This study reports change in air quality and its impact on the environment during the unique lockdown scenario at Bhubaneswar, a coastal smart city in east India. The urban air shows a remarkable reduction in the mean pollutant levels influenced by traffic emission viz. NO x (~67 %) and BC (~47 %) during lockdown over the pre-lockdown. Comparatively, a lower reduction of CO (~14 %) is attributed to the dominance of natural atmospheric chemical regulation and biogenic sources in addition to anthropogenic contributions. In addition to the lockdown, frequent rain events due to depression in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) also had a significant role in the reduction of the primary pollutants over the study site. An enhancement of secondary pollutant viz. O 3 (~3%) with a distinct diurnal pattern was observed during the first phase of lockdown over the pre-lockdown period. An anti-correlation between O 3 and NO x during pre-lockdown points to a higher O 3 production potential with decreasing NO x . While a reduction in the titration of O 3 due to suppression of fresh NO emissions led to accumulation of O 3 in the first phase of lockdown, inhibited photochemistry due to cloudy skies as well as reduction in precursors led to lower O 3 values during the later phases of lockdown.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The spread of novel coronavirus was initially identified in Wuhan city of China, in early December 2019, and then was successively transmitted across the world with 4 million cases in the first 4 months. While the first case of the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed on 31 January 2020 in India, it was detected on 16 March 2020 in Odisha, an eastern coastal state in India. The country saw a sudden jump in COVID-19 cases during mid of March (https://www.mohfw. gov.in/). In order to stem the spread of novel coronavirus, the Indian government called for a 14-h voluntary public curfew called as Janta Curfew on 22 March 2020. Besides, the Odisha Government called for an early lockdown of five districts of the state from 22 March 2020 to 29 March 2020 together with Bhubaneswar (20.30\u00b0N, 85.82\u00b0E), the state capital, and a globally acclaimed smart city. However, after 3 days of Janta Curfew, the Indian Government enforced a complete nationwide lockdown for 21 days from 25 March to 14 April 2020 (lockdown 1.0) then extended it further until 03 May 2020 (lockdown 2.0). Thus, the lockdown limited the movement of the entire 1.3 billion population of India in an effort to flatten the infection/transmission curve during the pandemic. Confinement of population, shutting off a large portion of industrial activity, and bringing public transport to a standstill led to a considerable decrease in anthropogenic emissions and, consequently, in the level of urban air pollution. However, essential services such as electricity, water, municipal sanitation bodies, hospitals, banks and financial Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11869-020-00916-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. services, shops dealing with food and medicines, and movement of essential goods trucks and trains were exempted from lockdown. With the rising tolls of COVID-19 cases, the Government of India further extended the lockdown two times until 31 May 2020 with some conditional relaxation. Moreover, night curfews were imposed during the entire May (lockdown 3.0 and lockdown 4.0) month from 7 PM to 7 AM. The pandemic outbreak has caused a large economic disruption in India. So, the Indian Government has allowed restarting various industrial and other commercial activities with 50 % of workforce called Unlock-1 during 01 June-30 June 2020 with strict guidelines. However, to tackle the emergency and curb the dispersion of COVID-19, the Odisha Government continued the night curfew from 7 PM to 5 AM with an addition of complete shutdown of weekends during entire June month of 2020.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The sudden change in emissions is expected to have a drastic impact on air quality, and the situation can be used as a natural experiment to simulate the sensitivity of certain pollutants prevailing in ambient air. In this context, air quality parameters such as carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO x = NO + NO 2 ), black carbon (BC), and ozone (O 3 ) are analysed. The measurements were carried out at CSIR-Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology (IMMT) located in the heart of Bhubaneswar city during March-June 2020 (Fig. 1) . Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Odisha state in eastern coastal India, is home to more than 8 lakhs people ( ht tps://www.census2011.co.in/census/ci ty/270bhubaneswar.html). The city, enlisted in the Government of India smart city program, is undergoing significant development in the construction of roads, shopping malls, residential areas around the city, and the consequent anthropogenic emissions. According to the 2018 RTO database, a total of 76,946 vehicles were registered in the Bhubaneswar city out of which 70% are personal vehicles. Furthermore, the city is fenced with numerous point sources of pollution like the thermal power plants, steel plants, cement industries, mines, metallurgical plants, and manufacturing industries in the north and north-west direction and two major shipping harbours, one (Paradeep Port)~100 km towards the eastern direction and the other (Dhamra Port)~159 km towards the north-eastern part (Mahapatra et al. 2018) . Despite nationwide lockdown, the thermal power plants, steel processing industries, mining activities, production and distribution of thermal and coking coal, limestone, dolomite, manganese, and chromite in and around Odisha were operational, as a part of essential services (http://www.ecoti.in/tQMoEb80).

Therefore, in the current pandemic situation as various phases of lockdown were imposed over this region, it was indeed a unique scenario to understand the behaviour, source, and concentration of primary and secondary ambient air pollutants like CO, NO x , BC, and O 3 . The data has been presented here to understand the variation of measured pollutants in the perspective of the environment when anthropogenic emissions are curtailed. While CO can give an insight into both anthropogenic and biogenic emissions together with chemical processing in the atmosphere, NO x and BC can give a direct insight into the emission scenario w.r.t. gas and aerosol phases. Furthermore, O 3 variations can give an insight into the photochemical processes operating in the atmosphere. Thus, the primary goal of this study is to evaluate and understand the change in the air quality of the region with a sudden reduction in anthropogenic emissions. The change in emission regime provided an opportunity to generate baseline data for the region, which will help to adopt new strategies to ensure better air quality.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The in situ measurements of near surface CO was made in Bhubaneswar using an online CO analyser (Horiba, APMA-370). The analyser is based on cross modulation-type nondispersive infrared absorption at 4.67 \u03bcm vibration band and has a detection limit of 50 ppb for a 60 s response time (Mahapatra et al. 2014a) . Simultaneously, the measurement of NO x and O 3 was carried with a chemiluminescene NO x analyser (Thermo fisher scientific, 42i), and UV photometric O 3 analyser (Thermo fisher scientific,49i) respectively. The NO x analyser works on the principle of chemiluminescence effect produced due to oxidation of NO by O 3 molecule at 630 nm and has a detection limit of 50 ppt with a response time of 50 s. The O 3 analyser works on the principle of absorption of UV radiation by atmospheric O 3 at 254 nm. The lower detection limit is 1 ppb with a response time of 20 s. All instruments were periodically calibrated using NIST traceable calibration standards and multi-channel calibrator. The analysers drew ambient air samples in using a 2-m-long polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing placed at a height of 20 m above the ground level.

The diurnal variation of CO, NO x , and BC show a bi-modal pattern during PL. The primary pollutants showed a build-up during the morning, and late evening due to an increase in emission sources (mostly traffic-related as the study site situated close to National Highway-16) and suppressed boundary layer that helps trap the pollutants in the lower troposphere. Conversely, higher dilution leads to lower value of these species during noon (Nair et al. 2002; David and Nair 2011) . Furthermore, photochemical consumption of NO x and CO also results in their lower value during the daytime. Previous reports also observed a distinct bi-modal peak in almost all the seasons for (Xie et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2016; Yadav et al. 2016; Jang et al. 2017; Zheng et al. 2017) , and BC Beegum et al. 2009; Mahapatra et al. 2014b; Kompalli et al. 2014; Talukdar et al. 2015; Vaishya et al. 2017; Rana et al. 2019 ) depicting the influence of anthropogenic emissions in urban areas. In addition, analysis of tropospheric CO by Ghude et al. (2011) and Girach and Nair (2014) over Indian subcontinent have revealed that CO emissions in eastern India is mostly dominated by coal combustion from the thermal power plants along with biofuel and biomass burning. However, during the current lockdown phases, we could not observe prominent bi-modal peaks for CO, NO x , and BC. Thus, the suppressed rush hour peaks for three pollutants is a direct indication of lockdown effects, and such suppression have not been observed during similar time periods in previous years over the study site (Mahapatra et al. 2014a, b) . The suppressed peaks for CO and NO x during the various lockdown phases can be attributed to curtailment in vehicular movements. Furthermore, for species like NO x , which have strong local sources and short residence times, the reduction is much more drastic with high pre-lockdown to lockdown ratios compared to a pollutant like CO with regional sources and a much longer residence time (more than 30 times that of NO x ). Similarly, the residence time of BC of a few days to a week is intermediate between NO x and CO, and hence BC can provide a wider coverage compared to NO x in terms of source contributions. The lifetimes of these pollutants are in the order CO > BC > NO x . The L1/PL values for these gases are 0.98, 0.73, and 0.32, respectively. Likewise, Jain and Sharma (2020) also highlighted a statistically significant plummet in NO 2 (~51%) in five megacities of India viz. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bangalore. However, unlike the pollutants discussed above, the diurnal pattern of surface O 3 shows a distinct noon peak during PL and L1 (Fig.  4a) , a notable feature of an urban region (Lal et al. 2000; Nishanth et al. 2012; Gaur et al. 2014; Yadav et al. 2016 ). The O 3 concentration starts building up immediately after sunrise, attains maximum value (PL, 30 ppbv; L1,~34 ppbv) during noontime, and then decreases. The daytime increase in concentration is attributed to the photo-oxidation of precursor gases such as CO, CH 4 , and NMHCs in the presence of NO x (Lal et al. 2000) . However, lower O 3 concentration during the night is due to inhibition of photochemistry, titration of O 3 by surface emissions of NO, and loss due to surface deposition (Mallik et al. 2015) . The pronounced elevated diurnal pattern during L1 suggests a higher rate of photochemical production of O 3 from precursors compared to O 3 destruction (Resmi et al. 2020 ). The O 3 chemistry during L1 could be due to locally/regionally emitted precursors along with atmospheric transport from the Chota-Nagpur region and the north-western parts of Odisha state (Fig. S2 ). This is evinced by very similar background concentration observed during night time in PL and lockdown periods. A cloudy sky due to rain events (Fig.   S1 ) on several days during L2, L3, L4, and UL along with reduced precursor levels inhibits photochemical production of O 3 leading to the suppressed diurnal variation of O 3 (Ghosh et al. 2015) . Furthermore, the standard deviation (SD) in O 3 values during the current study is of the order of less than 20% while the year to year changes in O 3 is of the order of 36-45%, implying the impacts of lockdown (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 546, "end": 564, "text": "(Nair et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 565, "end": 585, "text": "David and Nair 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 782, "end": 799, "text": "(Xie et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 800, "end": 817, "text": "Zhao et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 818, "end": 836, "text": "Yadav et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 837, "end": 854, "text": "Jang et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 855, "end": 873, "text": "Zheng et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 883, "end": 902, "text": "Beegum et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 903, "end": 926, "text": "Mahapatra et al. 2014b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 927, "end": 948, "text": "Kompalli et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 949, "end": 970, "text": "Talukdar et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 971, "end": 991, "text": "Vaishya et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 992, "end": 1008, "text": "Rana et al. 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1141, "text": "Ghude et al.

However, a two-sample t test shows an insignificant (p > 0.8) decline in the concentration of CO during L1 as compared to PL. CO is released during incomplete combustion processes viz. burning of fossil fuel, biomass, garbage as well as from photooxidation of methane (CH 4 ), and other hydrocarbons (Fishman and Seiler 1983; Cros et al. 1988; Mahata et al. 2018) . Furthermore, the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) time series of area-averaged methane (CH 4 ) mole fraction in the air for March-June 2020 over 20-21\u00b0N, 85-86\u00b0E (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/) shows no substantial change in CH 4 concentration during the observation period (Fig. S3 ). This can be attributed to the much longer lifetime for CH 4 and sources like agriculture, waste, biomass, and biofuel as well as natural sources, making a much larger contribution to CH 4 emissions compared to fossil fuels (Bousquet et al. 2011; Saunois et al. 2016; Kavitha et al. 2018 ). All these sources in and around Bhubaneswar might result in a build-up of CO concentration during L1. Furthermore, CO has a longer lifetime due to a combination of CO production and loss chemistry, being controlled by OH radical, which is mostly well buffered (Mallik et al. 2018 ). Nonetheless, a significant reduction in mean CO during L2 over PL could be due to the extended lockdown phase, across the entire country, resulting in a continuous fall in anthropogenic emissions over the study region. CO concentration decreased further from 219.29 \u00b1 66.62 ppbv during weekdays to 177.29 \u00b1 66.62 ppbv during the weekend of UL period due to the imposed curfews, along with the change in seasonal meteorology, i.e., transition between pre-monsoon to,monsoon season. CO and NO x , which share many common anthropogenic emission sources (Mallik et al. 2015) were found to be weakly associated (r = 0.4) over Bhubaneswar (Fig. 6) .

This could be due to curtailment of vehicular emission, which is considered to be dominant source over the study site (Mahapatra et al. 2014b) . The BC concentration during UL weekdays (1.16 \u00b1 0.34 \u03bcg m \u22123 ) was observed to slightly increase in comparison to L4 due to relaxation in vehicle movement during daytime (7 AM to 7 PM); however, a slight decrease in BC (1.01 \u00b1 0.34 \u03bcg m \u22123 ) concentration during weekend is due to the imposition of weekends curfew. During the study period, there was a transport of air masses exclusively from the marine region (Fig S2) . It has been reported that pollutants like CO and BC are also evinced over the Indian Ocean due to the coastal anthropogenic activities (Girach et al. 2020; Venkataraman et al. 2005) . Hence, there is a chance of regional transport of CO and BC to the study site through the marine air masses in regions between the coast and the southern site of the measurement location (Fig. S2) . These regions include residential areas within Bhubaneswar city as well as slums and villages on the outskirts of the city all the way up to the coast. All these regions will have some activities related to CO emissions like biomass and garbage burning, brick kilns, and ancillary activities. Assuming an average wind speed of 10 m/s, an air parcel would take about 16 h to reach from Puri (or the coast) to Bhubaneswar, covering a distance of 60 km. This travel time is much lower than the lifetime of NO x (\u03c4 < 2 days), BC (\u03c4 < 7 days), as well as longer lived O 3 and CO. Thus, despite being southerly in direction, the winds can still carry the impact of continental emissions to the vicinity of Bhubaneswar. However, the study site witnessed several rain events over the region for the entire L2 phase (Fig. S1 ), which could have resulted in wet scavenging of pollutants like O 3 and BC, and hence the reduction in pollutant concentration was quite prominent during the L2 phase.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 215, "end": 239, "text": "(Mahapatra et al. 2014b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 800, "end": 820, "text": "(Girach et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 821, "end": 846, "text": "Venkataraman et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 654, "end": 662, "text": "(Fig S2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1045, "text": "(Fig. S2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1855, "end": 1863, "text": "(Fig. S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Day-to-day variability of air pollutants"}, {"text": "A t test shows an insignificant overall increment of~3% (p > 0.2) for O 3 in low NO x conditions during L1 as compared to PL (Fig. 4) .

Several previous studies over the Indian subcontinent revealed that vehicular emissions are the major source of NO x (Aggarwal and Jain 2015; Jain et al. 2016) . Recently, Singh and Chauhan (2020) also reported a significant reduction in tropospheric NO 2 over eastern India during lockdown as compared to the same period of 2019. Similarly, Xu et al. (2020) reported a significant reduction in primary pollutants due to lockdown in Hubei Province, Wuhan, Jigmen, and Enshi in Central India. Hence, a prominent reduction of~65% in NO x during L1 compared to PL over the study site facilitates O 3 accumulation in the urban atmosphere. However, a lack of precursor transport mediated by cleaner marine air masses and cloudy sky due to frequent rain events during L2, L3, L4, and UL reduced O 3 production over the study site. Fig.  S4 shows the daytime relationship between O 3 and NO x during the six different lockdown phases. An anti-correlation (r = \u2212 0.75) between O 3 and NO x during PL (Fig. S4a) is attributed to an increase in O 3 concentration during daytime due to photochemical production and decrease in NO x due to photochemical decomposition as well as boundary layer dilution (Lal et al. 2014; Ghosh and Sarkar 2016) . The titration of O 3 at higher NO x levels during PL was not observed during the lockdown periods (Fig. S4 b & c) . Nonetheless, a lack of correlation between O 3 and NO x during lockdown (Fig. S4 b, c, d & e) indicates O 3 chemistry is complex, and its production does not simply increase with NO x reduction. During L1, the enhancement in O 3 concentration in low NO x emission might be due to a change in volatile organic carbon (VOC) and NO x ratio. However, in the absence of concomitant measurements of VOC, it is not possible to estimate the exact production potential of O 3 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 235, "end": 259, "text": "(Aggarwal and Jain 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 260, "end": 277, "text": "Jain et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 460, "end": 476, "text": "Xu et al.

The 1-sigma standard deviations of these gases during the lockdown period are much less compared to the year-to-year variation (Table 2) . This supports the fact that apart from local/regional meteorology, the various lockdown phases had a significant effect in bringing about a reduction in the concentration of various primary as well as secondary pollutants. The overall reduction in O 3 can be attributed to lower precursor levels, also impacted by the lower amount of transported precursors as well as inhibiting meteorological conditions like rain events and cloud cover. Interestingly, we did not observe as much reduction in CO as it is emitted through both anthropogenic and biogenic sources, and its lifetime is intrinsically related to the chemical processing in the atmosphere. Even during the complete lockdown phase during April-May 2020, biofuel emissions could be significantly active for cooking purposes (in the city slums as well as in the surrounding villages).
