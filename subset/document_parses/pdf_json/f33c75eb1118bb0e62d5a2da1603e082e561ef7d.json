One such novel andragogic technique has been termed the flipped classroom (FC). This approach involves the student reviewing the theoretical aspects of the course through material provided, often by pre-recorded lectures, before face-to-face teaching, the intention being that as the student is familiar with the subject matter, they will derive more from the tutor contact time. This format has been shown to increase student satisfaction, 1 performance and cognitive development, 2, 3 and delivers better academic attainment. 4, 5 It was anticipated that utilising this new teaching method would improve student satisfaction with respect to the teaching of the applied dental materials and biomaterials (ADM&B) theme at a UK dental school. The present study aims to assess student satisfaction with the course before and then after the theoretical teaching was flipped by means of measurement via the student course evaluation forms (SCEFs).",

            "text": "The FC approach often embraces the availability of computer technology to allow the removal of taught lectures from the timetable and their delivery online before teacher-facilitated conceptual application activities. 6 It has evolved since its inception within a US secondary school to wide acceptance in tertiary education worldwide. 6 The FC approach has seen success in various disciplines throughout medicine, 1,7 and evidence of its use and success is emerging within dentistry. 3, 4, 8, 9 Although many of the positive findings report on student satisfaction, 1, 9 there is early evidence linking it with increased academic achievement. 4,10,11 A recent meta-analysis of FC across a range of healthcare disciplines found that it yielded significant improvement in student learning in comparison to traditional approaches 12 and other studies in dental disciplines have shown that it better supports lower-performing students. 13, 14 Andragogic rationale for the flipped classroom approach Challenges exist within dental teaching to accommodate the four recognised learning styles as described by Honey and Mumford, 15 which have been inspired by Kolb's work. 16 Table 1 The flipped classroom (FC) approach has been fully implemented in the delivery of the application of dental materials and biomaterials teaching at a UK dental school. Practical experience with immediately relevant link from the didactic teaching Table 1 The four recognised learning styles and attributes, with an explanation on how each could be satisfied by using the FC approach presents how the change in course delivery to a FC blended approach planned to address all of these learning styles. 15 Additionally, it was hoped that this revised style of course would encourage higher-order thinking. Using Bloom's taxonomy 17 as a framework, the online lectures aimed to impart knowledge, and the tutorials aimed to investigate and develop comprehension before the practical session progressed into application and analysis. Kolb's learning cycle 18 is a recognised theory of experimental learning which is applicable to the application of dental materials teaching, particularly as it is a practical subject. This theory is based on the assumption that students learn through doing. In this case, practical experience of mixing and handling dental products enriches the teaching experience, deepens the understanding of the student and reinforces the application of the subject. The student was provided with workbooks for the hands-on element to support experiential learning as demonstrated in Kolb's cycle 18 (Fig. 1 ). In addition, interactive problembased learning seminars were added to the programme. These were added to gain deeper learning and encourage students' self-directed learning. 19 Furthermore, it was anticipated that this FC blended approach would bridge the generational gap between teaching and learning styles. 20 Students are currently most likely to be part of 'generation Y' . This generation as a whole are highly collaborative, thrive using technology, respond to a mentoring/coaching form of teaching and favour case studies with immediate feedback, 21 all of which is incorporated into the FC blended approach. 11",

The proposed course was initially mapped or storyboarded 22 by the academic theme lead responsible for the course dividing it into topics defined by their theme. Mini lectures called 'lecturettes' were adapted from the previously available didactic lecture material, recorded and saved as a PowerPoint (Microsoft Inc, Redmond, WA, USA) presentation relative to each theme. These tended to be short and thus made it easier for the student to concentrate and be less likely to lose interest. They also allowed the course to be made modular for versatility as some subject matter was covered in a number of areas. For example, common dental impression materials are used in the construction of removable dentures and also in fixed prosthodontics, which are covered in two other distinct courses. Each of the lecturettes covering the traditional lecture material were recorded as podcasts by video capture as this has been found to be more effective in knowledge retention 23 using Panopto, Seattle, USA. These podcasts were made available on the university's virtual learning environment (VLE). The session was shown in the student's calendar with the presentation in PowerPoint (Microsoft Inc.) format attached with the link to the podcast. The students were encouraged to watch the podcast with the lecture presentation, which allowed them to annotate notes or write down any questions which sprung to mind at the time. Mandatory consolidative tutorials and hands-on practical sessions were timetabled after the lecture slides and podcasts had been made available. Expectations that the lectures should be viewed before attending the tutorial and practical sessions to get the most out of the session and to enable contribution were communicated to the students verbally by the course coordinator and were written in the course handbook.",

This peer interaction has been shown to develop deeper conceptual understanding. 11 Gali et al. 24 found that tutorial-based discussion as opposed to traditional lecture-style teaching for dental materials helped students relate the teaching to clinical application. Students also reported finding the teaching more motivating and interesting. The tutorials sporadically included quizzes by means of OMBEA Response (OMBEA Ltd., London, UK). Research has shown that the testing effects of quizzes have a positive effect on learning outcomes, 25 in addition to assessing the understanding of the theoretical material supplied before face-to-face teaching events. 26 As was custom at the end of every semester, students were encouraged to provide formal feedback via the SCEF reports. The formal and informal feedback gained was compared with that received before the change in format of the theme.",

This was particularly useful for more complex ideas and concepts where the student could replay the section repeatedly until they understood it. Most students were fully engaged with the process and those who did, by definition, carried out more pre-class preparation time. This was borne out in a paper by Cheug. 7 Furthermore, the results show that the students appreciated the more quality tutor/learn contact time and the fact that the pre-practical tutorials were dictated by their learning needs.

The original SCEF forms asked for feedback on the curriculum overall and then, with time, were incrementally refined to asking about dental health and disease, the umbrella term under which the theme was contained, and then finally feedback was requested specifically for ADM&B. Similarly, general comments were asked for in the initial reports, but progression led to more specific questions on strengths, weaknesses and any innovative teaching methods which had been used in the course delivery. Pertinent feedback on the delivery of the blended FC approach was entered into other disciplines. This was collated and included within the results. For the purposes of the present study, it is regrettable that numerical data were not collected from the outset as this would have led to meaningful measurement of improvement or otherwise of any changes effected within the course.",

All other classes are compulsory; therefore, by changing the session description to a tutorial, students were compelled to attend. This increase in attendance increased involvement, engagement and learning. It has been reported in the literature that there are potential difficulties with the FC format. The format of FC relies on the student to undertake preparation in advance of tutorials and often this is in their own time. Chuang et al. found that the FC approach did not suit all students as it required a high level of belief and motivation to complete the preparatory work. 27 It could be hypothesised that students undertaking a professional degree in healthcare would be highly motivated, but Patanwala et al. 28 found this not to be the case as some students studying pharmacy therapeutics failed to view the prerecorded material and thus were not prepared for the tutorials. However, it was found in this course that most students were engaged and prepared, and attended the face-to-face sessions with a good initial grasp of the subject. The authors deem this to be a result of clearly directing the students to the podcasts and lecture slides via the course handbook and VLE, while advising them that viewing was a prerequisite for the mandatory tutorials. The tutorial and practical sessions were also interactive and engaging, with the lecturer expecting student participation. Students quickly realised that failure to prepare would be apparent. If all courses were taught in such a way, however, then this could be problematic as the student may be overloaded and not have sufficient protected time to watch all of the lecture material. This preparatory, asynchronous material must be factored into the students' timetable.",
