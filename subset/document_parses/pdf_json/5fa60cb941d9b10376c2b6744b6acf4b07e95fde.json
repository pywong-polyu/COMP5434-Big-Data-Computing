            "text": "Involvement in sustainable development is a voluntary activity. Organizations apply the principles of sustainable development only when they identify several benefits. These benefits are identified, especially with the financial ones. The involvement of organizations in sustainable organizations has different intensity levels. These intensity levels are influenced by psychosocial factors (PF), attitudes toward organizational risks, and organizational and urban policies. The present paper identifies the key psychological factors involved in applying organizational sustainability principles within organizations. For this research, five groups were created for in-depth interviews with key people from Romania's innovative companies. To identify the importance of the framework analysis factors, the Delphi method was used, in which 20 experts from different fields of activity were involved. Following the rounds involved in the Delphi method, the ranking of PF on four levels of importance was accepted, based on planned behavior and reasoned action theory. These levels were correlated with the intensity levels of involvement in sustainable development. The entire market study was conducted during COVID-19, which significantly impacted specific directions. As a result, it could be observed that motivation, learning attitude, behavior, and intention to take precedence are essential in the organizational sustainability approach.",

            "text": "Sustainability means that a company can secure its long-term resources, anticipate its future needs, and use resources efficiently and fairly in organizational activities. This is a reference definition, developed in 1987 by Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland in the report entitled \"Our Common Future, \" prepared by the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development. Sustainability does not only mean ecology, it also means achieving a balance between the three responsibilities: economic, social, and environmental. These responsibilities are embedded in most existing definitions in the literature, where there are several concerns for social equity and economic development (Horn et al., 2012; Noone et al., 2018; Pislaru et al., 2019) . Involvement in sustainable development differs from one company to another. Some of the companies are heavily involved, with several benefits. Other companies get involved for specific criteria they want to achieve (requiring employees to report their sustainability or have an adequate environmental footprint). It can be seen that in the manufacturing industry (Labuschagne et al., 2005; Jayal et al., 2010; Hesselbach and Herrmann, 2011; Mani et al., 2014; Ford and Despeisse, 2016; Kayikci, 2018) , the implications are numerous. Over the years, this industry has shown an increasing evolution from involvement. The construction sector (Naik, 2008; Abidin, 2009; Marhani et al., 2012; Y\u0131lmaz and Bak\u0131, 2015; Molavi and Barral, 2016; Kamali and Hewage, 2017 ) has many implications. Within this sector, the implications refer to buildings' energy efficiency and the use of adequate construction materials. The electricity and heat sector, gas, hot water, and air conditioning are making considerable progress in sustainability principles (Oparaocha and Dutta, 2011; Sinclair et al., 2015; Dincer and Acar, 2017; Kveselis et al., 2017) . Here, steps are being taken to reduce greenhouse gasses generated in the atmosphere. They began to use innovative technologies that consider consumer-dependent factors (Blevis, 2007; Barquet et al., 2016; Lal, 2016; Arfini et al., 2019) . Studies conducted in the machine-building industry have highlighted the need to investigate psychosocial factors (PF) to increase the level of involvement in OS. Factors are mentioned as motivation and attitude (Cioca et al., 2015) . The transport sector is also making progress due to new technologies used in vehicle manufacturing (Richardson, 2005; Steg and Gifford, 2005; Anderton, 2010; Yigitcanlar and Dur, 2010) . Pollution norms contribute to reducing the level of greenhouse gasses and fuel efficiency. In this way, combined with driver-dependent factors, efficient use of resources in the field of transport (Steg and Gifford, 2005; Anderton, 2010; Cruijssen, 2020) . It can be seen that the implications of organizations in different fields are numerous (Al-Mulali and Ozturk, 2015; Apergis and Ozturk, 2015; Farhani and Ozturk, 2015; Ozturk, 2017) . The involvement of organizations in this voluntary approach depends on several factors. These factors include psychological factors, social factors, economic factors, technological factors, and other factors. Psychological factors are considered some of the most important, especially when it comes to the entry barrier. Among the social factors that contribute to the success of adopting approaches for sustainability are perception, motivation, learning, attitudes, beliefs, self-efficacy, culture, and others (Abdullah et al., 2017 (Abdullah et al., , 2018 Sarfraz et al., 2018a,b) . Being a voluntary approach, the social factors' approach presents a necessity in successfully implementing the principles of sustainability (Bocken et al., 2014; Eccles et al., 2014; Adloff, 2019) .",

This study can be customized for specific activity fields or branches of activity and represents a pillar in intensifying the levels of the organization. Based on a transdisciplinary approach, the applied methodology allows the generation of a nuanced interpretation of problematic implications. It addresses the gaps in psychology that apply to sustainable organizational development. It enhances organizations' innovation. In-depth interviews were analyzed with framework analyses. The paper begins with the presentation of the essential research in sustainability. It continues with the importance of innovation and involvement in OS, matrix presentation of factors identified in interviews, and developing the logic of intensity levels developed due to applying the Delphi method.

The concept of sustainable development has known various criticisms and interpretations over time, being accepted in various activity fields (Sadiq et al., 2020) . In its development, the concept has adapted to a complex global environment's contemporary requirements. Still, the basic principles and objectives, as well as the problems of their implementation, have remained almost unchanged. However, some goals have been updated, and new goals have been set since 2015. These goals are united in the 2030 Agenda, which outlines the challenges that humanity must meet for sustainable development, but also to survive on the planet (Choong and McKay, 2014; Erdmann Hilty et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2014; Honda, 2020) .",

This theory helps explain individuals' behavior and involvement in various activities or decision-making situations. Behavioral intention (BI) is created or caused by two factors: attitudes (what is expected to be done and motivation) and subjective norms (SN) (strengthening the normative faith and persuasive objectives) (Madden et al., 1992; Lada et al., 2009; Trafimow, 2009; Rossmann, 2011; Hale et al., 2002) . It is an extension of TRA, and the main component of this model is behavioral intent. Individual attitudes and subjective risk assessment influence these BIs. TPB consists of six constructions: attitudes, BI, SN, social norms, perceived power, and perceived behavioral control (Ajzen, 1985 (Ajzen, , 1991 (Ajzen, , 2012 Rizzo and Columna, 2020) .",

For in-depth interviews, 10 common questions and five different questions were established for each working group. The structure of these questions is presented in Table 6 .

For process innovators only in activity A-S, the following factors were obtained: attitudes, BI, SN, and perceived power of action. Innovative processes require an adequate interpretation of SN, and PPA must have a certain intensity. A creative and new attitude defines process innovators. For innovators only of business processes in activity A-S, the dimensions identified are motivation, learning, and belief. Business processes are dynamic due to the constantly changing economic conditions. As a result, lifelong learning and motivation are essential elements. All this is corroborated with belief. For product and process innovators in activity A-S, the dimensions obtained are attitudes, behavioral intent, SN, and norms especially applicable to the field (NSAF). Process and product innovators are 12.08 (PI5) directed toward the business environment's dynamics, adopt the new norms, and have adequate behavior for innovative principles.
