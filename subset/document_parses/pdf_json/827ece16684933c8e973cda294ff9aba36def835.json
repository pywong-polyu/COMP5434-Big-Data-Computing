On the 38 one hand, early work in human-computer interaction suggests that humans are prone to treat 39 machines in a social manner, as a cognitive heuristic, just like they would other humans 40 (Blascovich et al., 2002; Nass et al., 1994 Nass et al., , 1999 Reeves and Nass, 1996 thinking is truly at the heart of people's prosocial behavior towards machines, then increased 107 heuristic thinking, in turn, may accentuate people's tendency to treat machines like humans 108 and, consequently, encourage more favorable decisions with machines. To study this, we 109 focus on altruism as a simple measure of social consideration for others (Forsythe et al., 110 1994 ) \u2020 . When one behaves altruistically, one helps another at a cost to the self without getting 111 a direct benefit from the interaction (e.g., donating money to a stranger). To measure 112 altruism, we considered the dictator game (Forsythe et al., 1994) , which is an economic 113 decision-making task involving two players: a sender and a receiver. The sender receives an 114 initial endowment -in our case, 12 tickets to a lottery worth $30-and then decides how 115 many to give away, whereas the receiver has no say and must accept whatever was sent. 116",

To improve upon this, we adopted the Cognitive Reflection Test 188 (Frederick, 2005) to measure if those impacted by Covid-19 were engaging in reduced 189 reflection, i.e., more intuitive thinking. This test consists of questions (e.g., \"A bat and a ball 190 cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\") 191 with an intuitive incorrect answer (10 cents) and a correct answer that requires increased 192 reflection (5 cents).

So, we asked participants to rate five statements about their faith 196 in technology, such as \"Computer technology will change life for the better.\" and \"Computer 197 technology advances will solve America's social and economic problems within the next ten 198 years.\" (see Table S2 in the SI for full details on this scale). Finally, research suggests that 199 those with higher moral foundations -especially in the Care/Harm and Fairness 200 foundations-will show higher consideration for non-humans; thus, we asked participants to 201 answer the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham et al., 2013) (see Table S3 for more 202 details on this scale). 203 We first looked at dictator game offers across trials for each of the counterpart order, 206 as shown in Figure 1B . We ran an order \u00d7 trial repeated measures analysis of variance 207 (ANOVA), which revealed no effect of order (F(1, 184) = 0.507, p = 0.447), no effect of trial 208 We then focused on comparing offers with humans vs. computers. We ran a mixed 219 model analysis with Covid-19, counterpart type, and the interaction as predictors, and the 220 offer percentage as the target variable. The predictors were set as fixed factors, we used an 221 unstructured repeated covariance type for the residuals, and we used the restricted maximum 222 likelihood estimation method. This analysis confirmed the main effect of Covid-19 (p = 223 0.001) and revealed a main effect of counterpart type (p < 0.001) and a statistically 224 significant Covid-19 \u00d7 counterpart interaction (p = 0.025).

We found that the demographics and geographical distribution 231 for high-Covid participants were in line with distributions for the impact of Covid-19 in the 232 US, as measured by the number of confirmed deaths on the day the experiment was run (see 233 Figure S3 ), which gives us confidence that this construct is indexing Covid-19 impact. The 234 offers for each of these categories is shown in Figure 1E . As can be seen, the offers were 235 higher with higher Covid-19 impact, reinforcing the finding that those impacted by Covid-19 236 were being more altruistic. We then created a new dependent variable measuring the 237 difference in return to humans and computers -which we call the bias in favor of humans-238 as shown in Figure 1F . We ran an ANOVA on this measure to understand the relative impact 239 of Covid-19 on offers with computers vs. humans. The analysis revealed a main effect of 240 categorical Covid-19 (F(2, 183) = 7.10, p = 0.001, partial \u03b7 2 = 0.072, Figure 1D ). Post-hoc 241 tests with a Bonferroni correction revealed that the bias in favor of humans for high-Covid 242 participants was lower than for low-Covid participants (p = 0.001). 243 Why were participants impacted by Covid-19 being altruistic to computers? To get 244 insight on the mechanism causing the effect, we ran a multiple mediation analysis (Preacher 245 and Hayes, 2008) and considered several possible mediators.

In As autonomous technology -e.g., robots, self-driving cars, virtual personal assistants 281 -becomes increasingly available, its adoption and success hinges on the ability to promote 282 collaboration with humans. In this paper, we present insight on mechanisms shaping how 283 people make decisions with machines, with subsequent practical consequence for the design 284 of such technology. This insight was enabled by an unprecedented event -the Covid-19 285 global pandemic -which is impacting the way people make decisions, at least in the short-286 term, but possibly in the longer-term. Our results indicate that, in a dictator game experiment, 287 participants that were impacted by Covid-19 (as measured by a PTSD scale) were being 288 considerably more altruistic with machines than those that were not. The effect, as suggested 289 by a mediation analysis, was explained by increased heuristic thinking, likely motivated by Social Actors theory of Reeves and Nass (1996) . This theory, which is very influential in 307 human computer and robot interaction research, has argued that people heuristically treat 308 The results presented here have practical implications for the design of technology 330 and autonomous machines. Prior research indicates that people often consider the others' 331 welfare when making decisions (Axelrod, 1984; Kollock, 1998; Rand and Nowak, 2013) . 332",

However, whereas the present effect was caused by stress due to the Covid-19 336 pandemic, it is possible to encourage heuristic thinking in healthier ways, such as by 337 expressing emotion (de Melo and Terada, 2020; de Melo et al., 2014) or through cultural cues 338 in machines (de Melo and Terada, 2019). As the results further show, this approach can left unaddressed, constitute important barriers to the adoption of technology. On the 342 cautionary side, it may not always be valuable for users to treat machines as if they were 343 social actors -e.g., to manage expectations about the machine's capabilities or to avoid 344 exploitation. In the present case, the results suggest that those impacted by the Covid-19 345 pandemic may be particularly susceptible to be socially influenced by machines. Given the 346 disproportional impact of Covid-19 on economically vulnerable groups, this highlights the 347 need for ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure the altruism shown to machines is well-348 deserved. Generally, the same theory would suggest that, when it is important to control the 349 social expectations about machines, we can discourage heuristic thinking by motivating users 350 to think more deliberatively through the interaction. Overall, the judicious application of the 351 theory discussed here can lead to the development of technology that is able to build 352 collaboration with humans and, ultimately, be successfully adopted in practice. 353",

Even 355 though we considered several possible mediators for the effect of Covid-19 on behavior with 356 machines, it is possible that there are other relevant factors at play. For instance, individual 357 stress propensity, level of education, and socio-economic status could simultaneously make 358 individuals susceptible to engage in heuristic thinking and being impacted by Future work should, thus, study these factors to help understand their relative importance to 360 the effect. The present study focused on altruism, but there are other relevant forms of social 361 consideration -such as reciprocity, trust, and fairness -that may shape collaboration between 362 humans and machines. Follow-up work should complement the work presented here with a 363 study of the relationship between heuristic thinking and these constructs and corresponding 364 impact on human behavior. The sample of participants for this study was collected during the these results with samples taken at different stages, which may be subject to additional 367 sources of variation (e.g., pandemic fatigue). It should also be worth comparing this study to 368 data collected in other geographical regions in the world. Finally, whereas the present study 369 reports phenomena that occurred in the context of the Covid-19 global pandemic, it is 370 relevant to confirm and understand if there are differences in the way people think and 371 behave under more normal circumstances; in particular, other manipulations for heuristic 372 thinking should be explored. 373",

On the 42 other hand, more recent work emphasizes that these tendencies are not as strong and there are 43 important differences in the way people behave with humans when compared to machines 44 (Gallagher et al., 2002; McCabe et al., 2001; Rilling et al., 2002; Sanfey et al., 2003). For 45 example, in exact same decision tasks, people are less likely to follow social norms such as 46 fairness with machines (de Melo et al., 2016; de Melo & Terada, 2019; Terada & Takeuchi, 47",

Participants were 162 debriefed at the end of all procedures, and the experiments were approved by the University 163 of Southern California's institutional review board. To minimize reputation effects, the 164 experiment was anonymous, both with respect to other participants and experimenters. Please 165 see the Supplementary Information (SI) for details on how this was accomplished. 166 A sample of 186 participants was recruited as senders for this experiment on Amazon 167 Mechanical Turk. Prior research indicates that this online platform can yield high-quality data 168 and successfully replicate behavioral results in traditional pools (Paolacci et al., 2010). 169 Moreover, this pool allowed us to recruit a diverse sample from over 40 states in the United 170 States (see the SI Method Details section and Figure S1 for details on participant samples' 171 demographics). 172 To measure the impact of Covid-19, we adapted the abbreviated PTSD Checklist-173 Civilian 6-item scale for measuring PTSD in general medical settings (Lang and Stein, 2005). 174",

Our 295 findings suggest that the more individuals were impacted by Covid-19, the more likely they 296 were to behave altruistically with others, including non-human others (see the SI for a pilot 297 study suggesting that this effect may also extend to reciprocity). Negative impact on social 298 behavior, typically due to competition for scarce resources following disasters (Carlin et al., 299 2014; Hsiang et al., 2013), may have been avoided in this case due to the Government's 300 quick response in terms of financial aid to the population and businesses -similarly to the 301 impact Government programs have had in the past (Bruneau et al., 2003). 302We present insight on the cause for this effect, with clear theoretical implications for 303 our understanding of human behavior with machines. Our mediation analysis indicates that 304 heuristic thinking and faith in technology fully mediated the effect of Covid-19 impact on 305 decisions with machines.

Besides 310 making these links, our findings exclude distraction as a possible mediator for this effect, 311 emphasizing that heuristic thinking, not the absence of thinking, explains prosocial behavior 312 towards machines. Moreover, prior research reveals important differences in the decisions 313 people make with machines, when compared to humans (de Melo and Terada, 2019; 314 Gallagher et al., 2002; McCabe et al., 2001; Rilling et al., 2002; Sanfey et al., 2003). Our 315 distinctions people make between humans and machines. More broadly, these findings seem 317 in line with predictions from the social heuristics theory, whereby encouraging intuitive 318 thinking, in contrast to deliberation, can lead to increased cooperation in non-strategic 319 settings (Rand, 2016; Rand et al., 2014). Our work extends this prior work by showing that 320 this effect extends to interaction with machine counterparts. 321 The second mediator -faith in technology -suggests possible longer effects of 322 Covid-19 on human behavior with machines. This scale measured participants' expectations 323 about the role technology will play in improving quality of life in the future. The results 324 indicated that those impacted by Covid-19 rated higher on this scale, which may reflect 325 positive experiences with technology as they were forced to engage remotely in their social 326 and professional life. Moreover, this scale mediated the effect of Covid-19 on behavior with 327 machines, suggesting that improved perceptions about the value of technology can lead to 328 more favorable decisions with machines. 329",

Decisions in this game, thus, have been argued to reflect altruism 120 as it rules out other motives for giving including, for example, the expectation of future 121 reciprocity (Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000; Camerer, 2003). The dictator game, therefore, is 122 affected communities, due to a need to cooperate to tackle the challenge and recover quickly 129 (Calo-Blanco et al., 2017; Cassar et al., 2017; Toya and Skidmore, 2014; Whitt and Wilson, 130 2007). For instance, Chileans affected by the 2010 Maule earthquake were more likely to 131 give to charity, engage in volunteering, and less likely to commit crimes (Calo-Blanco et al., 132 2017). In contrast, scarcity and competition for valuable resources can lead to reduced trust in 133 some cases (Carlin et al., 2014; Hsiang et al., 2013). The specific socio-cultural context and 134 prevalent institutions, thus, are important to understand the effect external environmental 135 events have on human behavior. If the Covid-19 pandemic is causing people to show 136 increased consideration for others, then it may lead them to make more favorable decisions to 137 others. Moral theory further argues that increased empathy can lead to individuals to consider 138 more distant others (Singer, 1981; Zaki, 2014). Beyond caring for the self and close family, 139 individuals may be motivated to consider extended family, friends, communities, nations, and 140 even non-human others (Graham et al., 2017; Waytz et al., 2019). 141",
