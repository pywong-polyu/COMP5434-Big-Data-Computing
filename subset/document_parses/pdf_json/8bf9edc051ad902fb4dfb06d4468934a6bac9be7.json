Anti-tracking network is proposed as the countermeasure to fight against the network monitoring and censorship [4] [5] [6] . So, the attacks on anti-tracking network increase rapidly in recent years, such as network paralysis, network infiltration, communication tracking and so on. Especially, for the P2P-based anti-tracking network which takes the advantage of the wide distribution of nodes for tracking-resistant communication, it is important to keep a stable, secure and destroy-resistant topology structure. Also, considered that the nodes in P2P-based anti-tracking network can join in or quit the network freely and randomly, it increases the uncertainty and insecurity for anti-tracking network to maintain a robust network topology.",

Then, we can calculate the average degree of CPT as shown in Eq. 2. When n is very large, the average degree of CPTd is close to 6. So, we usually set the upper limit of nodes' degree as 10 in CPT. The nodes of which the degree is bigger than 10 should adjust its local topology to reduce its connectivity. Every node in network has the ability to control its connectivity, then CPT has the ability to optimize the network topology. Theorem 1 has proved that the number of edges are fixed for a CPT of which all surfaces are triangles, if the degree of some nodes are reduced, the degree of other nodes should be increased to keep the convex-polytope structure. So, the self-optimization of CPT can be viewed as a transfer process of node degree from the high-degree nodes to the low-degree nodes. Assume that node v 0 has n neighbouring nodes which are labeled in sequence from v 1 to v n . Because all the neighbouring nodes of v 0 form a circuit, we use v i\u22121 and v i+1 respectively represent the adjacent nodes of v i in the node circuit. If node v 0 needs to reduce its degree, firstly node v 0 has to request for the degree d i of its each neighbouring node v i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n). According to the degree of its neighbouring nodes, node v 0 selects a suitable neighbouring node to disconnect. To maintain the convex-polytope structure, the corresponding two neighbouring nodes of node v 0 have to connect with each other.

For each network constructed by CPT, NN and DHT, we randomly remove p percent of nodes and count the time requirement of network self-optimization as the metric. By increasing the percentage of removed nodes, we compare the change of time requirement to evaluate the efficiency of network self-optimization. Figure 9 (a) illustrates the time requirement of network construction with CPT, NN and DHT. The value of X-axis denotes the node number of the constructing network. With the increase of the network node number, the time requirement of CPT increases slower than NN and DHT. Limited by the computation of neural network, the time requirement of NN increases sharply. DHT relays too much on the agent nodes to construct and manage the network topology. Benefited from the convex-polytope structure, the whole network of CPT keeps the balanced distribution of nodes' connectivity. Without the too much computation like NN and too many connections like DHT, CPT can achieve better efficiency of network construction. Figure 9 (b) illustrates the time requirement of network self-optimization after p percent of nodes are removed from the network randomly. When more than 50% nodes are removed randomly, the network will be split into different subgraphs. In this case, we need to connect the different subgraphs into one whole network, then continue the network self-optimization process and count the time requirement. As we can see in Fig. 9(b) , the curves of three methods increase at the beginning, and then decrease when p is more than 50%. Because along with the increase of the percentage of removed nodes, the network size becomes smaller. So, when the network size reduces to a certain degree, the time requirement of network self-optimization will decrease.",
