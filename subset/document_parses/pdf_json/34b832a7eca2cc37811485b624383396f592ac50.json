            "text": "African swine fever (ASF), a highly hemorrhagic viral disease of domestic pigs, has been internationally epidemic for nearly 100 years ever since the first report in Africa in 1921 (1, 2) . The current pandemic of ASF initiated from the introduction to Republic of Georgia in 2007 (3) . Since then, ASF has rapidly spread to other Trans-Caucasian countries, Russia and East Europe, and highlighted its enormous threat to global swine industry by conquering the world's biggest pig producer and consumer, China, in 2018 (4, 5) . The causative agent of this devastating disease, African swine fever virus (ASFV), is considered the only DNA arbovirus owing to its capacity to infect several tick species in the genus Omithodoros (4). Besides soft ticks, which act as invertebrate competent vectors, ASFV just affects mammalian animals in the Suidae family, such as warthogs, wild boars, and domestic pigs. In contrast to the natural reservoir host warthogs, in which the infection of ASFV is basically asymptomatic (6) , the domestic pigs and wild boars mostly develop severe clinical manifestations after virus invasion and present a mortality rate up to 100% roughly in 7-10 days post infection (7, 8) , despite the fact that attenuated virus strains with low virulence may be isolated over an epidemic period in a certain naive region (9) (10) (11) .",

Common clinical symptoms of domestic pigs suffering from infection of these strains include sustained high fever, reduced feed intake to anorexia, vomiting, watery to bloody diarrhea, conjunctivitis, respiratory distress, reddened skin, cyanosis, severe depression, huddling, and incoordination (8) . Pathologically, systematic hemorrhagic lesions and enlargement can be observed in multiple organs including lymph nodes, spleen, kidneys, lungs, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, accompanied by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and macrophage destruction (7, 8) . Despite many research efforts and increasing knowledge on the pathogenesis, the basic mechanism how ASFV induces these clinical and pathological signs largely remains to be understood. Several hypotheses have been raised. Among them, early studies focused attention on hemorrhagic lesions, the major acute pathological characteristic, and considered it could be related to virus replication, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and massive destruction of macrophage (8) . Moreover, leukopenia, largely attributed to lymphopenia, is regarded as a result of apoptosis in lymphocyte populations induced by immune mediators (1, 7, 8) . Nowadays, it is generally accepted that secretion of cytokines by the infected monocyte-macrophage system that is considered as the major target of ASFV and secondarily activated lymphocytes is strongly applied in the abovementioned biological processes (12, 13) .",

However, an exaggerated immune activation with excessive cytokine release could be rather pernicious. An important instance is the socalled cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome (15) . The term \"cytokine storm\" was firstly coined in the early 1990s to describe the pathological outcome related to organ transplantation when an inflammatory response flared out of control (15, 16) . Since 2000, cytokine storm has become increasingly used not only in non-infectious clinical issues but also in diseases caused by cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, variola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (17) (18) (19) . Recently, cytokine storm is also proved to be associated with the underlying pathogenesis of viral hemorrhagic disease such as Lassa fever, yellow fever, dengue, and Ebola viral disease (20) .",

However, so far, a global picture of the kinetics of ASFV-induced cytokine release in vivo is not available (21) . Here, we performed experiments in domestic pigs to analyze the representative circulating interferons (IFNs), interleukins (ILs), growth factors, tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), and chemokines promoted by infection of type II virulent ASFV strain and determined a comprehensive increase of proinflammatory cytokines that drew an image of a typical cytokine storm. Furthermore, we also showed that cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and IL-10 may act as indicators of a lethal outcome at the endpoint of the infection process.",

Virus stocks <5 passages were prepared as simply described below. BMDM cells were seeded at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 7 per p100 culture dish and were infected 12 h later with ASFV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5. At 96 h post infection, the cells were harvested and underwent three freeze-thaw cycles. The supernatant containing the viruses was collected after a centrifugation at 3,000 rpm, 4 \u2022 C for 15 min, and stored in aliquots at \u221280 \u2022 C (22) . The viruses were then titrated using the BMDM cells via fluorescent focus assay adapted from previous methods (22, 23) . The fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody against ASFV early protein P30 involved in this assay was laboratory-made based on conventional procedures (24) . Due to the rule of reduction, the sample size was restricted to three. To ensure the validity of the conclusion drawn, the animal experiment was permitted to perform twice. In each trial, three 2-to 4-month-old Duroc-Landrace-Yorkshire piglets (Sus scofa domestic) with weight between 15 and 25 kg were obtained from a local farm with high biosecurity standards and hygiene. Before being introduced into the laboratory, the healthy piglets were screened via conventional or qPCR assays. Those free of the clinically common porcine viruses mentioned in the previous subsection were transferred to the ABSL-3 facilities and were subcutaneously injected with implantable animal electronical microchip. Pigs were supplied with commercial feed twice per day and clean water at all times. After 7 days of acclimatization, the pigs were intramuscularly inoculated at the left hind limb with 1 mL of PBS diluted supernatant containing 10 3 fluorescence focus unit of ASFV SY18.",

Monocytemacrophages, the primary target cells for replication of ASFV, play a central role in cytokine network. Thus, several in vitro studies involved the comparison of cytokine response of macrophage upon infection of ASFV with different virulence and found that low-virulent ASFV NH/P68 induced increased transcription of IFN-\u03b1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12 in comparison with the virulent ASFV L60 (34, 35) and that low virulence ASFV OURT88/3 or avirulent BA71V induced higher expression of IFN-\u03b2, IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, CCL4, IL-8, and IP-10 compared to the virulent ASFV Benin 97/1 or 22653/14 (36, 37) . However, results from in vitro and in vivo studies were somewhat discrepant. It was demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 could be readily detected in the serum of animals infected with virulent isolates (38, 39) , which was further confirmed by recent studies (40, 41) . Our work expanded the concept of knowledge about circulating cytokines induced by virulent type II ASFV in domestic pigs. The virulent ASFV SY18 induced continuous increase of almost all key pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in virus infection but not the anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21, which, at the first time, clearly drew an image of a cytokine storm.",

            "text": "During the clinical phase, the increased viremia showed that the virus began to efficiently spread through circulating system, accompanied by the first wave of pro-inflammatory cytokine release. The uncontrolled and sustained increase of cytokines could possibly result from multiple factors. Accumulating stimulation by newly synthesized ASFV components and positive feedback of the pro-inflammatory cytokines through auto-, para-, and endocrine pathways might contribute to the excessive activation of both infected and non-infected macrophages, leading to amplifying cytokine secretion (26) . IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are largely early products of immune response against invasive microbes. After activation, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 can further act as activators of bystander cells for IL-6 secretion, which can in turn enhance the activity of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, magnifying the inflammatory response (43, 44) . On the other hand, the silence of anti-inflammatory cytokines exacerbated the imbalance of immune homeostasis (14, 33) . Although the prototypical antiinflammatory cytokine, IL-10, is frequently involved in cytokine storms induced by T cell engaging immunotherapy, influenza virus and dengue virus infection (15, 18, 20) , we did not detect any secretion of this regulatory cytokine in pigs upon ASFV SY18 infection except for the final phase, indicating that IL-10 was prevented or left out in controlling the ASFV-derived immunopathology. IL-10 is mainly produced by M2 polarized macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells, T helper 2 cells (Th2), and, at certain conditions, Th1, Th17, Th9, regulatory T cells (Treg), B cells, and mast cells (33) . Although it was reported that IL-10 could show an IFN-\u03b3-mediating pro-inflammatory effect in the presence of an ongoing serious inflammatory process (45) , the IFN-\u03b3 secretion was not detected in the pigs in the current study, and therefore, the increased level of IL-10 observed at the endpoint might more likely suggest a desperate struggle of host against the inflammatory impact. In this point of view, IL-10 seems to be an indicative hallmark of an irrecoverable status, rather than one of the causes, of cytokine storm during acute ASF. This is in agreement with the recent observations that an elevation of IL-10 was likely to be related to a lethal outcome (37, 46, 47) .",

This could be a substantial cause of the unchanged level of type I IFN as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines during the primary phase of acute ASF. Due to the incapability of type I IFN induction by virulent ASFV in macrophages (34, 37, 51) , the dramatical elevation of IFN-\u03b1 during the clinical phase of infection could be a result of secondary activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (53) . However, as shown in the studies based on SARS-CoV (17, 54) , the postponement of type I IFN secretion accompanied by robust virus replication could promote the accumulation of activated monocyte-macrophages, resulting in raised cytokine levels and impaired T cell responses.",

This is in line with our study in which IFN-\u03b3 was proved to be absent throughout the ASFV SY18 infection. The influence of IFN-\u03b3 response in ASFV infection remains controversial. While the correlation of IFN-\u03b3 response with protection against ASFV were reported in some studies (40, 56, 57) , other data did not support this relativity (58, 59) . On the other hand, the absence of IFN-\u03b3 might also reflect an impaired activation of natural killer (NK) cell, which was another major producer of this cytokine and played a crucial role in counteracting virus infection (60, 61) . This is in accordance with the previous study in which the NK cell activity negatively correlated with the ASFV virulence and animal clinical manifestations (62) . Collectively from these results and our data, IFN-\u03b3 may play an essential but insufficient role in combating ASFV infection. Nevertheless, virulent ASFV could block IFN-\u03b3 responses of both NK cells and T cells.",

Due to these fundamental functions, chemokines are often found to contribute to occurrence of cytokine storm (18, 20) . Reports involving the in vivo roles of chemokines upon ASFV infection are limited. Zhang et al. (64) described a mild upregulation (1.4\u00d7) of RANTES in macrophages upon infection of virulent ASFV at an early stage (4 h post infection), whereas the same group also reported that at late stage, the mRNA levels of RANTES remained stable following infections with either attenuated or virulent ASFV (65) . Moreover, the secretion of IL-8 by macrophage was even decreased upon infection of virulent ASFV (65) . Our study showed that secretions of IL-8, RANTES, and IP-10 by domestic pigs upon infection of virulent SY18 all increased during both the clinical and final phases. This is in agreement with a previous study in which a continuous increase of IL-8 in pigs upon infection of virulent ASFV was described (41) . This obvious discrepancy of chemokine secretion between in vitro and in vivo might indicate non-macrophage sources of these inflammatory mediators in pigs infected by virulent ASFV.",

A representative disease course could be divided into three periods, the primary phase, the clinical phase, and the terminal phase, which were immune-silent, dysregulated, and uncontrolled, respectively. Accompanied by the onset of severe clinical signs and viremia, a cytokine storm occurred characterized by a tendency of significantly increased and sustained secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, RANTES, and IP-10. Moreover, secondary drastic increase of the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8, as well as elevated IL-10, could be hallmarks of an irreversible immune status, foreboding a lethal outcome. Although the molecular mechanisms of cytokine storm are far from understood, it seems that the ASFV-caused cytokine storm arises from the combination of delayed innate response in the primary phase, the suppressed anti-inflammatory response, and the impaired T cell response in the clinical phase. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms require further investigations.",
