            "text": "Common envelope evolution (CEE) is believed to be an important stage in the evolution of binary/multiple stellar systems. Following this stage, the CE is thought to be ejected, leaving behind a compact binary (or a merger product). Although extensively studied, the CEE process is still little understood, and although most binaries have non-negligible eccentricity, the effect of initial eccentricity on the CEE has been little explored. Moreover, most studies assume a complete circularization of the orbit by the CE onset, while observationally such eccentricities are detected in many post-CE binaries. Here we use smoothed particle hydro-dynamical simulations (SPH) to study the evolution of initially eccentric (0 \u2264 \u2264 0.95) CE-systems. We find that initially eccentric binaries only partially circularize. In addition, higher initial eccentricity leads to a higher eccentricity following the end of the inspiral phase, with eccentricities as high as 0.18 in the most eccentric cases, and even higher if the initial peri-center of the orbit is located inside the star (e.g. following a kick into an eccentric orbit, rather than a smooth transition). CEE of more eccentric binaries leads to enhanced dynamical mass-loss of the CE compared with more circular binaries, and depends on the initial closest approach of the binary. We show that our results and the observed eccentricities of post-CE binaries suggest that the typical assumptions of circular orbits following CEE might potentially be revised. We expect post-CE eccentricities to affect the delay time distributions of various transients such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational-wave sources by up to tens of percents.",

During a common envelope evolution (CEE) a (typically) evolved star fills its Roch-lobe ensuing an unstable mass-transfer. The binary then evolves to a CE phase, leading to the inspiral of the companion inside the envelope and eventually, the ejection of a significant part (if not all) of the CE (see Ivanova et al. 2013 , for a review). The inspiral can give rise to mergers of the companion with the core, or leave behind a compact short-period binary. CEE is believed to play a key role in the evolution of compact systems; the production of X-ray sources and of gravitational wave sources and supernovae progenitors (e.g. Paczynski 1976; Izzard et al. 2012; Ivanova et al. 2013; Soker 2017 , and references therein).",

Theoretical studies that carry hydro-dynamical simulations of CEE typically fail to fully eject the envelope, and/or to reproduce the orbital properties of post-CE binaries. Various additional physical processes have been suggested to play a role in the CEE and the envelope ejection, such as recombination energy Ivanova et al. 2015 , accretion and jets (Shiber et al. 2019; Schreier et al. 2019) , long pulsations (Clayton et al. 2017 ) and \u2605 E-mail: glanz@tx.technion.ac.il dust driven winds (Glanz & Perets 2018) . The role and importance of each of these various components are still debated. Some of these processes (or their combinations) can potentially be distinguished by their timescales (e.g. Igoshev et al. 2019) and the specific stage of the CE in which they have their strongest influence. The characteristics of the observed late stage outcome system (such as orbital separation and eccentricity) could then potentially identify which of the proposed processes could indeed have an important role in the evolution of the CE.",

            "text": "Although CEE have been extensive studied numerically, the vast majority have initiated the binary system with a circular orbit. One reason to believe the orbit has already circularized prior to the onset of the CE, is due to tidal dissipation (Zahn 1977; Verbunt & Phinney 1995; Soker 2000) . Nevertheless, as was recently studied by Vigna-G\u00f3mez et al. (2020) ; Vick et al. (2021) , Roche-lobe overflow of an eccentric binary is not necessarily a special scenario. As described in Soker (2000) ; Kashi & Soker (2018) , the eccentricity grows dramatically during each pericenter passage due to large mass loss; if the mass loss rate is high enough to overcome the circularization due to dynamical tides, the eccentricity may even increase. Eccentric binary systems can also be formed following velocity kicks imparted to neutron-stars and possibly black-holes upon formation in binary systems, or through violent dynamical interactions in destabilized triple systems (Perets & Kratter 2012; Michaely & Perets 2014; Glanz & Perets 2021) or through secular Lidov-kozai (Lidov 1962; Kozai 1962) or quasi-secular (Antonini & Perets 2012 ) evolution in triple stellar systems (e.g. Perets & Fabrycky 2009; Perets & Kratter 2012; Shappee & Thompson 2013; Michaely & Perets 2014; Toonen et al. 2016; Naoz 2016; Moe & Di Stefano 2017, and references therein) . These can lead to shorter period binary systems, that can even experience the unstable Roche lobe overflow, leading to the CEE, with very small pericenters, even inside the expanding envelope.",

As in Glanz & Perets (2021) , we used the AMUSE framework (Portegies Zwart et al. 2009) to integrate between the different codes and to analyze the results. We used MESA stellar evolution code (version 2208, Paxton et al. 2011) to create models of 1 \u2299 , 4 \u2299 and 8 \u2299 that were evolved from zero age main sequence into red giants, all have convective envelopes, with the corresponding core masses-0.39 \u2299 ,0.48 \u2299 and 1.03 \u2299 (detailed properties are given in tables 1, 2, 3). While the stages of our 1 \u2299 and 8 \u2299 were chosen as in Passy et al. (2012) and Glanz & Perets (2021) , the model with 4 \u2299 was evolved to the tip of its Red giant phase, where it remains for much longer than the dynamical timescale expected for the CE phase (see Fig. 1 ). We then converted the 1-dimensional models into 3-dimensional Smoothed Particles Hydro-dynamical (SPH) models with 250K particles (see Glanz & Perets 2021 for more details about the mapping). As we are not interested in resolving the evolution of the internal structure of the giant core, both the core and (later-on) the companion are modeled as gravitational only interacting particles (also termed dark matter particles in Springel 2005, due to their use in cosmological simulations). For each giant model, we chose the softening lengths of the point mass particles as in Glanz & Perets (2021) , as long as those satisfy our stability tests as described in Subsection 2.2.",

We used the same method described in Glanz & Perets (2021) , by evolving the system up to \u2248 50 dynamical times and compared the SPH velocities to the typical velocities of the system. We define our stability criteria such that less than 1 percent of the particles gain velocities which are comparable to the typical values (i.e. relative Keplerian velocity of the companion, the sound speed, and the escape velocity). Using our default softening length, we found that for the giant with 1 \u2299 , non-negligible particle velocities were excited after \u2248 45 dynamical times. These timescales are sufficiently long for most of our simulations, however the cases with initial eccentricities of 0.9 and 0.95 have longer dynamical timescales and require longer evolution to study the full CEE. Beginning those simulations at a later position on the orbit, when the binary still avoids interactions (as defined in the next Subsec 2.2.2), in a addition to a 10 times larger core softening length in the most extreme case of = 0.95, induced much smaller artificial excitation of the velocities which then satisfied our stability criteria.",

When both the angular momentum of the envelope and its potential energy become larger than the one of the two cores, the system begins to synchronize, and when the inner mass does not change anymore, the dynamical friction goes to zero, the mass unbinding effectively terminates (during the simulation time). The ejection of the material from the inner regions and the effective termination of the orbital dissipation lead to the stabilization of the orbit at a fixed SMA and orbital eccentricity.

Fig. 7 the calculation of mass loss is not accurate (see discussion in Subsec. 4.2), we can identify a strong correlation between these values and the initial eccentricities. We note that the envelope continues to unbind after the termination of the fast inspiral, but this further mass loss was not calculated due to higher resolution required for longer simulations. In addition, simulation 1R06P95 had a slightly more massive and bigger core, as well as a resulting different smoothing length profile, which can affect the amount of ejected mass. When calculating the corresponding alpha and gamma CE parameters corresponding to a complete ejection of the envelope in these models (Livio & Soker 1988; Nelemans et al. 2000; Nelemans & Tout 2005) , and comparing the final eccentricities according to same constants, we get a good agreement between simulations which began with a giant not yet filling its Roche-Lobe at semi-major axis (1R06P7-1R06P95).

However, as the transferred energies and angular momenta go mostly to the upper layers, where the escape velocities are low, the amount of mass loss over the entire CE is larger for systems with initially smaller pericenter (higher eccentricities). Figure 13 shows the calculated unbound mass throughout these simulations, showing that the ejection continue (mostly at pericenter passages) after the orbit has almost stabilized at fixed semimajor axis (same figure, upper panel) and fixed eccentricity (middle panel). Nonetheless, in addition to the computed mass loss defined in Sec. 4.2, even after the region below the pericenter distance from the core has been completely diluted, further interactions at the apocenter lead to the increase in the ejected mass, that should further continue on a longer timescale, when interacting with the remaining bound mass. However, due to Simulations 8R2A0-8R2A7 began with initial apocenter more than twice the radius of the primary, where only the pericenter of the last 2 is initially inside the envelope, but with most of the first orbit outside the envelope (since > 1 ). All these simulations result with a core merger, and even in this case, the orbit could not circularize before the companion has reached the core. Since there was no synchronization, the amount of mass loss up to the merger point increases with the initial angular momenta and orbital energy of the system. Therefore, in these cases, the amount of mass loss increases for lower initial eccentricities. We can conclude, that the amount of mass loss is larger for larger initial angular momenta and orbital energy, unless the semi-major axis is initially located inside the envelope, leading to a much stronger unbinding, with smaller final separations. Fig. 14 shows a comparison of the orbital separations evolution of a different mass ratio, and initial apocenter more than twice the radius of the primary. Even in this case, the orbit could not circularize before the companion has reached the core. . The orbit (distances between the two cores) of simulations with 1 \u2299 giant and 0.6 \u2299 companion, initialized with same distance (same apoapsis distance) and different eccentricities.

We evolved the giant to 110 \u2299 , with a core mass of 1,core \u2248 0.698 \u2299 , and a fully convective envelope, when the giant is still stable during a dynamical timescale (see Fig. 1 ). Due to its extended low-density envelope, the binding energy of an AGB star is much lower in comparison with the one at its RG stage. Consequently, the system can synchronize prior to the termination of the CEE, even in case of a core merger. In Fig.  16 we present the evolution of the separation between the two cores, and the mass loss. We can see that even though all three simulations ended with a core merger, all have a long self-regulating stage, when the spiral-in slows down significantly and the mass ejection terminates. As in all cases of primaries with RGs, one can identify the correlation between the mass ejection and the initial orbital eccentricity of the binary system, and despite the lower binding energy (which is still relatively high), all models ejected less than 10 percent of the envelope before the merger. We note that the models of the AGB and RG differs in their density profiles, their cores, both in mass and radius, which affect their smoothing length profiles, and the initial energies and angular momenta. Therefore, a comparison between these cases is not in the scope of this work. The ejected masses now show similar correlation with the initial eccentricities as in the simulations with the 8 \u2299 giant, but the same claim about the ejected massed after releasing the energy and angular momenta of the binary at the merger, all asymmetries we find might disappear.",

However, to our knowledge, most of the previous numerical simulations ended with most of the envelope still bound (Passy et al. 2012; Ricker & Taam 2012; Ivanova et al. 2013) . A few works which assumed a complete local thermalization of the recombination energy during the spiral-in gave rise to larger or complete unbinding (Nandez et al. 2015; Sand et al. 2020; Kramer et al. 2020) ,although the definition of unbinding also differs between studies in which the thermal energy is included in the definition, i.e. assuming it effectively translates to kinetic energy, or not; see more below. Nevertheless, consistent modelling of the role of recomobination is difficult, and its imprtance and overall role in envelope ejection is still debated (Han et al. 1994; Harpaz 1998; Han et al. 2002; Soker & Harpaz 2003; Ivanova et al. 2015; Sabach et al. 2017; Grichener et al. 2018; Reichardt et al. 2020; Sand et al. 2020) . Note, that the definition of bound material includes the thermal energies in some cases, but not in others. This could pose a major problem, since remaining bound mass might infall on longer timescales and eventually lead to the merger of any post CE binaries, in contrast with observations of such binaries (Ivanova et al. 2013; Edelmann et al. 2005; Siess et al. 2014; Kupfer et al. 2015; Kawka et al. 2015; Vos et al. 2017; Ratzloff et al. 2020) .

Soker (2000) showed that the orbital eccentricity of a binary system inside a CE increases significantly with the mass loss rate. However, as was showed in our results, the circularization of the orbit by tidal forces is very strong, leaving our simulated system with an initial pericenter outside the envelope, with a relatively small final eccentricity even for the largest initial eccentricity. Therefore, an additional efficient mass ejection during the spiral-in should lead to larger final eccentricities at its termination. Nevertheless, interactions of the post-CE system with the surrounding gas may cause an additional eccentricity amplification at apocenter interactions (Artymowicz et al. 1991; Kashi & Soker 2011; Vos et al. 2018) . Therefore, if most of the mass ejection is due to the potential energy dissipation during the spiral-in (with some additional mass loss occurring later-on, e.g. as in the case of dust driven winds), we expect to find most post-CE binaries located inside planetary nebulae to have low eccentricities, if any, whereas post-CE binaries with a complete unbound nebulae to have larger eccentricities. If additional processes cause a larger mass loss rate during the spiral-in, we should expect the majority of the post-CE binaries to have even larger eccentricities, possibly inconsistent with current post-CE binaries.",

            "text": "Our findings suggest that post-CE binaries could have non-negligible remnant eccentricities following the CE phase. Many of the mergers of compact object binaries are thought to occur following a CE phase which shrinks the binary orbits, which is then followed by a typically much slower inspiral due to gravitational-wave (GW) emission. The latter, GW inspiral is sensitive to the initial eccentricity of the binary, where, for a given SMA-eccentric binaries merge faster than more circular ones Peters (1964) . In other words, remnant eccentricities could potentially affect delay time distribution of mergers, and thereby affect the delay time distributions of type Ia supernovae that result from mergers of WD, short Gamma-ray burst resulting from neutron stars (and possibly black hole) mergers and GW sources from the mergers of WD, NSs and/or BHs. Current population synthesis models inferring the delay-time distributions of such transient explosive events typically assume CEE always leads to final circular orbits. Our results suggest that such assumptions might be erroneous and should potentially be corrected. The eccentricities we find are typically not extremely high, and therefore we expect the effects to change the inspiral times by a few up to \u223c 20%, however it could differ by as much as a factor of two for binaries which initial pericenters are embedded deep inside the giant envelope. In principle, remnant eccentricities might also lead to eccentric GW sources, but our derived eccentricities are likely too low. Although a GW inspiral circularizes a binary, an initially highly eccentric binary might retain some eccentricity up to its merger, potentially observable by GW detectors. However such cases typically require very close and very eccentric orbits (1\u2212 \u226a 1), higher than expected from our models.",

            "text": "In this work, we used hydro-dynamical simulations of the common envelope evolution to study the effect of different initial eccentricities on the evolution throughout this stage. We used the AMUSE framework (Portegies Zwart & McMillan 2018) to combine the stellar evolution of the giants prior to the common envelope, simulated with MESA (Paxton et al. 2011) , and the hydrodynamical evolution of the binary system, simulated with the SPH code GADGET2 (Springel 2005) . We simulated 26 systems with different mass ratio of the binary components, and a large variety of different initial eccentricities, up to 0.95, which initiated with a very large apocenter, required even higher computational resources than those usually used for CE simulations. We find that CEE of initially eccentric binaries give rise to remnant post-CE binaries with non-negligible eccentricities, with up to 0.18 (0.4) for post-CE binaries with initial peri-centers outside (inside) the giant star. The post-CE eccentricities appear to be correlated with the initial eccentricities. We note that population synthesis studies typically assume post-CE binaries have circular orbits. Our results suggest that such modelling might be inconsistent both with our models and observed systems, and that accounting for remnant eccentricities could affect the typical timescales and delay time distributions for the mergers of compact binaries and their resulting explosive electromagnetic and GW transients, such as supernovae gamma-ray bursts and GW-sources.",
