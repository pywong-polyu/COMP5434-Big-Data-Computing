We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6 days). The death Science of the Total Environment 727 (2020) 138394 rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths.

Different virus epidemics take place throughout the world every year, but only a few rise to the level of public concern (Schlagenhauf and Ashra, 2003; Viboud and Simonsen, 2012; WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), swine influenza A H1N1 virus (H1N1), and Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola) brought on the public's attention because they caused many severe infections and thousands of deaths (Dawood et al., 2012; Nicholls et al., 2003; WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014) . Similarly, the disease COVID-19 caused by a coronavirus (2019-nCoV) brought world-wide attention and caused public panic because many deaths had been reported without being put in the context of the many mild infections and its potentially low case fatality rate (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . For example, despite being a common infection, influenza rarely causes public concern because even though it is common, it leads to death in only 0.1% of cases. A variety of reports indicate that 2019-nCoV is highly infectious through multiple routes Huang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . While the high infection rate is certain, the mortality rate of COVID-19 has not been definitively determined. It is reasonable to suspect that the deaths of six of the first 41 patients (15%) in Wuhan (Huang et al., 2020) in the earliest reports by Chinese scholars were inaccurate. When the initial mortality rates were reported, only patients who were critically ill were included. Patients with mild symptoms, as well as those with asymptomatic infections, were not analyzed Huang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . Case-fatality rates reported by Huang et al. (2020) analyzed a skewed patient sample since it included only a small number of patients who had been transferred from other hospitals due to their critical condition. Therefore Huang et al.'s sample was skewed towards a concentration of severely ill patients, while the general patient population includes more patients with COVID-19 who are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms and who have not been hospitalized.

The PIBA uses patient data in real-time to build a model that estimates and predicts death rates for the near future. PIBA uses data of patients identified early in the disease process to calculate the average number of days from hospitalization to death for those hospitalized. Another feature is to take into account variations based on mathematical models. The PIBA calculation method does not divide the total number of patients on a day by the number of deaths on the same day. Instead, the PIBA calculation method divides the number of deaths on that day by the number of possible patients of a day or days when the patients have just begun to develop the disease. Thus, PIBA comprehensively and reasonably estimates the mortality rate based on the actual number of deaths and estimates the number of patients on a specific day. As time goes on, large amounts of data from northern and southern China have been accumulated through continuous reporting, all of which are used by PIBA, which then becomes more accurate as data accumulates. We conclude that it is time to utilize the accumulated data to estimate the case fatality rate of COVID-19 infection. Based on national data from the China National Health Center, the COVID-19 death rate is much lower than that reported in Huang et al. (2020) . Holistic data covering all of Wuhan, the epicenter city of COVID-19, also indicates a death rate lower than that reported by Huang et al.

We conclude that there is a large proportion of patients in Wuhan who have mild illness and not been hospitalized at all. Due to the uncertainty of the movement of infected people in the early stages of the onset, these mildly ill people move around in Wuhan unidentified. This problem reminds other parts of the world that if the fatality rate of the COVID-19 is found to be high, a large number of infected people have not been able to be identified or diagnosed.
