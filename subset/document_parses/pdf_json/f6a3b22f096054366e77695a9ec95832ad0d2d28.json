This study describes the direct and indirect impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on an urban major-hospital ED. Methods: Data regarding all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting from February 1 to March 31, 2020, were prospectively collected, while data regarding non-COVID patients presenting within the same period in 2019 were retrospectively retrieved. Results: ED attendance dropped by 37% in 2020. Two-thirds of this reduction occurred early after the identification of the first autochthonous COVID-19 case in Lombardy, before lockdown measures were enforced. Hospital admissions of non-COVID patients fell by 26%. During the peak of COVID-19 attendance, the ED faced an extraordinary increase in: patients needing oxygen (\u00fe239%) or noninvasive ventilation (\u00fe725%), transfers to the intensive care unit (\u00fe57%), and in-hospital mortality (\u00fe309%), compared with the same period in 2019. Conclusions: The COVID-19 outbreak determined an unprecedented upsurge in respiratory failure cases and mortality. Fear of contagion triggered a spontaneous, marked reduction of ED attendance, and, presumably, some as yet unknown quantity of missed or delayed diagnoses for conditions other than COVID-19.",

Table 1 reports the general features of the included cases, grouped by year of presentation and diagnosis of COVID-19. Compared with 2020 non-COVID patients, COVID-19 patients (Table 1) were predominantly male (P < 0.0001), older (P < 0.0001), and showed markedly higher admission (P < 0.0001) and mortality rates (P < 0.0001). The 37% reduction in overall ED attendance observed in 2020 (Table 2; Figure 2 ), was concentrated in phases P2-2020 (-41.8%; P < 0.0001) and P3-2020 (-63.8%; P < 0.0001). In fact, during P1-2020, before the identification of the first COVID-19 patient infected in Italy, the patient flow was approximately equal to that observed in P1-2019 (ie, -3.3%; P = 0.234). Of interest, two-thirds of the total reduction observed between P1-2020 and P3-2020 occurred immediately at the onset of P2-2020, before the lockdown measures were put in place, while the remaining 34% of reduction came after the lockdown. The falling trend in visits involved all areas of the ED. The most striking reductions occurred during the Impact of COVID-19 on ED P3-2020 phase (compared with P3-2019) in the pediatric area (\u221295.3%; P < 0.0001), in the orthopedic area (\u221292.4%; P < 0.0001), in the ophthalmologic area (-89.7%; P < 0.0001), and in the surgical area (-80.6%; P < 0.0001).",

Elective surgery and out-patient Impact of COVID-19 on ED Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness visits were progressively reduced; both medical and surgical wards and a sizable number of staff were shifted to COVID-19 units; new supplementary sub-intensive and ICUs were created for COVID-19 patients. 14 The ED relocated triage activity outside of the building and created 2 separate pathways for high-and low-risk COVID-19 patients. On February 26, a \"Respiratory Medicine\" area was set up in the ED, dedicated to suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases, isolated from the other areas, and equipped for managing the highest possible number of respiratory failure cases.

These measures may have led to a reduction in the global risk of some acute conditions, such as trauma and myocardial infarction. Nevertheless, lockdown measures per se do not seem to account for the massive drop in ED visits seen in the early phases of the epidemic. Furthermore, we observed an unprecedented reduction in hospital admissions from the ED of non-COVID patients during the COVID-19 epidemic, suggesting that a considerable number non-COVID patients with acute and potentially severe conditions requiring hospital treatment \"escaped,\" or failed to report to, the ED. All these data strongly suggest that a significant number of missed or delayed diagnoses will have accompanied the COVID-19 wave, worsening these patients' outcomes. For this reason, the spontaneous collective response of avoiding the ED that we observed should probably be considered a maladaptive one. 18 The capacity of national health systems to ensure continuity of essential health-care services in times of epidemics is critical to minimizing other potential health emergencies. 19, 20 Nonetheless, our data suggest that its effectiveness could be greatly undermined by a widespread perceived lack of safety in accessing health-care facilities, as an indirect effect of epidemics themselves.",
