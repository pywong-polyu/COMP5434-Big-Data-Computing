            "text": "The Coronavirus disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic in a very short time span. Currently, there is no specific treatment or vaccine to counter this highly contagious disease. There is an urgent need to find a specific cure for the disease and global efforts are directed at developing SARS-CoV-2 specific antivirals and immunomodulators. Ayurvedic Rasayana therapy has been traditionally used in India for its immunomodulatory and adaptogenic effects, and more recently has been included as therapeutic adjuvant for several maladies. Amongst several others, Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Asparagus racemosus (Shatavari) play an important role in Rasayana therapy. The objective of this study was to explore the immunomodulatory and anti SARS-CoV2 potential of phytoconstituents from Ashwagandha, Guduchi and Shatavari using network pharmacology and docking. The plant extracts were prepared as per ayurvedic procedures and a total of 31 phytoconstituents were identified using UHPLC-PDA and mass spectrometry studies. To assess the immunomodulatory potential of these phytoconstituents an in-silico network pharmacology model was constructed. The model predicts that the phytoconstituents possess the potential to modulate several targets in immune pathways potentially providing a protective role. To explore if these phytoconstituents also possess antiviral activity, docking was performed with the Spike protein, Main Protease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase of the virus. Interestingly, several phytoconstituents are predicted to possess good affinity for the three targets, suggesting their application for the termination of viral life cycle. Further, predictive tools indicate that there would not be adverse herb-drug pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions with concomitantly administered drug therapy. We thus make a compelling case to evaluate the potential of these Rasayana botanicals as therapeutic adjuvants in the management of COVID-19 following rigorous experimental validation.",

Higher infectivity as compared to the SARS-CoV virus reported in 2003 and absence of a definite cure are the worrisome aspects of SARS-CoV-2 [2] . In the view of rapid spread in short period of time, the number of people infected globally is enormous (~over 2 million), and this poses a tremendous challenge to healthcare systems. COVID-19 has an age related skewed distribution of morbidity and an overall lethality although the numbers are changing as the disease is progressing [3] . The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that, COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities such as chronic lung diseases (e.g. asthma, COPD), hypertension, obesity, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are vulnerable to a higher mortality rate [4] .",

The Spike protein of the virus binds to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors on the surface of type-II pneumocytes of alveolar lining, which are then internalised and the +ssRNA is released [5] . With the help of host ribosomal machinery and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme SARS-CoV-2 synthesizes its polyproteins and multiplies its +ssRNA. The new copies of SARS-CoV-2 are released into the alveolar sac by destroying the infected pneumocytes. The inflammatory mediators released after pneumocyte damage recruit immune cells at the infected site. Macrophages release inflammatory cytokines into the blood leading to vasodilation of blood vessels increasing capillary permeability of endothelial cells. Neutrophils release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteases to destroy viruses which also damage normal pneumocytes and generate cellular debris in alveolar space. These inflammatory and immune responses result into alveolar consolidation leading to increased respiratory rate followed by cough. The systemic inflammatory response acts as messengers to hypothalamus to increase body temperature [6] . In some patients the cytokine response goes out of control leading to excessive collateral damage to organs with a possible progression to death [7, 8] .",

In some countries, patients are being treated using existing combinations of antivirals used for other viral infections [9] . Clinical evidence explaining the efficiency of these antivirals against SARS--COV-2 are limited and not defined [10] . Therefore, for developing specific therapies as well as for boosting speed and scale of clinical evaluation WHO launched Solidarity clinical trial on April 8, 2020 . This includes screening of four study treatments in comparison with standard of care. Based on available experimental data, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta-1\u03b1, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are the chosen study drugs [11] . For patients with co-morbidities, it is inevitable to take daily medication along with COVID-19 managing drugs. Therefore, it is required to have safe pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 that can be co-prescribed with WHO solidarity trial drugs and commonly prescribed drugs such as anti-hypertensive, anti-asthmatic and anti-diabetic. Administering plasma of a recovered patient to the critically ill COVID-19 patients also seems promising [12] . Hydroxychloroquine which is being used in many countries for COVID-19 treatment under emergency circumstances, seems to have limited beneficial evidence [13, 14] . There is indeed a great rush to find the holy grail for COVID-19 in terms of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Several pharmaceutical companies have announced clinical trials for drug and vaccine candidates. However, it may take a long time to reach the community.",

In this work we explore if the botanicals WS, TC and AR can fill in the gap. Phytochemicals present in AR, TC and WS were identified using chromatographic techniques. A network pharmacology model was used to identify and depict the interactions of phytochemicals with molecular targets in the immune system to unravel their immunomodulatory role. Further, the phytoconstituents were docked to three molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 to assess the potential for antiviral activity. Further, predictive tools were used to assess the potential of interactions between phytoconstituents and commonly prescribed drugs. The results present a compelling case that Ayurvedic Rasayana botanicals have the potential for immunomodulatory and antiviral activity and could be used as therapeutic adjuvant for COVID-19 management following rigorous experimentation.",

The bioactives i.e. Shatavarins of AR, Tinosporides of TC, and Withanolides of WS are known to play crucial role in immunomodulation [8, 20, 45] . According to traditional medicine or Ayurveda principles, the synergistic effect of bioactive combination in an extract strengthens physiological immunity superior than a single molecule [46] . To assess the immunomodulatory potential of the experimentally identified 31 phytoconstituents from AR, TC and WS a network pharmacology approach was followed [47] . As a first step, potential protein targets of bioactives were identified using the BindingDB server. The targets identified were mapped to known immune pathways that were extracted from the KEGG database and plotted using Cytoscape. The retrieved data showed total 29 bioactives from Rasayana botanicals associated with 306 unique human protein targets. Of these, 53 protein targets of 28 bioactives were found to be involved in 20 immune pathways referred as immune targets (Fig 10) . The detailed mapping of phytoconstituents from each plant with targets and the number of associations reveals that bioactives from Withania somnifera show the largest number of associations ( Fig 11A) . The distribution of immune targets amongst Rasayana botanicals is shown Fig 11. More specifically, we analysed the data to evaluate involvement of Rasayana botanicals in immune pathways by combinations of bioactives and targets in a particular immune pathway (Fig 11) . The analysis showed involvement of AR in Th17 cell differentiation with 24 associations between 8 bioactives and 6 targets. AR was also found to be involved in IL-17 signalling with 13 associations between 9 bioactives and 7 targets. Data analysis showed association of TC with chemokine signalling with 13 associations between 7 bio-actives and 5 targets. TC was also found associated with few other pathways such as NOD-like receptor signalling, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, and NK cell mediated cytotoxicity by moderate bioactivetarget associations. The analysis also retrieved multimodal involvement of WS in immunomodulation through various pathways. It was found to be associated with chemokine signalling with 66 associations between 9 Withanolides and 11 immune targets. WS was also found to be associated with FC-gamma R-mediated phagocytosis and receptor signalling (NOD-like and c-type lectin) by 54, 55, and 46 bioactive-target associations.

The largest share of the deposition is a series of M pro crystal structures obtained by fragment screening. This indicates that the binding site of M pro is druggable. The M pro is known to be functional as a homodimer and has a heart-like shape. The protein has one active site per monomer. The active site contains the catalytic cysteine-Cys145, that performs the proteolysis reaction. The structure, PDB ID: 5R84, solved at a resolution of 1.83\u00c5 was chosen for this study. In this structure, the protease is co-crystallized with the fragment cyclohexyl-N-(3-pyridyl) acetamide (Z31792168) which is seen to bind in the S1-S3 pocket of the protease ( Fig 12A) . The S1 pocket is characterized with the presence of His163, Glu166, S2 with Cys145 and S3 is known as the aromatic wheel and includes Phe181 and His41. Thus, in our studies we placed the docking grid over the S1-S3 pocket. Initially, the co-crystallized ligand was separated and docked to check if Autodock was able to reproduce the binding mode. The docked pose showed an RMSD of 0.46 \u00c5 with the crystal structure pose and a docking score of -6.2 kcal/mol (Fig 12A and 12B) . A detailed study of interactions revealed that the carbonyl group of Z31792168shows a H-bond with Glu166 in the S1 pocket. The cyclohexyl moiety of the ligand has hydrophobic interactions with Met165, His41, His164, Arg188 and Gln189 residue in the S3 pocket. The pyridine ring scaffold shows hydrophobic interactions with Phe140 and His163 in the S1 pocket. All these interactions are in line with the crystallographic pose. ",

In our study we observed that, 18 out of 31 phytoconstituents have a docking score better than -6 kcal/mol. The best docking score -9.9 kcal/mol was observed for Ashwagandhanolide. Many other phytoconstituents like Withacoagin, Withaferin and Withanone are observed to have docking scores close to the -9 kcal/mol. However, a point to be noted is that some of these phytoconstituents are large molecules and hence the docking scores may appear to be inflated due to size and the proportionately larger ",

The docked results (Fig 13A and 13B) indicate that the active metabolite forms hydrogen bonds with Asp760 which is an important active site residue and with Lys621 and Tyr619. The position of the active metabolite is that of the NTP entry channel. The docking score for the metabolite is -4.28 and the ligand efficiency is -0.2. Next, 31 phytoconstituents were docked to the binding site. The results are compiled in Table 2 . Withanolide-B, Withacoagin, Withanone, Ashwagandhanolide and Muzanzagenin are predicted to possess docking scores ranging from~-9 to 10 kcal/mol. A total of twenty-one phytoconstituents have a docking score better than -6 kcal/mol. Calculation of ligand efficiency reveals that the top binders include Muzanzagenin, Withaolide-B, Withacoagin and Magnoflorine. There are sixteen compounds with ligand efficiency better than the active metabolite.

In particular, hydrogen bonds are observed with side chains of residues Asp623, Ser795 and Ser795 and backbone of Cys622 while non-polar interactions are observed with Phe140, Leu141, Leu167, Ala191.

For WS, except Ashwagandhanolide, Withanoside-V and Withanoside-IV all other analyzed phytochemicals were found to be orally bioavailable. The assessment of drug likeness indicates that Muzanzagenin and Asparagamine-A from AR, all analyzed phytochemicals of TC except 20-\u03b2-Hydroxy Ecdysone and Tinosporaside and all analyzed phytochemicals of WS except Ashwagandhanolide, Withanoside-V and Withanoside-IV have drug-like properties (Table 3) .

Muzanzagenin, Asparagamine-A from AR and Columbamine, Berberine, Magnoflorine, Menisperine from TC showed ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB). Log Kp (Kp in cm/s) is skin permeation coefficient that assesses ability of test molecule to permeate through skin. Large negative value indicates lesser skin permeability. This is directly correlated with molecular size and lipophilicity of compounds [52] . Log Kp values shown by all analyzed phytochemicals indicate lower skin permeability. An important aspect of developing therapeutics or their adjuvants is whether they are metabolized by Cytochromes thus reducing their efficacy or potentially interfering with concomitant therapy. Predictions showed that none of the phytochemicals of AR except, Isoagatharesinol have the potential to inhibit any of the major CYP isoforms (Table 3 ). Few TC phytochemicals may act as inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 whereas few WS phytochemical may inhibit CYP2C9. These properties need to be considered during phytopharmaceutical development.

As discussed earlier, diabetic, obese, asthmatic, geriatric, hypertensive population is more prone for COVID-19 [53] . These associated comorbidities of COVID-19 are being continually treated along with anti-SARS-COV-2 therapy. Here, we propose the use of Rasayana botanicals for COVID-19 prophylaxis (both pre and post COVID-19) as well as anti-SARS COV-2 activity. This can lead to the chances of HDIs, which may be harmful/beneficial/fatal [40] . Therefore, with the help of Swiss-ADME data (Table 3 ) and available published literature (S2 Table in S1 File) the probable pharmacokinetic HDI were explored. This showed that, whole plant extracts of these botanicals (especially those that are prepared according to the Ayurvedic procedure) do not inhibit main CYP isoforms such as, CYP1A2, CYP, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Various extracts of AR, TC and WS have IC 50 values >100 \u03bcg/mL for these CYP isoforms (S2 Table in S1 File). This indicates that at higher concentrations (generally more than therapeutic dose), these extracts may produce pharmacokinetic HDI in vivo [54] . Based on the above results, these phytoconstituents or Rasayana botanicals may produce beneficial pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions in vivo, with the anti-viral and disease-modifying drugs that are currently being prescribed for COVID-19.",

            "text": "The understanding of pathophysiology of COVID-19 is emerging with increasing prevalence over the globe [55] . A wide variation in the patient population ranging from asymptomatic, to mild or moderate cases and severe cases (some showing relapse) is reported. Severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 lead to mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome accompanied with hypoxia followed by organ failure [6] . In general, we need to have drugs that are best prophylactic (pre and post COVID-19), immunomodulatory and adaptogenic in nature along with anti-SARS-CoV-2 action. Using in silico approaches, the present study shows that the selected Rasayana botanicals may have these all the actions and may be effective for management of COVID-19 (Fig 15) . In the following sections we discuss in detail how these Rasayana botanicals and their phytoconstituents can be potential therapeutic adjuvants for the effective management of COVID-19. Note: CYP-Cytochrome P450, are the Phase-I drug metabolising enzymes responsible for >95% xenobiotic's metabolism; P-gp-P-glycoprotein is key efflux drug transporter; BBB-blood brain barrier plays a crucial role in prevention of drug transport into the brain; whereas, Kp explains skin permeability coefficient. Kp is linearly correlated with lipophilicity and molecular size. The more negative the log Immune-bolstering activity SARS-CoV-2 attacks pulmonary pneumocytes in alveolar sac for viral replication [7] . Typically, the immune response to viruses involve cytotoxic T-cells. The viral-infected host cells are recognised through binding of T-cell receptors (TCR) to MHC-I molecules. In case of viruses that escape from TCR recognition, physiological immune surveillance employs NK cells to eliminate virus infected cells. Cytotoxicity triggered by cytokines and other cytotoxic mediators induce infected cells to undergo apoptosis [56] . Our analysis showed that, Withanolides of WS may augment TCR signalling pathway by modulating NF-kappa-\u03b2 regulators and theta type protein kinase C (PK-C). Withanolides may also involve in NK cell mediated cytotoxicity by modulating beta and gamma type PK-C. Rutin of AR and 20-hydroxyecdysone of TC may also help in destroying infected cells by regulating cytotoxicity mediator TNF-\u03b1. Magnoflorine and Menisperine of TC could modulate apoptosis through caspase proteins. They may involve in mediating innate immunity by regulating proteolytic cascade of complement system through coagulation factors. Shatavarins of AR were predicted to modulate antigen processing and presentation through heat shock proteins. Withanolides may interact with integrin protein and interleukins to intensify non-inflammatory intestinal IgA secretion to neutralize virus. our It has also been reported that Withanone and Withaferin A may disrupt interactions between viral S-Protein and host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by binding Part-(D) shows higher probability for the beneficial pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic herb-drug interactions 37 if co-prescribed with WHO Solidarity trial drugs and drugs for COVID-19 associated comorbidities. It is interesting to note that above mentioned phytoconstituents are predicted to have good docking score, ligand efficiency, oral bioavailability, and drug likeliness. This makes them potential molecules for rapid drug discovery and development based on multi-targeted and reverse pharmacology approach for COVID-19 management. However, these in silico predictions need in vitro-in vivo validation.",

Briefly, the internalization of SARS CoV-2 eventually leads to secretion of large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines [57] . This leads to engagement of immune cells at the infected site. The present data indicates potential of WS to interfere with chemokine signalling through beta and delta type PK-C and chemokine receptors. Similarly, IL-17 plays crucial role in acute and chronic inflammatory responses. The IL-17 signalling can be mitigated predominantly through heat shock protein by AR, glycogen synthase by TC, and prostaglandin synthase by WS. AR derived saponins and TC extract showed anti-inflammatory property by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines along with other inflammatory modulators [58, 59] . WS extract also modulated cytokine expressions by inhibiting MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway [60] . This pathogenic reaction may become more complicated in co-morbidities like diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and obesity where inflammasome is already present [61] . This further activates this inflammatory cascade and COVID-19 progression. It has been reported that the Rasayana botanicals containing phytoconstituents like Withaferin-A have an ability to treat the inflammasome [19, [62] [63] [64] .",

Few drugs and drug combinations are still under investigation for their efficacy in managing this fatal infection [96, 97] . Current treatment involves combination of previously available antiviral agents [98] . COVID-19 patients having co-morbidities like T2DM, hypertension, asthma, obesity, etc. are also being treated with these drugs along with their ongoing prescriptions [4] . Along with modern therapeutic agents, patients are also being treated with drugs from traditional medicinal system like Ayurveda [40, 99] . Thus, while using such diverse treatment regime, there is need for designing and executing detailed DDI (drug-drug interactions) and HDI (herb-drug interaction) studies for proposing safe, efficacious and beneficial combinations. DDI and HDI can be predicted by PK-PD pathways (with special focus on drug metabolising enzymes and transporters) of particular drug. Cytochrome P450 system (CYP's) are major enzymes involved in catalysing biotransformation of administered drugs. CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 are involved in metabolism of around 80-90% of drugs [100] . Pharmacokinetic profiles of plant extracts considered in this study are not well established [101] . Data obtained from predictive web-based tools to evaluate the herb-drug PK-PD interactions analysis shows some phytochemicals may or may not inhibit main drug metabolizing enzymes (Table 3) . This inference is also being supported by published in vitro studies on human liver microsomes using whole plant extracts of AR, TC, and WS (S2 Table in S1 File). IC 50 values for all the extracts are > 100 \u03bcg/mL which seems to be a higher concentration than used in vivo [54, 102] (S4 Table in S1 File) . Thus, we speculate that in vitro studies on human liver microsomes using whole plant extracts of AR, TC, and WS may not show any inhibition of these main CYP isoforms. However, there is a need to explore in vitro-in vivo HDI for rationalizing their use in pharmacotherapeutic management of COVID-19 [103] . We also recommend that HDI studies should be planned to focus on drugs used in the management COVID-19 and its associated comorbidities. The S5 ). This raises the concern for careful pharmacotherapeutic management. On the other hand, it can be predicted that there are very less chances of pharmacokinetic mediated HDI with the studied Rasayana botanicals as no such overlap has been found in our in-silico studies as well as published in vitro data.",

Appropriate pharmaceutics developability assessment needs to be done if any of these phytoconstituents are to be considered for phytopharmaceutical development. The in-silico pharmacokinetic data also shows that, Muzanzagenin is the main drug-like molecule from AR and it has also showed docking score better than -6.0 kcal/mol against all three protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Majority of the key phytoconstituents show good oral bioavailability. All phytochemicals of TC were found to be druglike substances. In case of WS phytochemicals, except Ashwagandhanolide, Withanoside V and Withanoside IV all were found to be drug-like molecules. Though, Ashwagandhanolide has shown highest docking score for all 3 SARS-CoV-2 protein targets its drug-likeness is an issue of concern and needs further detail investigations. On the other hand, the network pharmacology and docking data showed that there are very high chances of beneficial pharmacodynamic HDI for the effective pharmacotherapeutic management of COVID-19. At the same time, we cannot forget that the drug concentration plays the important role in both in-vitro and in vivo studies, therefore effective and safe clinical extrapolation based on experimentally validated data are warranted.",

The activities on immune mechanisms provide a sound logic for use of these botanicals in treatment.

Once the SARS-CoV-2 virus passes the respiratory tract, it enters the lung cells with the help of its Spike protein coupled with ACE-2 receptors (these are present almost all over the body enabling its spread to multiple organs and their failure in later stages of the disease). Rasayana botanical extract constituents (E), Withacoagin and Withanolide B may inhibit COVID-19 entry by disrupting interactions between viral spike protein and host ACE-2 receptor. Rasayana botanicals may inhibit viral replication through inhibition of coronavirus main protease (M pro ) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) Part A: The M pro is can be inhibited by Columbin and Tinocordiside. RdRp can be inhibited by Muzanzagenin and Withanolide-B thereby inhibiting RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV-2. This may lead to its life cycle arrest. Part-(B): The patient related predisposition factors such as sex, age, diseases, individualization (PRF:SADI) and COVID-19 pathophysiology involved in the multiple organ failure and death.
