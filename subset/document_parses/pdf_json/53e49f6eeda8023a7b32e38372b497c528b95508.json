In addition to this entrenched variant diversity in circulation, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within single infected hosts with co-existing viral variants evolving differently in distinct cell types. The BriS\uf044 variant, originally identified as a viral subpopulation by passaging SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCoV-19/England/02/2020, comprises in the spike glycoprotein an eight amino-acid deletion encompassing the furin recognition motif and S1/S2 cleavage site. Here, we analyzed the structure, function and molecular dynamics of this variant spike, providing mechanistic insight into how the deletion correlates to viral cell tropism, ACE2 receptor binding and infectivity, allowing the virus to probe diverse trajectories in distinct cell types to evolve viral fitness. Teaser SARS-CoV-2 can exploit different cell types to diversify and evolve virus variants distinct in infectivity and structure. Gupta et al. SARS-CoV-2 Bris\uf044 Page 3 of 35",

The S trimer glycoprotein is responsible for binding to the ACE2 receptor and for viral cell entry after cleavage at the S1/S2 junction and S2' sites (2). Critical to this process is proteolytic processing of S by host cell proteases (3). After intracellular cleavage at the S1/S2 junction by a furin-like protease to produce the S1 and S2 subunits, S is further primed by cleavage at the S2\u00b4 site by host serine proteases on the plasma membrane such as TMPRSS2 (4,5) or the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B/L (6). S1 comprises the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor binding domain (RBD), and the SD1 and SD2 domains (7,8). S2 contains the S2\u00b4 cleavage site, the fusion peptide, a fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR), a HR1 heptad repeat, a central helix and a connector domain followed by a HR2 heptad repeat, the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (7,8). Receptor binding destabilizes S, allowing S2\u00b4 cleavage, leading to shedding of S1 while S2 reorganizes to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes, enabling entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells (9). The furin cleavage site is a four amino acid motif located on a solvent-exposed flexible loop of S (7). Furin-cleaved S was shown to bind more efficiently to human ACE2 than uncleaved S (10). The furin cleavage site thus contributes substantially to the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, adding to the lethality of the virus.",

            "text": "After growth of a low passage isolate of SARS-CoV-2 from February 2020 in the African Green monkey kidney cell line Vero E6, a cell line routinely used to propagate viruses from clinical isolates, we discovered a virus subpopulation with a S variant (termed here BriS\uf044) exhibiting an in-frame 8 amino acid deletion encompassing the furin recognition motif and S1/S2 cleavage site (amino acids 679-687 NSPRRARSV, replaced by I) (11). Subsequently, further deletion variants abrogating S1/S2 cleavage were identified after viral passaging in cell culture (12) (13) (14) and at low frequency in clinical samples, attenuating infection in animal models (15-18). Moreover, deleting only PRRA in S by reverse genetics resulted in a recombinant \uf044PRRA SARS-CoV-2 which exhibited increased infectivity and viral titer in Vero E6 cells, but a 10-fold reduced viral titer in Calu-3 2B4 lung epithelial carcinoma cells compared to the wildtype (WT) virus (19), indicating the acquisition of a furin cleavage site increased SARS-CoV-2 fitness for replication in respiratory cells. BriS\uf044\uf02c compared to WT virus, shows higher infectivity of Vero E6 cells which have low levels of TMPRSS2 protease and are deficient in the interferon pathway, suggesting that in the heterogenous environment of the human body such deletion variants can emerge in suitable cell types serving as potential niches for SARS-CoV-2 to further evolve or specialize.

In contrast, BriS\uf044 was selected for in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1A) as expected (11) . The amounts of the BriS\uf044 and WT viruses was estimated based on genome equivalence by qRT-PCR and used for infection of (Fig. 1C) . Thus, the lack of the TMPRSS2 protease contributes to, but is not the only reason why the BriS\uf044 variant infects Vero E6 cells better than WT virus. Differences in the route of cell entry either via fusion at the plasma membrane or receptor mediated endocytosis (20) (21) (22) may account for this result. Interestingly our results using Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells are similar to those of Zhu et al (18) comparing the replication of WT SARS-CoV-2 and a virus (Sdel) containing a 7 amino acid deletion encompassing the furin cleavage site but differ from those based on a competition assay between the WT and \uf044PRRA viruses, which infected Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells equally well (19) . Despite the fact that we selected WT SARS-CoV-2 from Caco-2 cells by serial dilution, BriS\uf044 infected Caco-2 cells better than the WT at high virus titers; 25% versus 10% infected cells were observed with the starting dilutions of BriS\uf044 and WT, respectively (Fig. 1D) . Overexpression of the ACE2 receptor in Caco-2 cells led to 70% infection of cells up to 32-fold dilution of WT, whereas only about 35% of cells could be infected by the BriS\uf044 variant at the same dilution (Fig. 1E) . Thus, both the WT and BriS\uf044 viruses infect Caco-2 cells better when ACE-2 expression was increased, but the improvement for WT virus was substantially higher. Calu-3 lung cells were infected about 2-fold better by WT virus for all dilutions except the starting dilutions (Fig. 1F) , corroborating the contribution of the furin site in SARS-CoV-2 S to improved infection of lung cells (19) .",

We purified the protein by affinity purification and size exclusion chromatography ( fig.   S3A ,B) We used the peak fraction from SEC for negative stain EM quality control ( fig. S3C ) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) ( fig. S4 , table S1). We determined the BriS\uf044 structure without applying symmetry (C1) at 3.0 \u00c5 resolution ( fig. S5A ). In our analysis, all BriS\uf044 particles exhibited the locked conformation of the S trimer we had described previously (23) . After applying 3fold symmetry (C3) we obtained a 2.8 \u00c5 cryo-EM map (Fig. 2, fig. S5B ). In this compact locked S conformation, the receptor-binding motif (RBM) is buried inside the RBD trimer obstructing ACE2 receptor binding ( fig. S6A ). The RBD also comprises an RGD motif implicated in integrin-mediated cell entry (24) . The three RGD motifs present in BriS\uf044 are buried at the interfaces between the RBDs ( fig. S6B ) and thus will be likewise less accessible in the locked form, similar to the RBMs. We previously found a free-fatty acid (FFA) binding pocket in the locked structure of SARS-CoV-2 S, and identified a small molecule tightly bound in the pocket, with the molecular mass of linoleic acid (LA) as determined by electron-spray ionization mass-spectroscopy (ESI-MS) (23) . In the present locked structure of BriS\uf044, all three pockets are again occupied by a small molecule ( Fig. 2A,B) . Using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS-MS) as an orthogonal method and LA as a calibration standard, we confirmed that the BriS\uf044 S samples contain LA (Fig. 2C ). LA is bound in a bi-partite binding pocket where one RBD provides a hydrophobic pocket to accommodate the hydrocarbon tail, while residues R408 and Q409 of the adjacent RBD provide a polar lid coordinating the carboxy head group of LA (Fig. 2B ). In the BriS\uf044 C1 structure, we identified the same tube-shaped density in all three RBD domains ( fig. S6A ), indicating high occupancy of all three pockets. Using masked 3D classification, we scrutinized the data set for potential heterogeneity in LA binding and found that at least 95% of the RBDs were LA-bound in our structure ( fig. S7 ).",

            "text": "Five out of 14 annotated disulfide bonds in S (25) stabilize the RBD including the disulfide bond linking C336 and C361 (Fig. 2D ,E). Three arginine R1031 residues in our construct (R1039 in WT S), one each from the three polypeptide chains in the S trimer, form a hydrogen bond cluster (Fig. 2G ). In this cluster, the arginine residues are symmetrically arranged around the central trimer axis with short range contacts of 4.65 \u00c5 present between the carbon atoms of the guanidino groups. The guanidinium planes stack parallelly on top of the aromatic plane of the juxtaposed F1034, and a salt bridge is formed to E1023 of the adjacent S polypeptide chain (Fig. 2G) . R1031, E1023 and F1034 are conserved in all human coronaviruses, highlighting their central importance. In the vicinity, a disulfide bond is formed by conserved residues C1024 and C1035, arranging E1023 and F1034 at the required distance and in the proper conformation to stabilize the R1031-mediated interaction (not shown). Opening of the RBDs was shown to induce an asymmetry in the trimer structure that breaks this H-bond cluster (8, 26) . LA binding in the FFA-pockets induces conformational changes to the residues surrounding the FFAbinding pocket in the RBD and beyond, including the NTD, SD2 and the fusion peptide proximal region (FFPR). Re-organization of SD2 in the locked structure results in a stabilization of the region around R634 (Fig. 2K ). This arginine residue is stabilized by \u03c0-stacking on Y829 (Y837) and thus connects to the FPPR of the neighboring subunit. Such \u03c0-stacking interactions were observed in a previous structure which had an intact furin site, and also (unassigned) density in the FFA-binding pocket (10) . R634 stacking to Y829 is additionally stabilized by a hydrophobic interaction to L833 (Fig. 2K ). Fixed in a rigid position through these interactions, C832 (C840) can form a disulfide bond to C843 (C851) which additionally stabilizes the FPPR (Fig. 2F ). This disulfide bond-mediated stabilization of the FPPR has been described in a cryo-EM structure of full-length S protein (9) . We scrutinized the deposited EM density of this structure and found it contained unassigned density in the FFA-binding pocket, indicating a ligand, presumably a free-fatty acid (9) . In the meantime, further structures became available which adopt a locked conformation and comprise assigned or unassigned density in the FFA-binding pocket. The sandwiched R634 is present in all; fully modelled in five structures (PDBID 6ZB5, 7JJI, 6ZGI, 6ZGE, 6XR8), not modelled in one structure but evident in the density (PDBID 6ZP2) and in a further structure with the density (but not the model) supporting the sandwiched arginine (PDBID 7DF3). In comparison, S structures in the closed, but not locked, conformation, where the FFA-binding pocket does not contain any ligand density, show no \u03c0-stacking interaction of R634. Instead, in these structures (PDBID 6VXX and 6ZP1) residues 620 to 640 as well as parts of the FPPR are disordered, and residues Y636 and R634 adopt different conformations.",

Importantly, BriS\uf044 lacks 8 amino acids including the furin cleavage site and the S1/S2 cleavage site located on a flexible loop.

It was shown that O-glycosylation of these residues negatively affects furin cleavage, contributing to S stability and infectivity (27) . P681 and S680 are deleted in BriS\uf044\uf02c and P681 is mutated in other lineages, including the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in Kent, UK (28) and rapidly spread globally. The enzymes responsible for O-glycosylation (GALNTs) are expressed differently in different cell types (29) , and the absence of P681 in BriS\uf044 could thus contribute to the observed dominance of this variant in certain cell types.",

In the cell-based assays, however, BriS\uf044 virus is infectious (Fig. 1 ). To address this apparent discrepancy, we biochemically analyzed the interaction of a range of S proteins with the ACE2 receptor. We compared BriS\uf044 binding to ACE2 with S protein lacking the RBM, S protein where the furin site residues are replaced by an alanine (S RRAR->A ), uncleaved WT S (S RRAR ) and furin-cleaved WT S (S RRAR* ) (Fig. 3A, table S3 ). ELISA using a surrogate virus neutralization test kit (sVNT) indicated that all S proteins efficiently bind ACE2, except the S protein lacking the RBM used as a control (Fig. 3B ). For the other S proteins, half-maximal binding was observed between 64 and 128 nM S protein in the assay. We determined the dissociation constant (KD) of BriS\uf044 and ACE2 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with biotinylated ACE2 immobilized on a streptavidin-coated chip (Fig. 3C, fig. S8 ). Binding of BriS\uf044 (KD=2.5 nM) to ACE2 is only slightly weaker as compared to S RRAR->A (1.4 nM) (23) . In agreement, the maximal RU values, indicating mass deposited on the ACE2-coated chip, were virtually identical for BriS\uf044, S RRAR->A and uncleaved WT S ( Fig. 2D, fig. S8A ,B). The partially cleaved WT S yielded lower RUmax signals, possibly due to partial dissociation of the S trimer and binding of the smaller S1 fragment to ACE2. Our biochemical assays thus establish that the BriS\uf044 trimer can adopt an open, ACE2-binding competent conformation, which however was not observed on the cryo-EM grids. This finding is in agreement with our results that the Thus, LA binding significantly stabilizes the locked conformation of both, WT S (P=0.0027) and BriS\uf044 (P=0.0024). Importantly, LA apparently shifts the equilibrium favoring the locked conformation for BriS\uf044 more than for WT S (P = 0.039) (Fig. 4H ). This hypothesis is supported by our cryo-EM structure which shows that virtually all BriS\uf044 trimers were LA-bound and in the locked conformation (Fig. 2) .",

The simulations revealed a cascade of structural changes occurring in response to the LA removal and highlight the route by which such changes are transmitted through the S protein (fig. S10, S11). Strikingly, we find that the furin cleavage site responds swiftly to LA in the WT S, despite being 40 \u00c5 away from the FFA pocket ( and S1/S2 cleavage sites.

We find important similarities between BriS\uf044, an engineered \uf044PRRA SARS-CoV-2 in which only the four residues of the furin cleavage site had been removed by reverse genetics (19) and Sdel, a variant containing a cell passage acquired deletion encompassing the furin cleavage site (18) . All deletion variants replicate substantially better in Vero E6 cells but show impaired replication in Calu-3 cells -underscoring that WT SARS-CoV-2 evolved to efficiently infect and replicate in respiratory cells. At the same time, we find differences highlighting the impact of the exact sequence context of the deletion: expression of serine protease TMPRSS2 in Vero E6 cells reduced the replication advantage of \uf044PRRA SARS-CoV-2 (19), but not of BriS\uf044 or Sdel (18) . In our experiments, BriS\uf044 and WT SARS-CoV-2 both exhibited increased infection and replication in Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells, but BriS\uf044 retained higher infection and replication rates as compared to WT virus (Fig. 1C) . Importantly, the engineered \uf044PRRA virus required more antibody for neutralization of the virus compared to WT SARS-CoV-2, while monoclonal antibody and human sera neutralize BriS\uf044 and WT SARS-CoV-2 with equal efficacy (Fig.   1G, fig. S2 ). Interestingly, ACE2 receptor overexpression in Caco-2 cells improved the infection and replication of BriS\uf044 and WT SARS-CoV-2 as compared to Caco-2 cells with a lower constitutive expression of ACE2 (Fig. 1D,E) .",

The virus can then fuse at the plasma membrane to enter cells (20, 22) . It has been shown that the furin-cleaved S can also interact with neuropilin (NRP1) following the CendR rule, potentially enhancing viral entry (34, 35) . Lacking these modalities, BriS\uf044 is likely taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis and then potentially cleaved by an intracellular protease before fusing via the endosome.",

Vero E6 cells express low very levels of TMPRSS2, therefore WT virus cannot enter efficiently by fusing at the plasma membrane, and it has recently been suggested that WT SARS-CoV-2 is also taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis in these cells (21) .

R634 is part of an extended loop structure that holds the FPPR in place, and alterations in this region, for instance the D614G S mutation, favor opening of the RBDs and disorder the FPPR (37), possibly exposing the S2\u00b4 cleavage site upstream of the fusion peptide (9) .",

Thus, BriS\uf044 can evidently adopt open conformation(s), consistent with the infectivity of the BriS\uf044 variant (Fig. 1) . We conclude that cryo-EM analysis may not fully reflect the dynamics of the S trimer which is subject to a range of stabilizing and destabilizing modalities (38) . Moreover, WT and other S proteins previously analyzed often contain a variety of alterations such as proline mutations stabilizing the prefusion conformation which we did not include in our construct (table S3) . Further, a decreased stability of open BriS\uf044 may be due to the more rigid loop (T676-Q682) lacking 8 amino acids including two protease cleavage sites. In agreement with this, it has been suggested that furin cleavage facilitates the opening of WT S (10). Our study indicates that the locked BriS\uf044 conformation is stabilized as compared to WT S by the additional interactions we described, and the shortened loop may assist to keep these properly in place. Thus, BriS\uf044 may have different opening kinetics from WT S and other variants, which however does not noticeably affect the equilibrium binding constant to ACE2. Moreover, it has been shown that the presence of ACE2 receptors enhances the opening of the RBDs (39).",

In this approach, the response of a system to a perturbation is directly computed by calculating the difference of a given property between simulations with and without a perturbation. Subtracting the perturbed and unperturbed pairs of simulations at a given time, and averaging the results over many replicates, allows for the identification of the events associated with signal propagation and the determination the statistical significance of the observation (30) (31) (32) . The perturbation was generated by the (instantaneous) removal of LA from the FFA-binding pocket. Note that the perturbation used here is not intended to represent the physical process of unbinding, but rather is designed to force the system out of equilibrium and drive a rapid response within the protein, as it adapts to LA removal. A graphical representation of the procedure is shown in Figure S9 . Three equilibrium MD simulations, 200 ns each, were performed for the locked form of the unglycosylated head region of the WT and BriS\uf044 S proteins with LA bound. The simulation conditions for the equilibrium and dynamicalnonequilibrium simulations were identical to those described in (23, 66) . The starting conformations for the nonequilibrium simulations were obtained from the equilibrated part of the equilibrium LAbound simulations. Conformations were taken every 5 ns, and each of the LA molecules were (instantaneously) removed from all the FFA-binding pockets. The resulting apo system was then simulated for 5 ns (fig. S10, S11). 180 apo dynamical-nonequilibrium simulations were performed (90 simulations each for BriS\uf044 and WT S).

The percentage of virus infected cells was analyzed 18 hours after virus infection, before multiple rounds of virus replication. In Vero E6 cells, half-maximal infection was achieved with an ~ 6-fold higher dilution of BriS\uf044 as compared to WT virus (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of TMPRSS2 protease in Vero E6 cells (5) resulted in a substantially higher infection efficiency for both viruses; close to 100% of cells were infected with an up to 16-fold dilution of WT virus and an up to 64-fold dilution of BriS\uf044 virus",

S2). Targeted molecular dynamics simulations indicate that LA stabilizes locked BriS\uf044 more than wildtype S We next characterized the conformational changes in WT S and BriS\uf044 by using targeted molecular dynamics simulations (Fig. 4) to explore the force required to open a single RBD from a closed position in the S trimer for apo and LA-bound systems corresponding to WT and BriS\uf044. We performed 50 simulations over 10 ns for each system (Fig. 4A,B,C,D) applying a force constant of 0.2 kJ/mol/nm to raise a single RBD from an equilibrated, closed conformation to a target, open state, corresponding to the energy-minimized open S model built on EMD-1146 (23). Starting from their closed conformation,we observed that all BriS\uf044 and almost all apo WT S opened during the 10 ns MD simulations. In contrast, bound LA in the WT S substantially reduces the number of opening events (the cross-over time-point when the RBD opens more than halfway) compared to the apo WT spike(Fig. 4A,B).Notably, binding of LA to BriS\uf044(Fig. 4D) completely prevents RBD opening at 0.2 kJ/mol/nm in these simulations. Increasing the force constant to 0.3 kJ/mol/nm was required to raise the RBD of LAbound BriS\uf044 over this time period(Fig. 4E). Example plots illustrate how during the course of the simulation the force applied either resulted in the RBD opening(Fig. 4F, movie S1) or failed to pull the RBD open (no cross-over) as determined by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)(Fig. 4G)The time at which the RMSD traces cross (cross-over time) occurred was binned (in ns steps) for all 50 replicates for each system, as shown inFig. 4A-E. In summary, 98% simulations of the apo WT S and 100% of BriS\uf044 open the RBD with a force constant of 0.2 kJ/mol/nm applied, while only 14% of the WT and 0% of the BriS\uf044 systems complexed with LA open with the same force applied(Fig. 4H).",

The nonequilibrium simulations also show allosteric connection between the FFA pocket and V622-L629, D808-S813 and the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR, residues 833-855) in WT S(Fig. 5, fig. S10). Similar structural responses are observed for the three WT S subunits (fig. S10). The V622-L629 region is part of a larger loop structure spanning residues 617-641, close to the R634-Y829 cation-\u03c0 interaction site (Fig. 2K)(33). The V622-L629 region, close to R634, and the furin-cleavage site respond rapidly to the perturbation in WT S: 0.1 ns after LA removal, conformational rearrangements are observed in both regions(Fig. 5, fig. S10). As the simulations proceed, a gradual increase in deviations is observed for both the furin-cleavage and V622-L629 regions in WT S, with the conformational changes being further propagated to the segments adjacent to the fusion peptide, namely the FPPR and D808-S813. These results show direct coupling between the FFA-binding pocket and important, distant regions of the protein, including the furin-cleavage site. Our simulations also highlight differences in the dynamic response and in the effect of LA between the WT and BriS\uf044 spikes(Fig. 5, fig. S10, S11): in BriS\uf044, only the V622-L629 region responds rapidly to LA removal. The deletion site itself shows smaller conformational rearrangements in BriS\uf044 when compared to WT S, confirming a more rigid arrangement of the shortened loop which in WT S comprises the furin cleavage",

            "text": "Appreciation of the scale of intrapatient sequence variability in HIV infection decades ago led to a much better understanding of the HIV infection lifecycle and the realization of the need for combination drug therapy to combat that RNA virus(40). Similarly, the identification of viruses with furin cleavage site deletions in clinical samples from COVID-19 patients (16-17) and the differential infectivity and replication of the WT and BriS\uf044 viruses suggests that in the heterogenous environment of the human body, SARS-CoV-2 variants with abrogated S1/S2 cleavage may replicate preferentially in specific cell types. While WT SARS-CoV-2 clearly has a competitive advantage in respiratory tract cells(19), the BriS\uf044 virus could preferentially infect and replicate in other human cell types as a niche and reservoir to delay full clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection by the immune system. In fact, postmortem tissue analysis revealed viruses with a furin cleavage site deletion in heart and spleen tissue which could represent such reservoirs(17). Previous studies of RNA viruses have empirically demonstrated that the phenotype of a viral population can change measurably without changes in the consensus sequence due to increased diversity in evolved virus subpopulations(41). We propose that BriS\uf044 exemplifies such SARS-CoV-2 evolution, with such variants of the virus exploiting different cells and tissue types as niches for probing evolutionary space in the same infected host to evolve viral fitness, underscoring the need for analyzing individual virus genomes rather than viral populations for better understanding of the pathology, and the development of future treatments to overcome SARS-CoV-2.",
