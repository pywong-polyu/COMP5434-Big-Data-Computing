Historically, phase 4 observational studies have been used to study such endpoints. However, these also have limitations due to high drop-out rates and an inherent lack of power to detect rare outcomes, or to evaluate risks associated with prior or subsequent treatment decisions, or comorbid medical conditions. 'Real world data' refers to data gathered in the course of an individual patient's routine clinical care. The aim is not to discriminate based on age, comorbid conditions or other such factors that may influence trial eligibility. 1 These data are by nature highly confounded-which brings significant statistical concerns-but also enables observations relevant to clinical practice. Such data enable the study of specific areas that cannot be addressed via traditional routes.",

National registries from European countries, including Sweden, France and Italy have significantly improved our understanding of MS disease trajectories and the influence of treatment on these. 2 MSBase is a collaborative, international disease registry, which captures a range of MS-related data from a large number of countries. 3 More recently, processes for formal data sharing have started to enable the pooling of data from five large registries (Sweden, France, Italy, Denmark, MSBase). 4 Across the UK, harmonised data gathering has been limited to date. While many databases exist, most lack the granularity needed for the objectives of this study. For example, the database for the Blueteq web-based prior approval system identifies people who are prescribed disease modifying therapy (DMT), but does not capture safety data. Rigorous data collection and prospective data entry is time consuming, and frequently does not provide short, or even medium, term benefit to clinicians. Linking data entry to DMT funding rebates brings a clear risk of biasing data. While many of the concerns regarding missing or incomplete data can be overcome with large numbers of participants, 5 in order to overcome reporter bias when examining potentially rare or serious events, data collection and verification needs to be rigorous.",

Second, a chronological filter based on the LEOPARD methodology will be applied. 19 The LEOPARD filter assesses whether an adverse event occurs more often before or after the prescription of the treatment with which it appears to be associated.

Given the infrastructure support required for consent and ongoing data entry, a minimum number of recruits was needed to make the study viable within each centre. An advantage of this approach is that all of the major MS centres selected treat patients with the full range of MS DMTs. However, this approach also introduces a potential source of bias. Patients not seen at MS centres are more likely to be on either no treatment or first line injectable treatments, whereas those treated at MS centres potentially have access to highly active treatment earlier in their disease course. However, early data (table 3) suggest that this strategy has been successful in recruitment patients across a range of DMT.",
