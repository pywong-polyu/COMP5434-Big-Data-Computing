As a viral infection, COVID-19 may be a more prevalent and severe pathology for loss of smell than other upper respiratory viral infections. Research indicates, for example, that the olfactory function is affected more in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with the common cold [1] . The clinical evolution of COVID-19-associated olfactory loss is still unclear because recovery reports vary considerably [2] . According to recent studies, a significant percentage of patients in the months after recovery from the initial phase of COVID-19 still has shown persistent olfactory dysfunction [3, 4] .",

            "text": "In a randomized controlled trial, 100 patients who had recovered COVID-19 according to RT-PCR negative results were incorporated in order to analyze the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray on anosmia or hyposmia. The patients were assigned to a topical corticosteroid group (100 mcg daily) or a control group for three weeks. The results showed that the use of intranasal corticosteroid offered no benefits over olfactory training, and the median smell scores according to VAS at weekly assessment showed significant recovery rate in each group (P < 0.001) without any significant differences between the two groups [17] . Similar to our study, the authors administered mometasone furoate as local corticosteroid to improve olfactory dysfunction. However, whereas the administration of this medication was determined only by the presence of olfactory dysfunction regardless of symptom onset and severity, we considered patients who had olfactory dysfunction from symptom onset for at least two weeks. One of the most important reasons for considering this period of time was that most of the acute olfactory symptoms were improved within two weeks of the COVID-19 onset without any intervention [6, 18] . Moreover, dissimilar patient settings from home isolation (mild COVID-19) to hospitalization (moderate-severe) might have affected patient outcomes. Consequently, it is not possible to establish whether patients experienced improvement due to the applied intervention and not the normal course of COVID-19 in the study of Abdelalim et al [17] . In contrast, we studied the patients with anosmia or severe microsmia as confirmed by the SIT test, and not only through self-reported olfactory loss. Moreover, the non-blinded nature of the study was another major limitation in interpreting the results. Given the above discussion, it does not seem appropriate to administer local corticosteroids at early stage of COVID-19 for all patients regardless of the duration of olfactory symptoms and severity scores. In addition, using psychophysical tests such as UPSIT rather than VAS alone provides more reliable olfactory symptom assessment, such that it allowed us to discover significant differences in our final evaluation that would have otherwise remained unnoticed (Table 7 , Fig. 2 ). In another study on corticosteroids by Rashid et al, the efficacy of betamethasone nasal drop on anosmia in COVID-19 patients was evaluated. A total of 276 patients were randomly given either betamethasone nasal drop three times daily or 0.9% sodium chloride solution for a maximum period of one month. The results indicated that the nasal use of betamethasone drop had no significant effect on the anosmia recovery time according to a self-reported evaluation of the smell sense [19] . Moreover, the clinical response of the patients was not accurately determined. Symptom onset, severity, and improvement were not clear and relied merely on patients' self-reports. Because of these limitations and the non-blinded design of the study, the results should be interpreted cautiously. In a pilot study, the impact of oral methylprednisolone on the smell loss of 27 patients with COVID-19 was evaluated. Nine patients were assigned to 32 mg oral methylprednisolone along with olfactory training. After 10 weeks, the patients' smell mean score in the oral corticosteroid group was significantly higher than that of the control group. Besides, most of the reported side effects of the corticosteroid group were mild or transient in comparison to no report of the mere training group [20] . The compliance of the patient to perform olfactory training was reported low. Moreover, the small sample size and nonrandomized non-blinded design were the major limitations.",
