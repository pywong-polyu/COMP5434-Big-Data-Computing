Participants: We will recruit 600 participants in 20 methadone clinics. Eligibility criteria: (1) age 16+; (2) Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) scores \u2265 10 for methamphetamine use or confirmed methamphetamine use with urine drug screening; (3) willing to provide three pieces of contact information; and (4) having a cell phone. Outcomes: Outcomes are measured at 13, 26, and 49 weeks and throughout the interventions. Primary outcomes include the (1) increase in HIV viral suppression, (2) reduction in HIV risk behaviors, and (3) reduction in methamphetamine use.",

Use of methamphetamine is increasingly common among people with primary OUD [1] [2] [3] . Prevalence of methamphetamine use disorders is increasing in Vietnam [4] , raising concerns about increased risk of HIV infection [5] [6] [7] [8] and disruption of the substance use treatment systems, especially methadone programs [9, 10] . Methamphetamine use among people living with HIV could decrease retention in care, hinder medication adherence, accelerate viral replication, and further HIV disease progression [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Other countries beyond South-East Asia encounter similar challenges [16] [17] [18] . In low-and-middle-income countries, it is vital to identify cost-effective models of adapted evidence-based practices for addressing substance use disorders [19, 20] .",

To evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions, the study employs a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design. In the first phase, participants will be randomized into two frontline interventions for 12 weeks. Based on their outcome at the end of this phase, they will be placed or randomized into three adaptive strategies for another 12 weeks (Fig. 1) . The economic evaluation that addresses Aim 2 aims to weigh public health and societal costs against public health and societal benefits attributed to the interventions of different intensities with a time horizon of 12 months. To address Aim 3, we will conduct an ethnographic evaluation to identify the multi-level factors that influence the adoption and scale-up of the interventions in methadone clinics. The ethnographic evaluation is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) [50, 51] . The CFIR assesses five domains of interventions, outer settings, inner settings, provider characteristics, and participant characteristics. The evaluation includes pre-and postintervention in-depth interviews with key informants who participate in the study and ethnographic observation with participants in their daily activities at the clinics and in the community settings.",

Drug screening: We use an FDA-approved Multi-Drug Rapid Test Panel to detect methamphetamine, opioid, and cannabis in urine twice a week throughout the intervention period and at week 49. Methadone and HIV treatment: We extract methadone and HIV treatment data from participants' medical charts. Variables of interest include length of treatment, treatment regimen, medication dose, and treatment adherence. Self-reported drug use: Drug use patterns (methamphetamine, tobacco, and alcohol use) are evaluated based on amphetamine use behaviors, Amphetamine Cessation Symptom Assessment (ACSA), Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C) scales. ACSA, a 5-point Likert scale, has been used in other studies in Vietnam [55] . The scale includes three domains of methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms: fatigue (3 items), cravings (2 items), and anxiety (11 items) [56] . Higher scores in each domain and in total indicate greater levels of methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms. AUDIT-C is used for identifying patients who drink at hazardous levels or have active alcohol use disorders. AUDIT-C comprises 3 questions scoring on a scale of 0-12 with a cut-off point of 4 for men and of 3 for women [57] . Self-reported psychosocial factors: We use the Barriers to Access to Care Evaluation (BACE) scale to assess barriers to access to mental health care [58] . Participants are asked to what extend they agree or disagree with statements indicating barriers to mental health care. We use the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) which was previously validated in Vietnam to measure mental health [59, 60] . The DASS-21 scale consists of 7 Likert items for each dimension (depression, anxiety, and stress). For each item, respondents indicate how often it applies to them over the past week. The total score of each dimension will indicate the severity level of depression, anxiety, and stress. The Medical Outcome Study: Social Support Survey scale (MOS-SSS), also validated in Vietnam, is used to measure social support [61, 62] . The MOS-SSS comprises 19 items covering four domains: emotional/informational support, tangible social support, positive social interaction, and affectionate support. Higher scores suggest greater support received. Quality of life is measured with the EQ-5D-5L scale which includes the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive system covers 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). On the EQ VAS, respondents indicate the score that represents their health status on the scale that ranges from 0 (the worst health they can image) to 100 (the best health they can image). The EQ-5D-5L was previously validated in Vietnam [63] .",

We can detect even smaller group differences for substance use outcomes in the proposed sample of 400 HIV-negative participants and the combined sample of HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants.

The study will provide effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evidence for scaling up these interventions. The SMART design assesses different treatment strategies for participants who respond differently to frontline interventions. The combination of trial and ethnographical study will provide insights on factors at multiple levels that need to be considered in decisionmaking. The adaptation and pilot implementation of EBIs will make them culturally sound to local participants. As the interventions will be delivered by methadone providers at methadone clinics, they can be readily implemented if the trial demonstrates they help. The participation of some participants can be interrupted due to drug-related police arrest or methadone treatment fatigue. This limitation can be minimized as we will select clinics with low drop-out rates. We have officially informed the local police on the study implementation and received approval from both national and local authorities. While this measure does not prevent participants from being arrested, especially when they are involved in illegal activities, it could reduce attrition. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures could pose challenges for the study implementation. With the response plan developed for potential interruption scenarios, we believe the study will be implemented safely and will maintain a high-level of data quality and intervention fidelity.",

The effectiveness and costeffectiveness findings will be critical to make decisions on adopting methamphetamine use interventions. The study will provide insights into the barriers and facilitators to the expansion of interventions to direct further policy advocacy and program development. The study will be implemented at the time when the COVID-19 pandemic has waged significant impacts in Vietnam. Therefore, it offers lessons learned for future scale-up of the intervention in the face of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic in many parts of the world. He co-directs a program aimed at examining the underlying causes and clinical characteristics of gambling disorder in order to develop effective, evidence-based treatment strategies. He is also involved in research to examine the full impact of cannabis on the body, mind, and brain.",
