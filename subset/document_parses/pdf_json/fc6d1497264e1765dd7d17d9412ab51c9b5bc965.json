            "text": "Human Infection Studies (HIS) have emerged as an important research approach with the potential to fast track the global development of vaccines and treatments for infectious diseases, including in low resource settings. Given the high level of burdens involved in many HIS, particularly prolonged residency and biological sampling requirements, it can be challenging to identify levels of study payments that provide adequate compensation but avoid 'undue' levels of inducement to participate. Through this embedded ethics study, involving 97 healthy volunteers and other research stakeholders in a malaria HIS programme in Kenya, and using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and observations during and after a malaria HIS, we give a grounded account of ethical issues emerging in relation to study payments in this setting. While careful community, national, international scientific and ethics review processes meant that risks of serious harm were highly unlikely, the levels of motivation to join HIS seen could raise concerns about study payments being too high. Particular value was placed on the reliability, rather than level, of study payment in this setting, where subsistence livelihoods are common. Study volunteers were generally clear about the study aims at the point of recruitment, and this knowledge was retained over a year later, although most reported experiencing more burdens than anticipated at enrolment. Strict study screening procedures, regular clinical and laboratory monitoring of volunteers, with prompt treatment with antimalarial at predetermined endpoints suggested that the risks of serious harm were highly unlikely. Ethical concerns emerged in relation to volunteers' attempts to conceal symptoms, hoping to prolong residency periods and increase study payments; and volunteers making decisions that compromised important family relationships and personal values. Our findings support an interpretation that, although study volunteers were keen to join the study to access cash payments, they also paid attention to other features of the study and the general clinical research landscape, including levels of risk associated with study participation. Overall, our analysis shows that the ethical concerns emerging from the study payments can be addressed through practical measures, hinged on reducing burdens and strengthening communication, raising important issues for research policy and planning.",

Core issues concern the acceptability of infecting healthy volunteers with disease causing pathogens, volunteers' understanding of the concept of deliberate infection, and their experiences of and motivation for participation. Relatedly, there are debates about policy for HIS, including how to support fair decision making processes and compensate for the risks and burdens experienced by volunteers, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

We use the word 'payments' to refer to compensation and re-imbursement, especially when offered in monetary terms. Some features of HIS may prompt higher levels of payment, including prolonged periods of residency and postdischarge study visits often involved as well as physical and other burdens associated with deliberate infection (e.g. restricted movements and regular blood draws for experimental and clinical/safety monitoring) [8] [9] [10] . Prolonged residency requirements support science and safety, for example, where repeated, timed blood sampling is needed to support research and a participant's health must be monitored continuously to diagnose and treat a deliberate infection or other health issues, if these arise [11] .",

In this respect, study benefits-including some forms of payments-should account for costs, burdens and inconveniences linked to research participation and recognise existing structural inequities, including where made as forms of ancillary care [16, 17] . At the same time, offering reasonable support to participants means that benefits should not present an offer that will be 'empty' or 'difficult to refuse' , which may be a particular risk in contexts of unmet need [18, 19] . In contrast, failure to compensate study volunteers adequately risks exploitation at individual and population levels. The latter is illustrated through a phenomenon described as \"ethics dumping\" in which study benefits and payments are minimised by choosing to conduct studies in low resource settings where low benefits are highly attractive to populations with few alternative sources of cash [20, 21] .",

An earlier definition identified four criteria for undue inducement: that a desirable offer is made, the offer is 'excessive or irresistible' , leads to decisions that would otherwise not be made to participate and the study potentially involves serious burdens or harm [24] . Refining this definition, others have noted that a 'high' offer may distort a study participant's ability to perceive the risks and benefits of participation accurately [25] [26] [27] . At the same time, concerns about undue inducement have been described as unnecessary; prior independent expert ethics review will ensure a reasonable balance exists between study risks and benefits before inviting participation, and payments can therefore only act as due, and not undue, inducement [24] . Others have noted dangers in an overreliance on the optimal functioning of research ethics committees (RECs), including in undertaking a risk-benefit assessment [27] .",

Over this time, the malaria HIS programme has involved a total of 161 healthy adult volunteers from two administrative locations in Kilifi County and one location (Ahero) in Kisumu county in Western Kenya, selected to represent areas of varying malaria endemicity (low and medium endemicity in Kilifi and high endemicity in Ahero) [40, 41] . Kilifi and Kisumu counties lie about 843 km apart, with differing sociocultural features reflecting diversity in predominant cultural traditions (Mijikenda ethnic traditions in Kilifi and Luo in Ahero) and economies. Rates of multidimensional poverty have been assessed at 35.5% and 59.9% in Kisumu and Kilifi counties, respectively [42] , and Kisumu town is the third largest city in Kenya. 1 Volunteers from both counties shared similar economic opportunities and challenges in life, with a majority dependent on subsistence or small scale farming, sea or lake fishing, tourism (in Kilifi) and small scale trade or business, including driving motorbike taxis and selling vegetables, cooked food or household items [43] .",

Following selection and recruitment, including individual informed consent processes with a quiz to check understanding, research clinicians gave an intravenous injection of P. falciparum sporozoites to healthy volunteers under closely monitored conditions. Volunteers were required to remain within a residential facility at a university guesthouse in Kilifi town for up to 25 days to support clinical monitoring and fixed-time repeated blood sampling to assess immune responses to the challenge and check for the development of malaria infection. Participants who developed malaria were treated and discharged on full recovery, with variation in the time to develop symptoms, given individual differences in existing levels of immunity. Final clinical follow up for the malaria HIS occurred at day 35 post-challenge, after discharge from the in-patient facility.",

Given the unique character of HIS in requiring prolonged residency and deliberate infection, the policy on these study payments was developed through a consultative process including the HIS research team, the wider scientific community, and the Community Liaison Group at KWTRP. Payment policies were approved by the relevant ethics and regulatory bodies (KEMRI Science and Ethics Review Unit, and Pharmacy and Poisons Board respectively) [11] . Study payments accounted for reimbursement of travel expenses, and for compensation for financial and economic losses [11] . Travel was reimbursement in relation to actual costs incurred. Compensation and remuneration costs were assessed in relation to likely financial and economic losses, burdens experienced, and burdens accepted during residency, including limitation of movement away from home and experience of malaria infection, where this arose. The total payment, based on these assessments, was set at KSH 2000/day (approximately USD 20/day) drawing on national minimum wage guidance [7] and earlier consultations with KEMRI Community Representatives on daily rates of compensation during their own residential training activities [4, 30, 31] . Since the payments were pegged on days spent at residency (up to a maximum of 25 days), the total amount that individual participants would receive would inevitably differ as it will depend on how long one stayed in residency. The payments were made as a lump sum at the end of residency.",

Study staff were sampled based on their roles (clinician, study investigator, field worker/community health volunteer and community engagement staff ), and community leaders (from Ahero and Kilifi) and community representatives (from Kilifi) were invited based on residency within the locations involved in the HIS. The community representatives from Kilifi known as the KEMRI Community Representatives (KCRs) is a hybrid network of community members elected by their community to serve for a period of time as a hybrid community advisory board [38] . Data collection methods included non-participant observation, individual and pairs in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, which are described in detail elsewhere [8, 12] and summarised in Table 2 below.

We imported data into QSR Nvivo 12 software to support our analysis, using a Framework Analysis approach [45] . Framework analysis involves steps of close reading of transcripts and field notes, the selection of three rich accounts to inform the development of a preliminary coding scheme by consensus within the study group and coding of all transcripts as an iterative process in which the scheme was adapted to capture emerging findings. Saturation was attained when no relevant new codes were being identified around the broad topic of interest (i.e., payment issues) from the transcripts. The team discussed data within codes to support organisation into themes, with findings charted into a matrix by individual participant or group, to support further interpretation. This overall process of analysis and interpretation informed earlier publications [8, 12] , based on data collected during T1 and T2. In this paper, we present and analyse data from T1, 2 and 3, to focus on an account of ethical concerns around study payments in the Kilifi malaria HIS, drawing on the wider literature including that presented in Sect. 1.1. As highlighted in our earlier publication [12] , throughout the tool development, data collection and analysis, we were conscious of and made every effort to consider our positionality, especially as staff/researchers from an institution (KWTRP) perceived as highly prestigious and powerful across the study communities as well as our individual views about HIS. The study team included both social scientists (PCC, VM, IJ, EO, DK) and basic scientists (MK, PB), with extensive experience of community-based clinical research, including within the study communities. Additionally, some members of the social science team (IJ, DK) were introduced to study volunteers during screening, enrolment and study engagement activities, giving them an opportunity to build rapport prior to data collection. Taking these into considerations, we presented our social science study as a separate study from the clinical study, with separate recruitment and consenting processes. We were therefore keen to maintain a neutral stance on HIS throughout the data collection and analysis process. ",

Perhaps more importantly, volunteers described feeling reassured about the safety of the study procedures, including through expressions of trust in the research institution and protocol review process, hearing positive accounts of the study from participants in earlier phases of the study, interactions with study staff and a general perception of malaria infection as an easily treated, everyday condition [7, 8, 12] .",

Earlier phases of the malaria HIS programme faced early challenges with initial recruitment -which was attributed to unfamiliarity of this type of study design, concerns around safety and waiting to see whether those who sign up first will be safe. The amounts of compensation were the same across all the malaria HIS. However, in the later phases of the malaria HIS frontline staff and KEMRI Community Representatives noted a much greater interest amongst local residents in joining the current phase of the study. Levels of volunteering were also far more than that seen in earlier (non-HIS) trials in Kilifi, such as vaccine and drug trials [8] , where the levels of inconveniences are much lower. Further, our observations during screening periods to determine eligibility to join the study suggested that many potential volunteers experienced high levels of anxiety while waiting, and others showed marked disappointment on learning they would not be able to take part. Some volunteers found to be eligible during initial health checks also worked hard to ensure they 'made it' into the final study cohort, including take measures to minimise risks of getting malaria before the challenge event that would prevent their final inclusion:",

In addition, community-based frontline staff and volunteers in earlier HIS studies were often asked questions about the study and some shared their experiences with friends and neighbours.

Rarely described were instances where the cash was used in ways that were unhelpful, including in buying recreational drugs and alcohol. Another factor that emerged was the gendered sociocultural challenges in relation to bringing cash into the family [8] . Community leaders and frontline community-based staff described instances in which family conflicts emerged over the payments. For example, some women volunteers were unwilling to hand over cash to male household head, as would be expected in this traditionally patrilineal culture, and sometimes serious disagreements arose about how the cash should be used [30, 54] .

In this way, while accessing payments was a main motivating factor for joining the study, this assessment was based on positive support for the study aims, given local relevance, and reassurance about safety through existing trust relations with KWTRP and its staff, familiarity with the nature and treatment of malaria as an illness, and some recognition of the regulatory processes that protect volunteers' interests.

Other factors however do point to the fact that some participants placed greater emphasis on the payment offered in the study in terms of compensation and re-imbursement -particularly the monetary lumpsum offered at the end of the residency period.

The emergence of conflict between communitybased frontline research staff and community members, related to accusations of partiality or unfairness in volunteers' recruitment, and the reported impacts on community attitudes towards joining other types of studies as reported in our earlier study [8] , also speak to levels of interest that may be high. Similarly, some volunteers' attempts at concealing symptoms during the trial (even though not feasible in practice) and reports of 'trading off ' important existing values against decisions to join studies (where the primary motivation to join was financial) raise similar concerns, as reported for other non HIS clinical research [58, 59] .

Firstly, the high levels of interest in joining the study seem to have been underpinned by often unrealistic expectations of how the payments would impact volunteers' lives. One response might therefore be to strengthen volunteers' capacity to make this assessment, for example, by involving previous HIS volunteers in engagement activities, rather than reduce the payments. Secondly, changes in the way payments were made, rather than the amount given, for example regular weekly payments to volunteers during residency rather than a lump sum at the end [8] . Additionally, former volunteers' reports on the way that payments were used illustrate great diversity in the extent to which individuals have been able to make important changes to their lives, suggesting that these levels are reasonable.",

In this empirical ethics study, we have explored the ethical issues with volunteers' payments in a malaria HIS at a low resource setting in Kenya. While the payments to volunteers as reimbursement and compensation were recognized as a desirable good, with exceptional high levels of interest to participate in the study across the study communities, volunteers understanding of the study aims and key elements of the study procedures, do not suggest that volunteers had 'clouded' judgement about the study. Moreover, documentation of the way the payments were used by volunteers show that while the payments were highly valued, it was arguably not transformational to be deemed as an excessive offer. Additionally, the design of the study involving close and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring of volunteers after challenge while in residence, with prompt treatment of those that",
