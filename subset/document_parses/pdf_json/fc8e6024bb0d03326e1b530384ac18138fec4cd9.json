Then, elective surgeries could not be carried out timely. It not only affects the health of patients but also affects hospital income. The key to the above problem is how to deal with uncertainty, which is one of the most difficult problems faced in the field of optimization. Specifically, surgery duration, length of stay, the arrival time of emergency patients, and whether they are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus are uncertain. Therefore, we propose a bed configuration to ensure that elective patients are not affected by non-elective patients such as COVID-19 patients. More importantly, we propose a planning model based on robust optimization and fuzzy set theory, which for the first time consider different categories of uncertainty in the same healthcare system. Given that the problem is more complex than the classical surgical scheduling problem, which is NP-hard in most cases, we propose a hybrid algorithm (GA-VNS-H) based on genetic algorithm, variable neighborhood search, and heuristics for problem traits. Specifically, the heuristic for operating room allocation is used to improve the efficiency, the genetic algorithm and variable neighborhood can improve the global and local search capabilities, respectively, and the adaptive mechanism can reduce the algorithm solution time. Experiments show that the algorithm has better calculation efficiency and solution accuracy. In addition, the elective surgery planning model under the new bed configuration model can effectively cope with the uncertain environment of COVID-19.",

For instance, many hospitals are therefore forced to postpone or even cancel elective surgery (Naderi et al. 2021) . Therefore, the elective patients had to wait for a long time. Among them, some patients may be dissatisfied due to waiting, some face deterioration, and some, unfortunately, die (Campbell 2021; Norris et al. 2022; Sen-Crowe et al. 2021 ). On the other hand, the cancellation of elective surgery will result in a substantial decrease in hospital income because it is the main part of hospital income (Best et al. 2020) . Although increasing bed capacity can alleviate the shortage of hospital beds, it will directly increase the financial burden of the hospital, especially after the decrease in income due to the reduction of elective surgery (Best, et al. 2015) . Therefore, some hospitals try to restart elective surgery, but they face some challenges. For example, hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients without available beds for elective patients. In addition, the uncertainty of the arrival of emergency patients will affect the planning of elective surgery. What's more serious is that emergency patients cannot be sure whether they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, which may cause infection in elective patients once they are admitted to the hospital.",

For example, mixing COVID-19 patients with elective patients is not a wise choice. In addition, the COVID-19 epidemic has exacerbated the uncertainty, such as the arrival time and the number of emergency patients, the surgery duration, and whether emergency patients are infected with the virus SARS-CoV-2 cannot be known in advance. The new challenges that the COVID-19 brings to conventional surgery scheduling:1) Historical data cannot predict new trends, such as COVID-19 extending hospital stays of surgical patients (Norris et al. 2022) . 2) Inpatient beds and ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients are uncertain (Ren\u00e9 Bekker 2022), resulting in uncertain inpatient beds and ICU beds available for elective surgery patients. 3) The bottleneck resources of elective surgery scheduling became inpatient beds and ICU beds instead of operating rooms (Martin 2021) . 4) The environment inside and outside the hospital is highly uncertain, which leads to the schedule being adjusted frequently.",

            "text": "One of the traditional bed configurations is that each medical specialty has self-owned wards, such as surgical wards and cardiology wards, as shown in Fig. 1 . One of its advantages is it can match patients' specific medical needs (e.g., dedicated staff and equipment). But in this setting, it often occurs that some beds in one specialty are scarce, while that in others are underutilized (Dai and Shi 2019) . Therefore, Izady and Israa (2021) proposed clustered overflow configuration (Izady and Israa 2021) , as shown in Fig. 1 . Scheduling in this configuration has more flexibility to assign the patient but fails to cope with the uncertainty of emergency arriving. In this setting, planning elective and non-elective together may lead to unexpected results that the elective patient would be postponed or canceled due to the emergency. In addition, during the epidemic, the uncertainty of emergency patients will also bring the risk of infection to the elective patients. To this end, we propose a new bed configuration, named buffered clustered configuration, as shown in Fig. 1 . In this bed configuration, the admission route of nonelective patients (including walk-in patients and emergency patients) has changed. Specifically, they cannot directly enter the general ward, but can only enter the buffered ward and clustered wards. Through buffer ward, non-elective patients can be isolated and tested for COVID-19. In addition, clustered wards reduce the impact of non-elective patient arrival uncertainty on elective surgery. We need to explain why elective patients do not need buffered wards. Because compared with emergency patients, elective patients have enough time to determine whether they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and surgery can be postponed if they are not sure. However, non-elective patients are in urgent condition and must receive timely treatment before determining whether they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the hospital cannot under different bed configurations (An example with two Specialties) 1 . 1 During the epidemic, compared with the operating room, the hospital bed is a scarce resource, and hospitals usually reserve sufficient operating rooms for emergency patients as its number is large. In addition, some non-elective patients in the picture have already received emergency surgery or treatment before entering the ward. refuse to treat these patients (Greiner et al. 2021; Yu et al. 2021) .",

            "text": "For the surgery duration and the length of stay (LOS) in hospital, Most studies assume that the distribution of these parameters is known, or at least the data is sufficient (by fitting the distribution with data), and then build a stochastic model to schedule elective surgery (Atighehchian et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2018; Shehadeh and Padman 2022) . However, the assumption that the parameter distribution is known is too strong, and the data in the hospital is sometimes insufficient (Mak et al. 2015) . For example, Denton et al. found that at Fletcher Allen Medical Center, on average only 21 data points are available for each type of surgery (Denton et al. 2007 ). In addition, the COVID-19 epidemic makes historical data difficult to reflect new trends. For example, Norris et al. (2021) showed that long-term waiting leads to prolonged postoperative hospital stays for some elective operations, and the operation process becomes more complicated. Robust optimization and fuzzy optimization are two effective methods to deal with insufficient data. One of their difference lies in the source of decision-making information. The former is objective information, such as parameter support, while the latter is subjective information, such as surgeon estimates. Existing research usually assumes that the decision information in the same planning system is either objective or subjective. In practice, these two situations can exist at the same time. For example, the elective surgery duration can be estimated by the attending surgeon based on the patient's physical condition. However, the number of non-elective patients arriving each day is difficult to be estimated by the surgeon. Therefore, this paper divides the uncertain parameters of surgical planning into two types, called objective parameters and subjective parameters. Specifically, the patient's surgery duration and the length of stay are objective parameters. The arrival of emergency patients is a subjective parameter influenced by external factors. As far as we know, in surgical planning, almost no research considers these two information representations in the same decision-making environment.",

The two most important are the upstream resources represented by the operating room and the downstream resources represented by the hospital bed. Most scholars regard the operating room as a scarce resource (Bandi and Gupta 2020; Ferrand 2014; Lovejoy and Li 2002) , while some studies regard downstream wards as scarce resources (Best, et al. 2015; Taramasco et al. 2019; Zychlinski et al. 2020 ). There are two common ways to deal with resource shortages. One is at the operational level, where patients are scheduled to make full use of resources (Gul et al. 2015; Naderi et al. 2021; Vancroonenburg et al. 2016) , and the other is at the strategy level, where reasonable allocate resources to achieve resource balance (Best, et al. 2015; Izady and Israa 2021; Pinker and Tezcan 2013) . this paper focuses on the problem of resource shortages both upstream and downstream by two methods as previously mentioned.",

(2020) regard OR idle time and overtime as the goal to use the existing operating room resources as much as possible while avoiding additional Occupied. This is consistent with one of our optimization goals. In practice, congestion of downstream resources will make it difficult for patients to enter the hospital for treatment and reduce the utilization rate of the operating room. Therefore, some studies consider the utilization of downstream resources. For example, Zychlinski et al. (2020) believe that the shortage of hospital beds in the downstream Geriatric Institutions will lead to congestion, causing upstream patients to be unable to receive treatment in time. F\u00fcgener et al. (2014) expanded the scope of surgical scheduling to downstream resources, such as the Intensive Care Unit and general wards that patients need after discharge. Moosavi and Ebrahimnejad (2018) regard bed exceeding capacity as an optimization goal. Similarly, we consider the utilization of downstream hospital bed resources as an optimization goal. in contrast, we not only consider elective patients but also nonelective patients (including emergency patients, walk-in patients, and COVID-19 patients).",

(Dai and Shi 2019) proposed an overflow configuration. Specifically, if one patient has no available bed in his (her) specialty ward, overflow configuration allows the patient to be planned to one bed in another specialty ward. Under this configuration, the hospital can make full use of the idle beds of all medical specialties without increasing production capacity. However, it also brings some drawbacks. Inevitably, there are also some drawbacks. For example, due to the significant differences in nurse skills and nursing equipment in different medical specialties, overflow configuration will bring certain health risks to overflow patients (patients planned to other medical specialties wards). Therefore, (Izady and Israa 2021) proposed clustered overflow configuration, which can ensure the full use of resources and reduce health risks. The above bed configuration does not reflect the difference between elective and nonelective patients. In the case of sufficient bed resources, it has excellent applicability. However, when there is a shortage of hospital beds, its effect will be greatly reduced, because there is competition and conflict between non-elective patients and elective patients in the use of hospital beds. Specifically, non-elective patients usually have a higher priority and will preempt the beds that have been allocated to patients for elective surgery. For this reason, we proposed a buffered clustered configuration. Similar to clustered overflow configuration, we use clustered ward, the difference is that we reset the admission process of non-elective patients. In addition, we added a buffer ward to observe and detect potential COVID-19 patients.",

The uncertainty comes from many aspects, including the uncertainty of the arrival of emergency patients, the uncertainty of surgery duration and the length of hospitalization, etc. It is difficult to predict the arrival of emergency patients from historical data because of its complication and the fact that sometimes data are not available, such as in the early stage of COVID-19. Therefore, some research and practice provide dedicated operating rooms and hospital beds for emergency operations (Bovim et al. 2020; Ferrand 2014; Li et al. 2017 ). This method is practical because the emergency requires timely surgical treatment. In addition, it can also reduce the interference of the uncertainty of emergency patients on elective surgery planning. However, during COVID-19, the shortage of downstream beds forced us to re-evaluate this approach. Specifically, the uncertainty of the arrival of emergency patients results in that the beds reserved for emergency patients may not be used in time. On the other hand, the beds reserved for elective patients may be occupied by emergency patients when there are not enough beds reserved for emergency patients, resulting in the cancellation of the planned elective surgery. Therefore, we reset the admission route for non-elective patients to reduce their interference with elective dates.",

Some studies assume that historical data is sufficient or the distribution is known, and use stochastic optimization to obtain optimal scheduling (Bovim et al. 2020; Eun et al. 2019) . In practice, data is not always available or sufficient. Given the lack of surgery duration data, (Moosavi and Ebrahimnejad 2020) proposed a robust scheduling model. Similarly, (Wang, et al. 2019 ) built a distributionally robust optimization model to minimize operating room opening costs and expected overtime. Of course, sometimes even though the data is not sufficient, it can also provide a small amount of information, such as the mean, support, and moments. Therefore, (Mak et al. 2015) proposed a data-driven robust scheduling model. When historical data is not available, surgeon experience is also available decision-making information. This information, usually inferred by the surgeon based on the patient's physical condition, can fully describe the patient. In this paper, we refer to the information from historical data as objective information and information from the surgeon's evaluation as subjective information. Methodology for different surgery procedures and information can be seen in Table 1 .",

The feature of the fuzzy model is that it doesn't rely on historical data (Zhao et al. 2020) , while the robust model needs a small amount of data. Both models are suitable for the environment with insufficient data. The difference is that fuzzy models require expert experience while robust models rely on a small amount of data. In addition, fuzzy sets have contributed to enhancing the robustness and applicability of scheduling (Jos\u00e9 et al. 2015) .

Therefore, one of the goals is to reduce OR overtime and idle time, while reducing idle beds and extra beds needed. Extra beds are temporary beds that are added to cope with the number of patients exceeding capacity. Given that the hospital faces an uncertain environment, timely adjustment is needed to improve adaptability. Therefore, one of the optimization goals is to minimize changes to the initial planning. Under normal circumstances, the hospital needs to decide the surgery date and the operating room.

For this reason, we design the neighborhood operator for each subpart of the chromosome. In addition, the classic VNS usually restarts the search process from the first neighborhood after finding a better neighborhood solution. The main disadvantage of this search process is that even if a better solution is obtained in the current neighboring area, it will still go to the first search area (K. Wang et al. 2021) . Therefore, compared with other neighborhoods, the first neighborhood is more likely to be used. Once the search effect of the first neighborhood is not good, it will lead to a waste of computing power and reduce the efficiency of the algorithm. In addition, the search time of the VNS algorithm is relatively long. Once there are many neighborhoods, the search time will increase significantly. Therefore, we propose an improved adaptive search mechanism.",

If there are too many neighborhood operators, it will significantly increase the search time of the algorithm. To this end, we designed a search mechanism based on rewards and consumption. The basic principle is that each neighborhood operator has an initial energy value, and each application of the neighborhood operator consumes one unit of energy value. When all the neighborhood operator run out of the energy value, the search ends. If the neighborhood operator gets a better solution in a certain iteration, it will get a certain amount of energy as a reward. The next neighborhood selection is based on the existing energy value of each operator. Specifically, it uses the Roulette Wheel Selection mechanism of the classic GA algorithm.",

As shown in Table 4 , in small-scale test instances, each algorithm can find the optimal solution such as test instance 1. However, as the scale of the problem increases, the accuracy of DE, HPSO, and FDE has dropped significantly. From the perspective of the algorithm running time, as shown in Table 5 , these algorithms are also longer, which showed that the DE, HPSO, and FDE cannot effectively solve the proposed model. In comparison, GA-VNS-H is significantly better than other algorithms in terms of accuracy and computation time. To further highlight the role of the internal components of the algorithm, we have compared the various sub-strategies proposed in this article. The results prove that each component can effectively improve the efficiency of the GA-VNS-H. Note that GA-VNS is sometimes better than GA-VNS-H because the latter adds heuristic OR_assignment for operating room arrangements. When the operating room in the test instance is relatively idle, the effect of the heuristic will reduce. To evaluate the model, we selected two classic models for comparison. They are the Deterministic model (DM) and the Completely robust model (CR) proposed by (Mulvey et al. 1995) . In DM, the values of uncertain parameters are randomly selected in the support set. In CR, the support of uncertain parameters can be directly applied to the model. In FR, surgery duration and LOS are fuzzy numbers, and the number of non-elective patients is the parameter support.",

The solution of the model may be infeasible in the actual environment because of the uncertainty of the actual environment. DM has the largest number of constraint violations, which indicates that its ability to adapt to the environment is weak. Especially when resources are in short supply, the proportion of feasible solutions of DM in the simulation environment is very low. Therefore, although its objective function value of the feasible solution is the smallest, it is infeasible with high probability in the actual environment. We also found that both CR and FR have high robustness because the number of violations is very small. Furthermore, FR is superior to CM in both the robustness of the model and the robustness of the solution. Note that the average proportion of feasible solutions of FR in the simulation environment has reached 95.1%, indicating that its environmental adaptability is outstanding. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3 , the CM generates long running times. In comparison, the FR has less computation time.",

Only a small number of patients require long-term stay and observation in Buffered Ward. As shown in Table 6 , WT represents the waiting time, and PR represents the priority of the planned patient. PRD represents the change of the operation date in the re-planning. BED_O represents the excess of the hospital bed.",

It also indirectly shows that clustered wards help to make full use of the bed because they can balance the use of resources in different specialties. The PR of buffered clustered configuration and clustered overflow configuration is larger, which shows that they can allocate high-priority patients to obtain surgery. In addition, the PRD of buffered configuration is smallest than others, which proves the buffered configuration can reduce the interference of the non-elective patient's random arrival to the elective patient. Of course, we also see that the BO of the buffered configuration is higher than that of the traditional configuration. This shows that although we can reduce the patient's infection risk and the interference of elective surgery through the buffered configuration, the cost is that the bed is exceeded. Fortunately, this excess is not great.",

In addition, we propose a fuzzy-robust model based on robust optimization and fuzzy set theory to deal with the uncertainty. At last, to solve the model, a hybrid algorithm based on genetic algorithm and variable neighborhood search is further proposed. Experiments show that the algorithm has better calculation efficiency and solution accuracy. In addition, the elective surgery planning model under the new bed configuration model can effectively cope with the uncertain environment. Most hospitals postponed or canceled scheduled surgeries because of the potential risk brought by COVID-19 patients. We are providing a method of bed allocation and patient management to help safely perform elective surgery. It can help protect patients present in the hospital and reduce the waiting times for surgery out of the hospital. Of course, it also helps to ensure the income of the hospital.",
