            "text": "March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterised the COVID-19 disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) capable of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as a pandemic. 1 Given the fact that an average operating theatre would see over 1200 procedures per year, and that 18% of them are for patients requiring emergency surgery, 2 thousands of patients positive for COVID-19 are likely to require surgical interventions during this outbreak. Furthermore, a study recently published in The Lancet concluded: ' Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality. Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice. . . ' 3 As demonstrated by Weber et al., 4 despite wellestablished safety protocols, healthcare professionals are at continuous risk from occupational infectious disease transmission from patients. Many frontline healthcare workers had a significantly increased risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the outbreak, numerous cases of which resulted in severe illness and death. 5 Despite the significance attributed to the management of patients with acute respiratory disease, and the existence of guidelines and protective measures for these cases, the degree of transmission risk associated with aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) is not yet clear. 6,7 A more recent systematic review 8 identified some procedures to present an increased risk of transmission. These included tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy and manual ventilation before intubation; other intubation-associated procedures, endotracheal aspiration, suction of body fluids, bronchoscopy, nebuliser treatment, administration of O 2 , high flow O 2 , manipulation of O 2 mask or BiPAP mask, defibrillation, chest compressions, insertion of nasogastric tube and collection of sputum were not significant. 8 Viral RNA has been detected in faeces, [9] [10] [11] whole blood, 9, [12] [13] [14] serum, 15,16 saliva, 15, 16 oro/nasopharyngeal specimens, 9, 17 urine, 9 ocular secretions, 18 breastmilk, 19 and in placental or fetal membrane samples. 20 Substantial further research is required in relation to the degree of infectivity from a number of these additional sources of viable virus. Nevertheless, the potential to aerosolise any virus-laden fluid will expose surgical teams to SARS-CoV-2, the subsequent risk of infection from which is currently unknown.",

Lasers can also create virus-and bacteria-laden plumes. 25 It is clear that the evidence for the creation of aerosols associated with these procedures, the burden of potential viable microbes within the created aerosols, and the mechanism of transmission to the host have not been well studied.

Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) have implications for transmission of viruses including COVID-19. It has not previously been formally assessed whether use of a dermatome should be classified as an AGP. This study uses a fluorescent dye in the context of simulated surgery using a dermatome to see if any, and how much, fine spray is generated from the device and also utilises ultra-slow-motion videography to see how any spray may be generated. At the heart of this study is the included video footage that demonstrates considerable fine spray generation which suggests it is best to assume that dermatomes are likely to generate some degree of aerosol depending on the clinical scenario and how it is used. However, this information does not translate to providing any information about the risk of transmission of the virus from using a dermatome, especially in relation to COVID-19, and separate research would be required to answer this. may be harvested in a variety of ways. 28 The most commonly used technique involves a dermatome, which provides rapid, consistent harvest of large uniform-thickness grafts. Dermatomes are typically air-powered or electric, although manually operated devices exist. All powered dermatomes harvest with a rapidly oscillating blade. Despite STSGs being a major tool in a surgeon's quiver for reconstruction of burns and skin defects, there is no study that examines their potential harvest as an AGP. The most detailed review of the evidence to date 29, 30 does not mention dermatomes, but does acknowledge indirectly that power tools may be AGPs. Thus far, the plastic surgery community has only had limited indirect evidence such as this from which to make key decisions. The present study seeks to establish directly whether powered dermatome usage has the potential to be an AGP, and to put this in clinical context based on the current world literature.",

Some pre-COVID-19 studies have shown aerosolisation from use of both drilling machinery in the operating room and ultrasonic dental devices, 21, 22 which lends credence to the potential for similar equipment such as dermatomes and hydrodebridement tools to also generate aerosols, but this is an indirect extrapolation. Certainly, the dermatome is not on any list such as the WHO list of AGPs published in 2014 30 or in the World Federation of Anaesthesiologists' list. 31 There is, however, an advisory suggestion by BAPRAS and the BBA in relation to dermatome usage and its potential to generate aerosols. 26, 27 This study suggests dermatome usage is likely to be an AGP, but does not provide any information with regards to clinical context and what degree of risk usage is likely to confer in relation to COVID-19. While previously cited studies show the presence of the virus in many bodily fluids, only a minority of individuals in the Lancet Infectious Disease study had viremia, 14 and the most likely source of aerosolised virus from a skin donor site is likely to be from blood. However, it must be noted that skin graft donor sites for major burns will sometimes come from areas that could be contaminated with other bodily fluids. This includes the scalp donor site, which could be contaminated with ocular secretions and from the oro/nasopharynx, and buttock donor sites, which could be contaminated with faeces, especially when faecal tubes are in situ.

It is likely that the finer and less visible spray will travel an even greater distance than the visible distance demonstrated in the images or videos and will need to be evaluated by more sophisticated means. While the evidence is circumstantial, it remains the first-available and best-available evidence in the published world literature. It must be noted that while the potential to aerosolise any virus-laden fluid may put surgical teams at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the subsequent risk of transmission from any such exposure is currently unknown. We know that the detection of viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) does not equate with the potential for infection unless infectious virus particles have been confirmed through virus isolation and culture; furthermore, correlation has been suggested between the isolation of viable virus and the initial viral load. 33 Hence, further studies are required to put the results of this study into clearer clinical context. This study therefore underscores the position that it is reasonable with the current evidence to categorise dermatome usage as an AGP, and hence to maintain PPE for procedures utilising a dermatome on that basis.
