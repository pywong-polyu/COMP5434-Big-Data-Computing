COVID-19 patients admitted to Henan Provincial People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed, including 23, 4 and 8 cases with mild to moderate, severe and critical symptoms, respectively. VTE incidence, age at onset, relevant laboratory parameters and prognosis were analyzed. Overall, VTE incidence in the 35 patients was 20.0%, occurring in severe (n \u00bc 1) and critical (n \u00bc 6) cases. D-dimer showed statistical significance in laboratory examination, representing except a diagnostic index and especial can be a prognostic factor in VTE among COVID-19 patients. Severe and critical COVID-19 cases had significantly reduced platelet counts, with a risk of hemorrhage. During treatment, the risk of both hemorrhage and thrombosis should be considered. VTE occurs in COVID-19 cases, affecting individuals with severe and critical symptoms. Significant D-dimer increase is of great significance in the risk assessment of death in critical cases of COVID-19. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent VTE during treatment.",

[3] [4] [5] The range of COVID-19 encompasses asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions featuring respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation, and multi-organ and systemic signs such as sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). 6, 7 These clinical manifestations have been grouped by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention into mild to moderate, severe and critical disease types. 8 Multiple observational studies have revealed that venous thromboembolism (VTE) is very common in COVID-19 patients, even on standard or higher intensity pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis. 9, 10 In addition, elevated D-dimer amounts could predict VTE occurrence in case of no suitable diagnostic testing. 9, 11 However, further investigation is needed to comprehensively assess COVID-19 patients with VTE. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the clinical features, laboratory test results and treatment experiences of COVID-19 patients with VTE, to help further develop preventive and rescue measures for VTE in COVID-19 cases. Our findings provide a reference for improving the treatment of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The high mortality of COVID-19 has attracted worldwide attention. [3] [4] [5] It has been reported that almost all severe and critical cases have coagulation disorders, 16 which eventually activate coagulation cascade reactions and inhibit the fibrinolytic process, further promoting thrombosis. Once VTE occurs, it greatly increases the difficulty of treatment and further elevates the risk of death. 17, 18 A previous study reported that advanced age is a high risk factor for VTE in in-hospital patients. 19 As shown above, VTE occurred in 7 patients, including 5 who were over 60 years old. Among these 7 cases, 3 were over 80 years old (42.86%). As a high risk factor for VTE, advanced age should be paid special attention to in the treatment of severe and critical cases of COVID-19, for 2 main reasons. On the one hand, critical COVID-19 cases are mainly elderly patients. On the other hand, advanced age itself is an independent risk factor for VTE, and many elderly patients have underlying diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which also increase the risk of VTE. 20 However, VTE also occurred in 2 patients with COVID-19 aged 40-60 years. This might be related to the effects of acute inflammatory response on coagulation and fibrinolytic function after acute infection through a variety of pathways, including decreased levels of protein C and antithrombin III, which affect the coagulation system. 21 Therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to VTE occurrence in elderly patients with critical COVID-19 while also preventing and screening VTE in young individuals with critical COVID-19.",
