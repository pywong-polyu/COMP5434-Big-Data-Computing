In this regard, strict lockdown measures were imposed in India on the same date to stop virus spread. Thereafter, various lockdown impacts were observed, and one of the immediate effects was a reduction in air pollution levels across the world and in India as well. In this study, we have observed approximately 40% reduction in air quality index (AQI) during one month of lockdown in India. The detailed investigations were performed for 14 major hotspot places where the COVID-19 cases were >1000 (as of 1 st June 2020) and represents more than 70% associated mortality in India. We assessed the impact of lockdown on different air quality indicators, including ground (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 , and AQI) and tropospheric nitric oxide (NO 2 ) pollutants, through ground monitoring stations and Sentinel-5 satellite datasets respectively. The highest reductions were noticed in NO 2 (-48.68%), PM 2.5 (-34.84%) and PM 10 (-33.89%) air pollutant (unit in \u03bcg/m 3 ) postlockdown. Moreover, tropospheric NO 2 (mol/m 2 ) concentrations were also improved over Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Thane, and Ahmedabad metro cities. We found strong positive correlation of COVID-19 mortality with PM 10 (R 2 = 0.145; r = 0.38) and AQI (R 2 = 0.17; r = 0.412) pollutant indicators that significantly improved next time point. The correlation finding suggests that long-term bad air quality may aggravate the clinical symptoms of the disease.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak started in Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei Province (Raibhandari et al., 2020) , when the first case of coronavirus was reported in December 2019 . The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) gradually spread throughout the world and became a global health issue (Chen et al., 2020a; Gilbert et al., 2020) , and the World Health Organization (WHO) later declared it a pandemic Cucinotta and Vanelli (2020) ). In India, the first SARS-CoV-2 case was reported in Kerala state in Jan 2020 (Gautam and Hens, 2020) and gradually spread in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, and the rest of the states. Later, a countrywide lockdown was declared by the Prime Minister of India on the midnight of March 24th, 2020 that has been extended until April and further extended until June 2020 due to the fear of spreading the virus. By this countrywide lockdown, transportation and industrial activities were almost stopped, and as a beneficial outcome, air pollution levels were drastically reduced in various cities of India (Sharma et al., 2020) as reported by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Different pollution indexes have been adopted throughout the world, including various air pollutants, and in India, the air quality index (AQI) is often adopted to express the magnitude of air pollution (Shenfeld, 1970; Ott and Thorn, 1976; Murena, 2004) . In the initial stage, some significant pollutants were not included, which harms the respiratory system (Radojevic and Hassan, 1999; Qian et al., 2004) . In this context, Indian National Air Quality Standards (INAQS) have included various air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, SO2, NO2, NH3, and CO) to calculate the AQI through more than 200 monitoring stations across India (http://www.cp cb.nic.in).",

In this regard, ground and tropospheric pollutant (PM and NO 2 ) levels were correlated (Qin et al., 2020) . Therefore, people living in polluted regions generally inhale toxic pollutants from the past couple of years and are more prone to toxic pollutants, which makes the immune system weaker (Viehmann et al., 2015; Schraufnagel et al., 2019) . In this study, we targeted only those 14 hotspot regions of India where the COVID-19 cases and mortalities (representing more than 70%) are reported to be high. Accordingly, this research aims to assess the reduction of AQI and different air pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , O 3 , and SO 2 ) at the ground monitoring station and extract the changes in tropospheric NO 2 concentration by employing remote sensing data. Moreover, the study also tried to establish the relationship between air pollutants and COVID-19 mortalities.",

Later, the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation technique was used to obtain the raster values for the maximum area. These AQIs were assessed on 25 th Febraury 2020 (a month before lockdown), 25 th March 2020 (first day of lockdown) and 25 th April 2020 (a month after lockdown) on different dates to monitor the variations. Moreover, detailed investigations were performed using ground and tropospheric pollutant indicators for Ahmedabad, Aurangabad, Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Surat, and Thane cities (Fig. 1 ). The criterion behind selecting these major places is that we have considered only those places where the number of cases was more than 1000 as of 1st June 2020 (Table 1 ). The statistical analysis was performed using the Air Quality Index (AQI), and other pollutants, i.e., PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , SO 2 and O 3 (units in \u03bcg/m 3 ), monthly average data of the mentioned places were procured for pre-lockdown (February 25th, 2020 and March 24th, 2020) and post-lockdown (March 25 th , 2020 and April 24 th , 2020) periods from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) portal (https://cpcb.nic.in/). At the same time, remote sensing data were analyzed using Google Earth Engine that was collected from Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (S5p/TROPOMI) to determine the average monthly spatial variations in tropospheric NO 2 (mol/m 2 ) concentrations and extensively used for air quality applications (Veefkind et al., 2012) . Moreover, linear regression and correlation analyses were performed between different air pollutants and COVID-19 mortalities (as of 1 June 2020) obtained from different portals handled by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (https://www.mohfw.gov.in & https://www.mygov.in/covid-19).

The average AQI before a month of lockdown was 128, which dropped down at 89 (on a very first day of lockdown) and further decreased after a month of lockdown to 72. This continuous reduction in the AQI clearly indicates that the atmospheric pollution of India has greatly improved under the COVID-19 lockdown.",

The highest average reduction was found in NO 2 (-48.68) compared to other pollutants. The similar trends of reductions were also observed in SO 2 (37.76%), PM 2.5 (34.84%), PM 10 (33.89%) and O 3 (9.06%) air pollutant indicators. The results reveal that the NO 2 levels have decreased more in Thane, Mumbai, and Kolkata cities after imposed lockdown with 77%, 74%, and 68%, respectively. These cities are known for heavy traffic loads with a lower density of roads that increase the burden of NO 2 levels. A similar trend of reduction is observed in both particulate matters (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ) with less variation. Remarkable improvements in PM2.5 concentrations were observed at Pune, Thane, and Ahmedabad, which were reduced 63%, 56%, and 43%, respectively; however, they were high before the lockdown period in Jodhpur city. The prominent source of PM 2.5 is organic aerosols and motor vehicle traffic, which are totally anthropogenic induced activities that stopped due to lockdown. PM 10 is highly controlled by construction sites, burning activities, industrial sources, and dust factors that make Delhi, Jodhpur and Mumbai cities more prone to PM 10 air pollutants. However, higher reductions during lockdown were noticed in Pune (59.7%), Thane (58%), and Kolkata (44.3%). The SO 2 pollutants that have shown considerable variation post-lockdown and the reduction have counted high in comparison to the other pollutants. The major reduction is observed in Aurangabad (-89%), and the rest of the cities and the chief reason behind the reduction in SO 2 level is an industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur. The concentration of O 3 shows a negligible increase due to the high insolation between April and August in the Indian subcontinent (Gorai et al., 2017) . The concentration of O 3 increases in Aurangabad (19.2%), Hyderabad (12.29%), Kolkata (12.03%), Chennai (8.87%), and Delhi (6.3%) cities, as they are known for industrial and transport dominated places.",

Mumbai and Delhi are the main COVID-19 hotspots and polluted places in India and across the world. People inhale these toxic pollutants and die in past decades; therefore, determining the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and atmospheric pollution is an important task. In this regard, our linear regression results have shown satisfactory positive relationships with PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and AQI pollutant indicators (Fig. 6a, b and f) . The analysis showed promising associations between COVID-19 deaths and PM 10 (R 2 = 0.145; r = 0.38, p = 0.039), AQI (R 2 = 0.17; r = 0.412, p = 0.21) and PM 2.5 (R 2 = 0.107; r = 0.-32, p = 0.081) air pollutants. The poor/ negative correlations between these variables were found with SO 2 and O 3 air pollutants ( Fig. 6d and e) . The NO 2 pollutant at the ground had an insignificant relationship (Fig. 6c) , whereas high concentrations of tropospheric NO 2 (mol/m 2 ) over the Mumbai, Delhi, Thane and Ahmedabad places (Fig. 5) indicate that it is a contributing factor, as the COVID-19 deaths are greater in these regions compared to the rest of the investigated places. However, we could make this relationship stronger when less vulnerable COVID-19 places would be correlated with good air quality regions.",

Interestingly, the associations with remaining air pollutants are still negligible. A similar attempt was also highlighted by Qin et al. (2020) , who mentioned that people living in regions with poor air quality are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to the long-term inhalation of toxic pollutants. Another study conducted by Cole et al. (2020) examined long-term air pollution exposure in 355 Dutch municipalities and found positive relationship with PM 2.5 , NO 2 and SO 2 pollutants with COVID-19 cases and deaths, where PM 2.5 was highly correlated compare to rest of the pollutants. The other research found that a small increase in long-term exposure to PM 2.5 is not good and their model results revealed that a 1 \u03bcg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 is responsible for 8% increase in the COVID-19 death rate . Therefore, poor air quality generally makes a weaker immune system of the human body (Schraufnagel et al., 2019 ) that may aggravate virus replication and diminish virus clearance by the host.",
