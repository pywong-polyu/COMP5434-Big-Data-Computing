            "text": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1), an endogenous vasoactive peptide, has been found to play an important role in peripheral pain signaling. Acidsensing ion channels (ASICs) are key sensors for extracellular protons and contribute to pain caused by tissue acidosis. It remains unclear whether an interaction exists between ET-1 and ASICs in primary sensory neurons. In this study, we reported that ET-1 enhanced the activity of ASICs in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recording, ASIC currents were evoked by brief local application of pH 6.0 external solution in the presence of TRPV1 channel blocker AMG9810. Pre-application with ET-1 (1\u2212100 nM) dose-dependently increased the proton-evoked ASIC currents with an EC 50 value of 7.42 \u00b1 0.21 nM. Pre-application with ET-1 (30 nM) shifted the concentration-response curve of proton upwards with a maximal current response increase of 61.11% \u00b1 4.33%. We showed that ET-1 enhanced ASIC currents through endothelin-A receptor (ET A R), but not endothelin-B receptor (ET B R) in both DRG neurons and CHO cells co-expressing ASIC3 and ET A R. ET-1 enhancement was inhibited by blockade of G-protein or protein kinase C signaling. In current-clamp recording, pre-application with ET-1 (30 nM) significantly increased acid-evoked firing in rat DRG neurons. Finally, we showed that pharmacological blockade of ASICs by amiloride or APETx2 significantly alleviated ET-1induced flinching and mechanical hyperalgesia in rats. These results suggest that ET-1 sensitizes ASICs in primary sensory neurons via ET A R and PKC signaling pathway, which may contribute to peripheral ET-1-induced nociceptive behavior in rats.",

            "text": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is an endogenous vasoactive peptide. It is derived from endothelial cells and is also produced by other cell types, including inflammatory cells, tumor cells, and neurons [1] [2] [3] [4] . ET-1 exerts its biological effects by binding to two specific G-protein-coupled receptors, endothelin-A receptor (ET A R) and endothelin-B receptor (ET B R) [5, 6] . In the peripheral nervous system, ET A R is expressed in nociceptive primary sensory neurons, including the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, whereas ET B R is mainly found in satellite glial cells [7] . Numerous studies have demonstrated that ET-1 plays an important role in peripheral pain signaling. In humans, exogenous ET-1 causes tactile allodynia and severe pain [8] . In rodents, an intraplantar injection of ET-1 produces mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain-like behaviors [9] [10] [11] [12] . Paw withdrawal thresholds to mechanical stimuli and heat are significantly lower in conditional ET-1 knockout mice [13] . Peripheral ET-1 acts on nociceptors through its cognate receptors, which subsequently modify pain-related ion channels to amplify signal generation [14] . In DRG neurons, ET-1 increases neuronal excitation by hyperpolarizing tetrodotoxinresistant (TTX-R) Na + channels and suppressing the delayed outward rectifier current (I K ) via ET A R [15, 16] . In contrast, ET-1 decreases the excitability of DRG neurons through the activation of ET B R [17] . ET-1 potentiates TRPV1-mediated currents by an ET A R-mediated and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanism in both the expression system and sensory neurons [18, 19] . ET-1induced pain-like behavior is attenuated in TRPV1-deficient mice [20] . TRPV1 also contributes to ET-1-induced thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia [10, 21] . ET-1 sensitizes TRPA1 in primary sensory neurons via an ET A R and protein kinase A (PKA) pathway [22] . TRPA1 is involved in ET-1-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain-like behavior [22, 23] . However, ET-1induced nociceptive responses are not completely inhibited in TRPV1-deficient mice or by TRPV1 and TRPA1 antagonists, suggesting that other mechanisms are also involved.",

Dissociated neurons were placed into a 35-mm Petri dish and were bathed in an external solution containing (mM): NaCl 150, KCl 5, CaCl 2 2.5, MgCl 2 2, HEPES 10, and D-glucose 10, and the pH and osmolarity were adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH and to 330 mOsm/L with sucrose, respectively. Cells were kept for at least 60 min in normal external solution before the start of electrophysiological experiments. The neurons selected for electrophysiological experiments were 15-35 \u03bcm in diameter, which are thought to be nociceptive neurons. Recording pipettes were pulled using a Sutter P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments, CA, USA). The micropipettes were filled with internal solution containing (mM): KCl 140, MgCl 2 2.5, HEPES 10, EGTA 11 and ATP 5; the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH and its osmolarity was adjusted to 310 mOsm/L with sucrose. The resistance of the recording pipette was in the range of 3-6 M\u03a9. To establish a whole-cell configuration, a small patch of membrane underneath the tip of the pipette was aspirated to form a giga seal, and then, negative pressure was applied to rupture it. The series resistance was compensated for by 70%-80%. The capacitance compensation was also adjusted before recording the membrane currents. The membrane voltage was maintained at \u221260 mV in all voltage-clamp experiments. Current-clamp recordings were obtained by switching to currentclamp mode after a stable whole-cell configuration was formed in voltage-clamp mode. Only cells with a stable resting membrane potential (more negative than \u221250 mV) were used in the study. Signals were sampled at 10 to 50 kHz and filtered at 2 to 10 kHz, and the data were stored in a compatible PC computer for offline analysis using pCLAMP 10 acquisition software (Axon Instruments, CA, USA).",

The proton-gated current (I pH6.0 ) could be blocked by 10 \u03bcM amiloride, a broad-spectrum ASIC channel blocker. This current was also blocked by 2 \u03bcM APETx2, an ASIC3 blocker. The proton-gated currents were recorded in the presence of AMG9810 (5 \u03bcM) to block proton-induced TRPV1 activation. Under such conditions, capsaicin (50 nM) failed to evoke any membrane currents. The membrane potential was clamped at -60 mV. b The sequential current traces illustrate that the I pH6.0 amplitude was enhanced by different concentrations of ET-1 in a representative DRG neuron. ET-1 was preapplied to external solution for 2 min. c The graph shows ET-1 concentration-dependently increased the I pH6.0 with an EC 50 of 7.42 \u00b1 0.21 nM. Each point represents the mean \u00b1 S.E.M of 8-10 cells. Fig. 2b shows the effect of ET-1 (30 nM) on the concentration-response curve to protons. First, the pre-application of ET-1 shifted the concentration-response curve to protons upwards, as indicated by an increase of 61.11% \u00b1 4.33% in the maximal current response to protons in the presence of ET-1. Second, neither the Hill coefficient nor slope of the curve was significantly changed by ET-1 (pH: n = 1.89 \u00b1 0.37; ET-1 + pH: n = 1.86 \u00b1 0.42; P > 0.1, Bonferroni's post hoc test). Third, the pH 0.5 (pH for half-maximal activation) values of both curves also showed no significant difference (pH: pH 0.5 = 5.81 \u00b1 0.11; ET-1 + pH: pH 0.5 = 5.94 \u00b1 0.16; P > 0.1, Bonferroni's post hoc test).

The acid-evoked currents were ASIC3 currents, since they were blocked by 2 \u03bcM APETx2, an ASIC3 blocker. Similar to that observed in DRG neurons, the ASIC3 currents were enhanced by the pre-application of ET-1 (30 nM) in CHO cells co-expressing ASIC3 and ET A R (Fig. 4a, b) . The ET-1 potentiation of ASIC3 currents was also inhibited after pharmacological blockade of ET A R by BQ-123 (Fig. 4a, b) .

Rats displayed an obvious flinching response after ET-1 (10 ng/paw) was injected subcutaneously into the ipsilateral hind paw compared with rats receiving vehicle injection only (Fig. 6a) . The ET-1-induced flinching was almost completely blocked by subcutaneous cotreatment with BQ-123 (100 ng/paw), but not with BQ-788 (100 ng/paw). As shown in Fig. 6a , when ASICs blocker amiloride (100 \u00b5M, 50 \u00b5L/paw) or ASIC3 blocker rAPETx2 (10 \u03bcM, 50 \u00b5L/paw) was coadministered subcutaneously with ET-1 (10 ng/paw), it significantly attenuated hind paw flinching (P < 0.05, Bonferroni's post hoc test, compared with ET-1 alone group, n = 7 rats). Rats injected with ET-1 into the hind paw (10 ng/paw) also displayed obvious mechanical hyperalgesia, measured 0.5 and 2.5 h after injection (Fig. 6b, c) . ET-1-induced mechanical hyperalgesia disappeared 24 h after injection. Fig. 6b shows that ET-1-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was partially attenuated by subcutaneous cotreatment with BQ-123 (100 ng/paw) or BQ-788 (100 ng/paw). Furthermore, the intraplantar application of both BQ-123 (100 ng/paw) and BQ-788 (100 ng/paw) together almost completely blocked the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by ET-1 (Fig. 6b) . As shown in Fig. 6c , amiloride (100 \u00b5M, 50 \u00b5L/paw) or APETx2 (10 \u03bcM, 50 \u00b5L/paw) also significantly attenuated the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by ET-1 (P < 0.05 and 0.01, Bonferroni's post hoc test, compared with ET-1 alone group, n = 7 rats). The injection of these antagonists alone at the same dosage used above did not produce any effects on the number of flinches or the PWT (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrated that ASICs mediated, at least partially, ET-1-induced flinching and mechanical hyperalgesia. b ET-1-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was attenuated by BQ-123 or BQ-788 alone and was blocked by the combined application of BQ-123 and BQ-788. c ET-1-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was also attenuated after the pharmacological blockade of ASICs by amiloride or APETx2. Flinching and mechanical hyperalgesia were induced by the injection of ET-1 subcutaneously into the rat plantar hind paw. Spontaneous flinching was evaluated by the time spent licking/lifting the injected paw (in seconds). The paw withdrawal threshold (PWT, in g) of rats was measured by von Frey hair test before injection (0 h) and 0.5, 2.5, 24 h after injection. BQ-123 (100 ng/paw) and/or BQ-788 (100 ng/ paw), amiloride (100 \u00b5M, 50 \u00b5L/paw), or APETx2 (10 \u03bcM, 50 \u00b5L/paw) were co-injected with ET-1 (10 ng/paw) into the hind paw of rats. n = 7 rats in each group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Bonferroni's post hoc test, compared with the ET-1 alone group.",

ET-1 increased ASIC-medicated currents and action potentials in rat primary sensory neurons, which may contribute to ET-1induced spontaneous flinching and mechanical hyperalgesia in rats. Low pH-evoked currents are mediated by proton-gated ion channels, including ASICs and TRPV1 [40] . In the present study, the activation of TRPV1 channels was completely blocked by AMG9810, so capsaicin failed to evoke any membrane currents. We believe that ASICs mediated these low pH-evoked currents, which could be completely blocked by ASIC channel blockers; these evoked currents were, therefore, considered to be ASIC currents, although precise ASIC subunits need to be identified. To date, at least seven ASIC subunits have been identified in mammals. There are six ASIC subunits (ASIC1a and b, ASIC2a and b, ASIC3 , and ASIC4) expressed in both DRG cell bodies and sensory terminals [24, 25] . These ASIC subunits exist as homomeric or heteromeric channels in DRG neurons. The ASIC3 subunit is the most abundant in DRG and has emerged as a critical pH sensor [26, 32] .",

In CHO cells co-expressing ASIC3 and ET A R, ET-1 also sensitized ASIC3 through ET A R. Together, ET A R, but not ET B R, appeared to contribute to the ET-1 potentiation of ASIC currents. The results were consistent with the expression characteristics of ET A R and ET B R in primary sensory neurons. ET A R is present in a subset of small-and medium-sized DRG neurons and their axons, whereas ET B R is mainly expressed by satellite glial cells and nonmyelinating Schwann cells, but not neurons [7] . It has been found that ET A R is mainly expressed in isolectin B4-negative (IB4 \u2212 ) DRG neurons [41] . ASICs are also more prevalent in IB4 \u2212 DRG neurons than in IB4 + neurons [42] . Thus, the ET-1 potentiation of ASICs may mainly occur in peptidergic and IB4 -DRG neurons. ET A R belongs to a subfamily of GPCRs and is coupled to multiple second messenger systems. Although ET A R couples to G s in other tissues, ET-1 does not increase intracellular cAMP levels in isolated DRG neurons [43] . ET A R also couples to G q/11 to activate PLC\u03b2, which, in turn, produces IP 3 and DAG, followed by intracellular Ca 2+ release and the activation of PKC [5, 39, 44] . ET-1 can trigger intracellular calcium mobilization through ET A R in DRG neurons [45] . ET A R, but not ET B R, activates PKC in peptidergic, IB4 \u2212 sensory neurons [41] . In the present study, the lack of ET-1 potentiation in DRG neurons treated with GDP-\u03b2-S or the PKC inhibitor GF109203X indicated that a G-protein-and PKC-dependent pathway was involved in the sensitization of ASICs by ET-1. It has been shown that PKC is involved in the ET-1-mediated enhancement of capsaicin-induced Ca 2+ increases in sensory neurons. ET-1 potentiates TRPV1 currents via the ET A R-mediated activation of PKC in both DRG neurons and the trigeminal ganglion neurons [18, 19] . The stimulation of ET A R by ET-1 inhibits inward rectifier K + channels via the PKC pathway [46] . However, ET-1 sensitizes TRPA1 via the ET A R and PKA pathways in primary sensory neurons [22] . Our previous studies show that ASICs are modulated by intracellular PKC signaling [35, 37] .",

            "text": "Initial studies show that exogenous ET-1 elicits spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia. In the present study, rats displayed flinching responses and mechanical hyperalgesia after ET-1 was injected subcutaneously into the ipsilateral hind paw. ET-1induced flinching was almost completely blocked by subcutaneous cotreatment with BQ-123, but not BQ-788, suggesting this behavior is mediated by ET A R, but not ET B R. A combined intraplantar injection of BQ-123 and BQ-788 completely blocked ET-1-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, suggesting it is mediated by both ET A R and ET B R. Previous studies have shown that a subcutaneous injection of ET-1 into the rat plantar hind paw induces flinching behavior and spike responses in nociceptors through ET A R [9, 47] . It has been shown that ET A R activation contributes to ET-1-induced pain-like behavior and thermal hyperalgesia [9, 10, 48] . In contrast, ET-1-induced mechanical hyperalgesia requires both ET A R and ET B R activation [11, 21, 49] . ET-1 has been implicated in inflammation, so we cannot rule out ET-1-elicited nociceptive behavior that may be due to the induction of inflammatory responses after hind paw injection. However, some studies also show that ET-1 elicits nociceptive behavior due to ET-1's direct action on primary afferents, since this nociceptive behavior is mediated by ET A R located immunocytochemically on primary afferents [7, 9] . In this work, we used cell bodies of DRG neurons as a simple and accessible model to examine the characteristics of the membrane of peripheral terminals. The sensitization of ASICs by ET-1 may also occur in peripheral terminals. The pharmacological blockade of ASICs significantly alleviated ET-1-induced flinching and mechanical hyperalgesia in rats, suggesting that ASICs mediated, at least partially, ET-1-induced nociceptive behavior. It is possible that ET-1 sensitizes ASICs on primary afferents, which underlies ET-1-induced nociceptive behavior.",

            "text": "During tissue damage and inflammation, ET-1 is generated and released in a variety of cells, such as endothelial cells, monocytes and macrophages, which results in an increase of local ET-1 levels [3, 4] . DRG neurons are also an important source of ET-1 [1] . ET-1 can excite these sensory neurons in a paracrine or autocrine manner. ET-1 levels are higher within a cancerous microenvironment, and the administration of an ET A R antagonist alleviates cancer pain [3, 5, 50, 51] . Thus, an endogenous concentration of ET-1 in diseased tissue is required to cause pain. The present tested concentration of ET-1 (30 nM) falls within the endogenous concentration of ET-1 ranges reported [52] . ET-1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of types of pain, such as inflammatory, neuropathic, and tumoral pain [5, 14, 53] . During tissue damage and inflammation, protons are released from damaged cells and the degranulation of mast cells. These released protons result in a drop in the local extracellular pH. For instance, the local extracellular pH drops to approximately 5.4 during acute inflammation, which is low enough to activate ASICs and cause pain [30, 54] . An acidic pH is commonly associated with cancerous microenvironments, contributing to cancer-related pain via the activation of ASICs and TRPV1 [55, 56] . Under inflammatory and cancer states, once both ET-1 and protons are locally released together in diseased tissue, and they activate their cognate receptors expressed in nociceptors to initiate and/or sensitize nociceptive processes. Furthermore, the present study showed that released ET-1 could sensitize ASICs through ET A R. ET-1 and protons may potentially work synergistically to produce more intense pain and mechanical hyperalgesia.",
