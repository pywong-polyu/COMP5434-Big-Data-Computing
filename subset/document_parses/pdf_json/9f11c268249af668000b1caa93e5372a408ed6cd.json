Through author matching we combined datasets, resulting in a list of digitally active scientific authors. Generalised linear modelling identified factors predicting their digital engagement. Findings Globally, 2686 diabetes researchers used Twitter to discuss the management of diabetes mellitus, posting 110,346 diabetes-related tweets. As Twitter followers increased, so did tweet frequency (p < 0.001), retweets (p < 0.001) and replies (p < 0.001) to their content. Publication count (overall/per month) and proportion of first/last authorships were unrelated to tweet frequency and the likelihood of being retweeted or replied to (p > 0.05). Those with the most academic co-authors were significantly less likely to tweet than those with smaller networks (< 50; p = 0.001). Finally, those publishing most frequently on specific themes, including insulin (p = 0.041) and paediatrics (p < 0.001), were significantly more likely to tweet about these themes. Conclusion Academic expertise and seniority cannot be assumed as proxies for digital influence. Those aiming to promote science and obtain digital insights regarding condition management should consider looking beyond well-known 'key opinion leaders' to perhaps lesser known 'digital opinion leaders' with smaller academic networks, who are likely to specialise in the delivery of highly specific content to captive audiences.",

Data were collected using the Brandwatch consumer research platform (Brighton, UK) with direct access to the Twitter application program interface (API). We collected data on all retweets and comments/ replies related to diabetes Twitter content over this period, as proxies for content resonance and engagement, respectively. A combination of generic free-text terms (diabetes, diabetic, blood sugar, hypoglycaemia), in addition to product-specific terms (Novorapid \u00ae , Metformin \u00ae , Sitagliptin \u00ae ) and classspecific terms (sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] inhibitor, thiazolidinediones), were used to identify tweets related to the management of diabetes. In total, three reviewers contributed and cross-checked the search strings used for both the literature review and the Twitter search. A complete list of all terms used for the Twitter search can be found in Box S2 in Online Resource 1. The Twitter search was supplemented by adding all tweets that included hashtags specific to diabetes scientific conferences and symposia. Relevant conferences were identified following a 2-year retrospective analysis where hashtags retrieved from the primary Twitter search were summed by frequency. They were then filtered to include only those mentioned within 50 words of the terms 'symposia', 'congress', 'conference' or 'scientific events'. Following this process, any tweet containing hashtags related to the following diabetes conferences were included: (1) European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD); (2) International Society of Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD); and (3) American Diabetes Association (ADA). Once all tweets regarding diabetes mellitus were obtained, a list of unique identifiers (Twitter handles) was extracted in order to identify all unique contributors of diabetes-related social media content over the study period.",

At this point, we used the Brandwatch API to obtain data regarding the following: (1) total number of diabetes tweets; (2) number of Twitter followers; (3) number of retweets; and (4) number of comments and replies, and Twitter biography. Finally, the textual content of both tweets and scientific publications (titles and abstracts) were segmented using rapid automatic keyword extraction. These corresponded to either clinical, outcomebased or treatment-related areas of interest within diabetes, including insulin, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), self-management of blood glucose (SMBG), and type 1 versus type 2 (diabetes).

The primary outcome and dependent variable was the total number of diabetes mellitus-related original tweets, with secondary outcomes including engagement in diabetes mellitus-related conversations on Twitter (i.e., number of replies) and information propagation (i.e., retweets). Covariates included within the regression model included academic and social indicators. Academic indicators were (1) number of first or last authorships; (2) number of co-authors over the study period; (3) total diabetes-related publications; (4) publications per month; (5) proportion of first/last authorships as a percentage of overall publication count; and (6) publication impact factor. Impact factors are often used within research to denote average annual citations of scientific articles published in given journals, however increasing attention is being paid to ranking the research outputs of individuals, in order to provide estimations of impact or influence, within a given scientific research environment. The impact factor used in this analysis was a weighted sum of all publications since 2010 and therefore reflected the overall research impact of each author. We calculated individual-level impact factors by summing all publications in the period and providing a point for each publication, with first or last authorships receiving additional points. We additionally applied a logarithmic time penalty such that points awarded for publications from 5 years ago were discounted compared with those published 3 years ago, and those discounted from those published today. Totals were calculated for each author and normalised between 0 (lowest collective research output over the past 10 years) to 100 (highest research output).",

Because several prior studies have demonstrated that the gamma family with a log error link is not only robust but also the most applied approach for datasets in which non-negative and skewed data are guaranteed [13, 14] , such as in the case with tweet data, our analysis also assumed a gamma error distribution with log link. Subgroup analyses explored the relationship between scientific and digital content dissemination, and whether those with a prior history of publishing on specific themes, including SMBG, type 1 versus type 2, etc., are also more likely to post digital content on these themes compared with those who do not specialise in publishing research related to these themes. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the study design. In total, 44,135 publications focusing on diabetes mellitus were identified during the study period, authored by 141,032 unique authors globally. Over the same period, data were collected on 20,614,515 diabetes mellitus-related tweets. These constituted 4,869,492 original tweets, 12,347,321 retweets and 3,397,702 replies and comments. Tweets were published by a total of unique authors, consisting of but not limited to diabetologists and endocrinologists, general practitioners, patients, medical organisations and medical journals. Following author matching of tweets and publication data, a total of 2686 unique global HCPs were identified who had published both at least one diabetesrelated scientific manuscript and at least one diabetesrelated tweet during the 2-year study period, details of which are provided in Table 1 .

This study therefore provides previously unreported findings from a novel research methodology, examining the factors predicting digital engagement among those publishing research in the therapeutic area of diabetes. There are also several weaknesses of this study that should be considered. First, while every effort was made to ensure that the majority of digitally active diabetes publishers were included, we cannot guarantee this. We used a data collection period of 2 years. It is plausible that otherwise frequent academic publishers may have experienced a lull or a sabbatical over this period, including parental leave or investment in longer-term research, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which may have temporarily reduced their publication volume and therefore omitted them from the analysis. Similarly, while retweet and comment rates were considered for digital mentions, no metric for the success of, reach, or interest in academic publications was included. Use of Altmetric or similar measures of publication interest may have added to the analysis by providing another dimension to the academic outputs analysed.",

These individuals who are disproportionately more likely to be at an earlier point in their careers and who are yet to be named as co-authors on diabetes-related academic manuscripts may have been missed as a result of the prerequisite to have published at least one scientific manuscript. Another limitation resulting from this is the lack of recognition of a potential confounding variable, digital influence. Social network analysis may have highlighted who was most digitally influential and used this as a variable in predicting Tweet, retweet and comment rates. Further research should aim to determine the role of social influence in digital activity.",

This is particularly likely where patients and/or HCPs used abbreviations or commonly known shorthand for treatments or outcomes under consideration, or in the event of spelling errors.

However, our findings do not agree with this suggestion presented in previous studies. Rather, we learned that all things being equal, not only do the most frequently and influential HCPs use social media less often but when they do they are significantly less likely to have their content shared or interacted with by the diabetes scientific community. The reasons behind this finding may be several. First, the prior studies referred to, although among the most recent examining KOL influence, took place between 2006 and 2012. It is therefore possible that in the time since these publications, scientific communities have improved and matured, and observed that useful scientific information is not solely produced by the most influential and well-published. Second, the lack of engagement with digital content provided by KOLs could be a natural side effect of not wanting to say the 'wrong thing' or provide an opposing opinion to persons of influence. Third, it is likely that given the lower utilisation of digital media by high-publishing HCPs, they have put less effort into cultivating their digital networks. The number of followers a researcher has on Twitter was consistently shown to be predictive of both retweet and comment rates, therefore assisting higher-publishing researchers in growing their digital networks may prove useful in ensuring that their messaging is more widely received.",

Among those earlier in their careers, a lot can be learned from social media and from the views of more experienced researchers, which in essence can create a virtual network resembling a living advertisement board. This engaging medium has enormous potential for establishing relationships and disseminating information among physicians, their colleagues, and patients [19] .

Digital media is therefore likely to continue to increase in popularity and relevance, especially as current medical students and early-career HCPs, who are generally more digitally engaged [10, 21] , continue their careers into more senior and influential roles. As digital becomes more of a mainstay of scientific communication, engaging with and maintaining awareness of the beliefs of these digitally active HCPs may not only provide a significant medical return on investment but also quantify this return with direct linked metrics. This may be of particular value from a future brand planning and lifecycle management perspective, particularly in identifying and communicating practice gaps, which may provide support to convince government health divisions to take action and update clinical practice guidelines.",

Digital involvement in these events not only reduces financial costs for those attending but also increases access for those who are looking after children or family, or in fact from more remote locations, who are equally in need of keeping on top of the most upto-date science. Previous evidence has shown that the use of open online platforms and virtual communities such as Twitter is gaining popularity at health care conferences by allowing attendees to interact with one another and with their greater social networks, facilitating the sharing of information and ideas [7] . The ASCO annual meeting saw an increase in tweets from 10,475 in 2012 to 44,034 in 2014 [8] and 83,078 in 2019 (Twitter data). Our study included tens of thousands of mentions from the ADA and EASD conferences. We found that contrary to 'outside conference', there was no significant difference in digital engagement among researchers of all types. Whereas outside of conferences it was lesser known, and lesser published HCPs who were most likely to be digitally active, during conferences this gap reduced, suggesting that KOLs save their digital media use for these big events but are less likely to engage outside of events. This can be interpreted in one of two ways. First, that medical and commercial teams should acknowledge the different times when HCPs utilise digital media, allowing an evidence-based means of collecting HCP perspectives over time, and second, that industry should consider branching out to lesser-known HCPs for the purposes of symposia and presentations, as they are equally likely as KOLs to promote (and be promoted) at events.",

The findings clearly demonstrate significant digital engagement among publishing diabetes researchers, signifying an opportunity to leverage this communication channel both during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Types of tweets correlated strongly with academic interests, suggesting that segmentation may play a key role in determining who is likely to post and absorb specific 'types' of content. Furthermore, those with the greatest academic expertise (higher publication counts, higher first and last authorships, and larger co-authorship networks) were no more likely to engage with digital content or have their own content shared or commented on than less established researchers. It was these less established researchers who were less well-known in their fields and with fewer publications to their name who were far more likely to be active in sharing valuable scientific content to large Twitter audiences. This makes them 'opinion leaders' even if they would not be thought of as such in a traditional, academic sense. As such, those looking to promote science and monitor or learn from digital scientific content should consider looking beyond the typical 'high-impact' well-known academic experts to perhaps lesser known 'digital opinion leaders' with smaller networks, who are likely to specialise in the delivery of highly specific content to captive audiences.",
