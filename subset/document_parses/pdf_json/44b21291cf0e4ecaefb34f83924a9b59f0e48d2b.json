Methods: An exploratory study was conducted in Poland, Lithuania, Turkey and India using a cross-sectional research design. A total of 1097 respondents took part in the survey. Wellbeing was measured by the World Health Organization (WHO) Well-being Index, stress was evaluated using a psychological stress measure (PSM-9) instrument, burnout was evaluated using the Copenhagen Burnout inventory, and digital competence was measured by the Digital Competency Profiler (DCP).",

Moreover, the analysis on a country level highlighted that with regard to dealing with stress and burnout, the epistemological dimension of digital competence was the most important for Lithuanians and Indians, the informational dimension for Polish students and the social dimension for Turkish students. Conclusion: The findings support the importance of digital competence on perceived stress, burnout and well-being among students studying online during the COVID-19 lockdown and propose deeper research directions on this phenomenon.",

            "text": "In February and March 2020, the introduction of social distancing, closing down of majority of shops, restaurants, gyms, sport facilities, theatres, and limited travel and socializing became key measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The global COVID-19 pandemic affected 1.6 billion students, who at the peak of the crisis, could not study in a traditional way in 2020. [1] [2] [3] Schools and universities moved from physical to online learning. This is described as online education that takes place when a teacher and students are separated by a physical distance, and the Internet is used to connect them. 4 In the majority of cases, this transfer was done without a proper preparation and/or even providing just a limited support for educators and students. 5 The use of digital Learning Management Systems (LMS) has recently turned into a necessity, transforming educational institutions and the habits of educators and students. Students have suddenly had to force themselves to take responsibility for their own learning although they get together with the educators through online platforms. 6 The fear of pandemic and related changes influenced the well-being of students. In a monetary value of the total well-being cost (that is, health-related costs due to economic and social impact on people), the cost of losing well-being and experiencing high stress levels is indicated to be around \u00a343 per adult per day in the UK. 7 Thus, better well-being would decrease government and healthcare expenditure as well as the mortality rate.",

            "text": "The already numerous studies on COVID-19's role on students' well-being and its related issues have been conducted in different countries. Several main streams of studies could be highlighted. Firstly, issues of well-being and factors such as stress, anxiety and depression were explored. These studies revealed COVID-19-induced increased stress, anxiety and depression as well as lower well-being amid pandemic among students in Bangladesh, 8 China, 9, 10 Saudi Arabia, 11 the USA, 12 Turkey, 13 and Vietnam. 14 Secondly, studies related to reasons behind stress could be depicted. Among the main factors, isolation, economic and social changes, career concerns 15 and study challenges could be noted. Chhetri et al 16 found out that studies and the concern about not getting enough qualification during remote education could affect students' chances to find a job after graduation and could be indicated as sources of stress for Indian students. In Turkey, a study conducted by Aslan 15 revealed that students' well-being and stress are influenced by unemployment of a family member, illness and even death of relatives, acting as the main sources of worries. Academic, financial, and social difficulties and lack of interpersonal communication were revealed as the main source of stress in Saudi Arabia. 11 Conflicts at home and with neighbors, difficulties in isolating noise inside or outside one's home, a lack of direct outdoor access, increased alcohol and tobacco consumption and the perceived ineffectiveness of the use of media entertainment were risk factors for high stress in France. 17 Speaking about learning and stress, a failure to adapt to virtual learning assignments, exams, reduced learning time, interpersonal relationships caused stress among students during the COVID-19 lockdown. 14, [16] [17] [18] The third group of research is related to problems faced by students in online learning during the lockdown. The feeling of isolation and a lack of a sense of community are reported as challenges in online learning environments. 19, 20 These issues became even more important at the time of lockdown. Sufficient home resources facilitating online learning or stable Internet connection were highlighted as the main challenges for their online learning in Saudi Arabia. 11 A study conducted in Bangladesh highlighted that only 30% of students from public universities could attend online classes due to poor Internet connectivity and lack of money to buy Internet data in comparison with 76% of students from private universities. 21 However, not just technology problems but abilities to work with them could be highlighted. For example, students' ability to deal with technology was highlighted among other challenges in Saudi Arabia. 11 Moreover, research conducted on a sample of 200 students in Poland showed that students in particular were concerned that online learning would affect class-related issues, such as too much material for self-study, insufficient time to write final papers, or disruption of the course of exams. 5 Another study showed that perceived usefulness, computer self-efficacy and previous experience have a significant positive influence on students' attitude toward e-learning. 22 A study by Mishra et al 23 at a university in India proved that although online learning during the pandemic was a new experience for students and they felt stressed, they appreciated the initiative taken by the university administration regarding online counselling services for their well-being.",

A younger age, a lower educational grade, urban residence, living with family/parents, and having children in the family were found as risk factors for mental problems in Bangladesh. 24 Increased alcohol and tobacco consumption, lack of physical exercise, more Internet browsing time, shifts in eating habits, less exposure to sunlight and dissatisfaction with sleep behavior were also observed during the COVID-19 pandemic 16, 17, 24 and can be reasons for negative psychological effects during the lockdown, such as stress, fear, worries, anxiety and depression, which are also the main threats to well-being. 8, 17, [25] [26] [27] [28] The fifth group of studies is related to burnout. Higher levels of burnout were revealed among students due to self-evaluation, perfectionism, lack of organizational support, lack of academic self-efficacy and lack of teacher support. 18 However, some contradictory results were found. For example, increased burnout and decreased engagement during online learning were identified by Dental Medicine students at Harvard School, 29 but a study by Bolatov et al 30 revealed that burnout, anxiety and depression symptoms decreased when medical students moved from traditional to online learning during the COVID-19 lockdown in Kazakhstan.",

According to Bolivar, 58 the concept of competency is linked to the principle of \"learning to learn\", which is very important in online learning. Moreover, speaking about stress and digital competencies in education, it can be highlighted that these aspects were analyzed more from educators' and not students' perspective. 59 However, it should be borne in mind that if digital technologies are used without attention to human and environmental health, it could become a source of stress and concern among teachers and students alike. 34 Carretero et al 60 note that according to the European Commission, digital competence includes competencies related to the knowledge and the usage of information, communication and collaboration, the creation of digital content, safety and problem-solving. Marza and Cruz 61 highlight digital competence as a useful instrument. It helps students to acquire skills to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and generate innovation while bringing closed attitudes, knowledge and processes related to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Therefore, when students have developed digital competence, they can handle technology-related stress. It relates with the statement by Rodgers et al 62 that technology plays a critical role in managing stress. These issues became essential during the transition to online learning in the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Social competencies could be described as effective digital communication, collaboration and publication. Informational competencies relate to effective information searching, its evaluation and synthesis, and the production of new knowledge, and Epistemological competencies relate to effective data analysis, problem solving and hypothesis development. 64 Song et al 65 note that it is important to minimize technical problems as much as possible from the beginning of the learning experience. According to Alvarez et al, 66 the development of digital competence is very important as they will help to adapt to the impact that technology has and to decrease technology-related stress.

This curfew served as a precursor to the nationwide 21-day lockdown, which was announced at a short notice on 26th March to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. India had approximately 500 confirmed coronavirus cases when the nationwide lockdown was put in place. The lockdown continued in 4 phases until 31st May and then gradual unlocking took place in phases over the following months. The lockdown disrupted the education sector in India by confining about 320 million students at different levels of education to their homes. Within a week upon the enforcement of lockdown, teachers and students transitioned to virtual teaching and learning without proper institutional support in most cases, but relying on their individual ingenuity. The transition was abrupt and without any preparation time since the academic calendar in India runs from May/June and closes by April/May. Formal institutional training and support were made available gradually to educators. While the Governmentinitiated MOOCs platform (Swayam), an educational portal with curriculum-based, interactive e-content and about 32 direct-to-home (D2H) television channels, were already in place, the provision for optional and supplementary online learning was available to a certain extent, but not as a substitute for regular offline classroom-based learning. Live teacher-student interaction in a virtual classroom, hands-on experience on LMS, such as MS-Teams and Google Classroom, and the generation and distribution of e-content became a new experience for most educators. In India, being a large country with a wide economic disparity, inclusive online education was the biggest challenge as students faced varying levels of access and connectivity to the Internet. During the delayed and shortened summer vacation period for students, several formal online training programs were conducted to equip teachers for online teaching. The default offline face-to-face meeting between teachers and students has not been resumed yet, except in certain cases, such as professional education.",

The author revealed that the General Technology Competency and Use (GTCU) framework, authored by Desjardins, 80 is the best and the most representative. The GTCU framework is operationalized using a self-report instrument designed to study the digital abilities of educators and students in higher education. 81 Freely available, the Digital Competency Profiler (DCP) incorporates this instrument. Moreover, the DCP is being adapted for non-Western contexts of use. 79 Therefore, digital competence in this study was measured using the DCP list. The authors took the item list provided by Blayone et al 79 and tested for onlinelearning activity. Competencies were divided into three groups, where students were asked to rate their current readiness to use technology in online distance learning on a five-point Likert scale, where 1 represents 'not ready at all' and 5 represents 'very ready'. In addition, an option \"not applicable\" was added. Social competence was measured using seven statements (for example, \"To communicate with others using text messaging like SMS, Facebook Messenger and so on\"). Informational competence includes six statements (for example, \"To search for online resources and use them in distance learning as PDF, eBooks, audio\"). Epistemological competence has five statements (for example, \"To generate concept maps and mind maps using Cmap, xMind, MindMap, MindMeister, Visio and so on\"). The Cronbach Alpha of subscales ranged between 0.794 and 0.823 and reached 0.888 for the whole scale of digital competence.",

The research conducted for the purpose of this article revealed the existence of a negative correlation between stress and subjective well-being among students (H 1 ) who, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, started remote education in spring 2020. This result is consistent with the findings of related studies carried out by other authors among students in different countries. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] This study also confirmed that stress experienced by students and their burnout during the transition from direct to online learning were positively correlated (H 2 ). Such a correlation also appeared in the studies by Aslan et al, 13 and Abram and Jacobowitz. 18 They found that high stress is the main cause of burnout in the long term. The results of the studies included in this paper also reveal a negative relationship between students' burnout and their subjective well-being (H 3 ) in the process of adaptation to distance learning, hence supporting the findings of Abram and Jacobowitz. 18 Furthermore, in answering the first research question -How did students' digital competence influence their stress, burnout and well-being while studying online during the 2020 lockdown? -some interesting insights could be provided. A negative correlation was found between social and informational dimensions of digital competencies and stress (H 4A ). However, SEM results did not show any significant results, demanding deeper explorations in this field. The correlations revealed in the presented research are in line with the previously conducted study by Alvarez et al, 66 who emphasized that digital competence could lower technology-related stress. Similar results were revealed concerning burnout. Digital competence was negatively correlated with burnout and structural equation modelling confirmed the influence of social dimension of digital competence on burnout, partly confirming H 4B .",

The informational dimension of digital competence had the highest, and the epistemological dimension -the lowest correlations. SEM results confirmed the direct influence of informational dimension of digital competence and the indirect impact of social dimension of digital competence on well-being, mediated by burnout. As just two dimensions had statistical significance, H 4C is also confirmed only partly. Looking at previous studies by Liang and Hsieh, 84 and Thomas and Lankau, 85 it could be stated that supportive communication and socialization decrease burnout and their importance remain not only in physical but also in online communication too, as it was found in this study.",

A comparison analysis of digital competence, well-being, stress and burnout revealed differences among countries covered by this study. Firstly, the authors would like to note that the lowest stress is identified among Lithuanian students, also reflecting the lowest burnout and better wellbeing situation than in case of students from other countries, and the highest stress level was found among the students in Poland and India, also revealing the high level of stress and burnout as well as the lower level of well-being. Such results could be related to the pandemic situation, the nature of lockdown restrictions and Internet infrastructure and penetration in the explored countries. However, this paper is not focused on investigating in this aspect.",

For Indian students, the positive influence of epistemological dimension just on well-being was found. Considering the fact that more respondents from India were postgraduates in the sample, the importance of epistemological dimension of digital competence is higher for them than for undergraduate students and its usage influenced their well-being. This corresponds with the previous study of Aslan et al 13 claiming that undergraduate students felt higher stress than postgraduates. In case of Lithuania, as this was evaluated the worst, students having better epistemological dimension seemed to deal better with stress and burnout and to improve their wellbeing. However, all these insights need deeper analysis.",

Regarding Turkish students, their social dimension of digital competence helped them to deal with burnout, although it was the lowest scored dimension among Turkish students as well as among other countries. Looking at the subsample of Turkey, it should be remembered that the vast majority of respondents were undergraduates and that studies were mostly delivered individually with material shared using e-mail -not through online platforms. However, following the previous study by Aslan et al 13 it can be stated that undergraduate students pointed to the loss of face-to-face contact with friends as one of the main challenges. The ability to communicate using various online tools, social network systems and online collaboration platforms contributed to the lower level of burnout for Turkish students.",
