We describe the novel features of this problem, which are based on the possible (but still unexploited) knowledge on the composition of the disaggregated loads in containers and semitrailers entering the port. In this problem, the transportation requests of these loads are highly customized and have different delivery costs. We must determine the paths of vehicles and loads, which result in costs paid by carriers and customers, as well as external costs for the city itself. The resulting network design problem is faced from the holistic viewpoint of a possible mobility manager, which must minimize the overall system costs. We present a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) for this problem. Since it is very difficult to solve by standard MILP solvers, we present a Tabu Search algorithm exploiting the specific problem features. The computational experiments show to what extent this problem can be tackled by a general purpose mixed-integer programming solver and the Tabu Search algorithm.",

It is a crucial link between suppliers and customers and involves several stakeholders (e.g. carriers, depots, shippers, receivers, etc.). However, freight transportation generates nuisances in urban areas. Freight vehicles compete with vehicles transporting people for the capacities of streets and contribute to congestion and related issues (e.g. emissions, pollution and noise). Clearly, these nuisances impact the lives of people in cities, the productivity of the firms in urban areas, Supported by Fondazione di Sardegna through the project Algorithms for Approximation with Applications. as well as the efficiency of the same freight transportation services. These problems are expected to continue growing, owing to logistics practices based on low inventories and time delivery, particularly in the domain of business-to-customer electronic commerce. Moreover, the problems are amplified by the increasing urbanization: in 2014, 54% of the world population lived in urban areas this percentage is expected to increase up to 66% until 2050 [1] .",

In the second echelon, loads are moved from satellites to their destinations by the smaller vehicles. To our knowledge, a similar distribution scheme was investigated in studies on dry ports, which are facilities directly connected to one or more seaports with highcapacity transport means, where customers can drop and pick up their standardized units as if directly at a seaport [10] . Dry ports can act as special satellites to alleviate congestion in the hinterland of maritime harbours [11] .",

Clearly, this modus operandi is often inefficient, as \"better\" satellites can be selected if one knows the destinations of the loads in containers. For example, a mobility manager could determine the \"average\" destination of the loads in a container and select the closest satellite to this artificial destination. More important, the precise composition of the loads in each container can be derived from data on transportation requests, but it is still almost unexploited for the planning of freight transportation in maritime cities. Nevertheless, the potential of technological developments in data sharing represents viable perspectives to deal with such inefficiencies effectively. This paper investigates the service network design problem for freight transportation in the second echelon of a port city. More precisely, we assume that containers are already assigned to satellites according to predefined (and, possibly, cost-effective) policies and focus on inbound containers filled with loads to be delivered within the city. The objective is to support a mobility manager in the construction of a transportation plan to serve the freight demand by the vehicles of several consolidation-based carriers, while operating at the same time in an efficient and profitable manner. This service network design problem aims to determine the routes of vehicles and the itineraries of each load from the satellite to the final destination.",

First, the problem is mathematically described by a mixed integer programming model (MILP), in which the legs of paths of vehicles and loads are represented by boolean or integer decision variables. They must be determined, such that all customers are served with their loads by the available vehicles and the overall system costs are minimized. These costs are described by a linear function of the decision variables and the objective is to minimize this function. The need to serve customers by the available vehicles is enforced by linear constraints in the decision variables. Therefore, the service network design problem is presented as a constrained optimization problem (or MILP model), which can be solved (i.e. to determine decision variables) by algorithms.",

It is based on a sequence of local changes to the paths of vehicles and loads and adopts specific memories (the so-called Tabu Lists), to avoid solutions already visited during the search. Two variants of Tabu Search are presented: in the first variant, the algorithm visits only the set of feasible solutions (i.e. the set of paths of vehicles and loads that satisfy all the constraints). In order to improve the solutions, we investigate an algorithmic variant in which the temporary visits of infeasible solutions is allowed and penalized to reestablish their feasibility (i.e. the ability to satisfy all the constraints). Some computational experiments are reported, to discuss the effectiveness of the MILP solver and that of the Tabu Search algorithms. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe this service network design problem and illustrate the MILP model for this problem. In Sect. 3 we describe the Tabu Search algorithm.

The most popular ones are based on Local Search (LS) improvement techniques: starting from an initial feasible solution, it is progressively improved by applying a series of local modifications (or moves). At each iteration, LS switches to an improving feasible solution, such that the difference between the previous and the new solution is one move. The LS terminates when it encounters a local optimum with respect to the considered transformations, but this local optimum is often a solution of low or moderate quality. Tabu Search (TS) allows LS methods to overcome local optima: TS continues LS whenever a local optimum is visited by allowing non-improving moves and preventing cycling back to previously visited solutions by memories (or tabu lists), which record the recent history of the search. The basic elements of any LS or TS algorithm are the search space and its neighborhood structure. The search space is the space of all possible solutions that can be visited during the search. The neighborhood of the current solution is the set of solutions obtained by applying a single move to it [15] .",

As for the largest instances, we cannot compute any gap, as no comparison is possible with respect to the MILP solver.

This characteristic allows to evaluate the tradesoffs between the costs of vehicles and those generated by the volumes of the different loads moved by vehicles. The added value of this paper is the explicit consideration of the last costs, which are typically ignored by planning tools based on Vehicle Routing Problems. The information on the flows of each commodity can be adopted by urban mobility managers to support the decision processes on planning or improving facilities, the definition of new transportation services and the allocation of (human and material) resources to tasks [16] .",
