Current evidence indicates that age is far from accurate in identifying the risk of severe illness; furthermore, the count of individual risk factors has limited applicability to population-based \"stratify-and-shield\" strategies. We developed a COVID-19 risk stratification system that allows allocating people into four mutually-exclusive risk categories based on multivariate models for hospital admissions, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU), and mortality among the general population. The model was developed using clinical, hospital, and epidemiological data from the entire population of Catalonia (North-East Spain; 7.5 million people) and validated using an independent dataset of 218,329 individuals with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, who were infected after developing the model. This showed high discrimination capacity, with an area under the curve of the receiving operating characteristics of 0.85 (95% CI 0.85 -0.85) for hospital admissions, 0.86 (0.86 -0.97) for ICU transfers, and 0.96 (0.96 -0.96) for deaths. Our results provide clinicians and policymakers with an evidence-based tool for prioritizing COVID-19 healthcare resources other population groups aside from those with higher exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and frontline workers.",

However, the massive number of doses needed to achieve herd immunity will likely lead to a scarcity of the marketed vaccines. This scenario, which may worsen if long-term immunity is not achieved [1] , will force governments to establish priority criteria for accessing vaccines. This prioritization also applies to other healthcare resources needed for preventive strategies such as screening campaigns, awareness programs, and early administration of specific therapies that are not widely available.",

In the absence of a consensus framework for COVID-19 risk allocation, age at the cutoff of 65 years has been proposed as a criterion for targeting populations for vaccine prioritization [3] . However, evidence indicates that age is far from accurate in identifying the risk of severe illness [4] , and the idea of using age as the sole criterion for prioritization has raised ethical concerns [5] . To date, various risk factors associated with the severe illness have been identified, including clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics [6] [7] [8] . Based on these factors, various prediction models for COVID-19 have been proposed, most of them based on data from cohorts of limited size or aimed at estimating risk in specific populations like hospitalized patients [9] . An exception to this trend is the risk index developed by DeCapprio et al., which used a nationwide approach to develop a numeral index for predicting the risk of complications due to upper respiratory infections among the general population [10] . Alternatively, we propose a model that allows classifying the general population into mutually exclusive risk groups for severe COVID-19. In countries with centralized electronic health records, this model may help policymakers in resource prioritization and planning (e.g., vaccines, diagnostic tests, and hospital and intensive care unit [ICU] beds) and clinicians in making therapeutic decisions.

However, most of these models target individuals admitted to hospital or presenting at general practitioner with symptoms suspicious of COVID-19. Alternatively, we used data from the general population to develop a model that could provide a risk estimate, irrespective of the disease stage. This feature is important for prioritizing interventions and resources for people at risk of more severe outcomes in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following a similar population-based approach, DeCapprio et al. modelled nationwide data to develop an index to predict complications due to upper respiratory infections (as a proxy for vulnerability to COVID-19) among the general population [10] . The model showed a AUROC 0.81, close to that found in our analysis using nationwide data from COVID-19 patients (i.e., 0.85, 0.86, and 0.96 for hospital admission, ICU transfer, and death, respectively). Besides the COVID-19 specificity, our model is novel in providing a stratification system that allows allocating the general population into mutually exclusive risk groups, irrespective of the presence of symptoms. This approach offers policymakers of countries with centralized healthcare databases a helpful tool for prioritizing resources under a \"stratify-and-shield\" strategy. The discrimination capacity of our model when applied to an independent dataset of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients infected after the development period indicates that the model is also suitable for supporting therapeutic decision-making when managing COVID-19 cases.",

In this regard, the inclusion of the comorbidity using other multimorbidity measures might change the performance of the model. Our analysis was strengthened by the consistent performance of the model in two different periods and independent datasets. We deemed the analysis covering the two waves important because the overburdening of the healthcare system and resource shortage experienced during the first wave (i.e., when the model was developed) might act as important confounders. Another strength was the possibility of using data from the entire population. On the other hand, the use of administrative databases of data collected in routine care may limit the inclusion of all variables with potential influence on severe illness or death.
