The research was carried out in an area inhabited by 200,000 people. The amount of waste collected in the communes in yellow containers in 2016-2019 increased systematically in communes: rural by 75.8, urban-rural by 44.9 and urban by 17.8%. The collection efficiency expressed in the degree of collection was the highest and grew fastest in rural areas (from 25.1 to 35.5%). In cities, it practically did not change (14.4-15.8%). The weight of recyclable components represented on average 39.9% of the weight of yellow bag waste. Plastic bottles (PET) packaging prevailed, the share of which changed from 19.6 to 14.8%, including the share of colourless PET decreasing from 7.9 to 5.8%. At present, revenue from the sale of secondary raw materials obtained from waste collected separately to yellow bags covers only 26% of the costs related to the recycling and recovery of waste delivered to the installation. Support for separate collection of plastics through recovery organisations, i.e., entrepreneurs who are obliged to recover and recycle waste, is symbolic.",

The introduced EU environmental regulations are to contribute to reducing the amount of waste generated and increasing the use of recycled materials (Directive EU 2019/904) [4] . These assumptions are implemented, among others, through the Closed-Circuit Economy Strategy (circularity) and the requirements for the so-called extended producer responsibility, according to which all the costs of packaging waste management are borne by companies introducing packaging to the market. Additionally, an important element of regulatory changes introduced by the EU directive (Directive EU 2019/904) [4] concerning single-use plastic products (Single-Use Plastics Directive), the so-called SUP, will be sanctioned in 2021 to ban and limit the use of 10 disposable plastic products that have environmentally safe alternatives (plates and cutlery, beauty sticks, balloon sticks, polystyrene boxes and cups (EPS), products made of oxo-degradable materials). Another requirement introduced by EU regulations (Directive EU 2019/904) [4] will be an increase in the share of recyclates in PET bottles. Ultimately, by 2030, 30% of PET bottles by weight shall originate from reprocessing. Moreover, by 2025 77% of plastic bottles will have to be separately collected, and by 2030 this percentage shall increase to 90%.",

            "text": "Used packaging can only be recycled if an efficient collection system, segregation and quality assurance of the recyclate are ensured. Administrative interference seems necessary in this area, rationalising the design of packaging from the point of view of a circular economy, as well as limiting its nonusual, purely marketing role [5] [6] [7] , whereas a circular economy could be a possible future solution to the global resource security dilemma [8] . Table 1 gives examples of the use of plastics and the possibilities of their recycling or reuse. It should be noted that thermoplastics are used in typical plastic applications such as packaging (Table 1) but also in other applications such as textile fibres and coatings [9] . Reducing, reusing and recycling represents the fundamental message for resource conservation. Recycling means turning an item into raw materials which can be used again, sometimes for a completely new and other product. Reusing refers to using an item as it is without treatment. This reduces pollution and waste, thus making it a more sustainable process. The separate waste collection system has been developed very dynamically in many EU countries since the 1990s [11, 12] , whereas in Poland the process was slow and inefficient. In 2012, about 10% of generated waste was separately collected, and the rate of separate collection of plastics, metals and multimaterial waste per capita did not exceed 5 kg [13] . Numerous studies indicate a high share of pollutants in the waste fractions collected separately, as a result of mistakes made in waste segregation, society's habituation to the system without separate collection and insufficient environmental education [11, 12, [14] [15] [16] . These pollutants hamper treatment processes and reduce the value of the achieved levels of recycling and reuse of waste [17] .",

A focus on separate collection of certain plastic fractions only (such as plastic bottles) allows for high efficiency of sorting plants (fewer fractions). Over the last several years, some countries (Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania) had significantly lower recycling rates accompanied by low landfill taxes.
