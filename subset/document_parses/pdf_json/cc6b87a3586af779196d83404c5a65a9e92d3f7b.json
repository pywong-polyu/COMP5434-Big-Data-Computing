The relationship is also confirmed during stock market crashes. We show that the invariance principle explains a significant fraction of the endogenous variation between market activity variables at the intraday and daily levels. Moreover, our tests strongly reject the mixture of distributions hypotheses that assume linear relationships between log-return variance and transaction intensity variables such as trading volume or the number of transactions. We demonstrate that the increase in the ruble risk transferred by one bet per unit of business time was accompanied by the rise in the average spread cost. Different aggregation schemes are used to mitigate the impact of errors-in-variables effects. Following the predictions of the Information Flow Invariance hypothesis, we also study the relationship between trading activity and the information process approximated by either the flows of news articles or Google relative search volumes of Russian stocks over the 2018-2021 period. The evidence suggests that a sharp increase in the number of retail investors who entered the Moscow Exchange in 2020 entailed a higher synchronization between trading activity and search queries in Google since February 2020, in contrast to the arrival rates of news articles. The changes are driven by the increasing influence of the trading behavior of individual investors using Google Search rather than professional news services as the main source of information.",

In addition, we use the quantitative predictions of the Information Flow Invariance (IFI) hypothesis (Kyle & Obizhaeva, 2017b) to investigate possible differences in relations between trading activity in the Russian stock market and different flows of information used in investors' decision-making processes before and during the Covid-19 crisis.",

In particular, we analyze the plunges in stock prices on March 3, 2014, during the Russian ruble crisis in the middle of December 2014, and during the stock market crash on April 6 and 9, 2018. To the best of our knowledge, the paper also presents the first study of the impact of the increased number of active retail investors in a stock market using the quantitative predictions of microstructure invariance theory about the relationship between information flows and trading flows. The sample period spans from the first week of August 2018 to the last week of June 2021. According to the client statistics provided on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) website, there was a sharp increase in individual investor participation in 2020 (+ almost 5 million retail investors over 2020). Moreover, the total inflow of private investors' funds increased by 301 billion rubles (around 4.2 billion dollars according to the average U.S. dollar/Russian ruble exchange rate in 2020) from January 2020 to December 2020. The use of invarianceimplied methodology leads to new insights about the changes in the relationship between the trading and the information processes during the significant price/volume events in financial markets.",

            "text": "Market Microstructure Invariance hypothesis allows us to look at the Russian stock market from another angle. In this paper, we examine whether there was a changepoint (an abrupt shift) in the dynamics of the estimates characterizing the relationship between public information flows (the number of news articles provided by Thomson Reuters Eikon or Google relative search volumes of Russian stocks) and trading activity. We focus on these two sources of information by making the following assumptions. First, the same business-time clock R governs both Russian retail investors' aggregate behavior and Google search activity of Russian stocks. Second, the professional market participants' aggregate activity and the arrival rate of news articles provided by Thomson Reuters Eikon unfold in the same business-time clock P. Third, the market-wide business-time clock M is a linear combination of two clocks M \u03b1 R \u00b7 R +\u03b1 P \u00b7 P with positive time-varying coefficients \u03b1 R , \u03b1 P : \u03b1 R +\u03b1 P 1 depending on external factors. Intuitively, our conjecture about the possibility of a significant growth of \u03b1 R relative to \u03b1 P is primarily because retail investor participation in the Russian stock market was drastically increased in 2020. Since local individual investors and professional market participants (e.g., institutionals or asset managers) tend to use different sources of financial information, 1 as we have already noticed, we expect that market-wide trading activity started to be more synchronized with Google search activity of Russian stocks. Our regression analysis confirms this finding. We approximate the information flows by the negative binomial process and show that an abrupt shift upwards in the estimates characterizing this relationship occurred in the last week of February 2020, when the Russian stock market faced a huge inflow of private investors' funds.",

            "text": "Since the seminal paper by Bachelier (1900) , the connection between the fluctuations of asset prices and several characteristics of the trading process has been under scrutiny. Bachelier's ideas that the movement of stock prices takes the form of a random walk and price volatility is proportional to the square root of time were the main assumptions in the initial attempts to model price-transaction intensity relations. Osborne (1962) was the first to formulate the hypothesis that the return variance is proportional to trading volume and the number of transactions. Many subsequent studies (e.g., Clark, 1973; Crouch, 1970; Epps & Epps, 1976; Jain & Joh, 1988; Tauchen & Pitts, 1983; Wood et al., 1985) also found positive correlations between trading volume and the absolute value of price changes. 2 One of the main theoretical explanations for this phenomenon was the assumption that price changes are selected from a set of distributions characterized by different variances. This speculation became known as the \"mixture of distributions hypothesis\" (MDH). As a mixing variable, researchers used trading volume V (e.g., Westerfield (1977) ) or the number of transactions N (e.g., An\u00e9 & Geman, 2000; Jones et al., 1994) . In the previously mentioned article by Andersen et al. (2020) , the specifications were referred to as the Mixture-of-Distributions-Hypothesis in Volume (\u03c3 2 \u223c V ) and the Mixture-of-Distributions-Hypothesis in Transactions (\u03c3 2 \u223c N ). Andersen et al. (2020) also first extrapolate the invariance principles to an intraday dimension. The market structure of the Moscow Exchange provides an opportunity to develop the topic introduced in Andersen et al. (2020) by turning to the panel analysis. Like the CME Group Globex platform, the Moscow Exchange is a centralized marketplace. The tick sizes and margin requirements are adjusted by exchange officials promptly, and small lot sizes prevent significant market frictions.",

Second, it is necessary to pay attention to the local maxima of the logarithms of the trading invariant for various stocks, a significant part of which falls on the last five-minute intervals of each calendar hour.

At the same time, we show that the I has not invariant distribution across different stocks. Bucci et al. (2020) got similar results after investigating the ANcerno data on bets. The researchers found only \"weak universality\" when testing the invariance hypothesis. They demonstrated significant variations in the trading invariant I when examining some American stocks and futures contracts. Nonetheless, authors confirmed quantitative predictions about the relationship between trading variables. Figure 11 demonstrates the average spread cost at five-minute frequency. It is defined as the average trade size computed at five-minute frequency averaged across stocks times the bid-ask spread computed at five-minute frequency for every stock and then averaged in the cross-section.

We analyze the relative popularity of search queries only within Russia during the period from the first week of August 2018 to the last week of June 2021. The search query has the following structure: \"Name of a public company\" + \"stocks\" written in Russian. The initial sample consists of only those 32 shares of Russian issuers included in the MOEX Russia Index during this period. We exclude relative search volumes of Aeroflot, MTS, and Magnit stocks since the search queries written in Russian have double meanings in these cases. Besides the meaning \"stocks of the company,\" such queries can also be interpreted as \"the company's special offers\". 11 It is worth noting that Google Trends imposes some limitations on downloading and analyzing data. Firstly, it is impossible to compare search volumes of more than 5 queries simultaneously. Secondly, the algorithm does not show absolute values. Instead, it divides all numbers by the sample maximum, multiplies by 100, and rounds off all of them to the nearest integer between 0 and 100. We implement the following procedure to obtain relative search volumes data. In the first step, we find a benchmark query with the highest maximum search volume at some week among all queries over August 2018-June 2021. In our case, the benchmark query is \"Gazprom stocks\" written in Russian. We next get data on the search volumes of all remaining words relative to the benchmark's highest maximum. Ultimately, all relative search volumes are directly related to the benchmark's maximum, which equals 100. It is worth mentioning that we do not get rid of zero relative search volumes using this algorithm. Kyle and Obizhaeva (2017b) note that both the negative binomial (NB) model and the Poisson model can be used to study the relationship between the information flow and the trading flow. However, unlike the Poisson model, the NB model takes into account possible over-dispersion of the news/queries data. The additional variation caused by many zero relative search volumes is the main reason why the negative binomial model is preferable in our case.",

It should be noted that the original market microstructure hypothesis is formulated for metaorders that are usually divided by traders into many smaller orders to minimize trading costs. However, we found that the invariance principles explain much of the endogenous variation between trading variables over short time intervals. The centralized structure of the Russian stock market made it possible to correctly identify the size of transactions, a key variable in our empirical tests. After applying different techniques to mitigate the impact of errors-in-variables problems and performing several robustness checks, we showed that logreturn variation per transaction is proportional to the \u2212 2 power of the average trade size times the stock price. At the same time, we did not find confirmation of the invariance hypothesis for individual stocks and associate this result with significant noise in the regressors. We demonstrated that the nonlinear ITI relationship holds when considering trading days with maximum market downturns during the period January 2014-July 2018. However, we found that these days were characterized by a statistically significant increase in the trading invariant, the ruble risk transferred by one bet per unit of business time. In our opinion, the major causes were the sharp increase in the level of information asymmetry and the high volatility of securities' fundamentals since the average spread cost was soaring during these crashes. Our study also briefly touched upon the intraday dynamics of the trading invariant. We found a U-shaped pattern and drew attention to the presence of individual peaks of trading intensity at the moments of the last five-minute intervals of each hour. At the same time, we did not find the universal trading invariant for all stocks, one of the major assumptions of the invariance hypothesis. A more detailed study of the key factors of trading activity at highfrequency intervals and the use of more sophisticated econometric methodology for testing the log-linear regression specifications are among the main directions for future work.",

At the same time, to study whether the positive shock to retail investors' demand for equities changed the relationship between the trading and information processes in the Russian stock market, we used another extension of invariance principles: the Information Flow Invariance hypothesis. This invariance-implied methodology allowed us to zoom in on one of the most notable episodes in the Russian stock market over the August 2018-June 2021 period: the considerable increase in individual investor participation since the beginning of 2020. In accordance with our empirical tests, the information flow approximated by the Google search activity of Russian stocks became more synchronized with market trading activity. We showed that a changepoint in the dynamics of estimates characterizing this relationship occurred in the last week of February 2020, when the Russian stock market faced a huge inflow of retail investors' funds. At the same time, we did not find a statistically significant change in the relationship between trading activity and news activity. To summarize, the level of synchronization between those two flows was quite stable through time but lower than the corresponding level in the case of Google search activity. In the future, we would like to examine the alternative sources of public information in the context of the Information Flow Invariance (e.g., tweets, Telegram messages, financial analytics).",

Let large-cap stocks initially give more opportunities for profit than small-cap stocks. As a result, more informed traders start to take long positions in large-cap stocks. Consequently, the expected arrival of bets (the reciprocal of business time) for large-cap stocks rises. Moreover, the distance between trading prices and unobservable fundamental values tend to shrink for such stocks, and traders endogenously adjust their trade sizes to compensate for their trading costs. As a result, the monetary value of the transferred risk per unit of business time remains unchanged in equilibrium.We can turn to an alternative formulation of Eq. (5) if we take the logarithms of both sides of the equation and then take the conditional expectations:Taking into account the presence of an error term, we get the following log-linear relationship between trading variables. Intraday Trading Invariance:where c is a constant and e i\u03c4 are residuals with zero expectation. The inclusion of the stock price level p i\u03c4 is primarily due to the differences in stock prices in the cross-section. 12The mixture-of-distributions-hypothesisAs basic models, we consider the following two log-linear regression specifications. We use the notations and assumptions described earlier in this section.",
