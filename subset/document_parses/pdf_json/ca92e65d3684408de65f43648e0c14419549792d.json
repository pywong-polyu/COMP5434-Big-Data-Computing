            "text": "BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 disease. There are concerns regarding limited testing capacity and the exclusion of cases from unproven screening criteria. Knowing COVID-19 risks can inform testing. This study derived and assessed a model to predict risk of SARS-CoV-2 in community-based people. METHODS: All people presenting to a community-based COVID-19 screening center answered questions regarding symptoms, possible exposure, travel, and occupation. These data were anonymously linked to SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Logistic regression was used to derive a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bootstrap sampling evaluated the model. RESULTS: A total of 9172 consecutive people were studied. Overall infection rate was 6.2% but this varied during the study period. SARS-CoV-2 infection likelihood was primarily influenced by contact with a COVID-19 case, fever symptoms, and recent case detection rates. Internal validation found that the SARS-CoV-2 Risk Prediction Score (SCRiPS) performed well with good discrimination (c-statistic 0.736, 95%CI 0.715-0.757) and very good calibration (integrated calibration index 0.0083, 95%CI 0.0048-0.0131). Focusing testing on people whose expected SARS-CoV-2 risk equaled or exceeded the recent case detection rate would increase the number of identified SARS-CoV-2 cases by 63.1% (95%CI 54.5-72.3). CONCLUSION: The SCRiPS model accurately estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in community-based people undergoing testing. Using SCRiPS can importantly increase SARS-CoV-2 infection identification when testing capacity is limited.",

First, resources to test for SARS-CoV-2 may be limited, 4,5 making the selection of people for testing essential to infection control. 1 In such situations, selectively testing people with higher infection risks will maximize the number of identified cases for a testing capacity. Second, expanding SARS-CoV-2 testing to measure its transmission and current status would benefit from risk stratification to maximize case identification.",

Their model had limited discrimination (c-statistic = 0.65), its calibration was not measured, and no model validation was reported. Meng et al. 7 used 620 cases and controls to generate a model having age, sex, and a panel of 35 laboratory tests to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. They cited excellent discrimination (c-statistic = 0.87) in a validation population of 145 people (having SARS-CoV-2 incidence of 55.2%). However, the model's requirement for laboratory information limits its applicability to community screening since a venipuncture and laboratory processing time would be required (i.e., a 2-phase screening process). Menni et al. 8 derived and validated a model based on the self-reported symptoms and test results of 18,401 people.

Testing screening criteria were based on current Ontario Public Health testing guidelines and were used to increase testing coverage in populations where case identification was a policy priority (i.e., healthcare workers) while avoiding unnecessary testing in the general population who were asymptomatic or whose symptoms could be related to non-COVID-19 disease. Clinic screening questions elicited the presence of symptoms including rhinorrhea; fever symptoms including rigors, chills, perceived fever, or documented fever at home or at the screening clinic; cough; and shortness of breath. People with any of these symptoms underwent testing. Testing also occurred if any infection risk factor was present including close contact with a person with known or presumed COVID-19 disease or recent travel outside of Canada (Appendix A). In the absence of these indications, healthcare workers (or people cohabitating with a healthcare worker) were tested if they had symptoms of sore throat, sputum production, or rhinorrhea. Finally, testing could be approved in the event of extenuating circumstances or if the person was referred to the screening clinic by public health officials for testing. Explicit criteria were not used for each factor; we instead relied upon the clinical judgment of screening personnel.

Tests were classified as positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection if at least one of any of the three \"targets\" were detected. Prior to implementation, the RT-PCR was evaluated by testing 113 clinical samples that were negative for other respiratory viruses. As well, a total of 191 clinical specimens (including 172 negative and 19 positive samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 by our RT-PCR) were tested in parallel by the Public Health Ontario Laboratory (PHOL) using an in-house developed RT-PCR.

We also included an age-fever interaction because inflammatory exuberance decreases as people age 9 and we reasoned that the predictive capacity of these symptoms might change with age. We wanted our model to account for baseline SARS-CoV-2 prevalence since this would importantly influence the likelihood a particular person tests positive.

This makes interceptbased logistic models impractical for predicting infection likelihood when its prevalence varies, as in our study. We therefore did not include an intercept in our logistic model knowing that \"recent case detection rate\" would capture baseline prevalence. This ensured that each person's expected probability of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 could be calculated without needing to specify an intercept. From our final model, we created the SARS-CoV-2 Risk Prediction Score (SCRiPS) by multiplying, for each factor, the value-coefficient product by 10 and rounding to a whole number.

These calculations were repeated using a more conservative threshold of one-half of the recent case detection rate.

This expected probability can be used to importantly increase SARS-CoV-2 infection identification when testing capacity is limited. Accurate case finding is key to resolving the current COVID-19 epidemic. However, significant limitations in testing capability exist in Canada and elsewhere due to a lack of analyzers, swabs, transport media, laboratory reagents, trained staff, or overwhelming demand. Since many healthcare regions could continue to have testing limitation for many months, rationing of some form may be necessary. In such situations, preferentially testing those having the highest infection likelihood will maximize case identification (Table 3) .",

            "text": "We found that the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection in community-based people can be accurately estimated using relatively easily attained information. Expected SARS-CoV-2 infection probabilities have two potential applications. First, they would permit healthcare workers to accurately riskstratify people regarding infection likelihood. This would improve utilization of potentially scarce testing resources. For example, we found that limiting testing to those with an expected infection probability equal to or exceeding the recent case detection rates increased case identification by 63% (Table 3A) . Second, the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 testing is Based on PROBAST criteria, we would rate our model as having a low risk of bias 16 : we used an appropriate and complete patient population; all predictors were available and determined prior to test results; the model outcome was clearly defined and determined independent of all predictors; and our analysis included a reasonable number of participants, handled covariables appropriately, avoided variable selection based on univariable testing, included extensive model assessment measures, and avoided overfitting given our lack of variable selection and large sample size. However, several issues should be kept in mind when the SCRiPS is used. First, our model was derived on a single community-based sample that predominantly met basic COVID-19 screening criteria. Its applicability to other communities and in hospitalized patients or people not meeting the testing criteria used at the screening clinic needs examination. Second, several SCRiPS components were based on historical information and were not explicitly defined a priori or applied by the screening personnel in a standardized fashion. This could have limited the model's performance. Third, the model requires recent case detection rates for SARS-CoV-2. To accurately use SCRiPS, centers will require quick laboratory turn-around times as well as the capacity to analyze these data quickly. Fourth, it is noteworthy that the SCRiPS performed well in a bootstrap sample. Further evaluation of the SCRiPS model in other populations will be needed to truly evaluate its utility. Fifth, we found that healthcare workers were significantly less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 2A , Appendix B). We do not believe that this has any biological basis (i.e., healthcare workers are not less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2). Instead, this likely reflects our screening clinic's more inclusive testing criteria for healthcare workers or they having a lower threshold to seek testing. This highlights that SARS-CoV-2 infection likelihood, and therefore, components of its predictive model can be significantly influenced by testing behavior. Sixth, the SCRiPS model highlights the importance of disease prevalence when estimating infection likelihood (Table 2A) . Inaccurate estimates for this parameter could bias probability estimates from SCRiPS. Seventh, the outcome for our model-i.e., results from a standard test for SARS-CoV-2-is clinically relevant but could have some limitations. While the testing methodology used for our study returned results almost identical to those from reference laboratories, our test might have missed people who were truly infected because viral shedding kinetics varies with disease severity and sampling time from symptom onset. Finally, while the SCRiPS appears to be an effective model, further research will be needed to determine how its utility could be enhanced. This might be achieved by incorporating additional historical data identified by Menni et al. 8 to be strongly associated with infection likelihood including anosmia and anorexia or incorporating symptom duration or severity.",
