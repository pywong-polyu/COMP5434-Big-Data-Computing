Its outcomes reflect the population health, efficacy of the healthcare system and healthproviding behavior during the pandemic. Marked increases in OHCA incidence with worse outcomes during the pandemic have been reported in Greater Paris, New York City and Lombardy (Italy), areas badly afflicted with COVID-19 [7] [8] [9] . In contrast, regions with low prevalence rates of COVID-19 such as Victoria (Australia) and Pennsylvania (USA) did not observe increases in OHCA incidence [10, 11] .

Over 90% of the population resides in high-rise apartments. The COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore is summarized in Figure 1 . It was one of the first few countries to be affected by COVID-19 after China, documenting its first case on 23 January 2020 [15] . Its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition alert was raised to \"orange\", the second highest level, on 7 February 2020 in response to local COVID-19 transmissions [16] . Increasing numbers of new infections from 6 March 2020 onwards necessitated stringent public health measures and travel advisories, culminating in a partial national lockdown termed the \"Circuit Breaker\", enforced from 3 April 2020 to 2 June 2020 [17] . Hospitals temporarily halted noncritical services; other measures included school closures, a mask advisory, safe distancing regulations, and closures of beaches and playgrounds. Outbreaks of COVID-19 in the foreign workers' dormitories started in April 2020, which led to exponential increases in daily new cases and total infections. As of 31 May 2020, there were 34,884 cases with 23 deaths (prevalence rate of 612 per 100,000 population and case fatality rate of 0.07%) [18] .",

A protocol implemented in 2012 saw trained emergency calltakers provide CPR instructions to bystanders. Each OHCA case is attended by an SCDF ambulance comprising a paramedic and two Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), with one as the ambulance driver. Where necessary, motorcycle-based EMTs or firebikers are dispatched ahead of ambulances. Termination of resuscitation (TOR) protocol for OHCA was introduced in January 2019, and a tiered response to OHCA was implemented in April 2019 [19] . As part of the tiered response, additional fire medical vehicles are deployed for enhanced medical support; the presence of additional EMTs allows for high-performance CPR. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SCDF reverted to a single-tiered response to OHCA from 7 February 2020; fast-response bikes and fire appliances stopped being deployed, and high-performance CPR was discontinued. Paramedics and EMTs were required to don full personal protective equipment (PPE) for all cases attended. ",

Bystander CPR is defined as any attempt at chest compressions, with or without ventilation, and is assumed to be absent if not stated. Bystander automated external defibrillator (AED) application is defined as the deployment of public AED, regardless of whether it delivered a shock, and is assumed to be absent if not stated. The total response time (in minutes) is the interval between time of call received by the dispatch center and the time of patient contact by either the ambulance or rapid responder dispatched via the same dispatch center. Pre-hospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) refers to the resumption of perfusing cardiac activity either at the scene or during transport, whether sustained or not.",

Delayed, and often sicker, presentations of acute cardiovascular conditions, such as acute coronary syndromes, have been reported worldwide [3] [4] [5] . It is conceivable that some of these additional OHCA cases were collateral consequences of the pandemic.

Paradoxically, we observed declines in bystander CPR during the same period; this reduction was seen amongst related and nonrelated bystanders, and exclusively in dispatch-assisted CPR. We offer a few possible explanations for these observations: (1) The global focus on COVID-19 may have adversely affected bystanders' willingness to perform CPR, due to fear of aerosol generation from chest compression with potential transmission of COVID-19 from patient to layperson, even without mouth-to-mouth ventilation [25, 26] ; (2) This fear of disease transmission may be more prevalent in bystanders who were not previously trained or confident in performing bystander CPR, explaining the decrease in dispatchassisted CPR; (3) The temporary discontinuation of community first-responder schemes, previously shown to improve community response to OHCA [27] , resulted in a reduction in the pool of trained and willing laypersons for bystander interventions during the study period; and (4) Family members witnessing the arrests may not perform CPR due to other knowledge, cultural and psychological barriers, for example, fear of rib fractures or aggravating their loved ones' condition. Similarly, we saw a decrease in bystander AED application rates, from 11.1% in 2019 to 9.4% in 2020, underscoring the fear of potential transmission of COVID-19 in the community. It is noteworthy that the decrease in bystander CPR and AED application rates during the pandemic occurred against a backdrop of ongoing national efforts to improve community interventions for OHCA, through public education, community CPR+AED training programs, community first-responder schemes and initiatives to improve availability and accessibility to AEDs [28, 29] . These efforts saw improvements in community interventions for OHCA over the years, contributing to better patient outcomes [21, 29] . There may be a risk of the COVID-19 pandemic rolling back these improvements.",

            "text": "We reported worse pre-hospital ROSC rates during the pandemic, a finding which remained significant after accounting for the confounding factors. This finding could be explained by the following: (1) A lower proportion of OHCA patients received bystander interventions, particularly CPR; (2) Changes in EMS workflows during the pandemic, leading to longer response times and discontinuation of high-performance CPR by first responders; and (3) OHCA patients may have been sicker during the pandemic, particularly OHCA related to advanced cardiac injury (delayed presentation of acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure). Our findings of worse outcomes during the pandemic generally corroborated with that from Europe, New York City and Victoria, though the outcomes used in each study varied [7] [8] [9] [10] . The primary outcome in our study, pre-hospital ROSC, accounted for ROSC that was transient or sustained until ED arrival. As such, the rates of survival to hospital admission and subsequent survival to hospital discharge were expected to be lower. Hospital data on COVID-19 status, etiology of arrest and overall outcomes of these patients would have been helpful, but were unavailable for the study.",

The observational nature of the study rendered it susceptible to confounding factors not captured in the data repository. As we collected mainly essential pre-hospital data variables, we lacked information on comorbidities, socioeconomic factors and hospital-based management, and hence those cannot be controlled for. Patient comorbidities and socioeconomic factors have been shown to be important predictors of OHCA survival. Similarly, disparities in post-resuscitation care may explain the changes in outcomes; knowledge of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected post-resuscitation care would have been useful but was not available for this study. Given the time-sensitive nature of this study, we lack data on etiology of arrest and overall outcomes. Collection of hospital data and survival outcomes, which is more time-consuming, is ongoing as part of a planned follow-up study. There were varying amounts of missing data for all OHCA cases, albeit a small proportion (<2%). Finally, as with all epidemiological studies, data integrity, validity, ascertainment bias and misclassifications were potential limitations.",

This translated to one of the lowest case-fatality rates in the world. There were also measures implemented to prevent overwhelming the existing healthcare system during the pandemic-there was a separate call center (operated by the centralized \"993\" dispatch system) with its fleet of ambulances dedicated to ferry non-emergency COVID-19 suspects to hospitals, and purpose-designed community isolation facilities to manage mild cases of COVID-19. However, we still observed disruptions and delays in health-provision for OHCA at the pre-hospital level, in terms of community response as well as EMS systems-of-care, likely contributing to worse outcomes. This disruption in chain-of-survival of OHCA in the pre-hospital setting deserves further attention-public health interventions may be required to rebuild public confidence in responding to OHCA and EMS workflows may need to be re-evaluated.",
