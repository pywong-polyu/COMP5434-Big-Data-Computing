            "text": "Face masks impact social interactions because emotion recognition is difficult due to face occlusion. However, is this enough to conclude that face masks negatively impact social interactions? We investigated the impact of face masks on invariant characteristics (sex, age), trait-like characteristics (trustworthiness, attractiveness, and approachability), and emotional expressions (happiness and excitability). Participants completed an online survey and rated masked and no-masked faces. The same face remained masked or no-masked throughout the survey. Results revealed that, when compared to no-masked faces, masked happy faces appeared less happy. Face masks did not negatively impact the ratings of other characteristics. Participants were better at judging the sex of masked faces. Masked faces also appeared younger, more trustworthy, more attractive, and more approachable. Therefore, face masks did not always result in unfavorable ratings. An additional post hoc modeling revealed that trustworthiness and attractiveness ratings for masked faces predicted the same trait ratings for no-masked faces. However, approachability ratings for no-masked faces predicted the same trait ratings for masked faces. This hinted that information from masked/no-masked faces, such as from the eye and eye region, could aid in the understanding of others during social interaction. Future directions were proposed to expand the research.",

We were interested in invariant characteristics (sex, age) and trait-like characteristics (trustworthiness, attractiveness, approachability) of neutral faces.

Therefore, ratings for masked faces would be less intense than ratings for nomasked faces. For example, we expected that happiness ratings would decrease for masked faces in contrast to no-masked ones. Since excitement is highly similar to happiness (Russell and Bullock, 1985) , face masks would also impede one's ability to infer excitability. Therefore, we expected excitability ratings to decrease for masked faces in comparison to no-masked ones. A lack of differences between masked and no-masked faces meant that the characteristics were not communicated by areas occluded by the face masks. Subsequently, the results would suggest that the non-occluded facial areas, i.e., the eyes and eye region, were involved in conveying these characteristics.",

We examined if the evaluation of trait-like characteristics was dependent on face masks using modeling and model comparisons. First, we derived the optimal (i.e., best) models by fitting invariant characteristics and emotional expression ratings to predict trait-like characteristics. This produced two optimal models, one for masked data and one for no-masked data. Then, we used the optimal model from each trait-like characteristic to predict the alternative data; the optimal model from masked data was fitted onto no-masked data to evaluate fit compatibility, and vice versa. When masked data predicted no-masked data, this indicated that the model components for masked data could be the same ones used for evaluating no-masked data. This would be confirmed if the optimal model for no-masked data also successfully predicted masked data using the same components. Subsequently, we would conclude that face masks did not influence the evaluation of the specific trait-like characteristic.",

            "text": "Face masks occlude a gross part of the face which causes some facial expressions to be misinterpreted (Carbon, 2020) . Such is an argument associating the negative impacts of face masks on social interactions. One method of showing such negative effects occurs when ratings for masked faces demonstrate central tendency or regression to the mean biases. This occurs because participants were unsure of the ratings or could not accurately estimate the characteristics (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974; Klopfer and Madden, 1980; Kulas and Stachowski, 2009 ). Ratings which deviated from a scale's midpoint suggested that participants were certain of their judgments. From this rationale, our data provided some evidence about the negative impacts of face masks on emotion recognition. Specifically, the results replicated the literature showing that happiness was difficult to interpret for masked faces than no-masked faces (Carbon, 2020) . This could be an evidence to argue that face masks negatively impacted social interaction in understanding happiness since the mouth region was a critical facial feature for communicating happiness (Beaudry et al., 2014) . When crucial information from the mouth was blocked by the face masks, the ability to recognize happiness became severely impaired. However, we disagree with such conclusions. While face masks impede emotional expressions, it does not always impact social interactions negatively. Face masks do not necessarily impact social interactions negatively. From our data, participants were better at identifying the sex of masked faces. Masked faces were also younger, more trustworthy, attractive, and approachable. If face masks only impacted social interactions negatively, then participants would experience more difficulty judging the sex. Similarly, masked faces should look older, less trustworthy, less attractive, or even less approachable, since these attributes would become less desirable in social interactions (Rotter, 1971; Perlini et al., 1999) . Suffice to say, the conclusion that face masks negatively impact social interactions due to the impairments in emotional recognition should not be drawn hastily.",

At the individual level, social interaction involves cognitive processes of both the self and the other (Doise et al., 1975) . It also involves some level of awareness about others or their surroundings (Glaser and Strauss, 1964) . Greater awareness often leads to higher acceptance, regardless of whether the awareness is about medical care (Hinton, 1999; Ozdag and Bal, 2001) , consumerism (Gunes and Tekin, 2006) , or interpersonal relationships (Krafft et al., 2017) . Importantly, social interaction is also shaped by situational context (Rogoff and Lave, 1984; De Jaegher et al., 2010) . The increased prevalence of wearing face masks, whether as an official directive, or by observing others with face masks, has likely led to a greater acceptance of face masks. Societal norms could further shape the general acceptance of face masks (Carbon, 2021 ).

However, the presence of face masks could modify the face's trustworthiness. Low-trustworthy faces were rated higher in trustworthiness when the face was covered by face masks as compared to the full face (Marini et al., 2021) . For attractiveness, one study showed that masked faces appeared more attractive and healthier than full faces (Kamatani et al., 2021) . Incidentally, masked faces could be approachable because they appear healthy looking. This could also partly explain why observers maintain close distances with face mask wearers (Cartaud et al., 2020; Calbi et al., 2021) . Eventually, the oddity of wearing face masks decreases and people become more accustomed to them (Carbon, 2021) . As face masks become more prevalent, the acceptance of the masks would increase, and face masks would be rated more favorable in social interactions.",

According to the literature, observers rely on the eyes to correctly recognize facial expressions when the mouth provides unreliable signals. The eyes also enhance the overall perceived happiness and trustworthiness of a face. The exception occurs only when the mouth is more reliable than the eyes in conveying signals about the face (Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00edn et al., 2017) . Our modeling data confirmed such findings (Figures 6-8) . For example, trustworthiness model for masked faces predicted trustworthiness for no-masked faces. Since the difference between masked and no-masked faces was the occlusion, this signified that trustworthiness cues extracted from masked faces remained useful for evaluating trustworthiness in no-masked faces. Our models also exhibited such patterns for attractiveness ratings. Hence, we argued that the eyes and eye regions play an important role in social interaction, regardless of whether the face is fully visible or partially occluded.",

One can also derive subtler characteristics like arousal and trustworthiness from the pupils (Bradshaw, 1967; Bradley et al., 2008; Kret et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018) . The eyebrows, also convey social signals about approachability or threat (Tipples et al., 2002) . Based on these findings, it is imperative that one does not neglect the role of the eyes and eye region in social interactions. Thus, the eyes and eye regions also play important roles in social interactions.",

We speculated that the greater acceptance of face masks could have translated into higher perceived characteristics for faces with face masks. This could be measured in future experiments by showing that higher ratings for the traitlike characteristics occur only for faces occluded by face masks, but not for faces occluded by other apparel. It would also be beneficial for future experiments to directly test if the ratings differed between static images and dynamic videos since social interaction is a complex and dynamic process. This would help generalize the results to realworld scenarios. This study was limited by the unequal gender distribution of the sample. Since Calbi et al. (2021) found that face masks did not influence a female observer's ability to recognize emotions, the observer's age and sex on perceived characteristics of a face should be investigated in future studies. It is also known that the age and sex of a face can influence face perception. For instance, females are better than males at evaluating faces (Herlitz and Lov\u00e9n, 2013) . Observers are also better at recognizing faces with similar age (Mason, 1986) . Female faces are preferred over male faces (Cross and Cross, 1971; Penton-Voak et al., 2004) and the bias occur as early as during infancy (Quinn et al., 2002) . Future studies could investigate the interaction between the impacts of face masks on the age and sex of the face.",
