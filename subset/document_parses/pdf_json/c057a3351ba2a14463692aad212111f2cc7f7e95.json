            "text": "Objectives Diabetic retinopathy screening (DRS) uptake is suboptimal in many countries with limited evidence available on interventions to enhance DRS uptake in primary care. We investigated the feasibility and preliminary effects of an intervention to improve uptake of Ireland's national DRS programme, Diabetic RetinaScreen, among patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Design/setting We conducted a cluster randomised pilot trial, embedded process evaluation and cost analysis in general practice, July 2019 to January 2020. Participants Eight practices participated in the trial. For the process evaluation, surveys were conducted with 25 staff at intervention practices. Interviews were conducted with nine staff at intervention practices, and 10 patients who received the intervention. Interventions The intervention comprised practice reimbursement, an audit of attendance, electronic prompts targeting professionals, General Practice-endorsed patient reminders and a patient information leaflet. Practices were randomly allocated to intervention (n=4) or wait-list control (n=4) (usual care). Outcomes Staff and patient interviews explored their perspectives on the intervention. Patient registration and attendance, including intention to attend, were measured at baseline and 6 months. Microcosting was used to estimate intervention delivery cost. Results The process evaluation identified that enablers of feasibility included practice culture and capacity to protect time, systems to organise care, and staff skills, and workarounds to improve intervention 'fit'. At 6 months, 22/71 (31%) of baseline non-attenders in intervention practices subsequently attended screening compared with 15/87 (17%) in control practices. The total delivery cost across intervention practices (patients=363) was \u20ac2509, averaging \u20ac627 per practice and \u20ac6.91 per audited patient. Continuation criteria supported proceeding to a definitive trial. Conclusions The Improving Diabetes Eye screening Attendance intervention is feasible in primary care; however, consideration should be given to how best to facilitate local tailoring. A definitive trial of clinical and cost-effectiveness is required with preliminary results suggesting a positive effect on uptake. Trial registration number NCT03901898.",

Enablers included a recommendation from friends/family or healthcare professionals. The latter aligns with international research which suggests that a recommendation to attend screening from a primary care healthcare professional may encourage attendance. 4 6 To be most effective 'implementation interventions', methods used to enhance the implementation of clinical interventions like DRS should target multiple levels. 7 Various interventions to improve DRS uptake, involving patient-level components (eg, patient education, reminders) and professional-level components (eg, guidelines or clinician education/training and registration/reminder systems), have been shown to be effective. However, few have focused on primary care and targeted both professionals and patients.

Therefore, a sample of eight practices was selected based on the study resources and to assess feasibility of the intervention and study procedures in different practice types. This decision is in line with the CONSORT 2010 extension for randomised pilot and feasibility trials, whereby rationale for the sample can include assessment of practicalities and estimating rates or rationale based on percentage of number required for future definitive RCT. 21 For example, at least 9% of the sample size of the definitive RCT has been proposed by Cocks and Torgerson 22 based on using an 80% one-sided Confidence Interval (CI). While our sample size was based on resources, according to the Cocks and Torgerson approach, eight practices (16% of the sample size of the definitive RCT) would be considered sufficient.",

Feasibility depended on existing practice systems and workflows (having an existing diabetic register, review and recall system at the practice), a practice culture which facilitated protecting time, and staff skills and confidence. Variation in costs across practices reflected practice structure and personnel involved in intervention delivery. The latter is one area where roll-out costs could be minimised.

Therefore, a tailored intervention according to the type of non-attender (eg, serial non-attender or never attender) might be more appropriate. Within the current trial, never attenders could not be definitively identified; individuals with Do Not Attend letter(s) but no results letter(s) on their file may be never attenders but may also not have had the letter recorded on file. A future trial should consider how to more reliably distinguish between types of non-attender, for example, through verification with RetinaScreen. As RetinaScreen does not provide registration and attendance data at the general practice level and there is an absence of automated data extraction or data linkage with primary care, this would place an additional burden on participating practices. Our findings from patient and staff interviews suggest patients may respond differently to the intervention depending on their current attitude and/or relationship with the healthcare professional who reminds them and/or the skills of that healthcare professional to use the right language or level of detail on risk to suit that patient. As part of the full-scale trial, it would be pertinent to investigate whether patients benefit differently or different patients benefit from the intervention. For example, whether certain characteristics are associated with continued non-attendance after receipt of the reminder, and whether there are differences between serial non-attenders and people who may have just missed one or two appointments. With only a limited number of non-attenders at baseline (n=71), and a lack of information on the pattern of attendance, we could not investigate these aspects in the pilot study. Given the importance of the healthcare professional-patient relationship, as part of a future trial it also might be valuable to examine the effectiveness of different delivery modes and different messengers (eg, nurse vs GP vs administrator).",

While we recorded intention to contact RetinaScreen, this may not lead to actual behaviour. A future full-scale trial should collect data, at a minimum, over a 1-year period (as DRS is required annually or every 2 years for those with no retinopathy in the previous two screenings) and also assess the outcomes of screening (ie, detection of retinopathy). 34 Differences in attendance at 6 months between intervention and control practices could reflect differences in the patient profile. The dietonly group may be less likely to attend general practice as they do not need prescriptions, presenting less opportunity to remind them about DRS. While able to report the intervention delivered, we cannot report definitively who received what intervention; some patients interviewed did not remember receiving the leaflet, therefore while sent, the letter may not have been opened or read. Lastly, the budget impact analysis only considers a once-off cost, not downstream costs or potential cost savings arising from the intervention.",

Though reminders (in general) have been shown to improve uptake of screening programmes, [36] [37] [38] evidence suggests greater efficacy of phone reminders, 39 40 which aligns with staff perceptions in our study that verbal reminders could be more impactful because they are unusual. However, separate calls were time consuming and unsustainable, and some healthcare professionals questioned this approach given the many facets to diabetes care. Interventions to improve diabetes care as a whole have been found to improve DRS uptake. 41 Going forward, staff planned to integrate reminders into routine in person consultations, reflecting how, in order to be sustained, interventions need to fit with the 'bigger picture' of the organisation. Our staff interviews were conducted just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. With increased remote consulting during the pandemic, 42 phone call reminders may now be more feasible. There is growing support (and accompanying research and guidance) on phone consultations as an alternative for face-to-face interactions, with the potential to reduce practice workload, 43 and delays for GP contacts. 44 Given reminders were a feasible way to improve uptake of DRS, although with adaptations, it seems appropriate to test, and provide, a suite of feasible, theory-based, codesigned messages and delivery modes. This would allow local tailoring while incentivising delivery of the core intervention components. During implementation, healthcare professionals judged which patients needed which type of messages. The 'fear appeals' approach is not supported by evidence, and may lead to undesired reactions or defensive responses. 45 Some people may not attend appointments due to anxiety about their condition, and the fear of getting a bad result was a barrier to screening attendance among patients in Ireland. 18 Few studies have investigated the differential impact of reminder systems between population subgroups.",

The IDEAs study was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and all site personnel underwent training in GCP. The protocol and any amendments have been reviewed by ICGP and the Clinical Research Facility-Cork.Provenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.Data availability statement No data are available. Some datasets generated and/ or analysed during the current study (research logs, staff questionnaires, audit data, staff interviews) are not publicly available as the data pertains to the organisation of a small number of general practices in Ireland. Limitations are based on the ethical approval received. Patient interviews are not publicly available, however, consent forms completed by patient participants include a provision to hold their contact details for the option of future contact. Therefore, participants may potentially be contacted to seek additional consent to process their data for a different purpose than originally outlined.
