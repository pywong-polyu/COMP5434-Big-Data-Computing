Thus, it is essential not only to measure outcomes, but also to identify the mechanisms by which they are generated. Using a realist evaluation approach, we aimed to identify the mechanisms generating outcomes in a Danish peer support intervention for socially vulnerable people with type 2diabetes (peers). By investigating the participating peers' interactions, we furthermore examined how their individual contextual factors either facilitated or hindered the mechanisms in operation.",

Independent of these contextual factors, 'experience of social and emotional support' was identified as a mechanism within all peers that increased self-care awareness (defined as output). Dependent on whether the contextual factors facilitated or hindered the mechanisms to generate outcomes, we categorised the peers into those who achieved outcomes and those who did not.",

Methodological guidance on complex interventions emphasises the importance of focusing on what is implemented, including the mechanisms that generate outcomes and the contexts that influence their implementation [23, 24] . Using the realist evaluation (RE) approach developed by Pawson & Tilley [25] , it is possible to identify outcome-generating mechanisms in complex health interventions such as peer support programmes. This can be achieved by investigating how the actors involved interact in the intervention and how contextual factors influence this. The RE's main principle is that all complex interventions have underlying theories, referred to as programme theories that describe the relationship between context, mechanisms and outcomes (CMO-configurations) in the intervention. By developing and empirically testing a programme theory, it is possible to identify the parts of the intervention that has had an effect, in different contextual settings for the targeted populations [25] . Also, the \"Intervention-Context-Actor-Mechanism-Outcome\" (ICAMO) framework [26] is increasingly applied as a supplement [26] [27] [28] . The ICAMO is a modified version of Pawson & Tilley's CMO-configuration, and it includes two extra components into the configuration: \"intervention\" and \"actors\". Thus, using the ICAMO gives an explicit focus on how the actors involved interact in the intervention.",

Moreover, we used Pawson's four layers of contextual factors by Pawson [36] (the individual, interpersonal, organization and infrastructure layers), focusing on the individual layer, to investigate how the peers' sociodemographic characteristics, capacities and life circumstances influenced how they interacted in the intervention. Finally, to define the term 'mechanism', we applied the mechanismframework by Dalkin et al. [37] . The framework is based on the original work of Pawson & Tilley [25] and defines mechanism as \"a combination of resources offered by the social programme under study and stakeholders' reasoning in response\" [37] . Following this framework, a mechanism is both the resource that an intervention provides and the recipients' reasoning and response to it. According to Dalkin et al. [37] , this relationship between intervention resources that are introduced into a specific context enhances changes in the recipients' reasoning that create the mechanisms that cause the outcomes, thereby making the intervention work.",

Furthermore, the use of healthcare services was measured by the number of times (during a 12-month period) the peers' attended diabetes-related appointments with GPs, food therapists and ophthalmologists, or had other form of contact with relevant healthcare services. The survey data were used to inform the qualitative interviews on any improvements in these outcomes. Thus, to analyse and group the outcomegenerating mechanisms emerged from the interviews. Furthermore, the survey data were used to obtain information on the peers' individual contextual factors, such as their sociodemographic characteristics, co-morbidity, A diabetes nurse from CFD conducted the survey as a structured interview, as the peers were considered too vulnerable to complete the survey on their own.

Furthermore, we found that the implementation of a minimum of two of the three intervention activities was needed to activate the outcome-generating mechanisms. As described by Pawson & Tilley, it is often impossible to find a key mechanism that is overarching and enables the outcome. Thus, the interaction of the intervention components, mechanisms and context as a whole facilitated the outcomes [25] . Furthermore, we found four contextual factors in peers' everyday lives that either facilitated or hindered the mechanisms: 'occupation and financial situation', 'health condition', 'energy' and 'other life events'. Not all contextual factors were present in all cases. As argued by Dalkin et al. [37] and Craig et al. [24] , the distinction between context and mechanism can be difficult to make. We experienced this challenge, especially as both our mechanism and context focus were on the peers. For example, 'energy' arose both as a mechanism and contextual factor, as it was a product of a range of different individual contextual factors.",

            "text": "Relating our results to existing literature on peer support for people with T2D is challenging. Many peer support interventions contain other approaches (e.g., groupor telephone-based) targeted to other populations (not socially vulnerable). Moreover, they are delivered by other types of stakeholders (e.g., clinics, churches and community organisations) and providers (peer educators, community health workers and peer-partners) [9, 13, 44] . Furthermore, they are implemented in other national contexts with other welfare systems and thus differ markedly from the Danish context. For example, in the US, most peer support interventions are communitybased and contain diabetes education [45] . Thus, they provide diabetes rehabilitation services similar to those that Danish municipalities are responsible for [46] . Finally, the existing studies on peer support have either focused on measuring the intervention effect (effect evaluation) [13] or fidelity issues in process evaluations [47] . Thus, our focus on the outcome-generating mechanisms and contextual factors influencing this process is novel to this field. However, there seem to be some recurrent characteristics that might be general for the implementation of peer support interventions. A scoping review on community-based peer-led health promotion programmes (not specific to T2D) reported similar findings to this study. For example, peers' health conditions, work situations and beliefs towards the programme according to their needs were found as contextual factors to programme participation and engagement [48] . These contextual factors are also reported in the existing literature on DSM [15, 16, 49] . Likewise, lack of energy [16, 50] and the importance of social and emotional support have been addressed [50, 51] .",

These are findings that would otherwise not be possible to discover through more classic RCT-studies. Second, the use of case studies, which was recommended in the RE approach when analysing complex interventions [43, 52] , allowed us to test our initial ICAMO model and verify whether propositions in the ICAMO could be reproduced in different contexts. Third, it triangulates different data collection sources and both qualitative and quantitative methods, enhancing the credibility of the findings. Furthermore, with our relatively large sample size of nine cases with four different types of informants in each (n = 25), we achieved sufficient information power to test and revise our ICAMO models [53] . Likewise, were the peer supporters, the diabetes nurse, and the project manager able to describe some of the peers' difficulties that the peers could not explain themselves.",

Another context focus (e.g., organisational or interpersonal contextual factors) [36] had provided us with other analytical findings. Third, we only used the ICAMO framework to structure our findings. Thus, we did not apply the realist interview. However, we did not consider this approach relevant, as we had in-depth knowledge from all key stakeholders to understand their perspectives. Furthermore, using the ICAMO framework contributes to the understanding of the interaction between context and mechanisms, and it may be relevant for other researchers to apply this when studying interventions targeting socially vulnerable groups.
