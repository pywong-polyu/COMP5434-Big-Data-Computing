One 11-year-old child stated, \"right now, we have to save the elderly and the people who are already sick and fight through this.\" These are very impressive sentiments from such a young person. Yet, his words also illuminate other aspects of the pandemic narrative that are concerning. First of all, there is the setup of \"us versus them,\" with younger people needing to sacrifice for older people. Second, there is no expression of concern for younger people, front-line workers, or health-care professionals who also experience the threat. Finally, the phrase \"the elderly\" is used to represent the older population. This pandemic is reinforcing one of the most damaging stereotypes: that older people are one monolithic group of vulnerable folks who need protection. Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic will set us back in long-standing efforts to confront ageism and reduce age stereotyping.",

As the most accepted \"ism\" in our society, it is no surprise that ageist attitudes have surfaced from the beginning of the pandemic. It was suggested that the threat of the virus was \"not that great\" because it only killed old people (Barnes, 2020) , that medical resources might need to be diverted to younger people in the face of shortages (Ault, 2020) , and that the targeted lockdown of seniors could help reopen the economy (Acemoglu, Chernozhukov, Werning, & Whinston, 2020) ; also, the hashtags #boomerremover and #grandmakiller appeared in social media.",

The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (S. 443) has bipartisan support and can ensure older workers are protected from subtle and overt forms of discrimination. This bill is intended to reinstate the original intent of The Age Discrimination in Employment Act, such that age could be a contributing factor rather than the primary factor for legislative protection. Similarly, the Fair Employment Protection Act (S. 2019) can help ensure the workplace is safe and fair for individuals of all ages and extends protection from perceived discrimination and harassment. Diversity and inclusion trainings are important to ensure a fair and equitable workplace, but trainings on age diversity are often neglected: only 8% of organizations include \"age\" as a part of their diversity and inclusion strategies (Trawinski, n.d.) . Trainings on age discrimination laws, the age diversity of the workforce, and the strengths that many generations bring to the workplace should be considered. Moreover, workplace flexibility-where, how, and when individuals can work-was a major feature of social distancing within the context of COVID-19. Programs and policies to extend this flexibility could be more widely implemented to include employees of all ages. Low-income older workers and people of color have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, especially because they are more often in positions where they cannot work from home (Taylor, 2020) . Our country's oldest senior employment program-the Senior Community Service Employment Program-provides training and job placements for low-income, unemployed older adults. Now more than ever, we need to extend the reach and impact of this important program.",

Post-pandemic, America will need more volunteers to restore communities' and families' health and well-being. Strengthening the Corporation for National and Community Service is a priority. The federal agency administers two of the oldest programs that engage people of all ages in service to communities across the country, and provide modest stipends to lower-income older persons. Participants in the Senior Companion program assist people in living independently, and those with the Foster Grandparent program work with children that need attention and support. Another federal program, RSVP, seeks to increase older volunteer engagement in local communities through matchmaking and recruitment support. The Serve America Act of 2009 reauthorized and expanded Corporation for National and Community Service programs, including establishing goals to increase older adult participation. For example, 10% of AmeriCorps funding was to go to encore service programs that engage people over the age of 55 and a new educational award, the Silver Scholarship, was established to recognize the contributions of older people. Funding for this decadeold legislation has not been fully achieved (Corporation for National and Community Service, 2016), and the participation of older persons in AmeriCorps had only reached 5.4% in 2017 (Corporation for National and Community Service, 2018b). Not long ago, several philanthropic foundations invested in this arena, and civic engagement was a key theme of the 2005 White House Conference on Aging (O'Neill, 2007) . However, from our perspective, there seems to be a loss of energy around the call for older adults to serve their communities. We need a renewed commitment to national service at this time in our history, with increased attention to the programs that mainstream older volunteers.",

A bundle of policies will likely improve the health and economic well-being of caregivers and their families, while increasing the production of goods and services for the nation through work. Paid family and medical leave is unevenly distributed throughout America, although data suggest it improves the health and well-being of families and has beneficial effects for businesses (Gonzales, Morrow-Howell, & Ho, 2017) . The Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act (or FAMILY Act) would create a national insurance program to provide workers up to 12 weeks of partial income for their own serious health condition or that of an immediate family member and for the birth or adoption of a child (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2020) . The Families First Coronavirus Response Act provided temporary paid leave to employees during the pandemic, and economic and health outcomes of the temporary rule should be studied to inform more permanent implementation. The Schedules that Work Act of 2019 aims to enhance stable, predictable, and flexible scheduling practices. Women, racial and ethnic minorities, and low-wage workers would largely benefit from this bill, as they are disproportionately affected by unstable, unpredictable, and rigid scheduling practices. The Social Security Caregiver Credit Act of 2019 would provide retirement compensation through Social Security credits to individuals who left the workplace to provide caregiving services; this legislation can potentially offset the risk of living in poverty in later life. Finally, consumer-directed care can assist people of all ages with disabilities in living at home with support following COVID-19; through this program, older care recipients can select their care providers and these friends and relatives can be paid (Mahoney, 2020) .",

However, the national response going forward cannot be to segregate the large older population in this country. We cannot base actions on damaging age stereotypes that reduce an extremely heterogeneous group of people into a single bucket: frail older people in need of protection and assistance. COVID-19 has shrouded the experiences of millions of older adults who continue to engage in paid and unpaid work, support their families, and live fulfilling lives. Scientists, policymakers, and journalists must be careful in framing protective measures regarding vulnerable populations. They must be cognizant of the underlying ageist assumptions and aware of the damage caused by exclusion from vital social roles. The diversity of the older population must be considered, and contributions of older adults to the economy, families, and communities must be recognized and supported.",
