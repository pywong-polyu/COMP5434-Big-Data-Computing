Further, lockdown imposed to curb the spread of pandemic has shown to have an adverse effect on economic and health status of an individual. It has also compelled us to switch from the physical world to virtual world, thus depriving us of benefits of person-to-person direct contact. People from developing countries are specially affected. An average person here lacks basic skills needed to survive in the digital world. Due to limited COVID-19 testing capacities in such countries, there is also less testing. Less testing means less contact tracing, underreported cases, and rapid spread of disease. In this paper, the underreported cases of daily infections and daily deaths are predicted using mathematical models. is is based on daily data published by the Government of Nepal. Here, Kathmandu valley is taken as a model area for estimation of underreporting. e behavior of probability of infection, probability of recovery, and probability of deaths is also mathematically analyzed. A time-dependent susceptible infected and recovered model is also proposed. Here, the second wave of COVID-19 is analyzed in detail from 1 Feb 2021 to 1 June 2021. e effect of lockdown on the psychology of people is also modeled with principal components analysis. e inherent and latent factors affecting the people in lockdown are identified. is is based on detailed primary data collected from a survey of 277 households.",

COVID-19 pandemic has put a lot of pressure on public healthcare system of such countries. is healthcare system is already understaffed and underresourced. PCR test is used for detecting COVID-19. It is also called swab test. Nepal has the capacity to conduct PCR tests on 23,000 samples on average daily. But tests are conducted only on 15000 samples on average daily [1] . e government of Nepal has announced free COVID-19 tests and treatment for its citizens. But the services are very fast and efficient in the private sector. PCR test costs around 20 USD in the private sector. is is beyond the reach of an average citizen of such countries. ese tests are sometimes unreliable, as they give negative results during the first time and positive results during the second time. us, less people turn up for testing. is has resulted in less contact tracing and rapid increase in infections. Hence, there are underreported cases of infections and deaths from COVID- 19. In Nepal, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 23 January 2020. It was a 32-year-old man who had recently returned from Huwei, China. e patient recovered and contacts were also asymptomatic [2] . e Government of Nepal enforced a strict lockdown from 24 March 2020. is lockdown was completely relaxed on 19 September 2020. e second wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Nepal was triggered in April 2021. Second wave of COVID-19 epidemic in India was the cause. It was due to Nepalese migrant workers coming back to Nepal.",

Information on the economic, educational, and professional status of these households is provided in Figure 1 to Figure 4 . e interdependence of income group with 31 variables related to food security, economy, and mental health was tested. Chi square test for independence of attributes was applied. e significant results indicating existence of dependence with the income group at 10% level of significance are shown in Table 1 . So out of 31 variables, 14 variables were identified. ese were dependent on the income status of the household. As seen from Table 1 , these are related to food security, economy, and mental health status of the family during COVID-19 lockdown. e descriptive statistics of these variables is given in Table 2.

It accounts for 28.53% of the total variability. e second component has high loadings to limited variety and fewer foods available during this period. is component explains 14% of the total variability. e third component has high factor loading to financial insecurity and decreased income.

A COVID-19 lockdown impact index was calculated on the basis of the first principal component. Its behavior over 277 households is analyzed and displayed here with the help of histogram and boxplot.
