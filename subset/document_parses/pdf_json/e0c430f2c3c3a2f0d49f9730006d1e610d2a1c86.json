The living donor kidney transplants are, instead, performed only by our center, and as of March 9, 2020, we were studying 10 potential donor/recipient couples. The activity of our transplant center of Naples continued during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analysed the number of kidney transplants performed since the beginning of Italian lockdown, on March 9, 2020, till June 9, 2020. Then, we have compared these data with the numbers of procedures carried out in the same three months in the previous two years. Moreover, we have considered the feasibility to execute living donor transplant during a worldwide pandemic, taking into consideration the couples of patients we are following for this procedure.",

The kidneys came from standard donors, deceased for head injury or brain haemorrhage, who underwent nasopharyngeal swab at the time of hospitalization and bronchoalveolar lavage before donation, as established by national directives. The recipients had strictly adhered to the protective measures imposed by the Italian government and received by our hospital and had not had any contact with suspicious people or stayed in high risk areas; but most of all, they did not show any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection and have been screened at the time of hospitalization with a nasopharyngeal swab and serological exams. The patients were 4 males and 1 female, all younger than 60 years old. They have been all fully informed about the benefits and the risks associated with kidney transplantation and about the risks of starting an immunosuppressive treatment during a pandemic. Moreover, they accepted the hazards related to structural changes made to the ward and the operating room usually used for transplantation, due to the COVID-19 emergency. The surgical procedures have been executed without complications, and all the patients have been discharged with a valid kidney function and without suspicious symptoms. The immunosuppressive therapy was our standard treatment and consisted in Basiliximab, at induction and on the 4th postoperative day, corticosteroids in decreasing doses, and Tacrolimus. During the follow-up, the patients are still asymptomatic and have been tested with serological tests that resulted negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",
