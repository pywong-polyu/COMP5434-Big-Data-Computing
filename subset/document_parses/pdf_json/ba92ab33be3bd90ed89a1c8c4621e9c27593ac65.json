A number of studies related SMA are guided by motivation-related theories, such as the uses and gratifications theory and the self-determination theory (13) . Social gratifications (e.g., maintaining relationships, interacting with others, and receiving social support) and sociopsychological needs (e.g., need to belong and need for relatedness) are major types of motivations predicting addictive social media use (14, 15) . Myriad studies have investigated the problematic social media use typically accompanied by a reduction in a size of the individuals' social circle, as well as an increase in loneliness, depression, and fear of missing out (FoMO) (10, (16) (17) (18) . FoMO demonstrates moderate-to-large relations with levels of excessive social media use (19, 20) . Given social media as an inseparable part of university students' daily life, concerns have been raised about its excessive usage globally (21) (22) (23) . Students with SMA are overly concerned about social media driven by a strong motivation to log on to or use social media and devote much time and effort to social media (24) . However, the relationship of FoMO and SMA is still further explored.",

The major motivation of social media use is self-presentation for managing a personal homepage (27, 28) . Self-presentation is defined as the goaldirected activity of controlling information to influence the impressions formed by an audience about the self (29) . Social media activities that accomplish self-presentational goals include posting photographs, profile information, impression management, and self-expression, which are important aspects of relational development in maintaining relationship (27) (28) (29) (30) . Using social media for social interaction seems to have positive effects on an individual's online self-presentation (31, 32) . Whereas, the excessive and inappropriate use of social media for entertainment purpose might decrease willingness to express themselves (32, 33) . The inconsistency of relationship between social media use and self-presentation seems to due to the different purposes of social media usage. Although previous researches have focused on the important role of purposes of social media use on self-presentation, less attention is paid to the association between negative consequences of inappropriate social media use and self-presentation. The aim of the present study is to explore the relationships of FoMO, SMA and selfpresentation on social media and determine the factors affecting SMA in university students.",

The over pattern result confirms the effect of self-presentation and FoMO on SMA. Social media usage is partially motivated by a need for a positive self-presentation (37) . Consistence with previous studies, using social media for social interaction might render individuals to increase willingness to express their personal and intimate information, such as updating self-descriptive profiles, sharing content within the circle of friends, and giving thumbs-ups (31, 32) . Furthermore, selfpresentation on social media showed a positive association with SMA in this study. In addition, information posted on social media, which could be viewed by others, also acted as predictor of SMA. That is, people experience higher levels of positive social feedback, which in turn is reflected in an increase in SMA, a process that is interpretable in light of craving for positive social interactions (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) . Accordingly, selfpresentation on social media could significantly predict SMA in university students. Expression willingness is an interpersonal skill that selects appropriate actions and verbal expressions to communicate one's feelings (40) . In this study, sharing photos or videos with others, and managing a personal homepage predicted expression willingness on social media, which is consist with previous study (27, 28) . However, no purpose for updating social feed maybe reduce individual's expression willingness. QQ and Weibo were the most popular social media platforms among university students in this study. When QQ and Weibo were set privacy protection, the desire for expression and basic information posted on social media were reduced. Privacy control is found to have a negative impact on personal information posted on social media (41) . There is evidence suggesting when communicating anonymously, self-presentation occurs online (42) . That's why when university students accepted a stranger's \"friend request\" and communicated with netizens, they were glad to express on social media in this study. In this study, because of my friends using social media or following others exerted significant influence on personal information posted on social media. Evidence shows that interactivity, privacy control, and trust influence social media users' self-disclosure behavior (43) . Trusting friends' choosing plays an important role on personal information shown on social media. Meanwhile, sharing information acting as self-disclosure goal positively influenced the level of basic information posted on social media, which is line with previous study (44) .",

Next, we found FoMO acted as predictor of SMA and self-presentation on social media. Evidence showed that adolescents with a high level of FoMO would choose to disclose themselves on cyberspace, especially social media to enhance social relationships with other contacts (46) . Meanwhile, a high focus on self-presentation on social media is associated with more mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression (47) . Therefore, subjects with high levels of FoMO tended to display themselves on social media in order to keep in touch with others in this study. SMA motivated by social interaction and communication check their social media accounts and communicate with social media friends in an automatic and impulsive fashion (48, 49) . Thus, FoMO, who are desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing, enhances individuals' state of self-presentation on social media and facilitates SMA.",
