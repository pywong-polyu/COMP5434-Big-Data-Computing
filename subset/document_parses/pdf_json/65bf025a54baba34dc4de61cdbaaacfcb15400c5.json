Shortages in healthcare staff and manpower bring the practical skills of medical students under the spotlight.

This can be achieved by comparing their behavioral dynamics to those of physicians. An online questionnaire was administered between March 20, 2020 and March 27, 2020. The preventive strategies adopted by medical students and physicians at different ages and levels of education were compared by using chi-square test where a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We report that the demonstration of preventive behaviors increased with educational attainment and age. Older age groups avoided crowded areas, wore more masks, used disinfectants and did not touch their faces as compared to the younger participants (p < 0.001). Similarly, postgraduate doctors used more masks and disinfectants as compared to graduate doctors and medical students (p < 0.001).

As a consequence, their risk of acquiring infection remains high. The latest data suggest that healthcare workers comprise nearly a third of all infected cases worldwide. 3 As the number of infected care providers continue to rise, the outbreak is increasingly overwhelming resources. Medical efforts against the coronavirus are further limited by significant hospital staff shortages. 4 To reduce the impact of these shortages, extraordinary measures are being imposed: annual leaves are being cancelled for doctors, junior doctors are managing specialist duties and even medical students are being considered to support response efforts against COVID-19. 5, 6 Desperate circumstances demand desperate measures. In the current pandemic, employing future physicians to support understaffed and overworked healthcare teams seems logical. However, before we consider placing medical students at the forefront of this battlefield, it is important to gauge their preparedness to support response efforts. Many have questioned the benefits of involving medical students with their limited knowledge and clinical exposure. In fact, some argue that their inexperience can turn them into vectors of transmission contributing further to the problem. 7, 8 Recent efforts by medical schools to modify pedagogy have promoted competency-based learning globally. However, medical curricula in most of the developing world still focus on academic knowledge and classroombased didactic teaching. The applicability of evidencebased knowledge is limited. Insufficient emphasis on public health education deprives students of a broad outlook on healthcare systems. 9 Studies suggest that instead of improving, perceptions of medical students about the importance of preventive strategies diminish during their undergraduate years. 10, 11 In the current health crisis, transmission control mainly relies on human behavior. Healthcare professionals are considered role models by their patients. 12 Evidence suggests that lifestyle followed by doctors influences their treatment of the patients. 13 Doctors who adopt and exhibit healthy behaviors provide better advice and motivation to their patients. 14 As prevention is currently our only way to counter disease transmission, the behavior and advice of doctors and medical students treating patients at the hospital will play a fundamental role in control efforts against COVID-19. However, a lack of healthful behavior has been reported widely in medical students worldwide and in Pakistan. 15, 16 These reports are concerning and require prompt action from medical educators. The current crisis has underscored a need for student training in public health like never before. The inability of students to support response efforts against COVID-19 because of their limited knowledge, lack of skill, and deficient preventive health education raises questions about the practical utility of current medical curricula. 17, 18 It is clear that insufficient knowledge affects student behavior negatively. Additionally, the age and maturity of medical students has also shown to affect their competency. 19 Scientists recognize medical students, junior doctors and senior doctors as behaviorally distinct groups based on their knowledge and age. 20 Despite that, there are only a few reports of comparative data on their preventive behavior.

In order to perform their clinical duties, they learn to strategize, plan, and implement solutions. Furthermore, a greater acquaintance with health advocacy and community service in the field makes graduates more conscious of their health and aware of the consequences of nonprevention. 29 To prepare medical students for a frontline role in public health emergencies like COVID-19, there is a need to increase their knowledge and skills. Studies suggest that experiential learning through community involvement can contribute to this, improving health attitudes and behaviors.

Medical educators have emphasized the value of inculcating civic responsibility in medical students through working with communities in real life settings. In Pakistan, the current curriculum does not provide learning opportunities in a real life context. 38 In addition to a formal public health curriculum, early and frequent clinical exposure should start from year one of medical college. Students should have opportunity to shadow general practitioners and volunteer at health camps for underserved populations. Research shows that if lifestyle health priorities are addressed early in medical education, this not only improves the health behavior of medical students, but also strengthens their clinical skills. 17 Beyond the public health academic curriculum, small groups of students should be involved in multiyear community-based projects. This may include health fairs and awareness campaigns for vulnerable communities. These changes are achievable in both developed and developing countries with minimal resource requirements. If adopted, they will provide students with the opportunity to understand the social determinants of health and available resources, as well as the importance of preventive behavior. The inclusion of project-based learning will help students to better understand the importance of preventive behavior, improving their engagement with public health while building their research and analysis skills. 39 The longterm goal of service learning and advocacy training in medical curricula is to develop skilled and committed groups of students who can contribute to their communities whenever the need arises.
