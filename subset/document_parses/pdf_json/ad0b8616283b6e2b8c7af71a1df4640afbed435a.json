The early initiation of TPE for 1-1\u00c15 patient's plasma volume with fresh frozen plasma, or 4-5% albumin or COVID-19 convalescent plasma as replacement fluids before multiorgan failure, has better chances of recovery. The number of procedures can vary from three to nine depending on patient response.",

The disease caused by this virus is collectively termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , and the viral RNA genome has >90% nucleotide identity with pangolin and bat coronaviruses (CoV), but only 50% identity to the common cold CoV [1] . Although it may produce less frequent respiratory symptoms in infected patients, it can also cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure (MOF), significant coagulopathy and substantial mortality [2, 3] .",

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm, a pathological inflammatory response at local and systemic levels following infection, is thought to influence disease severity and mortality [4, 5] . CRS was previously described during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) epidemics, when significantly higher levels of serum cytokines were observed, which correlated with pulmonary pathology [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . During SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar phenomena were observed [12, 13] with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines activating T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 responses [5] . Although cytotoxic T cells generally assist in attenuating viral infections, they also accelerate progression of the systematic inflammatory response in COVID-19 by increasing circulating CD14 + CD16 + monocytes and interleukin (IL)-6 levels [13] .",

            "text": "As per ASFA-2019 guidelines [22] , TPE for patients with infections and MOF due to various causes falls under Category III Grade 2B, meaning that the optimum role of apheresis therapy in treating these patients is not established, and that the current moderate quality of peer-reviewed evidence only supports an overall weak recommendation for this approach. Therefore, using TPE for COVID-19 patients with MOF may also be considered under this category. (2) Indications: Studies of TPE in septic patients with MOF, due to pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, suggested that TPE can help to restore hemodynamic stability [23,24]. It has been applied in a small case series of 3 severe to critically ill COVID-19 patients when they begin to exhibit thrombocytopenia, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase, and an increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, along with deteriorating oxygenation that might require high flow nasal oxygen or mechanical ventilation and/or exhibiting initial signs of shock or MOF [12] . For example, an expert panel from the National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases in China suggests that blood purification therapy, artificial liver support system (ALSS), may be indicated for COVID-19 patients when pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6) are more than 5 [12, 34] . Additional treatment options (e.g. immunoglobulins [35] , corticosteroids [36] , IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab [37] , alpha adrenergic receptor antagonists [38] ) have also been considered with variable success to date. As such, this article focuses mainly on the use of TPE in isolation. (6) Vascular access: Although vascular access for TPE can be peripheral or central, central venous access is preferred, especially for patients with severe disease admitted to an intensive care unit and receiving multiple procedures. Ultrasound-guided insertion, preferably of a double lumen dialysis central venous femoral or jugular catheter, is recommended to reduce the risk of vascular damage and infection risk to medical staff by limiting the number of insertion attempts [34] .",

            "text": "(7) Anticoagulation: Due to its safety and efficacy, Acid Citrate Dextrose formula-A (ACD-A) is the recommended anticoagulant for TPE [39] . Citrate anticoagulation has also been suggested in septic patients with MOF due to its potential immunosuppressive role [40] ; however, it can induce hypocalcaemia, as 1-1\u00c18 mg/kg/min of a citrate infusion reduces ionized calcium by 25-35% [41] . Because infused citrate is mainly metabolized by the liver and kidneys, hypocalcaemia occurs more frequently in patients with liver or renal dysfunction. To prevent severe hypocalcaemia during TPE, oral or intravenous calcium supplementation, or combined citrate-heparin anticoagulation are recommended. Despite undesirable side-effects (e.g. bleeding, thrombocytopenia, osteoporosis), heparin alone may be considered in selected patients with contraindications to citrate infusion, including those with hypoxemia, insufficient tissue perfusion, severe liver or renal dysfunction, or receiving long duration TPE or LDL apheresi s [42] . (8) Replacement Fluid: Due to the haemodynamic fragility of COVID-19 patients, the use of iso-oncotic replacement solutions is recommended (e.g. fresh frozen plasma (FFP), normal saline, or 4-5% albumin; separately or in combination) [43] . Although albumin and saline avoid donor exposure risks, their excessive use can increase risks of bleeding or thrombosis by depleting coagulation proteins [44] . Due to the thrombotic diathesis in COVID-19 [43] , FFP may be preferred as it has been shown to replenish levels of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, and tissue plasminogen inhibitor [44] . When all three types of replacement fluid are used together, it is preferable to end the TPE procedure with FFP to help restore pretreatment levels of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors. Also, COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) as a replacement fluid has been considered for critically ill patients because it can possibly add (neutralizing) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in addition to restore the dysregulated coagulation [45, 46] . (9) Exchange Volume: Exchanging 1-1\u00c15 of the patient's plasma volume is recommended, as~65% of an intravascularly present toxic substance (i.e. an \"ideal solute\") is removed in this way. Plasma volume can be calculated by the patient's total blood volume (TBV) and haematocrit (Hct) using formula: TBV = (~70 ml/kg) 9 (1 -Hct/100) [47] . In one case series of three severe COVID-19 patients, all 3 patients improved in oxygenation, CRP and IL6 levels following a single TPE procedure using 3L of FFP [12] ; however, when FFP is scarce, a minimum of 2L is suggested [34] . [50] . In a pilot study, acute kidney injury and pulmonary embolism occurred in 10% and 20% of critically ill COVID-19 patients, respectively [51] . In addition to pro-inflammatory cytokines, TPE also removes other plasma proteins, such as coagulation factors and immunoglobulins. Although a short course of TPE is unlikely to produce immunodeficiency, there is evidence that TPE might, at least temporarily, negatively affect the adaptive immune system (especially T-cell) homeostasis [50, 52] . Monitoring the patient's haemostasis parameters especially if FFP and/or CCP are not used as replacement fluids can mitigate additional haemorrhagic and thrombotic risks. Finally, TPE influences coagulation parameters in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation; thus, anti-Xa levels may decrease while partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times may increase, which might lead to mild risks of bleeding or thrombosis [53] .",

            "text": "In view of the global increase in the number of critically ill COVID-19 patients, clinicians have tried many experimental therapies. ASFA guidelines suggest TPE as a supportive therapy in patients with sepsis and MOF. Therefore, based on its pathophysiology and disease course, using TPE for COVID-19 patients may be considered; nonetheless, high-level evidence is still needed. Four mechanisms were proposed supporting the role of TPE to help modify the course of COVID-19 and ameliorate endorgan damage. The first is the removal of toxic substances with suppression of CRS [22] ; the second suggests that double filtration TPE removes 60-140 nm viral particles [54] ; the third proposes that TPE can correct the coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients when using FFP as a replacement fluid [55] ; and the fourth hypothesizes that TPE provides factors that stabilize and restore endothelial membranes [1] . The current contribution, based on available peer-reviewed publications, is intended to guide clinicians and transfusion apheresis professionals on using TPE in COVID-19. Because high-level evidence is still lacking, we strongly support monitoring these patients within the context of clinical studies, ideally prospective randomized controlled trials, whenever possible. Suggested initiation and target levels of severity scores and cytokines for these studies are outlined in Table 1 , based on severity criteria for CRS and other previous case reports and case series [56] . Assessing all parameters may not be necessary to start or stop the TPE procedures; single or multiple combinations of these parameters can be used to assess eligibility for TPE and subsequent responses. At this time, we cannot endorse one parameter over another; however, we do encourage using these tools to help identify and report on COVID-19 patients who would benefit most from TPE.",

One critical consideration is the high cost, which limits using TPE as a primary treatment, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), especially when more affordable therapies (e.g. dexamethasone) might be readily available. Another concern is that the efficacy of TPE for CRS is questionable because of the short half-life and rapid activity of cytokines [58] ; thus, therapies blocking cytokine action (e.g. receptor antagonists) might be more effective than intermittent cytokine removal by TPE [59] . A third consideration is decontamination and local restrictions after use of apheresis equipment after apheresis procedures in highly contagious patients. Also, the personal safety of the apheresis operator is of importance [60] .",

However, using FFP alone is also challenging due to its geographically variable risk of transfusion-transmitted infections and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) dependent on the country's TRALI mitigation strategies and a relatively limited, type-specific blood supply, particularly because the pandemic has affected blood centres' collection abilities worldwide [61, 62] . Solvent-detergent-treated plasma or pathogen-inactivated plasma could overcome these challenges, but this method may not be available in all countries. However, using albumin at the beginning of TPE, followed by FFP towards the end of the procedure, can mitigate these issues. The exact volume of FFP to use can be determined based on the patient's coagulation parameters. Although in limited supply, CCP, which contains neutralizing antibodies, can also be used as a replacement fluid, again preferably at the end of procedure, because it can supply both coagulation factors and virus-neutralizing antibodies [63] . Another option is to use albumin and FFP in a 1:1 ratio, substituting CCP towards the end of last TPE procedure, if available.",

Therapy can be initiated, and outcome determined using the critical and target levels of multiple parameters described herein. Because the safety and efficacy of TPE are uncertain in haemodynamically unstable and critically ill COVID-19 patients, the use of this therapy should be considered on an individual basis.

Various healthcare scoring systems (e.g. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE), Age, PaO2/ FIO2, and Plateau Pressure Score (APPS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD), Organ Failure Index (OFI)) were devised to help predict patient outcomes and drive clinical decisions; they have been variably used in assessing COVID-19 patients[30][31][32]. For example, in one study, eight patients with maximum SOFA scores were treated with TPE, and changes in the SOFA score correlated well with CRS patient outcomes, suggesting that changes in SOFA scores, and potentially other scoring systems, could help predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients[33].
