Inequality with respect to access, retention, and success in science arise from overlapping systemic barriers that disadvantage historically underrepresented groups [1] while benefitting the dominant group of white, cisgender, and straight men in science. Barriers for historically underrepresented groups include ongoing racism [2] , sexism [3] , discrimination based on sexual preference or gender identity [4] , ableism [5] , socioeconomic disparity [6] , and exclusionary learning environments [5, 7] . These issues can compound to exacerbate the difficulty historically underrepresented groups face in achieving scientific success. For example, women of color are subjected to increased gender-and race-based harassment in astronomy and planetary science compared to white women, white men, and men of color [8] [9] [10] , and LGBTQ2S + STEM students are negatively impacted by sexist educational environments due to the interconnectivity of sexual orientation and gender stereotypes [11, 12] . Given the persistent and overlapping systemic barriers faced by historically underrepresented groups, there is a clear and urgent need to find solutions that elevate all historically underrepresented groups in science [13] .",

As scientists and science educators, we believe that there are steps we can take to empower historically underrepresented students to succeed and persist in science. We derive these rules from our own lived experiences navigating our science educations as historically underrepresented and early-career scholars, as well as from the large body of science equity literature. The authors of this piece include educators who are BIPOC, queer individuals, women and nonbinary individuals, first-generation immigrants, and individuals with mental illness. Although all of the authors are currently studying as graduate and postdoctoral scholars at North American institutions, many were raised and educated around the world, including in the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, and Lebanon. Our collective teaching experience includes creating and delivering undergraduate and graduate courses at universities, supervising undergraduate research students, teaching at the elementary and a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 high school level, and creating or working for private and nonprofit outreach programs, including those that specifically target historically underrepresented students [14] .",

This piece is directed at those who teach at universities and community colleges, museums, and other science-based organizations, as well as scientists who mentor students through research (e.g., as supervisors) and science outreach programs. Broadly, these rules can apply to postsecondary students attending universities and community colleges (e.g., through teaching courses), graduate students (e.g., through supervisory roles), as well as primary and secondary students (e.g., through science outreach). Ultimately, as scientists and educators, leveraging our positions of power to reduce the barriers faced by underrepresented students will not only enhance access and equity for our students but will benefit science and broader society as a whole [15, 16] . We note that historically underrepresented scholars have often led the charge and faced further marginalization for their commitment to equitable education [17], so it is especially critical that scientists and educators from dominant groups commit to elevating underrepresented students in science.",

Empathy, at least in this pedagogical sense, describes the ways in which we seek to understand and extend compassion toward these unique realities of our students [18] . Empathetic teaching approaches are especially beneficial for students from marginalized backgrounds, whose experiences may have included numerous social, cultural, and political barriers [19, 20] . For example, mentors who seek to eliminate homophobic stigma by championing the use of affirming language and promoting safe spaces in their classrooms improve the experience of LGBTQ2S+ students [21] . Similarly, educators who develop learning environments based on cultural responsiveness and understanding (e.g., sensitivity toward particular cultural issues or barriers students may face) improve black students' feelings of agency in the classroom [22] . We suggest empathy not only as a first rule, but one that should be practiced continuously, and integrated with other strategies discussed herein.",

We must invite dialogues with our students that facilitate the sharing of their experiences and make an intentional effort to understand their perspectives [23] . In practice, we could accomplish this simply through opening the floor during the first few minutes of class to allow students to discuss ideas, events, or personal stories that are on their minds [22] . This form of culturally responsive teaching may prove particularly useful during urgent local or global events that directly affect students (e.g., Black Lives Matter movements or the COVID-19 pandemic). In addition to addressing our students empathetically in groups, we should also be willing to resign traditional methods in favor of individual approaches that improve individual outcomes. For instance, headphones may be discouraged in the classroom as a general rule, but a student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may significantly benefit from playing white noise in the background [24] . Rather than telling the student what they shouldAU : PleasenotethatasperPLOSstyle; italicsshouldnotbeusedforemphasis:Hence; pleaseadviseif sh do (\"remove the headphones\"), we should seek to understand the individual student's needs (\"headphones help me focus\"). It is also important to note that demonstrating empathy in the classroom is an ongoing process that also involves cycles of feedback from students [25], which we should invite continuously and informally throughout the term [26] . As we continue to expand our knowledge of marginalized students' perspectives, we must be willing to renegotiate our own approaches and behaviors to prioritize kindness. Ultimately, this may mean that we, as educators, must challenge existing pedagogical frameworks that systematize the learning process to the detriment of equity.",

In particular, we can impart historically underrepresented students with freedom to choose what and who to study, allowing them to navigate science based on their varying cultural and philosophical foundations, which are often neglected in scientific pedagogy [7, 17] . For example, under a traditional teacher-centered learning approach, we might ask students to submit an assignment on an influential scientist such as Charles Darwin, whose identity aligns with the experiences of majority groups. Whereas, under SCL, we would give each student the autonomy to choose scientists whose identities may better align with their own. As educators, we can further suggest diverse scholars to aid students in accessing important marginalized voices. In this scenario, an Indigenous student may instead choose Robin Wall Kimmerer, an Indigenous botanist who blends Western and traditional ecological knowledge to understand plants and the environment. More broadly, having autonomy over what and who to study can lead to increased creativity and learning outcomes for all students [29, 30] .",

Although active learning pedagogy increases learning and performance of all students [31], it disproportionately benefits historically underrepresented students in particular [32-34]. Active learning strategies are linked to increased GPAs of historically underrepresented students in science, which, in turn, lead to higher retention rates [35] . This reduction in the achievement gap may occur because frequent low-risk assessments (in lieu of a few high-risk assessments) can prevent underrepresented students from entering the \"danger zone\" (i.e., a low course grade), which can otherwise lead to dropping out of science courses and programs [35, 36] . Active learning strategies are also more conducive to high-quality, inclusive, and individualized learning environments that can benefit underrepresented students, who may otherwise struggle under more traditional passive learning settings [35] . We note that if student pairs or groups are created to facilitate active learning, they should be created conscientiously to prevent microaggressions (e.g., through letting students suggest peers to work with or balancing groups by historically underrepresented composition [37]).",

To start, we should begin introductions to our educational programs by clearly stating that students have a right to assert their needs and receive support, whether to us personally or to the institution, and by emphasizing the institutional supports that are available. Implementing this first step may be especially useful for historically underrepresented students, who can face systemic barriers that discourage them from self-advocating. We should facilitate student self-advocacy by providing venues through which students can seek support, such as an anonymous online question box [50] , or through making space for one-on-one discussions (e.g., office hours). When students self-advocate or provide feedback to us, we must make an effort to respond positively and with humility, making appropriate changes to the language or approaches we use in learning spaces. Positively incentivizing students to self-advocate could involve commending the student for speaking up and making a deliberate effort to empathetically listen to the student's concern. Continuing to follow through with the student is also critical. For example, if a student expresses concern over their ability to attend class in person, an educator could make materials available online, rather than punishing the student for attendance [51] .",

Educators can help reduce these negative pressures by hosting diverse guest speakers and hiring diverse teaching assistants and workshop leaders. In addition to delivering educational material from unique perspectives, these guests can also share personal stories about their backgrounds, career trajectories, and some of the barriers and challenges they face. When students find a common ground with their teachers and mentors (e.g., similar demographic characteristics), they feel more cared for and become more motivated to learn [58] . Small changes like these ultimately provide an environment in which historically underrepresented students see tangible evidence of what success can look like for them and become more inspired to undertake leadership roles in the future. Ultimately, academic institutions should ensure that underrepresented scholars are well represented across leadership positions. If, as educators, we rely on equitable representation through other means (e.g., guest lectures), we should be conscientious that underrepresented scholars are often inundated with such request and ensure that their time is valued and rewarded if they decide to take on these roles.",

Here, taking multiple approaches to explain a concept would greatly improve knowledge transfer. Additionally, having multiple scientific perspectives reduces biases [60] . For example, people in inland North America might generally feel that they are not directly or strongly impacted by climate change, and, as a result, subconsciously underestimate climate change effects on coastal communities and other heavily impacted groups. By being exposed to varied experiences and scientific perspectives through diverse speakers, books, documentaries, and other mediums, students and educators alike can develop a better understanding of climate change impacts and a deeper appreciation of how science relates to all people and cultures.",

More generally, to increase financial accessibility, we should prioritize open-source software and texts and inexpensive materials in lieu of highcost lessons when possible. For example, educators can support an open science concept, such as Wikipedia editing, or a group domain, as a way to have students work together to contribute to and reframe knowledge. We can also encourage our students to work together in ways that share limited materials, thus reducing the financial burden on individuals (e.g., organize a carpool program to a rural field site). If specific materials are needed, we should make them freely available to students in a discreet way, use resources as a class (e.g., visit the computer lab during class or tutorial time), or petition our institution to provide the required materials to make our classes more accessible. More broadly, we can advertise available funding opportunities to our students, particularly scholarships with diversity components (i.e., targeted funding for low-income and other historically underrepresented groups).

One concrete idea is to include questions about preferences, access, and accommodations in a survey given to students prior to the beginning of the term. It is also essential to make reasonable adjustments when necessary, which may require flexibility in our teaching approach and assessment [74, 76] . Ultimately, educators should have a working knowledge of legal requirements for SwD at both institutional and federal levels [77] . When well informed, we can better accommodate and advocate for SwD, as well as develop best practices that go beyond legal requirements in regions where those are low or absent. Importantly, we should remain compassionate and show a positive attitude toward SwD, as instructor attitudes toward SwD can play an essential role in their academic success [74] .",

Educators should also encourage historically undergraduate students to pursue available research opportunities available at their institutions (e.g., honors thesis, summer research internships), facilitating their participation in science research, networking, and career development. Importantly, providing information on how to approach professors and apply for funded research opportunities may go a long way for students who are not familiar with the process. Historically underrepresented students may also significantly benefit from learning resources, such as writing centers, writing workshops, and libraries; we should aim to connect students with these tools as early as possible. Other co-curricular opportunities frequently offered by institutions should be widely publicized to students, including career panels or lectures, networking opportunities with visiting or institutional researchers, and seminars. Lastly, equity resources are particularly important to historically underrepresented students, including diversity-focused events and organizations. Equity resources can assist students in developing networks of peers and mentors who are also from historically underrepresented groups, increasing their feelings of belonging and success in science [45, 82] . We encourage educators to keep track of these resources and advertise them in the class syllabus through class announcements or other means of communication (e.g., newsletters) to promote their uptake and, ultimately, the success of historically underrepresented students [6, 82] .",

            "text": "To that end, we strongly encourage educators to incorporate informal learning environments into their lesson plans as fundamental course components. Science centers and museums are obvious choices that are applicable across all science subdisciplines. A holistic appreciation for the biological sciences in particular almost necessitates field experiences (including field-based experiments, nature walks, and diversity surveys), which have been shown to critical determinants of future success [92, 93] . These experiences should be made available irrespective of the financial resources of the students and framed in such a way that students with less of a background in informal settings are not made to feel as though they are \"behind\" their peers (see rules 1 and 2). This is particularly true of students that may not have entered college or university directly out of high school, who often report different needs and expectations from postsecondary education [94, 95] . A successful implementation of this strategy also requires that the informal learning experiences be designed and integrated into the course thoughtfully, providing informed guidance throughout rather than simply opening the door and letting students succeed or fail on their own. This integration of formal and informal education efforts has enormous potential to bridge the gap between the 2 models, combining the structure of the former with the self-motivating strength of the latter [96] . This is particularly true if long-term relationships can be established between lecturers in universities and science educators at informal education sites [97] and can be especially impactful for groups that have been historically excluded from these formative experiences. This further requires that educators be flexible and embrace new strategies and technologies to improve access to STEM education. This may include leveraging digital resources such as virtual museum tours (e.g., those available from the Smithsonian Institutional Natural Museum of Natural History and Aga Khan Museum), interactive science websites (e.g., Royal Ontario Museums' Burgess Shale website) using freely accessible online STEM content (e.g., PBS eons), or by directly engaging science communicators online who can give guise presentations to students (e.g., Skype A Scientist). The often free (or relatively inexpensive) nature of these types of programs presents a significant breakdown of the socioeconomic barriers to science equity we described in rule 5.",

As a result, scientific fields of study tend to attract and retain more students who value intrinsic motives (e.g., passion for problem solving and discovery, curiosity) and accept the individualistic and isolating aspects of the field [98] . Students from historically underrepresented minority groups also value intrinsic motives in their career interests but are much more likely than majority students to be influenced by highly altruistic cultural values, particularly contributing to one's community [98, 99] . The sense of community that is integral to many minority groups fosters cultural values and identities in students that center around promoting meaningful communal connections and \"giving back\" to their community [100, 101] . Because minority groups are often disproportionately affected by social justice issues, they are likely more aware of the impacts and feel more urgency to act on these issues for the betterment of their community. Not all scientific fields afford or value communal work goals, and, as a result, students from historically underrepresented minority groups may be particularly at risk for losing interest in science careers [102, 103] . Instead of changing historically underrepresented students to fit the majority, we need to change research training and science education to be more inclusive of their values [38] .",

            "text": "Scientists and educators can integrate community into their teaching and mentoring activities by building links between culture and science that are particularly relevant to historically underrepresented students [104] . For example, climate change is an environmental issue that is widely addressed in scientific research and education for its global impacts. To make a meaningful connection between climate change and community, we can focus on how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities (e.g., pollution, food security, extreme weather events) and discuss why this makes their input and leadership in research even more valuable. Community-relevant topics can be integrated into the classroom by incorporating the diverse viewpoints and perspectives from historically underrepresented groups into traditional lecture topics (e.g., environmental justice in climate change, subsistence fisheries and food security in fisheries and conservation, Indigenous rights in resource management). As educators, we can develop class assessments that contribute to community science and/or outreach while meeting curriculum requirements (e.g., presentations are given to children's groups or organizations rather than presented in class). In mentoring activities, we can implement SCL and support students wishing to pursue cultural or communal based research endeavors. Both in the classroom and through mentoring, utilizing an asset-based approach in which educators can draw upon the knowledge of their students (e.g., asking students to share the knowledge they have gained about science from their family or culture) helps integrate community experience and learning. We can also tailor our outreach to students from historically underrepresented minorities by facilitating a sense of community through long-term interactions and empowering students to engage in issues that directly affect their community. For example, community science platforms such as iNaturalist allow students to record their own observations and interact with members of the community to discuss and learn more about their findings, while also making direct and beneficial scientific impacts [105] . Educators in positions of power can investigate community and outreach opportunities (e.g., Soapbox Science, Science Literacy Week) and present them to their students to encourage involvement. As we strive to establish meaningful connections with communities, we must also be cognizant of the time-intensive nature of this process and ensure that we are not intentionally or unintentionally exploiting communities and organizations or engaging in nonreciprocal relationships. Employing community-oriented science not only attracts more students from diverse backgrounds and reduces a major barrier to successful assimilation into scientific culture, but it can lead to more fulfillment and drive in scientists to better both science and society.",

Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) workshops and seminars are increasingly being instated by academic institutions with the objective of holding leaders accountable for advancing diversity [107, 108] . These learning opportunities have been shown to cultivate more inclusive academic environments and contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce [109] . Educators are encouraged to seize these opportunities for development, solicit them from their institution if they are lacking, and engage with peers to normalize the exchange of ideas surrounding inclusivity. In sharing, we can develop solutions that highlight unique identities, backgrounds, and experiences. This formation is not limited to the workplace. At a personal level, educators should be dedicated to ongoing learning outside of the classroom. This could include an increased awareness of our own biases and assumptions about others [107, 110] , as well as recognizing challenges faced by different races and ethnicities, genders, identities and orientations, socioeconomic statuses, and disabilities to tailor teaching approaches appropriately (rules 1, 2, and 3). Awareness could also involve keeping up with current global events that may impact student's well-being. This includes consulting reliable news sources covering a range of global issues (e.g., politics, economics, ethics, natural disasters, and crime), critically thinking about how these occurrences may affect our students and being prepared to engage in supportive discussions surrounding these events. Resources tailored to EDI are available in many forms (books, seminars, videos, infographics, scholarly material, etc.); material curated by academic institutions may be a good place to start (e.g., see [17, 110] ).",

For example, historically underrepresented students are often the targets of microaggressions [17] , which are prejudicial comments or actions, often delivered in an offhand manner [111] . Instead of \"calling-out\" and shaming the perpetrator of microaggressions, it can be reframed as an opportunity to learn and discuss the behavior, why it occurred, and the effect that it may have by instead \"calling-in.\" This term was coined by Loretta Ross, and unlike calling-out, calling-in is \"speaking up without tearing down\" [112] . It is conducted with respect and invites conversation and compassion. Normalizing these often-difficult conversations can lead to increased collective understanding and inclusiveness. Unfortunately, there may also be situations in which a prejudicial behavior of a student or even faculty member is serious or dangerous. In these circumstances, we also need to ensure that we are familiar with our institution's reporting systems in order to guide and support historically underrepresented students in navigating the situation. Committing to ongoing education applies to our responsibility not only as scientists but also as educators. In doing so, we uplift important and diverse perspectives that will continue to pave the path of scientific discovery.",
