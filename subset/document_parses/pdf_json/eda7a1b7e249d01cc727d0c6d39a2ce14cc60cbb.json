The linkage between and understanding of the physical dose and induced biological perturbations are opening entirely new areas of application. The ability to define anatomic extent of disease and the elucidation of the biology of metastases has brought a key role for radiation oncology for treating metastatic disease. That radiation can stimulate and suppress subpopulations of the immune response makes radiation a key participant in cancer immunotherapy. Targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy delivers radiation systemically with radionuclides and carrier molecules selected for their physical, chemical, and biochemical properties. Radiation oncology usage of \"big data\" and machine learning and artificial intelligence adds the opportunity to markedly change the workflow for clinical practice while physically targeting and adapting radiation fields in real time. Future precision targeting requires multidimensional understanding of the imaging, underlying biology, and anatomical relationship among tissues for radiation as spatial and temporal \"focused biology.\" Other means of energy delivery are available as are agents that can be activated by radiation with increasing ability to target treatments. With broad applicability of radiation in cancer treatment, radiation therapy is a necessity for effective cancer care, opening a career path for global health serving the medically underserved in geographically isolated populations as a substantial societal contribution addressing health disparities. Understanding risk and mitigation of radiation injury make it an important discipline for and beyond cancer care including energy policy, space exploration, national security, and global partnerships.",

            "text": "The scope, breadth, depth, complexity, technology, underlying science, and societal opportunities for radiation oncology have expanded dramatically over the last decade. In 2018, coauthors from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National CancerInstitute's (NCI) Radiation Research Program (RRP), and CERN/ICTR-PHE (European Organization for Nuclear Research/ International Conference for Translational Radio-oncology-Physics for Health) jointly described emerging opportunities for the radiation sciences including but also well beyond cancer care in \"Accurate, Precision Radiation Medicine\" (1) . It emphasized the addition of accurate physical targeting to biological targeting in a patient-centeredprecision medicine approach. It described the multifaceted composition of radiation sciences including basic physics, technology, biology, health care, energy, space exploration, and mass casualty preparedness with multiple crossroads coming together in a \"radiation rotary.\" Since that publication, substantial advances have been achieved. An entire new dimension for radiation oncology had opened by defining dose in both biological and physical terms in an NCI Workshop (\"Defining the Shades of Gy: Utilizing the Biological Consequences of Radiotherapy in the Development of New Treatment Approaches\") (2) . This articulated the need to define what happens biologically and physiologically to tumors and normal tissues as dose, fractionation, and type of radiation vary and the tissues rapidly adapt. This further highlights the critical need to define and measure dose delivered (3) in the laboratory and the clinic as radiation oncology's technical ability to physically deliver radiation externally and systemically rapidly grows. Accompanying these dramatic advances in science and opportunities for what the field can bring to cancer care and society led to our field taking a broad look at career opportunities in the expanding horizon (4) including the need for our expertise in disaster preparedness (5) .",

The current ability to physically localize radiation treatments is spectacular including external beam shaping, depth delivery of charged particles, and brachytherapy. That a target is hit requires accounting for motion, and it is recognized that even for superbly shaped fields, normal tissues are included from the margin for incorporating potential routes of spread including regional lymph nodes, transit dose to reach the tumor target, dose falloff from internal sources, and circulating and diffusing signaling molecules from the radiated tissue responding to the radiation stress. Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) requires dosimetry: routes of agent distribution, elimination, and excretion. External beam techniques are being developed, which: 1) purposely aim for heterogeneity (ie, lower and higher doses within the target with spatially fractionated radiotherapy) (6); 2) use highly focused large doses with stereotactic body radiation therapy; and 3) FLASH (7), which is radiation delivered in a short pulse in a fraction of a second the biology, physiology, efficacy, and toxicity of which are being defined.",

Having coined the term focused biology years ago, we view radiation \"as a drug\" where the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics matter (2) . Dose size, radiation type, timing, and biological impact matter and are exploitable variables. As with all cancer therapies, the more they are used the better they are understood. Therefore, the initial proposed mechanisms may not be what is operative with time. That the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at the end or edge of a particle beam matters greatly for potential toxicity with proton therapy was recognized after treatments had been administered for years (8) . Our future is now exceptional technology, induced biological changes and multimodality treatments with regulatory (https://www.fda. gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions/premarket-notification-510k#), and clinical implementation that require broad understanding of safety and short-and long-term efficacy as Figure 1 .

Although AI has not yet been implemented in routine clinical practice, researchers are continuously developing AI tools, and more and more use cases using these tools are being reported in the literature. Advanced AI techniques of decision trees, neural networks in all their flavors, and various AI learning algorithms have been applied to clinical problems in the field (10) . Recent accomplishments include fast, efficient contour autosegmentation that can drastically reduce the tedium and error rate brought about by simple reliance on voxel intensities of radiology images (11) . Deep learning algorithms have been employed to generate optimal dose distributions almost on the fly, with promising potential for adaptive radiotherapy. Classifiers have been used on radiomics features as possible imaging biomarkers to correlate with underlying pathology and treatment outcomes. The integration and cross-correlation of various omics databases are now being attempted to discern biological signatures underlying the treatment response of irradiated organs and tissues. The overarching goals of these AI applications are to assist practitioners in routine tasks and free up time for patient management, to mine the enormous data generated from clinical experience for trends, and to extract hitherto unrecognized determinants of patient outcome.",

The NCI has created the publicly accessible Cancer Research Data Commons (https:// datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons) with huge repositories of genomics, proteomics, digital pathology, radiological images, and so forth. These data archives are test beds for data mining and discovery extraction. For clinical text reports, there is a challenge not just of big data, but more so, good quality data. Several task forces and working groups in many professional societies like the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, American Society for Radiation Oncology, American College of Radiology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, and others in tandem with electronic medical record providers like Epic, Cerner, and GE Healthcare's Centricity have been created precisely to address this need.",

It has been shown that this federated approach performs close to 99% accuracy as that in the centralized, pooled data repository. Also, this data aggregation could be done per institution, so that a patient electronic health record could contain all clinical data from genomics, pathology, psychometrics, radiation treatment, and so on.

There is extensive interest on the effect of local radiation on immunogenic response and on causing an immune-related cell death for cancer cells not in the radiation field by the abscopal effect (43) . Figure 2 illustrates the complexity and some of the opportunities for tumor cell killing by radiation therapy used in conjunction with systemic therapy for immunotherapy generally requiring an immunotherapy agent (44) and molecular targeted therapy. While radiation can enhance immune response, radiation can also produce an immune suppressive effect. Furthermore, local radiation therapy can fail to control tumors because of tumor burden, induction of prosurvival pathways, and increased proliferation (2, 41, 42, 45) (Figure 3 ).",

            "text": "A major challenge is a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive cancer cell resistance to radiation and other therapies such that strategies to anticipate and abate disease recurrence can be deployed. Cancer cells exposed to radiation therapies share a pervasive feature of living systems in surroundings that undergo fluctuations, chiefly the capacity to persist through evolutionary bottlenecks for repopulation after the cessation of stress. The 2 prevailing viewpoints on cancer cell resistance, which are not mutually exclusive, are that positive selection operates on a pool of cancer cells that harbor intrinsic preexisting resistance traits and that therapy induces new adaptations among select cancer cells, so-called acquired resistance. Resistance is favored in a larger tumor volume where the probability of a cancer cell within a population either having (intrinsic) or finding (acquired) a solution to cytotoxic radiation stress is increased (46) . It therefore follows that heterogeneity is intertwined with therapy resistance. The advent of genomic sequencing technologies has helped define evolutionary patterns associated with radiation treatment. For example, a longitudinal analysis of glioblastoma patients suggests that the dominant clones associated with relapse were distinct from those at diagnosis and typically existed more than a decade before the commencement of radiation therapy (47) . While these data credential the importance of long-standing intrinsic mutations in clonal emergence following selection pressures imposed by treatment, heterogeneity and resistance can also operate at the phenotypic level in a process known as stochastic switching (48) . Stochastic switching in cancer cells involves complex relationships between metabolism, morphological dynamics, and epigenetic control of stemness (adaptive process that determines if a cell retains the property of a stem cell) and occurs on short time scales relative to processes wed to irreversible intrinsic genetic mutations. Research efforts that leverage modification of radiation dose and fractionation scheduling regimens in a manner that has potential to counter anticipated tumor adaptative responses and/or induce an adaptation that have potential for exploitation in synthetic lethality strategies are areas of interest (ie, identify responses that make the cell and/or the tumorsensitive to a molecular targeted therapy).",

As the field started to understand radiation's interaction with cellular structures, physicists studied radiation's biological effects, becoming a pillar of radiation biology. In most of the 20th century, radiation biologists who were teaching radiation oncology residents had substantial physics backgrounds. Mathematically based foundational models remain both useful for safe clinical application and informative for understanding the cellular, molecular, and immunological biologies that are advancing new radiation biology concepts, just as pharmacology remains relevant to medical oncology. The teaching of radiation biology expanded with the growth of molecular biology, cellular biology, and immunology. Going forward, radiation biology education faces 2 major issues: as traditional physicist-turned-radiation biologists are retiring, there is a scarcity of foundational radiation biology mentors and training programs, and teaching radiation biology must incorporate the current understanding of molecular, cellular, and immune-biological concepts. In an initial attempt, these 2 challenges were addressed by NCI funding an educational course, Integration of Biology and Physics into Radiation Oncology (70) to Wayne State University, whereby 240 clinicians and researchers in the radiation sciences discipline were trained over 5 years. More innovative approaches, including the NCI T32 mechanisms, are being considered to increase the necessary teaching force to educate the next generations of biologists and clinicians.",

Members of the radiation research community have raised the issues of the percentage of total NCI funding for radiation research grants, which can be complicated into how projects are \"counted\" in terms of the topic and field to which the research is attributed (71) . As with other NCI programs, the RRP endeavors to assist with opportunities for novel topics; however, the issue of funding is more appropriately discussed at venues other than this overview.

Many career opportunities are rapidly emerging, including formal collaborations within NCI, NIH, and DHHS; other US federal agencies (eg, DoE and NASA); international agencies (Supplementary Table 1 , available online); academia; professional societies; and unique industry partnerships.

            "text": "The conceptual similarity between systemic therapy and radiation: How tissues can experience radiation as different drugs. The figure illustrates the different scales of radiation therapy from pharmaceutical injection to external beam made up of photons or particles moving at upwards of 0.7c. Given the vast differences in the effects and scale of radiation therapy, it is fair to consider different forms of radiation as being like different drugs. Panel A represents the biology of RPT and notes how beta, alpha, and Auger electrons can be employed to cause DNA damage. In Panel B, the combination of beam and pharmaceutical processes involved in neutron capture therapy are shown. In Panel C1, TOPAS-nBIO (TOol for PArticle Simulations is extended to model radiobiological date) (https://gray.mgh.harvard.edu/research/ software/258-topas-nbio) images show how computational modeling via Monte Carlo simulation is able to accurately model cellular events. This capacity to expand world-leading physics code that is easy to use with biology is of critical importance to the field and is actively supported by the National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (https://itcr.cancer.gov/) program. In Panel C2, each image shows the resulting signal from 1 Gy of physical dose that was delivered to cells. These measurements were carried out in DAPI-labeled background (nuclear staining) to count H2AX foci. Relative biologic effect relative to Cobalt 60 beams is noted for 30% survival (RBE30) in the third column. Raw cell images and RBE values were provided by Ivana Dokic and Amir Abdollahi and were used with permission(14). The simulation images were provided to us for use in this figure by the TOPAS (http://www.topasmc.org/) team (with special thanks to Joseph Perl and Jose Ramos Mendez)(72).",
