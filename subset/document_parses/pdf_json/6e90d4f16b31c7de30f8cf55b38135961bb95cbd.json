We describe how an algorithm based on the Core&Peel method is used to detect disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. We first validate Core&Peel for the general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-theart algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner, and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core&Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover, for the two cancer datasets, Core&Peel detects further eight relevant pathways not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally, we apply Core&Peel and other methods to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts at a pre-clinical level.",

We next examined the performance of Core&Peel for detecting active subnetworks, i.e. finding subnetworks that are activated under different conditions. We used the DREAM challenge co-expression network and seven different datasets: two cancer RNA-Seq studies (prostate and colorectal cancer), two inflammatory disease microarray experiments (asthma and rheumatoid arthritis), and three COVID-19 related datasets (bronchioalveolar lavage fluid RNA-Seq, infected patient PBMCs, and COVID-19 infected A549 cells). We calculated differentially expressed genes using edgeR for the cancer data and limma for gene microarrays. We processed the first two COVID-19 data according to the pipeline the authors used; we used the summary statistics of the third dataset released from the authors to retrieve the differentially expressed genes (see Methods). We retained only modules that contained at least one differentially expressed gene in the comparison of interest. We ran Core&Peel using both nl=10 and nl=20 as the minimum subgraph size. We noticed that, in the active subnetwork detection problem, Core&Peel with nl = 10 identified more pathways with disease-associated genes than the case nl = 20. So we chose the Core&Peel-r1-nl10-d0.7-f1-j0.8 since it is one of the best configurations (same density and Jaccard coefficient) on the DREAM challenge data. Actually, this configuration works better in prostate and colorectal cancer cases where the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is pretty high, instead when the number of DEGs is low (Supplementary Table S4) , Core&Peel with a smaller density obtained better results. So we decided to use Core&Peel-r1-nl10-d0.5-f1-j0.8 in asthma and rheumatoid arthritis cases. In COVID-19 case studies, we took into account both Core&Peel configurations. Core&Peel detected 1270, 141, 49 and 1495 modules in prostate cancer, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and colorectal cancer datasets, respectively.

Next, such a network is analyzed to detect interesting phenomena from a biological point of view, potentially relevant for a phenotype of interest or a specific biological process. Biological networks have been found to have a rich modular structure which mediates biological processes and cellular activities. Thus discovering and validating modules within biological networks has become an activity propaedeutic to the discovery of biological mechanisms.

In both tasks, the DREAM challenge gene co-expression network was used as input of Core&Peel algorithm. In (a) we tested different values of density and Jaccard index. For each parameters combination, we tested the disease-association of each module detected by Core&Peel using the GWAS datasets made available by the DREAM challenge. The leaderboard set (including 76 GWAS datasets) was used to optimize the parameters and the final test (including 104 GWAS datasets) to get a final evaluation of them. We also tested the biological relevance of each module through the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. In (b), we used the differentially expressed genes and the hypergeometric test to select the active Core&Peel modules in a specific disease. We used several transcriptomic datasets: two cancer RNA-Seq studies (prostate and colorectal cancer), two inflammatory disease microarray experiments (asthma and rheumatoid arthritis) and three COVID-19 related datasets. We used the R/CRAN package DiagrammeR 96 to illustrate the workflow. topological properties of quasi-cliques and ego-networks. The method makes a very mild assumption on the properties of the input network, and of the predicted modules, thus in principle, it can be applied quite directly to other community detection problems with a similar flavor. One example of such a problem is disease module identification. In 2016, an open DREAM challenge attempted to identify the best performing algorithms for disease module identification 22 . We applied our previously reported Core&Peel algorithm 21 to the DREAM challenge data to see how well Core&Peel could perform on this new task. In practice, the list of 42 methods mentioned in 22 for functional module detection, and the list of 19 methods mentioned in 21 for protein complex prediction, have very little overlap; the only methods mentioned in both lists are SPICi and ClusterOne, which are used in the functional module detection DREAM challenge as part of an ensemble or hybrid computational pipelines. Thus the nature of the two problems, functional module identification and protein complex prediction, is such as to require a fresh look as it is not obvious that any algorithm can perform equally well in either case.",

            "text": "Core&Peel: detection of disease modules. The DREAM challenge proposed the problem of identifying disease modules from six heterogeneous networks of proteins/genes. To test the performance of Core&Peel in detecting disease modules, we decided to use only the DREAM challenge gene co-expression network. We varied the Core&Peel parameters for subgraph density and Jaccard coefficient to find optimal settings (Fig. S1 ). We noticed that some modules had more than 100 genes. We removed these modules to be consistent with the DREAM challenge, requiring no module to have more than 100 genes (Fig. S2) . The scoring methodology for the DREAM challenge used GWAS datasets as an orthogonal validation for the submitted networks. The PAS-CAL tool was used to correct the GWAS datasets for underlying linkage, creating gene-fusion regions tagged by the most significant SNP. By supplying PASCAL with the GWAS data and a gene network, this tool can score whether the detected modules contain significant GWAS hits. We tested the different Core&Peel parameters to the DREAM leaderboard (parameter tuning) and final submission GWAS datasets (Fig. 2) . We chose the 0.7 density and 0.8 Jaccard index (more precisely Core&Peel-r1-nl20-d0.7-f1-j0.8 configuration) since it detected the largest number of enriched modules compared to other configurations in the leaderboard GWAS dataset. Generally when the Jaccard index is from 0.8 and 1.0 there is not a substantial variation in the number of disease modules identified (Fig. 2) , so we decided to choose the smallest Jaccard index into this range. However when the density is too high (mostly equal to 1) very few modules were identified. This is more evident in the leaderboard step, in fact when the final GWAS datasets were used a remarkable improvement can be noticed, probably due to the larger number of final GWAS datasets than those in the leaderboard. We further noted that removing modules with a size greater than 100 slightly improves the performance (comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. S5 ).",

The DREAM comparison methodology is fit for comparing methods producing non-overlapping modules, while we allow overlaps; we thus resort to introducing an explicit post-processing equalizing phase for Core&Peel (based on ranking and cut-off) when we compare the score of a method producing overlapping modules (Core&Peel) with a method producing non-overlapping modules. This is done for the sake of fairness of the comparison without sacrificing the advantages that overlapping modules have in modelling the underlying biology. In order to compare Core&Peel with DREAM methods, we thus applied the CRank ranking algorithm to the results of the configuration chosen (Core&Peel-r1-nl20-d0.7-f1-j0.8). We selected the highest rank communities to obtain the same number of modules of DREAM methods ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The results of the leaderboard and final tests for Core&Peel versus the DREAM methods are represented in Fig. 3 . In most of the cases, Core&Peel can identify more enriched modules. In a few cases, Core&Peel finds fewer GWAS enriched modules, for example when compared with K5 ( Fig. 3b) , probably due to the low number of predicted modules (equal to 16). Obviously, Core&Peel still has the advantage to have overlapping modules and this helps to obtain more disease enriched modules for an equal number of predicted modules with DREAM methods. This last aspect highlights the importance of taking into account modules with genes in common since they are more realistic from a biological point of view, as also demonstrated in 23 .",

Core&Peel predicts in total many more modules than this method ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ), moreover Core&Peel identifies many more disease-enriched modules (Fig. 4) . We also report the fraction of predicted disease modules (i.e. number of enriched modules divided by the total number of detected modules) in Table 1 . Core&Peel identifies more disease modules both in absolute and relative terms, so we can consider it a competitive algorithm in disease modules identification problem, also for the class of methods producing overlapping modules. In Table 1 we reported the fraction of disease modules detected by the hits and spread hubs algorithms after filtering them according to the same Jaccard index (0.8) used in Core&Peel. We added this comparison to assess if there are any changes in the results when the rate of the overlap is the same among the two methods. However, we obtained similar outcomes with or without the Jaccard filtering. Besides, we analyzed the biological relevance of the predicted modules with GO analysis and Core&Peel achieves the best result (Supplementary Tables S2  and S3 ). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Table S4 ), the more modules are identified.

We compared the Core&Peel modules with those detected by the four existing active subnetwork identification methods, namely ModuleDiscoverer (MD) 24 , Key-PathwayMiner (KPM) 25 , ClustEx 26 and Degas 27 (see description on Supplementary Notes Sect. 3.1). The number of genes in each active subnetwork is reported in Table 2 . Generally, regulatory modules of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis include fewer genes than the prostate and colorectal cancer modules; this could be due to the lower number of DEGs. Degas is the method that produced the smallest modules. Core&Peel, ModuleDiscoverer and ClustEx produced the biggest ones, instead. Next, we were interested in comparing the modules detected by the different methods from a biological point of view. We compared the enriched pathways (Reactome-based) and plotted the overlap among all the method combinations (Fig. S6 ). We also conducted as baseline the pathway enrichment analysis using the DEGs. Globally, MD, ClustEx and Core&Peel detected a higher number of pathways than Degas, KPM, and DEGs. Degas is the method that identified the lowest number of pathways. In particular, in prostate and colorectal cancer cases ( Fig. S6a,b) , it does not overlap with the other methods. In both cancer cases, Core&Peel and MD share a significant part of their pathways (around 40) and a large number of pathways was identified only by ClustEx and MD in the prostate (Fig. S6a ) and colorectal cancer (Fig.  S6b ), respectively. In the rheumatoid arthritis case, more than half of the pathways were shared by Core&Peel, ClustEx, and MD ( Fig. S6d ) and there is a small overlap for the other combinations. Overall a smaller number of enriched pathways were detected in asthma (see horizontal bars on Fig. S6c ) than the other three case studies (horizontal bars on Fig. S6a ,b,d) and we can also notice there are fewer overlapping pathways among the methods (Fig. S6c ). Almost the entire set of enriched pathways of ClustEx is not in common with those produced by any other method. Similarly, more than half of the pathways identified by Core&Peel were not detected by the competing methods (Fig. S6c) .",

Blanco-Melo et al. 29 using DEA analysis noted that infection by COVID-19 has a molecular fingerprint characterized by \"exuberant inflammatory cytokine production as a defining and driving feature of COVID-19\", and this is also noted by Xiong et al. 30 . Our analysis of active subnetworks confirms this finding at the level of enriched pathways in the active subnetworks: positive regulation of cytokine production involved in inflammatory response (by Core&Peel), regulation of cytokine production involved in inflammatory response (by Core&Peel), cytokine production involved in inflammatory response (by Core&Peel), and Cytokines and Inflammatory Response WP530 (by Core&Peel and ClustEx) in Table S8 . Pathway Cytokines and Inflammatory Response WP530 is found enriched also in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 . Blanco-Melo et al. 29 also noted a high expression of IL-6 as part of the characteristic COVID-19 signature. The importance of the interleukin activation is also shown in our analysis, as the pathway IL-10 Anti-inflammatory Signaling Pathway WP4495, which has regulatory effects on IL-6, is found enriched in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7,  by ClustEx, and in Supplementary Table S8 , by Core&Peel. Consistently with known mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 progression 31 , we have found several apoptosis-related and lymphocite-related pathways in all three data sets. These observations are meant as a sanity check; their purpose is to recover in the functional enrichment analysis biological processes that are somewhat expected in any viral infection. These pathways per se are however usually aspecific and too broad to give useful hints for drug re-purposing efforts.",

Next we turn to discuss specific pathways for which it is more likely that existing drugs may alter their behaviour and have potential therapeutic effects. We keep our discussion at a pre-clinical level since the best we can hope from using the active network analysis is to find supporting evidence suggesting that some drugs (or families of drugs) should be shortlisted for further in vitro and in vivo experimental analysis, or finding additional evidence supporting drugs already shortlisted for clinical trials. Other sources and experiments may reasonably contradict the type of evidence we can hope to provide, therefore all available evidence should always be weighted in before moving to the next steps of a drug repurposing pipeline. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ COVID-19 studies stemmed from its in vitro capability of inhibiting COVID-19/SARS-CoV2 infection 34 , and its known safety profile obtained in clinical trials for EBOV in 2014 35 . At the time of the study of Wang et al. 34 remdesivir was already known, since 2017, to be effective in vitro and in vivo experiments involving members of the coronavirus family of viruses in a study by Sheahan et al. 36 , and this might be one of the reasons for shortlisting this drug in 2020 34 , along with other candidate drugs. Interestingly, our study of the patient's transcriptional response to COVID-19 detects a direct link between the human response to EBOV and the response to COVID-19, at a modular level. In a hypothetical scenario in which one wishes to shortlist candidate drugs for an essay similar to Wang et al. 34 , our techniques would provide evidence that complements the supporting evidence provided by an essay identical to that in Sheahan et al. 36 .",

Chloroquine is mostly known as an anti-malaria drug, while in our data, we could not spot specific pathways related to malaria, and therefore no indication for shortlisting it.

            "text": "In this work, we explore the potential value of the Core&Peel method for solving two related problems. The first problem is functional module detection within a biological co-expression (co-expr) network of genes. The second is the problem of active functional module detection, that is, finding modules within a biological network of genes, that are most affected in a specific disease vs. a normal background state. We initially discuss the two problems separately as the validation methodology is different in either case, however, the two aspects of the issue often interact with each other. Firstly, we compare Core&Peel with 42 methods producing non-overlapping modules that participated in the DREAM challenge project, as well as some recent methods of Tripathi et al. 2019, which allow substantial module overlap. Module overlap is an issue that often arises in the context of network partitions and modularization (as also in graph-based community detection). The DREAM challenge did require competing methods to report non-overlapping modules. This choice has the first effect since there is no need in the DREAM challenge of a requirement on the maximum number of produced modules. The number of nodes in a network is a natural upper bound on the number of reported modules. It is also somewhat easier to evaluate the enrichment of disjoint modules since one does not have to cope with inflated results, where possibly many high quality overlapping modules differ by just one or two genes, collectively representing quasi-duplicates of the same biological module. On the other hand, there is ample evidence [67] [68] [69] [70] (see also the discussion in the DREAM paper 22 ) that functional biological modules often share sub-modules and that this sharing has precise implications for the biological interpretation of the processes under study. When we compare Core&Peel with the output of the DREAM challenge, we mitigate the potential bias in the measurements due to overlapping modules by imposing a maximum value of the Jaccard coefficient between any pair of modules, thus avoiding to report quasi-duplicates. Moreover, for the sake of comparison, we rank the modules by intrinsic topological quality (see 71 ) and we limit Core&Peel to the top k modules in this ranking when we compare it to a method reporting k modules (for the same input graph).",

            "text": "Within these caveats, we strictly follow the performance measurement methodology of DREAM. We use the GWAS leaderboard and the final datasets separately (see Fig. 2 ). The results on the GWAS leaderboard are used to optimize the choice of the parameters of the Core&Peel method. Figure 2 reports good qualitative concordance of the relative performance of Core&Peel between leaderboard and final GWAS datasets for a wide range of parameters. There is a discrepancy for the density value d = 1.0 , which corresponds to detecting full cliques in the input graph. Since even the best co-expression networks are approximations to the true network of interactions, missing edges (false negatives) are expected in the input, thus implying that quasi-cliques may be more relevant to functional module detection than full-cliques. Table 1 and Fig. 4 show that Core&Peel can detect many more significant modules (with a common Jaccard coefficient maximum threshold of 0.8), and that Core&Peel has a larger fraction of the reported modules enriched for GWAS data. We also performed a second analysis in which we count the number of modules enriched within one (or more) Gene Ontology annotation at an FDR below a fixed threshold (see Supplementary Tables S1, S2, and S3). Supplementary Table S1 reports the number of enriched modules for the DREAM methods, and the average number overall DREAM methods. The average number of GO:BP enriched modules for the DREAM methods is comparable to those found by Core&Peel for thresholds 10 \u22122 , and 10 \u22123 , however, for thresholds from 10 \u22124 , down to 10 \u22127 Core&Peel has a substantially higher number of enriched modules. At threshold 10 \u22127 Core&Peel reports more enriched modules than 39/42 of the DREAM methods. Comparing the method of Tripathi et al. 23 , results in Supplementary Table S2 and S3 show superior performance of Core&Peel, both in terms of enriched modules for GO categories, and in terms of the fraction of enriched modules over the total number of returned modules. Both the validation with GWAS data and that with GO data give the same picture, showing that Core&Peel is competitive with the best methods in the field on many measured quality functions, even when discounting for the difference in the number of reported modules. Moreover as noted in 72 (page 8) the validation via GWAS enrichment uses data derived from association studies that are not normally used to define pathways and functional categories found in databases.",

This is a very rich structure, and we can exploit this richness to attack the problem of active module detection. Similarly to other methods, like Mod-uleDiscoverer, we use the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in case-control experiments to compute the enrichment of each module in DEGs, and we report as active modules those with an enrichment below a given FDR threshold (typically 0.01).

            "text": "The main validation methodology for the active subnetwork detection methods involves finding validated disease-related pathways and testing the enrichment of such pathways in the active subnetworks. For this type of analysis (over the four test cases), we use several curated databases of pathways. The association of the pathway to the disease can be either obvious from the pathway textual description, or it can be inferred by the presence of disease-related genes (at least two). Figure 5a and www.nature.com/scientificreports/ find more such pathways (and for prostate cancer, substantially more). Although any of the competing methods (ClustEx, KPM, ModuleDiscoverer, and Degas) may perform better than Core&Peel in some particular case, Core&Peel can perform uniformly well across all four test cases, and it is the only method in the comparative evaluation that could find significant enrichment for many validated cancer pathways. All methods mentioned in this paper require in input a biological network in which nodes represent genes, and edges represent interactions between pairs of genes. Many active subnetwork detection methods have been developed and tested using as input PPI networks (protein-protein interaction networks) 5 . Instead for this study we chose as target (large) gene co-expression network developed within the DREAM challenge project. There are advantages and supporting evidence that using a co-expr network is a sensible choice. (a) an edge in coexpression network may be due both to direct protein-protein interactions of the proteins associated with the genes, as measured in large scale proteomic essays. However it may also be due to indirect co-regulation in which the two genes show correlation because their expression is modulated by a common Transcription Factor or an ncRNA (miRNA, lncRNA, etc..). Thus a richer array of phenomena is captured in a co-expr network. (b) Co-expr networks tend to have more edges and thus to be denser than most PPIN. This is an advantage for density basedmethods, as modules tend to be more compact (in other words the average path length within a module is shorter for the same module detected in a denser network). (c) Co-expr networks are usually based on the correlation between expression vectors of pairs of genes, across thousands of measurements of gene panels (via microarray or RNAseq technologies). This set up integrates naturally data from different experiments, and different platforms, via standard normalization. The resulting correlation values depend very little on outlier conditions or variations across experimental conditions, thus representing a robust datum. In contrast, the integration of PPI data is somewhat more affected by outlier experiments and heterogeneous experimental conditions. (d) Huang et al. 74 compare the performance of 21 networks in uncovering pathways associated with a particular disease phenotype, by using 50 literature-based validated pathways. Huang et al. note that larger network size gives a higher absolute performance score. Moreover, among seven networks integrating co-expression data, six rank in the top seven positions by absolute performance score. (e) The findings in 74 are also consistent with the observations in 22 as the largest average number of disease-related modules is detected (averaging among methods) in the co-expression network (of 1M edges). Slightly less performant is a PPI network which, however, has more than twice as many edges (about 2.2 M). On balance, although there is evidence pointing at co-expression networks as an input of choice, both 22 and 74 indicate that usually, different types of networks reveal various aspects of the active subnetworks. Thus a multi-facet approach should always be considered for specific investigations.",

The bio-network represents a global and essentially static picture of the cell's machinery, while the perturbation represents the dynamic element we wish to study within the context of the bio-network. All the methods we compare with imply these two roles (static/dynamic) for the two inputs (network/perturbation), although they may differ in many other aspects. A limitation of this view on the data is that the phenomenon of network rewiring in response to the stimulus is captured somewhat imperfectly. Rare novel gene interactions (i.e. new edges in the network) arising as the result of the stimulus are not included in this model, and cannot be predicted. There is a different family of approaches (see e.g. 75 ) that focus instead on the network rewiring phenomenon, by a more direct experimental assessment of dynamics of physical and genetic networks, through experimental mapping of networks. In this setting typically one would produce and analyze two full networks, one representing the system's status before and one after the stimulus, to capture the variations. Here there is a different trade-off between the complexity of the experimental setup and the depth of the downstream 'in silico' analysis.",

Adapting the DREAM challenge evaluation methodology to the case of overlapping functional modules we conclude that, in terms of the number of enriched detected modules, Core&Peel is competitive with 42 functional module detection methods (which report non-overlapping modules) participating in the DREAM Challenge, and with the recent method by Raman's group 23 (which allows overlapping modules). Naturally, the number of enriched modules detected is just one easy-to-measure parameter, and other features may be important in a comparative assessment of several methods for the same task. On a more qualitative level, comparison of Core&Peel with several active subnetwork detection algorithms on four benchmark test cases show that Core&Peel has more uniform performance across all these four benchmark datasets, and for two cancer data sets (prostate, and colorectal) it produces modules enriched with more specific pathways, overlooked by the competing methods. COVID-19 is a recent infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first isolated in December 2019. As relatively little is known of this contagious disease at this time, we adopt an exploratory approach using Core&Peel along with several other methods to uncover active subnetworks of human response to COVID-19. Pathway enrichment analysis of such active subnetworks uncovers some broad biological processes common to many infections, as well as more specific pathways that show similarities between human transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and response to other pathogens, and thus provide evidence useful in ongoing drug repositioning efforts at a pre-clinical level.

Apart from comparing the Core&Peel results with DREAM ones, we took into account a further method developed by the Raman group 23 . This method has been designed to detect disease modules starting from heterogeneous biological networks. Like Core&Peel, it uses the data from the DREAM challenge and can detect overlapping modules. Basically this method involves two steps: (i) seed nodes selection and (ii) seed expansion. The seed nodes selection relies on the observation that disease genes have a higher degree than the non-disease genes. Consequently, the authors used HITS and spread hubs, which are based on the degree of a node, as a seed selection mechanism to select some important nodes from the network. After that, for each seed node, they applied a seed expansion algorithm that uses the Personalized PageRank score to rank the nodes in the neighborhood of a seed node. The nodes were added to the module one by one based on their ranking and the modularity score was re-calculated after adding every node. The set of nodes with the maximum modularity formed a module. We used their code (seed selection and seed expansion) released on GitHub: https ://githu b.com/Raman Lab/ Disea seMod uleId entifi cati on. We applied the same co-expression network used in Core&Peel as input data. The only tunable parameter of this method is the number of the seed nodes to set in the seed nodes selection script. The authors tested different values of this parameter (see 'Co-expression network' Table S4 in the Supplementary Material of the original paper https ://www.front iersi n.org/artic les/10.3389/fgene .2019.00164 /full#suppl ement ary-mater ial) but we chose the maximum one (4099) since the smaller the value, the fewer disease-enriched modules were detected. Using this value, we generated the maximum number of HITS and spread hubs seed nodes; in particular the algorithm found 1423 and 1279 HITS and spread hubs, respectively. Additionally we filtered the modules detected by this method according to the same Jaccard index used in Core&Peel to have the same rate of overlap between the two methods.",

The peeling procedure stops when the number of nodes drops below the minimum size threshold or when the density is above or equal to the minimum density threshold. Finally, the duplicates were removed, and if two subgraphs were too similar according to the Jaccard coefficient, the biggest one was retained.

The subgraph minimum density (d) and the maximum Jaccard coefficient (j) varied from 0.5 to 1.0, and the minimum subgraph size (nl) was set to 10 or 20.

The normalized data were downloaded using the GEOquery R package 83 . Differential expression analyses have been carried out with limma 84 setting the FDR threshold to 0.05 and FC lower threshold |log(FC)| \u2265 1 . We decided to increase the FDR threshold respect to that one chosen for the TCGA data to obtain a higher number of DEGs. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ COVID-19 data. We retrieved the DEGs from three COVID-19 datasets included in two different studies. In the first study, Xiong et al. 30 carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) specimens of COVID-19 patients. In both cases, they compared the case with healthy patients, and we retrieved the DEGs using the pipeline released by authors. Instead, Blanco-Melo et al. 29 infected the human adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cells with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-cells case) and compared them with controls. The authors released only the statistical parameters (ex: logFC, adjusted p value, etc...) from the DEA for each gene. We selected the DEGs choosing the FDR less than 0.05 and |log(FC)| \u2265 1 . Additionally, the R DESeq package was used to perform DEA in all the three COVID-19 studies, but the authors released their data differently; in the first work the DEA code was available on GitHub (https ://githu b.com/zhouy ulab/ncov/tree/maste r/figs), in the second one only the summary statistics were made available (Supplementary Table S2 in https ://www.biorx iv.org/conte nt/10.1101/2020.03.24.00465 5v1.suppl ement ary-mater ial).",

As in the previous case of the Ebola enriched module, in a hypothetical scenario, finding such HIV-enriched modules in the human transcriptional response to COVID-19 in late 2019/early 2020 would further support the choice of testing lopinavir by Cao et al. in early 2020. A few more drugs (or pre-drugs) effective in HIV therapy have been tested by Jockusch et al.42 and demonstrate potency in inhibiting SARS-CoV2 viral replication in cell cultures. The Staphylococcus aureus infection, and T-Cell antigen Receptor (TCR) pathway during Staphylococcus aureus infection WP3863 pathways are detected in Supplementary Tables S6, S7 and S8; while Staphylococcus aureus infection is detected in Table S6. Staphylococcus aureus is known to produce pulmonary infections 43 thus it is a reasonable hypothesis that human response to S.aureus could share similarities at a molecular level with the COVID-19 response. Moreover, since several strands of S.aureus have developed resistance to traditional antibiotics, a new generation of antibiotic drugs have been introduced recently to cope with it. A listing of antibiotic drugs under consideration for repurposing on COVID-19 is reported in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ COVID-19_drug_repurposing_research and lists five antibiotics, among these four: Teicoplanin, Oritavancin, Dalbavancin, and Monensin are effective against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) 44-47 .
