Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in the treatment of COVID-19, but whether it is helpful for discharged patients is still unknown. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the impacts of TCM treatment on the convalescents of COVID-19. Methods: A total of 372 COVID-19 convalescents from February 21 to May 3 in Shenzhen, China were retrospectively analyzed, 291 of them accepted clinically examined at least once and 191 convalescents accepted TCM. Results: After retrospective analysis of the clinical data of convalescents accepted TCM treatment or not, we found that the white blood cell count, as well as serum interleukin-6 and procalcitonin decreased in TCM group. Serum \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase was significantly decreased, while prealbumin and albumin increased in TCM group. Red blood cell, hemoglobin, and platelet count increased in TCM group. The mechanisms of TCM treatment might be the overall regulations, including balanced immune response, improved hematopoiesis and coagulation systems, enhanced functions of liver and heart, increased nutrient intake and lipid metabolism. Conclusions: This study suggested that TCM treatment would be beneficial for discharged COVID-19 patients. However, long-term medical observation and further study with randomized trial should be done to confirm this result. Besides, the potential molecular mechanisms of TCM treatment should be further revealed.",

The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization included myocardial injury [1] , liver dysfunction [2] , kidney related complications [3] , abnormal peripheral blood system [4] , hypolipidemia [5] , and hematological complications [6] . There is still no specific treatment available for COVID-19 patients currently, and the vaccines and targeted drugs are still in developing with time-consuming and arduous [7] .

TCM has been recommended and widely used, and made vast contribution to the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of COVID-19 in China since January 25, 2020 [10] . A total of 60,107 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China were treated with TCM by February 17, 2020 [11] . A review described the herbal medicine and pattern identification for treating COVID-19, there were 8 pattern identifications and 23 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 11 pattern identifications and 31 herbal formulae for the moderate stage, 8 pattern identifications and 21 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 6 pattern identifications and 23 herbal formulae for the recovery stage in the Chinese guidelines [12] . The functions and mechanisms of TCM are very complex, and the most important rules may be to regulate and enhance immune system [13] , and accelerate the rehabilitation. In addition, network pharmacology analysis predicted that TCM have general roles, including regulating viral infection, immune/ inflammation reactions, and the hypoxia response in vivo [14] .",

Previously research reported that renal abnormalities such as proteinuria and hematuria often resolved in COVID-19 patients within 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms [3] . Anti-COVID-19 medicines have been reported to cause adverse side effects to kidney. Some TCM including Huang Qi, Fu Ling, Bai Zhu, Di Huang, Shan Yao, etc., might be beneficial in treating renal injury in the battle of COVID-19. The present study showed that TCM treatment didn't significantly affect the recovery of blood renal indicators, which might due to the fact that renal indicators have all returned to normal after discharge. In the future study, we will detect cytokines in urine to further reveal the recovery of renal function of COVID-19 patients and the influence of TCM.",

For example, the monocyte and IL-6 in convalescence period are naturally decreased, and may bring bias. In addition, the sample size was small and the follow-up time was short. Besides, the potential mechanisms of TCM treatment and effective compounds about TCM formula are still unclear. Above all, further study with prospective design or randomized trial should be done to confirm these results, and the molecular mechanisms of TCM treatment should be the further research directions.",
