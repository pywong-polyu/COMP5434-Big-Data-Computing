According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 20 th , 2021, there have been 5,127,696 deaths and 255,324,963 confirmed cases of COVID-19 [1] . COVID-19 disease seems to be spreading through airborne transmission via aerosol, and as it is known that respiratory infections mainly occur when breathing, speaking, sneezing, coughing, or talking occurs. These transmissions are facilitated by droplets (> 5 to 10 \u00b5m) and/or aerosols (\u2264 5 \u00b5m) containing the virus SARS-CoV-2 (ref). Aerosol's accumulation, also known as the \"gas cloud,\" could remain infectious for hours in indoor spaces. Thus, the implementation of masks or respirators has a tremendous effect on reducing aerosol transmission [2] [3] [4] [5] . This physical protection is in use and has been adopted globally.",

In our study, the respirators contained at least one layer of polypropylene, suggesting that an electrostatic layer increased the retention of the virus.
