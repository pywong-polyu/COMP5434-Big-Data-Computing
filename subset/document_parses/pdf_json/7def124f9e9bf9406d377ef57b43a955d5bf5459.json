We aimed to determine the association between ARF management strategy and in-hospital mortality. Materials and methods: Patients in the Weill Cornell Covid-19 registry who developed ARF between March 5 -March 25, 2020 were exposed to an early IMV strategy; between March 26 -April 1, 2020 to an intermediate strategy; and after April 2 to prolonged observation. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model in-hospital mortality and test an interaction between ARF management strategy and modified sequential organ failure assessment (mSOFA). Results: Among 632 patients with ARF, 24% of patients in the early IMV strategy died versus 28% in prolonged observation. At lower mSOFA, prolonged observation was associated with lower mortality compared to early IMV (at mSOFA = 0, HR 0.16 [95% CI 0.04-0.57]). Mortality risk increased in the prolonged observation strategy group with each point increase in mSOFA score (HR 1.29 [95% CI 1.10-1.51], p = 0.002). Conclusion: In Covid-19 ARF, prolonged observation was associated with a mortality benefit at lower mSOFA scores, and increased mortality at higher mSOFA scores compared to early IMV.",

The rationale for an early IMV strategy included 1) avoiding emergent intubation and peri-intubation complications in patients with limited reserve, and 2) minimizing aerosolization from HFNC and subsequent risk of Covid-19 transmission to healthcare workers. Moreover, an early IMV strategy was supported by prior observational data in non-Covid-19 ARF showing that delaying invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality [3] .",

While providing essential support, IMV is fraught with risks including ventilator-induced lung injury [4] [5] [6] , ventilator associated pneumonia [7] [8] [9] , deconditioning [10] , and sedation related complications such as delirium [11] . IMV is resource intensive, requiring lower nurse to patient ratios and frequent respiratory therapy support. Given risks for IMV related complications and concerns about ventilator shortages, prolonged observation and higher thresholds for intubation were eventually adopted by many centers during the COVID-19 pandemic [12] , including WCM and LMH. Higher thresholds for intubation included tolerating higher levels of hypoxia and the use of supportive devices such as HFNC. HFNC reduces the work of breathing and provides positive distending pressure, enabling lung recruitment and potentially avoiding IMV [13] . Although some observational data suggest that HFNC can decrease the need for IMV, the safety of a policy that includes the use of HFNC and continuous positive airway pressure in Covid-19 associated ARF is unknown [14] [15] [16] .",

Given that our institutions practiced both approaches at different times in the initial surge of the pandemic, there is an opportunity to study the potential impact of an early IMV versus prolonged observation strategy. The objective of this study was to compare in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19 related ARF managed with an early IMV strategy versus a prolonged observation strategy. Prior literature in non-COVID ARF has shown a mortality benefit for non-invasive ventilation prior to consideration of IMV in a carefully selected patient population with fewer organ failures [17, 18] . We therefore hypothesized that the association of a prolonged observation strategy with mortality would vary based on the severity of illness at the time of developing ARF.",

Reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction assays performed on nasopharyngeal swab specimens confirmed Covid-19 cases. Registry data were manually abstracted from electronic health records using a structured abstraction tool with a quality control protocol.

Exclusion criteria included 1) transfer from a hospital outside of WCM and LMH, and 2) do not intubate or do not resuscitate order (DNR/DNI) prior to developing ARF. Specific protocols adopted by our institution, such as approach to staffing and resource distribution, have been previously described.

In addition, this threshold was employed due to initial concerns about rapid patient deterioration, to minimize emergent intubation and reduce healthcare worker exposure. As the surge in New York City progressed during March of 2020 with ICU resource constraints, and increased acceptability of HFNC, we adopted a \"prolonged observation strategy\". In this strategy, patients were closely monitored by intensivists while tolerating increasing hypoxia. While there was no specific oxygen saturation threshold for intubation, the prior strategy of intubating all individuals requiring more than 6 L of nasal cannula was no longer employed. Instead, a combination of nasal cannula, non-rebreather and HFNC were used to provide continued respiratory support, with clinician judgment based on level of respiratory distress guiding intubation decisions.",

Hernandez-Romieu et al [34] at Emory University and Hyman et al [35] at Mount Sinai Health System both compared timing of initiating IMV and mortality in severe Covid-19. The Emory study modelled time from intensive care unit admission to intubation and in-hospital mortality-no difference in mortality was found in patients intubated within 8 h, 8-24 h, and greater than 24 h. The Mount Sinai group studied the association between each additional day from time to hospital admission to intubation and in-hospital mortality. Their analysis revealed a very small increase in mortality with each additional day from admission to intubation (HR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.05]). Limitations of both studies were that the study population only included patients who received IMV. Consequently, these studies could not account for the potential mortality impact among patients with ARF who avoided intubation altogether using non-invasive support. Our study addressed this limitation by including all patients who developed ARF and therefore were at risk for intubation -and now shows that the association of ARF management strategy with mortality is influenced by illness severity at the time of developing ARF.",

            "text": "The increased mortality we describe associated with a prolonged observation strategy at higher illness severity scores has not been previously reported in severe Covid-19. In our study, the prolonged observation strategy was supported through the use of HFNC. An increased risk of HFNC failure with higher SOFA scores has been shown in populations with Covid-19 and mixed ARF [36, 37] . We theorize that HFNC failure may subsequently put patients at increased risk for emergent intubation, which can increase the risk of complications. Prolonged observation exposes patients to both the detrimental effects of selfinflicted lung injury while on HFNC and ventilator associated complications once intubated [4] . Early mechanical ventilation may be more beneficial in patients with multi-system organ failure to assist work of breathing and increase perfusion. An alternative hypothesis is that clinical factors such as frailty may influence decision making on timing of intubation, leading to a bias in some individuals in the prolonged observation strategy being selected for a less invasive approach with HFNC. This bias would not have been present in the early-IMV group where more concerted efforts may have been made about goals of care, leading to these patients being excluded from our analysis. The availability of resources and skilled personnel should be considered when evaluating the generalizability of our findings. Under all strategies, intensivists performed serial reassessments of patients with ARF for further deterioration. Patients who were observed for longer periods of time tended to be more hypoxic at time of intubation. When intubation was deemed necessary, it was performed by a dedicated airway team consisting of a respiratory therapist and two experienced airway operators: an anesthesiologist and a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA). Having multiple experienced airway operators with designated responsibilities allowed for difficult airway management and expedient intubations in situations where patients had low reserve and rapid desaturation. Specific protocols were developed to facilitate patient safety and speed, including pre-oxygenation coaching, use of video laryngoscope technology, and intubation in the more technically challenging semi-recumbent position to maximize functional residual capacity and avoid bag mask ventilation. An intensivist assisted with managing post-intubation ventilation and hemodynamic complications. At medical centers with less clinical staffing or overwhelming patient volume, this level of clinician support may not be available, and may increase the risk associated with a prolonged observation strategy.",

            "text": "A strength of our study is that our institutions used evidence-based practices for lung protective ventilation and prone positioning starting from the beginning of the pandemic. Therefore, injurious ventilation is unlikely to be a confounder in the early IMV group. A separate analysis Abbreviations: mSOFA = modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. IMV = invasive mechanical ventilation. 1 This model is additionally adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, hospital strain, inhospital receipt of steroids, smoking history, body mass index, and comorbidities (coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma, renal disease, and active malignancy). 2 The hazard ratios presented here are the changing association of ARF management strategy with mortality with each point increase in mSOFA score. was previously published describing important mechanical ventilation parameters among patients with Covid-19 who were intubated between March 1st 2020 to April 20,2020 at our institution. In this cohort, the median day 3 (n = 252) tidal volume was 6.38 (6.00-6.97) cc/kg of ideal body weight (IBW), driving pressure was 12.0 cm H 2 0 (9.0-15.2), and median plateau pressure was 24.0 cm H 2 0 (20.0-28.0) [22] . Our results should be interpreted within the context of the following limitations. There were lower numbers of individuals at low mSOFA scores, therefore our estimates of the association between ARF management strategy and mortality may be less precise at these values. As more critically ill patients with severe Covid-19 were admitted, \"pop-up intensive care units\" were created on general medicine floors. Geographic dispersion of patients with primary pulmonary conditions to other medical units has previously been shown to negatively impact outcomes [40] . We adjusted our analysis for this potential confounder by including hospital strain as a covariate. We caution that mortality declined dramatically over the course of the spring outbreak for reasons that are not well understood. The decline in mortality over the course of the initial outbreak of Covid-19 has been reported across hospital systems in New York City as well as in other geographic areas [41] [42] [43] . It is possible that the unmeasured confounders leading to this decline complicate the association between ARF management strategy and in-hospital mortality. Additional unmeasured confounders include differences in frailty, performance status, nurse staffing ratios, and receipt of physical therapy which may have led to differences in mortality over time, independent of the ARF management strategy. In our second sensitivity analysis, we considered just the first three weeks that the prolonged observation strategy was in effect and compared mortality to the early-IMV group. This was an attempt to limit the influence of time-varying confounders as the entire study period was then shortened from March 2020 to early April 2020 rather than extending out to patients who developed ARF in May 2020. This analysis showed the same association between rising mSOFA scores, prolonged observation and mortality.",
