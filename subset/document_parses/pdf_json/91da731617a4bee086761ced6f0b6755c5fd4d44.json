As the era of precision medicine and personalized treatment evolves, the utility of generalized diagnostic checklists must be balanced with an appreciation for individually expressed symptoms for diseases but especially within the context of neurologic disease. More than any other organ, the human brain as a consequence of its immense complexity defines our uniqueness not only from other species but more importantly from each other; not surprisingly, the manifestations of brain disease are correspondingly diverse, varying from person to person. An exemplary illustration of individualized symptom expression is the personality and behavioural change that sometimes accompanies traumatic brain injury. Henry VIII and Winston Churchill are clinically instructive when appreciating inter-individual variability in disease expression.",

In his youth, he would frequently wrestle or joust multiple times in a single day, often being thrown heavily or struck several times within hours. In June 1520, Henry VIII wrestled Francis I of France. Details are few, but Henry was defeated when Francis using a wrestling technique known as the Breton trip, vigorously threw Henry to the ground, stunning him [3]. In March 1524, Henry was de-horsed during a jousting match after a lance struck him in the head through his open visor; despite being confused and suffering from a severe headache, he continued to joust throughout the day (and went on to suffer from chronic headaches after this accident) [4] . One year later, while attempting to pole-vault over a hedge, the pole broke with Henry falling heavily, striking his head and becoming unconscious, having to be dragged out of a watery ditch [5] . Then, on January 24, 1536, Henry VIII experienced his most significant concussion. While jousting, not only was he unseated but the fully armoured horse fell squarely upon his head leaving him unconscious for 2 hours [6] . Fearing death was imminent, preparations were being made to notify his successor when Henry unexpectedly regained consciousness. Thus, throughout his life Henry VIII had at least three or four major concussions and probably many other lesser ones.",

In 1889, as a 14-year old Harrow schoolboy ascertaining how fast he could ride a tricycle, he swerved and crashed with such force that he was in the sickroom for a week with a concussion [10] . Four years later, while playing chase with his cousins he jumped from a bridge falling 30 feet to the ground, sustaining a head injury that left him unconscious for 3 days [11] . Fearing death was imminent, his father uncharacteristically curtailed a trip abroad to return to his bedside; Churchill convalesced for months before returning to normal. In 1895, as a cadet at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, his horse \"refused and swerved\" on the steeplechase course, flinging him with such force that he was in bed for three days recovering [12] . In 1921, he was thrown from a camel as he visited the Sphinx with Lawrence of Arabia [13] . In 1922, while participating in a polo practice, he was somersaulted off of a pony landing heavily on his head-\"every scrap of wind was knocked out of my body\" leaving me in a state of \"speechless consternation\" requiring several days of recovery [14] . Beyond these multiple horse accidents, Churchill also sustained injuries whilst piloting an aircraft: having just taken off from Croydon Aerodrome, the aircraft stalled at 90 feet, plunging back to the ground leaving Churchill dazed and heavily bruised [15] . Finally, there are Churchill's multiple automobile accidents in June 1914, February 1920, September 1921 and June 1926 [16] [17] [18] . However, his most significant motor vehicle accident was on December 13, 1931, when Churchill, forgetting that he was in America looked the wrong way when crossing a road and was struck by a car travelling 35 mph [19] . Churchill was transferred to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a concussion and contusions of the forehead requiring sutures [20] . Thus, throughout his life, Churchill had at least three or four major concussions and probably many lesser ones.",

Then at age 65 (when most people retire), Churchill became prime minister, wielding bold, implacable leadership in the face of overwhelming odds and emerging as a freedom fighter who prevented Britain from being invaded, thereby helping to save Western liberal democracy. His successes continued post-war. In 1953 he was awarded The Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values\". Winston Churchill's legacy is as Britain's most famous Prime Minister. Despite his unpredictable and enigmatic personality, he was an eloquent orator and an outstanding leader enthused with ambition and the courage to win at all costs. It is reported that in the late 1950s, an American schoolgirl posted a letter addressed simply to \"The Greatest Man in the World\"-the U.S. Postal Service forwarded it to the Royal Mail which delivered it to Churchill's home address [21] .",

However, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) emerges as the most viable contender [4, 24] . The memory problems, depression, headaches, insomnia, obesity, grandiosity, unpredictability, emotional dysregulation, sociopathy, are all possible consequence of CTE secondary to repetitive head trauma [24] .

Although much has been written about Churchill's depression [26] , others dispute this maintaining that Churchill's referral to the Black Dog is over-interpreted and overstated [27] ; also disputed is Churchill's drinking history [28] . Churchill had multiple medical problems including bouts of pneumonia, appendicitis, hypertension, a myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation and multiple ischaemic strokes. Yet despite this, he endured the incredible stress of leading wartime Britain. There is no evidence of chronic headache, no early dementia (except in the last years of life when multiple strokes yielded some cognitive impairment), no evidence of CTE or Alzheimer's disease. Rather than spiralling into self-destructive despair, Churchill (at age 65 years) rose magnificently to the physically and mentally draining task of leading Britain and much of the free world during humankind's bloodiest conflict. Although Churchill is still widely revered, in recent years his, comments on race and steadfast support of imperialist views have generated controversy, adding a dark side to his otherwise lionized legacy.",

Multiple brain regions are particularly susceptible to laterally sustained physical injury; for instance, the hippocampus, amygdala and mesial temporal structures are susceptible to both glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and physical impact forces. These neuroanatomical regions, vulnerable to neurochemical and biomechanical injury, are key players in fear conditioning, contextual memory consolidation and retrieval of emotional memories [29] . Head injuries sustained through physical trauma applied either frontally or posteriorly to the cranium can affect the orbitofrontal cortex as well as causing frontal subcortical axonal injury via a coup-contrecoup process. Recovery from such brain injuries is variable with deficits in executive function (particularly working memory) persisting often for years. The mechanism of these ongoing behavioural deficits arises from reduced connectivity in working memory-relevant neurophysiological networks, including the default mode, central executive, dorsal attention and salience networks [30] . This persistent disconnection syndrome may persist for years with recovery being highly individualized, as well exemplified by Henry VIII and Churchill.",

As demonstrated by Henry VIII and multiple modern-day athletes, repeated head trauma can have devastating delayed effects [31] . However, accidents happen, and not all concussions are avoidable. The person who has sustained a concussion should hold out hope that on the Tudor-Churchill spectrum they lay towards the Churchill end. Such hope is good, especially in brain disease. The implications of the Tudor-Churchill spectrum are not confined to concussions. Individual symptoms and disease manifestations vary widely across the full spectrum of human disease including depression, asthma, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus and infections, as recently exemplified by widely different clinical presentations for the COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Paraphrasing Sir William Osler, we should avoid sweeping generalizations and care for the individual not the disease. The Tudor-Churchill spectrum is the model of interindividual variability and reminds us that every person is unique, deserving of individualized thought, personalized diagnosis and tailored treatment, especially within the context of chronic brain disease.",
