In the last decade, multiple M. tuberculosis molecular epidemiology studies have shown how genomic information can complement traditional epidemiology in identifying person-to-person transmission clusters with a high level of resolution. Typically, the number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) disagreements between genomes, or SNP distance, is calculated and single-linkage clustering is performed for genomes falling within retrospectively established transmission thresholds of either 5 or 12 SNPs. Just as with DST, these thresholds were established with Illumina sequencing data.

First: a systematic head-to-head comparison of Nanopore and Illumina data for M. tuberculosis drug susceptibility profiling and isolate clustering, including quantitative metrics for cluster precision and recall. Second: an assessment of the impact of mixed Illumina and Nanopore data on clustering which represents an increasingly common challenge. Third: an open-source software pipeline allowing research and reference laboratories to replicate our analytical approach.

Our data confirms that Illumina and Nanopore sequencing technologies can be used to identify those mutations equally accurately in M. tuberculosis. Bacterial molecular typing is constantly shown to support the understanding of disease transmission and tuberculosis control in new settings. The bioinformatics tools and filters we have developed, assessed, and made publicly available allow the use of Nanopore or mixed-technology data to appropriately cluster genetically related isolates. We provide a measure of the expected level of over-clustering Introduction Ten years of progress in reducing the global burden of tuberculosis (TB) have likely been lost due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with 1\u00b74 million fewer patients diagnosed and treated in 2020 than in 2019. 1,2 Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment are key to setting the global effort to end TB back on course. 3 Understanding and interrupting transmission are equally important, as is implementing appropriate therapy for every patient. In high-income settings, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has become an attractive solution to both these challenges, with some settings now relying predominantly on WGS for drug susceptibility testing (DST) and implementation of individualised therapeutic regimens, 4 in addition to the well documented benefits of using these data for surveillance and outbreak control. 5 The necessary high capital outlay for sequencing platform acquisition has limited access to TB WGS analyses in many high-burden, low-income settings. With the availability of multiple DNA sequencing platforms, simplified access to interpretation of sequencing data 5 and curated genomic databases, 6 more countries are now integrating DNA sequencing within TB control programs for either or both DST and epidemiological surveillance. 7 Illumina sequencing platforms are the market leaders and are the established reference standard for TB genomic next generation sequencing (NGS). Per-base sequencing accuracy is extremely high, making this an attractive tool for both susceptibility testing and for surveillance, where just a few erroneous basecalls can be the difference between triggering public health interventions, or not. Significant validation and accreditation work has led to integration of this technology within routine clinical diagnostics in some settings (e.g. UK, the Netherlands, New York State). Illumina technology requires large capital outlay and significant testing volume to ensure clinically appropriate turn-around times while remaining cost-efficient. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offer a more transportable solution in the form of their handheld MinION sequencing platform (referred to as Nanopore henceforth). To date, a major obstacle for ONT's technology has been its basecalling error rate. However, as the technology has matured and its basecalling software has improved, it is now increasingly integrated in public health laboratories. 8, 9 Although laboratory infrastructure is still required for TB culture, DNA extraction, and library preparation, the Nanopore sequencing platform's inherent portability and relatively lower cost represent a clear opportunity for settings to benefit from WGS technology where it has hitherto been out of reach.",

For Illumina thresholds 5 and 12, we selected the respective Nanopore SNP threshold that gave the best balance of SACR, SACP, and XCR values (Suppl. Section S11). As we sought to minimise the number of isolates missed from their true cluster, a higher SACR is favoured. We selected Nanopore SNP thresholds of 6 and 12 (see Suppl. Figure S3 ). In Figure 4 we show Illumina and Nanopore clusters at these thresholds. Nodes represent isolates, coloured according to their Illumina clusters. We find isolates clustered together by Illumina remain clustered with Nanopore (nodes of the same colour are connected). At threshold 5, the Illumina clusters are recapitulated, but two Illumina-singleton isolates are adjoined to cluster 2 (dark orange), and seven Illuminasingleton isolates are combined into two new clusters of five and two isolates. At threshold 12, clusters 1 and 2, and clusters 7 and 8 are merged by Nanopore. In both cases, the Illumina maximal SNP distance between isolates included in these clusters is 13 -one above the established threshold. There are also five Illumina singletons which are adjoined to pre-existing clusters by Nanopore. Figure 4 also shows the metrics SACP, SACR, and XCR for each threshold, providing some intuition for how the values correspond to changes in clustering. Note, for example, that SACP for threshold 12 is 0\u00b7817. For both thresholds, the SACR value is 1\u00b70, meaning Nanopore does not miss any isolates from their correct cluster. All clusters exclusively regroup isolates from a same single country. Additionally, isolates from the same patient (n=8) were also clustered together by both technologies.",

We generated 1000 simulated datasets for each value in a range of Nanopore:Illumina ratios (0\u00b701, 0\u00b705, 0\u00b71, 0\u00b725, 0\u00b75, 0\u00b775, and 0\u00b79), and measured the impact on SACR, SACP, and XCR.

The other discrepancy was a katG 1bp deletion in a separate isolate. (There were also two further mutations (each in one isolate) which we did not classify as discrepant, where a resistance mutation was detected with both Nanopore and Illumina, but filtered in the Illumina calls due to low coverage (rrs a1401g and rrs a514c)). For further details see Suppl. Section S9.1. A summary of concordance of predictions is shown in Table 1 . These results lead to the key observation for evaluating the utility of Nanopore data as a replacement or complement for Illumina for obtaining genotypic DST: if genotyping at resistance mutations is highly concordant (here 100% for SNPs and >99.99% for indels), then this concordance should be retained as catalogues of resistance mutations are improved. .

The first question is technology-independent and has been the subject of many studies over recent years. Multiple studies have compiled catalogues of resistance mutations, 4, 10, 11, 19 and recently the WHO has published a knowledgebase of high confidence mutations intended to provide a solid foundation for future catalogues. 6 Given perfect sequencing, the catalogue determines how well DST can be predicted, which is inexorably improving as the global community collects progressively more data.

These translate into 5-and 12-SNP clusters congruent with those produced by Illumina data. One can be highly confident that isolates will not be omitted from \"true\" transmission clusters -i.e., those that Illumina data would deem clustered. We find that where Nanopore over-clusters compared with Illumina, the additional isolates are closely related and just beyond the Illumina threshold. In terms of genotyping resistance-causing SNPs and indels, the two technologies give almost identical results using Mykrobe -four discordances amongst 151 isolates x 66,537 nucleotide-level resistance-conferring mutations in the catalogue gives a concordance >99.99%. We conclude that (given >30x depth) Nanopore data can generate functionally equivalent data to Illumina for our specific pragmatic goals (resistance prediction and cluster detection).",
