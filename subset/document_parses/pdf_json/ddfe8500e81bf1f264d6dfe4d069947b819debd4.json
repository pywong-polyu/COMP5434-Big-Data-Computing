It is still poorly understood if the development of health services, clinical management, and scientific evidence is associated with better medical outcomes, sustained in the long term, for patients of each gender. 2-6 Strong evidence on the trends of mortality would help to evaluate the progress made so far, and inform future clinical practice, research, and health policies.
