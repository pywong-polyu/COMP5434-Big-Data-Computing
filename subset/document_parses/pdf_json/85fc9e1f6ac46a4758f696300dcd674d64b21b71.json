Promoting renewables is a robust policy action in world energy-based economies. This study examines if an increase in renewables production has a positive effect on the Brazilian economy, partially offsetting the SARS-CoV2 outbreak recession. Using data on Brazilian economy, we test the contribution of renewables on the economy via a ML architecture (through a LSTM model). Empirical findings show that an ever-greater use of renewables may sustain the economic growth recovery, generating a better performing GDP acceleration vs. other energy variables.",

World economies are falling into an unprecedented deep freezing state, from which the recovery will be neither direct, nor automatic.

A largescale transformation of the global energy sector is possible, though it will require significant investments. For this reason, it is a shared goal of policy action to change worldwide the future energy matrix into a more sustainable and renewable sources scheme.

The case of Brazil is representative: it has a great potential for all renewable resources, via its geographical position that provides an excellent cycle of nature concerning climate issues. Therefore, it could use the environmental sustainability tool as an engine of economic recovery from SARS-CoV2, implementing a rapid process of structural changes, exploring a more intensive use of renewables, thus fostering GDP growth. In particular, enhancing investments in this sector, Brazil could mitigate the effects of the domestic and international economic crisis caused by COVID-19. It has abundant resources of solar, wind, biomass, and ocean energy, and is the third largest energy market in the world for renewables, after China and the United States, with very ambitious goals in this sector for the future. These conditions make it possible to switch in the long term to renewable features that differentiate the Brazilian energy matrix from the world one. Its extensive endowment of natural resources allows the realization of sustainable projects able to support the growing electricity demand, enforcing economic development. Appropriate transmission networks will encourage producing, delivering and consuming energy, efficiently connecting new production centers to the Brazilian megalopolises.",

This condition will support a new ruling in the Latin American electric sector via the creation of a \"Single Latin American Electricity Market\".

Promoting renewable energy policy measures are, therefore, one of the biggest challenges for this country. The Northeast region is the primary producer of wind energy. With 135 parks, Rio Grande do Norte is the state where most of the energies produced use the force of the winds, with 3678.85 MW of installed capacity.

It increases the consumption and accessibility of energy across Brazil to over 1.4 million people who are not fully exposed to renewable energy sources (Newman 2017) .

Others, instead, using different econometric approaches, claim the presence of a negative correlation between the two variables. In particular, Inglesi-Lotz (2016) stated an inconsistent result, estimating a negative correlation between renewables and growth. These findings were also corroborated by Oliveira and Trindade (2018) , showing that the Energy Returns on Investments for recycled energy is much lower than on technology; hence, clean energy sources are highly unlikely to be the primary sources of power in the future due to such a substantial disparity.

Different factors prompted the attention to the generation and use of renewable energy. Among them are the growing part of the population that still cannot be fully supplied with hydropower, the depletion of fossil fuel, and the increasing number of motor vehicles, and other equipment, which requires energy for operations. In the face of an increase in energy consumption in Brazil, many researchers are still trying to prove the existence of a long-term causal relationship on the usage of renewable energy sources and the related change in terms of growth.",

(2020a Magazzino et al. ( , 2020b Magazzino et al. ( , 2021 , and Mele and Magazzino (2021) . Unlike traditional regression methods, ML is non-parametric techniques. Besides, they are not bound by a functional form but are free from the assumption of statistical distribution. In parametric techniques, such as linear regression, an increase in the independent variable determines only a variation, positive or negative, on the dependent variable. In ML techniques, on the other hand, the effect of the independent variable on the dependent one can produce a different result due to the levels and interactions with other variables. The ability to capture these interactions through different values of variables allows these techniques to go beyond traditional parametric models. With this approach, we estimate, in an historical context from 1980 to 2018, the acceleration probability of Brazilian GDP (dGDP) with a larger use of renewable energy consumption (Renewable energy consumption). We use a combination of four variables (Table 1) The algorithm construction model, predicting the acceleration between the target (dGDP) and the three inputs, is based on a complex mathematical function. The starting mathematical formulation is as follows:",
