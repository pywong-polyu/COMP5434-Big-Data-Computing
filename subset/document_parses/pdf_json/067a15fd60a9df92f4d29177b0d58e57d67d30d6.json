We examine hospital avoidance behaviors during the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. The outbreak provides an excellent setting for the analysis because unlike the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) situation, no mandatory lockdown was imposed during the outbreak, and the economic impact was also not large. Hence, reduced hospital visits are likely to reflect the public's intention to avoid hospitals to protect themselves from getting infected with MERS. Moreover, the outbreak did not spread to the entire country and vanished after a short period of time, allowing us to consider the affected regions as the treatment group and the other regions as the control group without much concern of confounding by other factors. The data come from a government agency, which assesses (national) health insurance claims made by hospitals, and hence cover all outpatient visits in the country. We find that people reduced outpatient visits by about 17% in response to the MERS outbreak, and the response was the most intense when new cases were reported most frequently.",

            "text": "Existing literature shows that during contagious disease outbreaks, people exhibit disease avoidance behaviors. For instance, behaviors reported in response to the HIV outbreak include pregnancy avoidance (Kaida et al., 2011; Moore et al., 2014) , reduced frequency of sexual activity (Gregson et al., 1998) , and increased condom usage (Ahituv et al., 1996) . Following outbreaks of respiratory diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the novel influenza virus A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, hospital avoidance (Bennett et al., 2015) and increased handwashing (Jones and Salathe, 2009; Ag\u00fcero and Beleche, 2017) were reported. 1 Among these behaviors, we examine hospital avoidance. Unlike practices like handwashing, hospital avoidance could worsen health; hence, a policy intervention is necessary so that patients can seek health care services without fear of infection. Relatedly, De Rosa et al. (2020) found that heart attack fatality rates rose in Italy during March 12-19, 2020, which coincided with the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak, possibly due to a reduction in admissions for acute myocardial infarction.",

The outbreak is appropriate for analysis in that this disease had never been known to the country and the first death was reported only 10 days after the outbreak began, coming as an unexpected health shock to the public. Nevertheless, unlike the COVID-19 situation, where the policy of social distancing or stay-at-home was implemented, no such policy was imposed during the MERS outbreak, possibly because most of the infections occurred in hospitals, which implies that reduced outpatient visits, if any, were likely due to the public's own intention to avoid contracting the disease, and not because of any governmental mandate. Relatedly, previous studies that estimated the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare utilization (Al\u00e9-Chilet et al., 2020; Ziedan et al., 2020; Chatterji and Li, 2021) likely include the effect of mandatory policies of lockdown, in addition to the effect of voluntary behaviors such as hospital avoidance. Al\u00e9-Chilet et al. (2020) found that non-respiratory emergency visits in Chile dropped by 57% in mid-March 2020. Ziedan et al. (2020) found a 40% drop in outpatient visits in the U.S. after the first week of March 2020, while Chatterji and Li (2021) reported that the number of outpatient visits per provider in the U.S. fell by 67% in the week of April 12, 2020.",

The data come from the National Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service, which assesses health insurance claims made by hospitals.

            "text": "This study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, although many studies have examined disease avoidance behaviors, only a few, especially studies on COVID-19, have examined hospital avoidance or the effect on the number of hospital visits. By presenting new evidence, our study expands the literature and highlights the need for policy intervention to discourage hospital avoidance. Second, many studies have examined disease avoidance behaviors through surveys asking how people respond to a particular disease (e.g., Jones and Salathe, 2009; Kaida et al., 2011; Ag\u00fcero and Beleche, 2017) , but like Bennett et al. (2015) and the COVID-19 studies described previously, our study is based on real data, which are likely to reflect people's behaviors in response to contagious disease outbreaks more clearly. Third, as described, because South Korea has a national health insurance system, the data used in this study cover every outpatient visit in the country and are therefore representative of the population. Lastly, the relatively small number of MERS cases in the country means hospital visits from those infected with the disease would have been few, so there is no likelihood of bias arising from their visits. The incidence of COVID-19, on the other hand, is relatively high (about 34,000 cases in South Korea as of November 30, 2020), so hospital visits from infected persons are likely to lead to an underestimation of the effect on hospital avoidance.",

We expect the largest effect in June, because, as shown in Fig. 1 , the maximum number of cases was reported during that month, with almost every day recording new cases. In addition, although the outbreak was announced on the day the first patient was diagnosed, the details of the patients, such as their place of residence and the hospitals they visited, were not announced until early June. The estimates for betas indicate changes in outpatient visits due to improved health as a result of disease avoidance behavior such as mask-wearing and hand hygiene, in addition to hospital avoidance during sickness to prevent MERS infection. Because mask-wearing and hand hygiene could be attributed to the intention to protect their health and thus avoid a hospital visit to prevent MERS infection, we consider reduced outpatient visits due to health protection behavior to be an indirect form of hospital avoidance. It is noteworthy that a decline in outpatient visits due to this behavior is likely to be relatively small, because the number of people suffering from aliments like the common cold which are preventable by mask-wearing and hand hygiene is the least in June, July, and August. 12 Further, although increased hygiene can improve health (e.g., Ag\u00fcero and Beleche, 2017) , any health improvement that is substantial enough to deter hospital visits is not very likely in a sanitized country like South Korea. 13 The estimates could be biased in the following ways. First, we use the remaining 12 regions as a control group. Considering that these regions also had MERS patients albeit a small number of them (one to five each), their residents are also likely to have avoided hospital visits, which is a factor for underestimation. However, based on Fig. 3 which shows a slowed decrease in the number of outpatient visits in June 2015 for these regions, bias from this factor is not likely to be large. Second, because no city-or province-level lockdown was imposed during the outbreak, people living in the four affected regions possibly visited neighboring regions for health care services, increasing the number of outpatient visits in those regions, which is a factor for overestimation. This behavior is comparable to out-migration from those in regions where a natural disaster such as a hurricane occurs (Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2013) . For a robustness check, we exclude four neighboring regions, namely, Incheon, Gangwon, Chungbuk, and Jeonbuk, from the analysis to check for possible bias.",

The cold data can be downloaded from https://opendata.hira.or.kr/home. do. 13 Ag\u00fcero and Beleche (2017) found that increased handwashing following the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 reduced the rate of Mexican children with acute diarrhea, which affects 11% of children under five. While, according to World Bank, at least 85.8% of Mexicans used basic sanitation services in 2011, the rate for South Korea was 100% in that year and afterward. The related data can be downloaded from the following World Bank site: https://databank.worldbank. org/reports.aspx?source=311&series=SH.STA.BASS.ZS. Third, although the outbreak ended in a short time, it possibly affected the economic condition of the affected regions, which could have had an impact on the residents' income and consequently, the demand for health care services. One possible scenario is that an increase in job losses due to the disease outbreak and the following economic downturn led to reduced income and reduced demand for health care services, which is a factor for overestimation. Another scenario is that job losses improved health, possibly due to reduced smoking or obesity (Ruhm, 2000) , leading to reduced health care demand. For a robustness check, we control for the regional unemployment rate in the analysis to check for possible bias. Lastly, some hospitals that treated MERS patients (before diagnosis) were forced to close down to prevent nosocomial infection, which is a factor for overestimation, but the bias from this factor is not likely to be large considering that people were not likely to visit such hospitals even if they were not closed. . 4 shows that MERS significantly reduced the number of outpatient visits to the five clinics in the first and second month after the outbreak (June and July of 2015) by 11.7% and 5.5% (17.2% in total), respectively. However, we found no effect for May, possibly because the first case was reported on the 20th of that month and no patient details were provided at the time. In addition, there was no evidence of a rebound in August and afterward, which implies that hospital avoidance during the outbreak did not cause any severe health problems. 14 The effect size of 17.2% is smaller than the estimate in Bennett et al. (2015) , who found that SARS reduced outpatient visits in Taiwan by 30% during the four months of March-June 2003. The difference is possibly due to the shorter duration of MERS. The effect size in our study is also smaller than the findings of 40% to 67% in the COVID-19 studies presented in the Introduction 14 We also estimated the effect using all other types of clinics including orthopedics and ophthalmology, and found significant effects only in June and July. However, as expected, the effects were smaller: 7.5% and 1.6%, respectively, which implies that patients in need of treatments from other departments also avoided hospitals. The result of this analysis is available upon request. section, possibly because those studies examined the situation under lockdown. Moreover, in the case of the U.S., lost jobs during the pandemic likely led to lost health insurance and consequently reduced hospital visits. 15 We conduct three robustness checks. First, we exclude one region at a time to examine whether a particular region drives the finding of Fig. 4 . In Table 1 , column (1) excludes Gyeonggi, column (2) excludes Seoul, and so on. Although excluding Daejeon reduces the estimate size the most, and excluding Chungnam increases the size, the results for the first and second month after the outbreak are robust. The estimates are \u22120.143 to \u22120.094 for the first month after the outbreak, and the estimates are \u22120.075 to \u22120.045 for the second month after the outbreak. For the second robustness check, we exclude the four neighboring regions from the analysis to check whether those residing in the four affected regions used medical services in these neighboring regions, which could lead to an overestimation. As shown in Fig. 5 , the estimates for the first and second month after the outbreak are not that different from the estimates shown in Fig. 4 .",

We examined this behavior during the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, which resulted in 186 cases and 38 deaths. We found that the MERS outbreak reduced the number of outpatient visits in the first two months after the outbreak by 17.2%. Although hospital avoidance could worsen health, we did not find any evidence that outpatient visits rebounded after the outbreak ended (Fig. 4) , which implies that the avoidance did not cause severe health conditions. The absence of such evidence is possibly due to the short duration of the outbreak, which lasted from late May to early July. Considering that other infectious diseases like COVID-19 can last longer than MERS, a policy intervention is necessary to encourage people to visit hospitals for treatment without any fear of infection. Promoting remote health care services, which are currently not available in the country, could be an option. Future research should discuss other options in addition to remote health care services.",
