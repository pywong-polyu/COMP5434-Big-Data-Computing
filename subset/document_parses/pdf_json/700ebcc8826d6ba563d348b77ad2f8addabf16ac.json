Methods Parallel randomized controlled trial including 58 patients consecutively admitted to a tertiary academic hospital for pelvic floor rehabilitation consultation from 1 January to 30 April 2021 for conservative treatment of UI. Participants randomized to the intervention were submitted to a 12-week PFMT program: (1) a hybrid telerehabilitation program of two individual face-to-face sessions followed by 2-weekly sessions of video-telerehabilitation with a follow-up by a specialized physiotherapist, including one individual face-to-face session at 8 weeks;",

The control group had two initial individual sessions followed by twiceweekly group classes, and consultations were face to face. The primary outcome measure (at baseline and 12 weeks) was UI-related quality of life using the Portuguese Version of the King's Health Questionnaire. Results At baseline the intervention (n = 18) and control (n = 17) groups were similar. UI-related quality of life significantly improved in both the intervention and control groups between baseline (T0) and the end of the 12-week PFMT program (T12) (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively), although the magnitude of the improvement was not significantly different between groups (-10.0 vs. -9.5 points, p = 0.918, respectively).
