While the highest burden related to sepsis affects lowincome and middle-income settings, sepsis remains among the leading causes of (potentially preventable) morbidity and mortality in high-income countries too, accounting for a total cost of US$7.31 billion in the USA alone. 6 These high economic costs, along with the persistently high prevalence and morbidity of paediatric sepsis, highlight the urgent need for further research into earlier sepsis recognition.",

The new Surviving Sepsis Guidelines 9 further emphasise the need for early detection as it is a critical survival factor for paediatric sepsis, with timely and appropriate initiation of interventions being linked to improved patient outcomes. Paediatric sepsis often starts as an insidious condition, which poses many challenges for healthcare professionals to accurately and timely diagnose it. This is due to the vague and non-specific nature of the disease, coupled with a relatively low incidence rate compared with the number of children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with febrile illness. 10 Consequently, the risk for a missed diagnosis is high and subsequent repercussions are potentially lifelong or fatal. 11 In its early stages, sepsis often resembles many other common febrile illnesses with the clinical signs of fever, tachycardia and tachypnoea. 12 Parents, as experts of their child, may be valuable in the identification of sepsis and discrimination of the condition from other milder illnesses.",

In addition, the internal consistency and inter-rater reliability of the concern questions will be assessed using Cronbach's alpha and the intraclass correlation using a one-way random effects model, respectively. Based on the results of the factor analysis, a factor score will be created and used as a measure of concern in the regression models. In addition, the relationship between the four individual concern questions with the primary outcome will be assessed through bivariate logistic regression models. The question that provides the best prediction of sepsis will be identified as the one that has the highest unadjusted OR and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), with 95% CIs being reported alongside all effects.",

All analyses will be performed by an expert statistician using R. 26 A preplanned secondary analysis will assess qualitative data from the survey free text questions using the framework method. 27 These free texts will then be examined and sorted into multiple categories to determine commonalities and differences. These categories will then be sorted into themes for the three groups: parents, doctors and nurses. 27 Strengths A strength of this study is its prospective observational study design with a large multicentre cohort of children evaluated for sepsis. In contrast to previous studies, which more broadly captured serious bacterial infections 18 or fever, 28 the present study captures sepsis defined as suspected/proven infection with organ dysfunction as the main outcome. The study design enables assessment of the role of parental and healthcare professional concern in diagnosing paediatric sepsis and compares Open access the respective diagnostic accuracies with the diagnostic performance of the routine diagnostic process.",

It is expected that some patients will only have partial sets of surveys completed due to circumstances such as a parent being deemed unfit to complete a research survey for various reasons, or the attending nurse or doctor not completing a survey. The incomplete sets of surveys for patients are anticipated given the pragmatic nature of the study and will be a consideration when conducting analysis and reporting. Bias could occur through children who are more clinically well having a greater number of concern surveys completed, as opposed to more clinically unwell children, whereby parents may be too distressed and healthcare professionals otherwise occupied treating the child. 29 Standardised dissemination of study education will aim to reduce potential bias related to variances on how the surveys are administered to parents, doctors and nurses. Implementation of an educational script will eliminate the use of words such as sepsis, organ dysfunction or death, which may potentially heighten concern levels or result in changes to concern. Finally, the study will be performed in two sites working within the same healthcare system in a high-income country, and, hence, similar studies in low-income and middle-income settings will be required to assess generalisability.",
