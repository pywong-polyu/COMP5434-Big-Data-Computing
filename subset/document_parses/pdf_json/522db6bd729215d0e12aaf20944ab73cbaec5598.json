While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The",

We compare spatial accessibility of healthcare between COVID-19 patients and the general population. Our analysis provides insights for decision making to optimize the allocation of COVID-19 related healthcare resources, such as hospital beds, testing resources, healthcare personnel, and ventilators.

The method has two major steps: calculating a bed-to-population ratio for each supply location and then summing these ratios for residential locations where supply regions overlap. Since we aim to measure the accessibility for the general population and COVID-19 patients, we separated the calculation of a bed-to-population ratio from that of a bedto-COVID-19-patients ratio. The first step delineates every hospital's 30-minute driving zone through a convex hull. Each zone is segmented into 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 minutes sub driving zones. These zones are used to compute a hospital bed-to-population ratio using a weighted sum of residential locations within each hospital's catchment area following equation (3).

Each hospital's catchment area and its corresponding driving zones can be expressed on hexagon grids ( Figure 5 ). If there are overlapping catchment areas, the values at each hexagon grid are aggregated. Specifically, we used 500-meter hexagon grids for Chicago and 5-km hexagon grids for Illinois. In Chicago, about 400 meters are the shortest distance between zip code centroids. Therefore, 500-meter hexagon grids are sufficient to represent the accessibility measure. Considering the relatively large area of Illinois, 5-km hexagon grids are suitable for depicting the accessibility measure. Calculating this measure is computationally intensive because creating driving zones generally relies on defining a boundary of nodes within a road network that are at the edge of the driving zones, generating a convex hull around these nodes, and then querying if residences lie within the boundary. The method also depends on calculating intersections and differences between multiple hospitals' driving zones and aggregating the collected statistics appropriately for each population center.",

This means that some areas may need additional beds while the beds may be abundant in other areas. In Figure 10 (b), the areas having higher accessibility for the general population, but lower accessibility for COVID-19 patients could be understood as the areas in which additional beds may be needed. Furthermore, the number of COVID-19 cases is relatively higher compared to existing accessible beds in these areas. On the other hand, the areas having higher accessibility for COVID-19 patients, but lower accessibility for the general population could be defined as the areas in which hospital beds may be abundant. To identify the areas that need additional beds to resolve the inequality in access to hospital beds for COVID-19 patients in Illinois, we compared the accessibility measure for COVID-19 patients to that for the general population, based on equation (5). Figure 11 illustrates the measure difference in Chicago (a) and in Illinois (b). The circles identify the areas where beds may be abundant. Compared to the accessibility for the general population, COVID-19 patients have higher accessibility in northern Chicago.

Given that the number of confirmed cases is expected to increase in Illinois, to assess spatial accessibility for COVID-19 patients over time is an important research topic. Then it would be interesting to explore the dynamics between the demand of COVID-19 patients and the supply of healthcare resources. Although our results may help identify the areas where resources are abundant or insufficient, we did not assess how much resources need to be allocated, which should be another future research topic.

Based on this study, policymakers and public-health officials should consider optimizing the allocation of existing healthcare resources or putting additional resources into low accessibility areas. At the same time, strict quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of known cases by individuals and communities are important to slow down the spread of COVID-19 (Anderson et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020) , which in turn, help to address the important spatial accessibility issues.",
