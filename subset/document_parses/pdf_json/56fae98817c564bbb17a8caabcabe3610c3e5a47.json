            "text": "Numerous reports indicate that African Americans and Latinos are being affected disproportionately by coronavirus disease 2019 . Positivity rates have not been analyzed on scale because only 4 states report race/ethnicity as part of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. Previous studies also have had little ability to control for many known risk factors to better identify the effects of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic communities. Using test results from a large national reference laboratory database that included patients from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, this study compared positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) among various race/ethnicity groups by linking zip code-based race/ethnicity proportions from US Census data. Analysis of 2,331,175 unique patients tested March-May 2020 demonstrated an increasing trend in SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity across Black non-Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 7.8% to 17.2%, P < 0.0001) and Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 8.4% to 15.5%, P < 0.0001) and a decreasing trend across White non-Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 17.4% to 7.1%, P < 0.0001). These trends in viral ribonucleic acid positivity remained in stratified analyses and in multivariable models that controlled for known risk factors including sex, population density, and the states initially hardest hit by COVID-19. These findings indicate that communities with the highest proportions of Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic populations have the highest SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity rates, even after controlling for other risk factors. More efforts are needed to mitigate the increased impact of COVID-19 on both the African American and Hispanic communities.",

            "text": "N umerous reports support that ethnic minorities are being affected disproportionately by SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] As of June 24, 2020, there were nearly 2.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States and 120,000 COVID-19-related deaths. 7 In early June, the reported COVID-19 fatality rate was nearly 2.5 times higher for African Americans than for the White non-Hispanic population in the states reporting race/ethnicity data, with some states showing even larger disparities. 8 These findings are based on data analyses from the American Public Media Research Lab that indicated non-Hispanic African Americans accounted for 24% of COVID-19 deaths, despite comprising only 12% of the US population. 9 The same report noted the mortality rate per 100,000 people was similar among White (22.7), Asian (24.3) , and Latino (24.9) populations. 9 As of June 1, 2020, race/ethnicity was included as part of confirmed positive cases in 47 states and as part of COVID-19 death reports in 42 states; however, only 4 states (Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, and Nevada) report race/ ethnicity testing rates, 8 making positivity rates based on race and ethnicity difficult to calculate. Even in states that have recently reported confirmed cases and deaths by race and ethnicity (eg, New York), it can be difficult to know the degree to which these racial divides are affected by large African American and Hispanic communities in some of the areas with the most COVID-19 infections (eg, New York City). Additionally, conflicting outcomes have been reported on the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) positivity and race and ethnicity, and most prior reports were based on a relatively small number of individuals. 10 Positivity rates reflect positive test results among only those people who were tested. Therefore, positivity rates are greatly affected by the amount of testing and the selection of individuals tested. Laboratory test positivity rates must be distinguished from infection and disease rates. Infection rates reflect who is infected in the population; incidence is defined by the occurrence of new cases whereas prevalence is defined as the proportion of cases in the population at a given time. Positivity rates are an additional useful measurement in population disease assessment as they account for the rapidly evolving number of patients being tested. To best understand the specific contribution of SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity rates, this study examined differences among US Census-defined race/ethnicity groups using data from a large national reference laboratory.",

The team grouped all other race/ethnicities, including multiple race/ ethnicities, into the ''other'' race/ethnicity categories. To determine the proportion of testing that likely came from each race/ethnicity group, the team weighted the result by the race/ethnicity proportions within that zip code. For example, if a specimen came from a community with equal race/ethnicity proportions for the 5 categories, each would be assigned a value of 0.2. These values were then summed in the full analytic data set. To analyze income, mean household income in the past 12 months (in 2018 inflationadjusted dollars) from 2018 ACS 5-Year Estimates was used. 12 Population density data came from the 2010 Census. 13 The team analyzed positivity rates by quintiles of race/ethnicity proportion, population density, and mean income to approximate the association with each of these factors.",

            "text": "Study data suggest that Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic communities are representative among all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The reasons for increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic communities tested are likely as complex as the communities themselves; however, population health experts have proposed several situations that could be causing these disparities. Ethnic minorities are overrepresented in essential jobs in industries including transportation, government, health care, and food supply services, which may increase their chances of being infected while at work. 16 Previous research also has shown higher rates of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, 17 and obesity 18 in African Americans, all of which have been linked to COVID-19 mortality, 19 although the impact of these conditions on infection rates has not yet been fully explored. [20] [21] [22] In contrast, studies demonstrated that among people ages 65 years and older, African American and Latino compared to White people have lower mortality from influenza and pneumonia as causes of death. 17, 23 Public health experts also have suggested that many risk factors for COVID-19 are connected in part to socioeconomic status, collectively referred to as social determinants of health, including reliance on public transportation for those who cannot afford a car, living in densely populated areas, having jobs without paid sick leave, disparities in access to quality health care, and living in smaller multifamily (or multigenerational) homes that make social distancing inconvenient or even impossible. 24 The cumulative impact of social inequities from an early age may influence racial and ethnic disparities in both clinical and subclinical health conditions. 25 Although the research team agrees with these factors in theory, data presented in this study demonstrated higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in higher income communities, after controlling for other factors in multivariable models. This was unexpected, especially given the small but significant association of higher income quintiles with lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in unadjusted analysis. One possible explanation is that a disproportionate number of employed health care workers are being tested for SARS-CoV-2. While there is a wide range of incomes among health care workers, some, notably physicians, have higher incomes and high exposure frequency to infected patients. Moreover, COVID-19 positivity rate disparities by race/ethnicity (particularly for the Black non-Hispanic community) remained even within the highest income communities, suggesting that lower income may not play as large a role as previously assumed. It is also important to keep in mind that the income variable used was based on the mean income for a patient's zip code. The relationship between patient income and COVID-19 positivity within zip codes, unfortunately, could not be analyzed for this study. Inclusion of these additional covariates may have yielded different results.",

Other related limitations include that patients may not be tested at the same race/ethnicity mix within each zip code, some patients may reside in one zip code but became infected somewhere else, and that, historically, hospitals have been less likely to provide patient zip code information than other facility types. Further, testing was based on specimens submitted to Quest Diagnostics only; other testing sites and laboratories may have tested a different proportion of patients within each zip code. However, analysis of test share indicated the population being tested for COVID-19 by Quest Diagnostics appears to largely reflect the overall United States regarding race/ethnicity proportions, at least when analyzed by zip code. COVID-19 testing is typically not random. People with symptoms or high exposure risk (eg, health care workers) are theoretically more likely to be tested. Yet some random testing is occurring as well, such as instances of preoperation screening. The mix of these factors, and how they have changed over the time interval evaluated in this study, is unknown. Further, these results reflect the early months of COVID-19 in the United States. Data from later time periods may show different associations. Strengths included the large analytic cohort, which included patients from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and the number of factors controlled for in multivariable models, which allowed for better isolation of the impact COVID-19 has had on racial and ethnic minority communities.",
