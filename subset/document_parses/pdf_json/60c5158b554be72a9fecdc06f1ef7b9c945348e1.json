Selecting an ideal representational framework for instances of various domains to minimize the divergence among source and target domains is a fundamental research challenge in representative transfer learning. The domain adaptation approach is designed to learn more robust or higher-level features, required in transfer learning. This paper presents a novel transfer learning framework that employs a marginal probability-based domain adaptation methodology followed by a deep autoencoder. The proposed frame adapts the source and target domain by plummeting distribution deviation between the features of both domains. Further, we adopt the deep neural network process to transfer learning and suggest a supervised learning algorithm based on encoding and decoding layer architecture. Moreover, we have proposed two different variants of the transfer learning techniques for classification, which are termed as (i) Domain adapted transfer learning with deep autoencoder-1 (D-TLDA-1) using the linear regression and (ii) Domain adapted transfer learning with deep autoencoder-2 (D-TLDA-2) using softmax regression. Simulations have been conducted with two popular real-world datasets: ImageNet datasets for image classification problem and 20_Newsgroups datasets for text classification problem. Experimental findings have established and the resulting improvements in accuracy measure of classification shows the supremacy of the proposed D-TLDA framework over prominent state-of-the-art machine learning and transfer learning approaches.",

Such machines heavily depend on the learning techniques that are implied to learn to develop a classifier. The ML techniques are mainly characterized as supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning, etc. [31] . Supervised learning techniques train the machine using labeled input data (train/source data) to predict the desired output (labels) of test data. However, the hidden patterns needed to be mined from the train data in unsupervised learning techniques as class labels are unknown. Semi-supervised learning techniques are used when a minimal amount of labeled train data is available, i.e., a large amount of unlabeled train data is used in conjunction with few labeled data to build the learning classifiers [57] .",

Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods are relatively ineffective if sufficient information about the test and training data is not available. In unsupervised learning, the prediction model works poorly when the information about the unlabeled data does not exist. To overcome this, a new approach to learning, called Transfer Learning (TL), has emerged as an attractive area of research [12, 14, 25, 28, 33, 38, 42, 49] . TL is inspired by human intelligence, i.e., humans do not require learning from scratch for every new task as they can efficiently utilize their already acquired knowledge (from other tasks) to solve a new task or learn more rapidly. For example, cycle riding experience helps in grasping motorbike skills quickly and swiftly. TL algorithms are usually designed to predict the test data using a mathematical model trained on a dataset that differs concerning domains, tasks, and distributions [57] .",

The goal of DA is to share the knowledge among source and target data but only for related tasks or domains. A notable issue within DA is to decrease the dissimilarity between the distributions of source and target domains, somehow maintaining the essential features of both environments. Although numerous research works have been done over the last decade on TL algorithms to produce an appropriate distance measure for DA, yet remains an ongoing and challenging subject. To that end, this work offers a novel DA method for determining the distance among domains. Precisely, the DA approach runs over the source domain to derive the representative features and then applied to target data. The distance measure is defined to distinguish the difference between the source and target domain. In other words, if the distance measure between domains is minimal, their distributions are considered to be similar, otherwise dissimilar. Hence, the weight vectors trained from the encoding and decoding layers as of the source data apply perfectly to target data for classification. Moreover, the feature representation model based on the proposed DA approach makes the source and target domain distributions similar, which constructs a new framework for the domain-specific features.",

It is a feature representation technique for reducing the dimensionality of features within both domains for better representation learning. Further, we utilize one of the incredibly powerful approaches of machine learning known as a deep neural network [42] . The concept of a deep learning network originated from the artificial neural network with many hidden layers which capture the intricate non-linear representation of data. The deep neural network is considered an intelligent feature extraction module that offers excellent flexibility in extracting high-level features in the proposed TL model. Deep autoencoder is a deep feed-forward neural network that contains more than one hidden layer and is trained to map the input value. We have utilized a deep autoencoder-based supervised representation learning method for transfer learning called Transfer Learning with Deep Autoencoder (TLDA) [55] . In TLDA, there are two layers: the first layer is for encoding and the second layer is for decoding, where the weights are pooled through source and target data. The first encoding layer is called the embedded layer. At this layer, the source and target data distributions are minimized by the K-L divergence of the embedded instances between domains. The second embedding layer is the level encoding layer where the source labels information is encoded using a softmax regression model. The above discourse TLDA framework is coupled with our proposed DA approach, as shown in Fig. 1 .",

The homogeneous and heterogeneous TL techniques introduced and summarized in the survey by Weiss et al. [49] . However, in-depth look into heterogeneous TL is provided by Day and Khoshgoftaar in their study [14] . Several researchers have studied specialized topics, including activity recognition [12] , computational intelligence [28] , and deep learning [42] . A number of studies also concentrate on particular application situations, such as visual categorization [38] , collaborative recommendation with auxiliary data [30] , computer vision [48] , and sentiment analysis [25] . A neural probabilistic language learning model proposed by Bengio et al. [4] learns a distributed representation for words and the probability function for every word sequence. A unique sharing method utilizing Bayesian methodology was reported by Bakker and Heskes [1] , which is a general amalgamation of expert architecture incorporating gated dependencies on task characteristics. A heuristic approach, called positive examples and negative examples labeling heuristic, was proposed by Fung et al. [17] , in which a classifier efficiently utilizes both positive and negative instances. Collobert and Weston [11] proposed a unified architecture for natural language processing for features relevant to the tasks. Blitzer et al. [5] reported the concept of pivot feature selection of domain adaptation (DA) for a target domain using both the source and target domains. A co-clustering algorithm was suggested by Dai et al. [13] to exploit the technique of transferal of label information across both source domain and target domain. Cao et al. [6] introduced an extension of the AdaBoost algorithm titled ITLAdaBoost as Inductive Transfer Learning AdaBoost algorithm for pedestrian detection. Tang et al. [43] developed a framework for distributed learning across heterogeneous networks to efficiently classify various types of social relationships. A multi-task transfer learning approach for small training samples was proposed by Saha and Gupta in [37] . The authors also developed an alternative method of multipliers to solve an optimization problem.",

[57] connect and systematize the existing TL researches, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of TL in a comprehensive way, which provides the most better understanding of the current research status and ideas on TL. Moreover, TL based mechanisms have been applied to a number of real-work applications such as Object detection in remote sensing images [9] , human activity recognition [7, 46] , fruit freshness classification [22] , sketch recognition [52] , person re-identification [26] , detect malarial parasite [2] , prediction of COVID-19 infection through chest CT-scan images [23] and so on. Unlike the earlier works, this paper proposed a novel supervised learning-based description method called D-TLDA using deep autoencoder networks that minimize the distance measure among the marginal probability distribution of domain variation and labeling of encodes of the source domain.",

Neural Network (NN) and Logistic Regression (LR) are the most traditional supervised machine learning algorithms. For the implementation of LR and NN algorithms, we use the original code and adopt the default parameters with the number of hidden layers as 10. The SVM is a learning algorithm based on a support vector regression model for evaluating the predictive accuracy of the target domains. The number of hidden nodes used in ELM is chosen by a trial-and-error method and set as 100 for both datasets. The machine learning tools obtain the resulting accuracy of different target domains with varying combinations of source domains. The accuracy averages to the 20 classification problems for the ImageNet dataset and the 20_Newsgroup dataset are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 for comparatively analyzing the mentioned machine learning approaches.",

Column 2 shows the SVM classification accuracy is 84.4%, whereas column 3 represents the NN classifier that obtains 80.56% value. The ELM classification value is represented by column 4 with an average In summary, we observe that the proposed D-TLDA method performs better than all the compared algorithms on image classification problems for the ImageNet dataset and text issues of classification of the 20_Newsgroup dataset. In general, the model retained a considerably more extensive margin of accuracy advancement of D-TLDA-2 on both datasets. Table 4 illustrates the margin of improvements in the accuracy (in percentage) of D-TLDA-1 & D-TLDA-2 over compared machine learning and transfer learning approaches. The highest percentage marginal improvements in the accuracy are 16.60% and 25.40% by the D-TLDA-2 compared to the accuracy obtained from TCA, demonstrating our model's more vital transfer learning capability. In the future, we will apply the proposed approach over big datasets such as Galaxy Dataset, Leaf Dataset, etc., to find the analysis of accuracy over other transfer learning approaches. Also, we will examine the performance of the proposed method by using various distance metrics (e.g., Normalized Euclidean distance, Hamming distance, etc.) for determining the divergence between the distributions of the source domain and the target domain.

This paper utilized a deep learning approach to impr ove t ransfer l earning t hrough opt imum exploitation of marginal probability-based domain adaptation methodology. The new transfer learning framework can tackle analogous multi-domain predicament when the source and target domains exhibit profound data distribution. The proposed framework exploited marginal probability distribution between source and target domain to efficiently select identical features to bridge the vast differences across source and target domain. Further, these adapted domains train a deep neural network as a deep autoencoder. The classification model is termed domain adapted transfer learning with deep autoencoder (D-TLDA). Two versions of this feature representation technique in conjunction with deep autoencoder are proposed as (1) Domain Adapted Transfer Learning with Deep Autoencoder-1 (D-TLDA-1), and (2) Domain Adapted Transfer Learning with Deep Autoencoder using Softmax Regression-2 (D-TLDA-2). Extensive experiments have been performed on two real-world datasets, viz. ImageNet dataset and the 20_Newsgroup dataset for image and text classification problems, respectively. By thorough comparison, we have shown that the accuracy achieved by our proposed transfer learning frameworks, D-TLDA-1 and D-TLDA-2, outperformed other well-known transfer learning methods viz. Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), marginalized Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (mSDA), Transfer Learning with Deep Autoencoder (TLDA-1 and TLDA-2). It is also shown that D-TLDA-1 and D-TLDA-2 have supremacy over prominent machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression (LR), Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).",
