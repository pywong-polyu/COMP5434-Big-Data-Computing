As soon as the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate is demonstrated, participants should have the chance to be unblinded immediately and placebo recipients immunized with the vaccine candidate. Participants should be allowed to unblind and access a known effective vaccine should one become available to them. In addition, and in particular, the research should respond to local needs (placebo-controlled trials should be done in regions impacted with high burden of COVID- 19) , both participants and communities should benefit from the trial, and the vaccine candidate to be tested, if proved to be efficacious and safe, should be made available in the country where the trial is conducted [8] . To this end and from the very beginning, transparency should be the fundamental guiding principle in the cooperation between the sponsor and local stakeholders with full community partnership and engagement throughout. The commitment of local investigators, research ethics committees, and health authorities as well as of local community leaders is a must to ensure a fruitful community engagement and participation.",

The main features of this type of trial and the percentage of the population that have been, at least, partially vaccinated in participating countries, as a proxy of availability of temporarily authorized COVID-19 vaccines, are shown in Table 1 . Only placebo-controlled RCTs that started after 1 April 2021 are described. These are trials that were likely started after, at least, some participating countries had the opportunity to access to a certain number of authorized COVID-19 vaccine doses. These trials are sponsored by local or foreign companies or organizations and are placed in four continents. Of these RCTs, two of them deserve a reflection. First, the one to be conducted in eight Sub-Saharan countries is aimed to assess SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (PACTR202105817814362). The trial has been approved by 12 local research committees in five participating countries and by the UCSF Human Research Protection Program institutional review board since the trial is sponsored by the US NIAID. The approved protocol states that, at the first set of vaccinations, 7,000 participants will be allocated to receive the two vaccine doses, whereas the other 7,000 will receive two placebo injections; some 2 to 4 months later, in a doubleblind fashion, participants will be crossed over to receive two placebo injections or two vaccine doses. The protocol states that if an authorized vaccine becomes available, participants will have the option of being unblinded and receive the authorized vaccine. Unblinding is not reported in the information posted on the registries for the other trials mentioned in Table 1 , except for the one to be discussed below.",

All US sites have stopped recruitment eight weeks after the trial was started, as did the Japanese centers shortly after. As happened in the Sub-Saharan trial mentioned above, participants can request unblinding. This trial has a number of recruiting sites in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The conduct of this trial in Colombia raises ethical concerns, since with 64% of the population being at least partially vaccinated [15] and with an adult population of 69% of the total [19] , it might have enough doses to vaccinate all adults.",

So, no new placebocontrolled RCTs should be conducted in healthy na\u00efve adults in China. All participating countries of these trials have a limited percentage of their populations partially vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, so the conduct of these placebocontrolled RCTs is ethically sound. However, there are two exceptions. Thus, sites from Malaysia and Mexico should not participate since, with 78% and 58% of their populations partially or fully vaccinated [15] , so no adult should have difficulty getting vaccinated with a temporarily authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Recruitment to these trials should be stopped and participants should have the option of being unblinded and receiving a vaccine out of study something that is uncertain since there is no information available about it.",

An important concern that has been recently flagged is that immunogenicity RCTs comparing a novel vaccine candidate with an authorized vaccine might find the issue of not having these latter available for the conduct of comparative RCTs, since the use of available temporarily authorized COVID-19 vaccines are restricted to fulfill public health needs [26] . Yet currently, there are three phase 3 immunogenicity RCTs assessing vaccine candidates vs the AstraZeneca vaccine in healthy adults: Valneva's inactivated virus vaccine (France, NCT04864561, n = 4,019, started in April); SK Bioscience's protein subunit vaccine (South Korea, NCT05007951, n = 3,990, started in August); and Medigen's protein subunit vaccine (Taiwan, NCT05011526, n = 1,020, not yet recruiting). In addition, in September, one immunogenicity RCT (CTRI/2021/08/036074; n = 2,140) started in India assessing Biological E's protein subunit vaccine (Corbevax) vs Covishield (the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India), whereas one month later, a RCT (NCT05077176; n = 7,300) was started to assess Health Institutes of Turkey inactivated virus vaccine (Turkovac) vs Coronavac (Sinopharm inactivated vaccine).",
