With reference to a redevelopment initiative in the peripheral area of the city of Bari (Southern Italy), the study has been carried out on a sample of two hundred residential properties, sold in the period 2017-2019 and located in the peripheral district. The main influencing factors considered by sellers and buyers in the negotiation phase have been collected. The application of a data-driven technique has allowed to identify a statistically reliable model through which the functional relationships between the variables considered and the selling prices in the current state have been detected, and the new market values generated by the redevelopment project have been then determined, in order to compare them with those relating to the current state. The results obtained point out an increase in the values of the sample properties as a result of the redevelopment project, confirming the empirically expected outputs.",

In this framework, the assessment of the effects deriving from the implementation of an urban transformation project in quantitative terms aims at i) weighing the quality level of urban spaces, ii) supporting the decision-making processes in the territorial redevelopment initiatives and iii) verifying their effectiveness. Currently, in fact, most urban systems have wide degraded areas. It's about the degraded housing, insufficient or inadequate facilities, ineffective public transport, large abandoned former industrial areas, environmental risks and problems, unattractive and disconnected urban services, widespread unemployment and relevant social problems, such as poverty, low levels of education, aging populations, etc. The decentralization process of the production system from central to more peripheral areas is the main cause of the \"emptying\" and consequent abandonment of wide urban areas. The recovery initiatives of these spaces allow both to reuse entire portions of cities no longer used for their original functions, and to start wider regeneration and reorganization processes of the urban system. Currently, the public policies of urban territory government, which have no longer been engaged in the strategies for expanding borders, focus on the planning of effective redevelopment initiatives in degraded and/or abandoned areas of cities, in order to improve the level of urban quality, in terms of \"appropriate\" equipment and infrastructure, adequate to the effective demand of the population who lives in the requalification territories [19] . So far, these areas have been considered places of social unease maximum concentration. Currently, instead, the degraded areas are considered a resource for public and private operators: for the public subject, in fact, they represent an opportunity for a growth of the city image and to demonstrate the skills and efficiency of the administration and to attract capital and private investors; for the private subject, on the other hand, a degraded urban area represents the opportunity for financial earnings deriving from the enhancement of the existing property asset and/or transformation of urban spaces.",

The exponents (i, l) are also selected by the user in a range of possible real numbers. The parameters a i are evaluated by the Least Squares Method. The EPR implementation involves the selection and generation of a series of different models whose functional form is the best combination of the input variables Xi, identifying for each one the exponents (i, l) and the numerical coefficients a i . The EPR main advantage is that the genetic algorithm underlying the procedure does not require the exogenous definition of the mathematical expression and of the number of parameters that fit better the data collected, but the iterative process itself returns the best solution [21] . Thus, the EPR overcomes the classical multiple regression method, as it selects only the \"good\" solutions and rejects the \"bad\" ones in order to obtain the best performance of the final results. Moreover, EPR applies an evolutionary multi-objective genetic algorithm as an optimization strategy based on the Pareto dominance criterion aimed at i) maximizing the model accuracy through the satisfaction of appropriate statistical criteria for the verification of the equation; ii) maximizing the model's parsimony through the minimization of the number of terms (a i ); iii) reducing the complexity of the model through the minimization of the number of the explanatory variables (Xi) of the final equation.",

(1) without function f selected and with the dependent variable Y as the natural logarithm of the total selling price (Y = ln(P)) [7, 12] . Each additive monomial term of the mathematical expression is assumed as a combination of the inputs -the explanatory variables Xiraised to the proper numerical exponents. In particular, in order to have a wide range of models, the candidate exponents belong to the set (0; 0.5; 1; 2) and the maximum number n of additive terms in final expressions is assumed to be eight. The implementation of the econometric method has generated several solutions, each one characterized by a different number of additive terms, combinations of the variables and a different level of CoD. With reference to the peripheral urban area of the city of Bari where the study sample properties considered in the research are located, the model defined by Eq. (3) has been selected as able to explain the mechanism of formation of selling prices in the current situation in the specific urban area. This model is characterized by a high CoD value (+79.48%) and it considers all the explanatory variables considered in the analysis. The mathematical expression of the model of Eq. (3) does not allow to immediately verify the empirical coherence of the coefficients signs of the explanatory variables selected, being the same variable present in more terms and/or combined within the same term with other factors. In the present research an empirical approach has been used, in order to verify the empirical consistency of the functional relationships returned by the EPR implementation on the study sample and to define the marginal contribution of each factor selected by the model. In particular, the procedure adopted constitutes a simplified exogenous approach which, instead of determining the partial derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the i-th variable, provides for the variation of the i-th variable analyzed in the variation interval in the observed sample, keeping the mathematical terms of the other variables are constant -i.e. equal to the average value for the quantitative variables and 1 for the other dummy variables.

Therefore, the most influencing factors for the sellers and the buyers in the processes of selling prices do not change compared to those considered in the anteproject situation. The values of the extrinsic variables for which a variation is expected have been replaced in the model, using the same operating methods implemented for the definition of the same variables in the current state. With reference to the intrinsic and extrinsic variables that are not modified in the post-project situation, the values of these characteristics previously determined and/or calculated do not vary. Therefore, it is possible to determine the new selling prices of the sample properties, assessed as a result of the project realization. The results obtained in terms of comparison between the estimated ante-project prices and the prices assessed after the implementation of the redevelopment initiative, confirm the outputs empirically expected in terms of growth in the market values of the properties located in the area of the redevelopment.

In particular, the proposed model aimed at assessing the effects of an urban transformation initiative on the real estate market will be able to support the decision-making processes and to integrate the traditional financial and economic tools currently implemented for the feasibility analysis of the projects. Finally, further insights may address i) the application of the proposed procedure in other national and international territorial contexts and the experimentation of the same technique for the study of the complementary effects of different contemporary transformation projects, ii) the comparison of the models obtained by the EPR implementation with the output generated by other techniques (e.g. Artificial Neural Networks, Cellular Automata, spatial analysis, ecc.).",
