The aim of this retrospective study is to estimate the impact that remdesivir-the first drug for COVID-19 approved in the EU-would have had in the first wave. Methods: This study simulated the impact that remdesivir could have had on the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) capacity (bed occupancy) and the number of deaths that could have been prevented, based on two scenarios: a real-life scenario (without remdesivir) and an alternative scenario (with remdesivir). It considered the clinical results of the ACTT-1 trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia who required supplemental oxygen. The occupancy rates in general wards and ICUs were estimated in both scenarios. Results: Remdesivir use could have prevented the admission of 2587 patients (43.75%) in the ICUs. It could have also increased the SNHS capacity in 5656 general wards beds and 1700",

Furthermore, remdesivir use could have prevented 7639 deaths due to COVID-19, which implies a 27.51% reduction (95% CI 14.25%-34.07%).

Remdesivir also showed a reduction in disease progression, reducing the incidence of the need for new oxygen, high-flow oxygen, and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, non-mechanically ventilated patients had a slower progression or reduced mortality with respect to placebo according to the post hoc analysis.

In consonance with these recommendations, Lacasa and colleagues estimated an algorithm to provide optimal rerouting strategies for ICUs patients [21] . Their approach was validated using reallife data from Spain; they concluded that 600 beds could have been made available using local sharing and over 1300 beds with countrywide sharing. This strategy would improve the management of COVID-19, particularly for patients who would not otherwise have access to ICUs. However, their approach had some limitations, as they considered the transportation of unstable patients in mobile ICUs and an unlimited number of ambulances and human resources [21] . Moreover, the mortality rate in hospitalized patients on general wards was 20.61% [12] , which is in line with a previous study reporting a mortality rate of 21.01% in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [15] .",

            "text": "The efficacy of remdesivir in the management of COVID-19 has been demonstrated in several studies [9] . Olender and colleagues analyzed its efficacy in a non-randomized cohort study using a propensity score model and an inverse probability of the treatment weighting method. The participants were hospitalized patients with COVID-19, pulmonary infiltrates and either had oxygen saturation of B 94% on room air or were receiving supplemental oxygen. Their results showed that 74.40% of patients in the remdesivir group versus 59.00% in the standard of care group achieved the primary recovery endpoint at day 14 (adjusted odds ratio: 2.03 [95% CI 1.34-3.08], p \\ 0.001). They also observed a 62% lower adjusted odds of all-cause death [22] . In addition, the doubleblind, randomized, and placebo-controlled *Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia requiring low-flow oxygen therapy at the time of hospitalization. This is the target population for the treatment with remdesivir **Non-hospitalized patients, hospitalized patients with pneumonia who did not require low-flow oxygen and hospitalized patients with other disorders different from pneumonia NA not aplicable. Sources: Instituto de Salud Carlos III. Informe no 33, 2020 [12] ACTT-1 trial showed that remdesivir improves the time to recovery and clinical status of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen [10], resulting in a reduction in the length of hospital stay and the number of ICU admissions. Despite the fact that the ACTT-1 trial did not reach a statistically significant difference in mortality in the overall study population, a post hoc analysis showed that remdesivir significantly reduced the mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and supplemental oxygen. Our results showed that remdesivir would have made up to 7880 beds available in general wards and 2000 ICU beds for other patients at the peak of the occupancy rates. Therefore, this new drug could have relieved the pressure of the pandemic on hospitals and the SNHS. Furthermore, remdesivir could have implied a 27.51% reduction (95% CI 14.25%-34.07%) in deaths It should be noted that a multi-country, openlabel, randomized trial developed by WHO showed that the mortality rate for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not achieve statistical significance (RR = 0.95 [95% CI 0.81-1.11], p = 0.50) [23] . Although this conclusion differs from previous evidence, it should be noted that our results refer to those patients who required low-flow oxygen therapy (a National Early Warning Score [NEWS] of 5) [24] according to the pharmacological protocol used in the SNHS [14] . In addition, the SOLIDARITY trial compared the efficacy of remdesivir in patients with or without mechanical ventilation, regardless of the oxygen delivery system (e.g., low-or highflow devices) [23] . A recent systematic review and meta-analysis also concluded that remdesivir is more effective and safe than standard treatment because it is associated with a faster time to clinical improvement, a reduction in mortality rate, and reduced incidence of serious adverse events [25] .",

First, due to the lack of information about the clinical status of COVID-19 patients, we assumed that 76.10% of hospitalized patients with pneumonia required supplemental oxygen, according to the US records [13] . Nevertheless, a group of experts agreed that this percentage was similar to the clinical practice in Spain. Second, we considered that hospitalized patients who require mechanical ventilation, high-flow oxygen devices, or ECMO are assisted in ICUs in Spain. Although this practice is widely spread, the management of COVID-19 patients may differ in some Spanish regions. Third, since there are no real-life studies about the efficacy of remdesivir in our country, we assumed the results of the ACTT-1 trial. Fourth, although we considered official sources, our results may be biased because of notification delays and the overwhelmed healthcare system. Fifth, given that the reduction of mortality rates by age group in patients receiving remdesivir was not estimated in the ACTT-1 trial, we estimated the number of prevented deaths by age group using the reduction in the mortality rate for the whole population of the trial. Sixth, since the potential impact on Despite these limitations, the main contributions of our study are: (1) the assessment of the healthcare resources used during the first wave of the pandemic (in terms of occupied beds in general wards and ICUs) in Spain and (2) the potential number of beds that could have been available in general wards and ICUs if remdesivir had been used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our results showed that this new drug would have prevented almost half of the ICU admissions, reducing the pressure on the public healthcare system, thus providing a more efficient use of resources. Consequently, in the following waves of the pandemic, the preventive measurements and vaccines have reduced the burden of COVID-19 for the SNHS as well as the death toll [27] . Given the mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects [28, 29] , remdesivir may reduce the healthcare resource burden and potentially avoid preventable deaths.",

In addition, there is uncertainty about remdesivir's benefit in terms of mortality in low-flow oxygen therapy patients because of the limitation of a post hoc analysis. Nevertheless, aspects such as the fact that the overall mortality, significant in the total study population of the ACTT-1 trial, reflects the huge COVID-19 heterogeneity in behavior in different patient subgroups and the difficulty of randomizing benefits coming from the highest sample size subgroup (n = 232 in remdesivir group and n = 203 in placebo group) should be taken into account[10]. Furthermore, in a real-life cohort of patients with severe pneumonia receiving low-flow oxygen-therapy treated with remdesivir, the 30-day mortality rate observed was 4.1%[26], very similar to that reported in the ACTT-1 trial [10]. This suggests that the results observed in this study could be in line with reality.",
