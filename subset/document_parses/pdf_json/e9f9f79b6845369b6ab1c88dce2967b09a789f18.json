In this context, the concept of reserve has been originally suggested as a core of protective factors against the onset of negative age-related outcomes [5] . Along with passive reserves, such as the brain reserve, each individual can arrange a different variety of factors defined as active, in that they can be actively implemented and improved throughout the life course. Within the range of active reserves, the construct of cognitive reserve (CR) has been developed to describe individual differences in vulnerability to cognitive and functional decline along aging. Precisely, the CR hypothesis better explains the observed discrepancies between the amount of brain neuropathology and the degree of cognitive or functional impairment among individuals [6] .",

This physical and motor progressive deterioration exposes older adults to higher risk of negative functional outcomes, such as frailty, which denotes a condition characterized by reduced homeostatic reserves and increased individual vulnerability to stressors, and increases the risk of negative consequences as disability and mortality [23] . Frailty could be described in terms of deficit accumulation; accordingly, frailty status results from the amount of health deficits an individual has accumulated during the life course [24] . The strong relationship between motor and cognitive performances in the elderly population is supported by several studies showing that the development of cognitive impairment among older adults is associated to a reduction in walking speed or in muscle strength [25, 26] . Similarly, deficit accumulation-based frailty has been recently associated with the evolution of cognitive trajectories among older adults [27, 28] .",

Frailty denotes a crucial outcome in aging studies, and it has been broadly investigated in community populations and hospital settings [49, 50] . Since frailty is considered a multidimensional and dynamic condition, the hypothesis that CR and premorbid IQ might have an impact not only on cognitive trajectories but also on frailty has been increasingly debated during the last years. To date, only a limited numbers of studies tested the association of premorbid IQ with frailty [16] . Moreover, when the effect of CR on frailty was previously explored, the main methodological weakness has been the use of CR proxies such as education, professional employment or leisure activities. For instance, findings from a recent large prospective study highlighted that physically frail individuals showed lower education, lower socioeconomic status, and reduced engagement in social activities compared with robust individuals, which indirectly suggests that physically frail individuals had a lower cognitive reserve [51] . In this context, the use of a measure of CR (i.e., the CRIq) in our study represents a step forward to overcome such limitation. Another novel point of our study was to have investigated the association between premorbid IQ and frailty in an Italian population for the first time.",

Moreover, consistently with the above-mentioned joint cognitive-motor approach to aging, our findings, though preliminary, might be also interpreted in line with the concept of cognitive frailty, which refers to a clinical condition characterized by the presence of both physical and cognitive impairment, in the absence of a manifest diagnosed dementia [52] .

These data support the hypothesis that neurodegeneration and/or vascular brain disease may have a predilection for areas controlling gait and cognition, thus explaining the parallel deterioration of motor function and cognitive performance. Accordingly, a systematic review of 39 longitudinal studies revealed that slow gait speed is a strong predictor of incident dementia and cognitive decline in the elderly population [55] . It is conceivable to hypothesize that cognition, motor performance and frailty are interrelated domains, which might contribute to aging. Indeed, the progressive reduction of cognitive functions and the decrease of motor performances might be considered as part of a joint pathway towards age-related outcomes [42] , and slow gait might be used as a reliable measure of cognitive trajectories as proposed by a recent meta-analysis [56] .",

In line with a framework integrating physical, motor and cognitive functions as a key to successful ageing, we developed a model in which CR and premorbid IQ were tested as contributors of cognitive status, in the presence of physical and motor indexes. Cognitive status was influenced by multiple variables including CR, antecedent intellectual performance (premorbid IQ) as well as physical contributors (handgrip strength). Moreover, a lower CR, a worse motor performance measured by gait speed, and a greater frailty status were associated to the worsening of cognition over time.",
