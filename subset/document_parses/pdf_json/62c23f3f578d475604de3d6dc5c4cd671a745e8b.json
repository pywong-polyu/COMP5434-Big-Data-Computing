Integrated with certain sampling schemes, such mechanistic models can be applied to analyse public health surveillance data, such as assessing the effectiveness of preventive measures (e.g. social distancing and quarantine) and forecasting disease spread patterns. This review begins with a nationwide macromechanistic model and related statistical analyses, including model specification, estimation, inference and prediction. Then, it presents a community-level micromodel that enables high-resolution analyses of regional surveillance data to provide current and future risk information useful for local government and residents to make decisions on reopenings of local business and personal travels. R software and scripts are provided whenever appropriate to illustrate the numerical detail of algorithms and calculations.

As of 27 June 2020, this pandemic has caused a total of 9 801 572 confirmed cases and 494 181 fatalities in more than 200 countries. Being one of the most lethal communicable infectious diseases in human history, it is expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue spreading in the world population, causing even higher numbers of infections and deaths in the future. With no effective medical treatments or vaccines currently available, public health interventions such as social distancing have been implemented in most of the countries to mitigate the spread of the pandemic. One of the central tasks of statistical modelling is to provide a suitable risk prediction model that enables both government and public health workers to evaluate the effectiveness of public health policies and predict risk of COVID-19 infection at the national and regional levels. Such information is valuable for governments to assess the preparedness of medical resources (personal protective equipments and intensive care unit beds), to adjust various intervention policies and to enforce the operation of social distancing.",

A crucial step in modelling disease evolution is to capture key dynamics of the underlying disease transmission mechanisms from available public health surveillance data, which enables reliable projection of disease infection into the future. A prediction model may help us foresee some possible future epidemic/pandemic scenarios and learn consequent impacts of current economic and personal sacrifices due to various control measures.",

Forecasting is known to be a notoriously hard task, which depends heavily on the quality of data at hand and a certain model chosen to summarise the information from observed data and then to reproduce information beyond the observational time period. The chosen model is of critical importance to deliver prediction. This paper concerns a review of the family of classical compartment-based infectious disease models, which have been the most widely used mechanistic models to capture key features of infection dynamics. We begin with the most basic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model to build up the framework (Section 2), and this three-compartment model is then generalised to have more compartments to embrace additional features of infection dynamics (Section 3), such as the well-known fourcompartment model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model, which takes the incubation period of contagion into account. Given many types of factors potentially influencing the evolution of an epidemic, a single prediction value is insufficient to be trustworthy unless prediction uncertainty is reported as part of forecast analysis. Quantification of prediction uncertainty is of critical importance, especially when a forecast is made at an early phase of an epidemic with limited data. Building sampling variations in infectious disease models makes a statistical modelling approach different from a mathematical modelling approach. A clear advantage of a statistical model is that the model parameters, including those in the mechanistic model, can be estimated, rather than being specified by certain subjectively chosen prior information.",

A mechanistic model is typically governed by a system of ordinary differential equations, such as the existing three-compartment SIR model consisting of three differential equations, which explicitly specifies the underlying mechanisms of an epidemic. This model is assumed to govern an operational system of disease contagion and recovery or death, which, in reality, cannot be directly observed. Most of the time, public surveillance data are accessible, which represent only a few snapshots of the underlying latent mechanistic system of an epidemic. Such gaps may be addressed by a statistical model that incorporates sampling schemes to explain how observed data are collected from the underlying infection dynamics. In turn, prediction uncertainty will reflect forms and procedures of the chosen sampling schemes specified in the statistical model. In this paper (Section 5.1), we will introduce the state-space model as a natural and effective modelling framework to integrate the mechanistic model and sampling schemes seamlessly.",

For example, at the beginning of an outbreak, one should consider a simple model, which may be expanded over the course of an epidemic's evolution with increased data availability. To make the specified model useful to answer a certain question of practical importance, a relevant feature should be included in the model building. For example, in the study of control measures to mitigate the COVID-19 spread, the model specification should incorporate a structure that is sensitive to the influence of a preventive policy. In Section 5.2, we will introduce an expansion of the basic SIR model in that time-varying control measures are allowed to enter. The flexibility of permitting certain modifications is an important property of a model to be considered in an infectious disease model. In this field, all models need to be tailored with increased data and more knowledge from the literature as a disease evolves over time. From this point of view, compartment-based models are superior to other models because, for example, it is easy to add other compartments, such as an exposure compartment, a quarantine compartment or a self-immunisation compartment, to improve the mechanistic model, to answer specific question of practical importance and to capture distinctive data features for better prediction.",

For example, in the USA, the numbers of confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases and case fatalities are recorded for each county. The average county population size in the USA is approximately 98 000, so a microinfectious model may be built upon county-level surveillance data to make high-resolution prediction and to assess the effectiveness of control measures at a community level. This paper (Section 6) will discuss this important extension of the classical SIR model, essentially a temporal model, to a spatio-temporal model that enables borrowing of information from different spatially correlated counties in the improvement of risk prediction. This exemplary model generalisation sets up an illustration from a nation-level macromodel to a county-level micromodel. The latter is more relevant and useful for local governments to make decisions of business reopenings and for residents to be aware of local infection risk.",

Note that not every statistical model permits delivery of a user-friendly computing package that is general and flexible enough to handle various types of data.

            "text": "Multi-compartment models have been the workhorse for modelling infectious diseases since the early 20th century. They are a class of mathematical models used for describing the evolution of masses (in unit of proportions or counts) among the compartments of a varying system, with broad use cases in epidemiology, physics, engineering and information science. This is a dynamic system that is typically represented by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to time, and, given a starting condition, the mass in each of the components is regulated by a function over time. An ODE is a simple mathematical model to depict a trajectory of a functional trend. One of such examples used extensively in epidemiology is an exponential growth function, f.t/ D e t , which may be viewed as a solution to an ODE of the form: df .t / dt D f .t/, or dy dt D y, where y is a function of time t, which obviously is y D f.t/ D e t with an initial condition f.0/ D 1. It is worth pointing out that this simple ODE explicitly characterises the rate of change (speed or velocity) for function y D f.t/, rather than directly specifying a form for the function f.t/ itself. Such rate-based characterisation is termed as 'dynamics' in the mathematical literature. Clearly, this ODE is not a statistical model as it does not provide a law of data generation; in other words, there is no randomness in this ODE to reflect sampling uncertainties. A typical multi-compartment model consists of several ODEs for a vector of rates that are linked each other. This is referred to as a dynamic system. The forms of ODEs are specified according to relevant scientific knowledge about the understanding of the underlying dynamic mechanism related to an infectious disease.",

            "text": "In the context of infectious disease modelling, the SIR model is the most basic threecompartment dynamic system that describes an epidemiological mechanism of disease evolution over time (see Figure 1 ). In brief, the model describes the flow of infection states or conditions by (i) moving susceptible individuals to the infectious compartment through a transmission process (the first arrow) and (ii) moving infectious individuals to the removed compartment (either dead or recovered) through a removal process (the second arrow). At a given time, the total population N under a study is partitioned into the three compartments, denoted by S, I and R, and their sizes satisfying S C I C R D N. With a slight abuse of notation, this notation denotes either the type of compartment or the size of compartment, whichever is applicable in a given context. In other words, S, I and R are used to denote the sizes of the mutually exclusive subpopulations of susceptible, infectious and removed individuals, respectively. This compositional constraint, that is, S C I C R D N, may be interpreted in a term of probability (or proportion) as follows: at a given time, an individual in the population is either at risk (susceptible), or under infection by a virus (infectious), or removed from the infectious system due to recovery or death; that is, \u00c2 S C \u00c2 I C \u00c2 R D 1, where \u00c2 S , \u00c2 I and \u00c2 R are, respectively, the probabilities of being susceptible, infectious and removed. This presents the primary constraint for a multi-compartment infectious disease model. More details of the SIR model will be described in Section 2.",

For example, to answer the question of how many individuals will be infected with the COVID-19 by the end of the year 2020 (or any future time) requires to know a calculator that computes the cumulative numbers of susceptible, infected and removed cases over time from the past to the future. Unfortunately, in reality, functions relevant to this calculator are usually non-linear, and their exact forms are difficult to directly specify. In contrast, a set of ODEs helps better understand the disease transmission dynamics (i.e. traits of infectious diseases) and more conveniently captures their key features, where each ODE may correspond to one mode of disease evolution. Such ODEs for disease spread may be regarded as a model for the expected dynamic mechanism, serving as a systematic component in a statistical model. Numerical methods such as the Euler discretisation method or the Runge-Kutta approximation method (Stoer & Bulirsch, 2013; Butcher, 2016) can be used to obtain approximate solutions of such ODEs with given boundary conditions. Regardless of methods used, solutions to a dynamic system are deterministic functions. We illustrate a basic mechanistic model of disease spread in the succeeding text.

Consider the SIR model for a hypothetical population with a constant population of N D 100 residents and an initial condition of 99 susceptible individuals, 1 infectious individual and 0 individual removed (either died or recovered). Here 100 subjects may be also regarded as 100% if the unit of proportion is used in the interpretation. The transitions between compartments, written in ODEs as in (1), represent population movement from one compartment to another (see Figure 1 ). We consider an example with\u02c7D 0:5 (a rate of moving from S to I) and D 0:2 (a rate of moving from I to R), leading to R 0 D\u02c7= D 2:5. Here R 0 is the socalled basic reproduction number that quantifies an average number of susceptible individuals contracting a virus from one contagious person in an environment of no preventive measures. This is a quite infectious scenario as we will see later. The R script in the succeeding text shows a scenario of obtaining the solution to the system of ODEs by standard ODE solvers ( R package deSolve) using the first-order Euler method (not shown) or the Runge-Kutta fourthorder (RK4) approximation method (Figure 2 ). Details about the RK4 method can be found in Appendix A0.1. Figure 2 , on each of these 100 days, the sum of the three values from the three curves is always equal to 100, presenting a time-varying redistribution of the 100 individuals. With no control measures in this hypothetical infection dynamics, the susceptible compartment quickly drops and reaches an equilibrium state after 35 days of the outbreak, and during the period of first 35 days, the infectious compartment increases to a peak and then decreases to zero (no contagious individuals in the population) as all currently infected individuals move to the removed compartment, which is the exit of the system.",

The latter is of critical importance given many unobserved and uncontrolled factors in surveillance data collection. In an early stage of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the daily infection and death counts reported by health agencies are highly influenced by the availability of testing kits, reporting delays, reporting and attribution schemes, and under-ascertainment of mild cases in public health surveillance databases (see discussions in Angelopoulos et al., 2020; Banerjee et al., 2020) ; both disease transmission rate and time to recovery or death are also highly uncertain and vary by population density, demographic composition, regional contact network structure and non-uniform mitigation schemes (Ray et al., 2020) .

Being a certain subgroup analysis, such micromodelling is appealing to address spatial heterogeneity across the more than 3 000 counties in the USA and consequently improves the prediction accuracy. As far as the spatial modelling of infection dynamics concerns, we review the classical cellular automata (CA) that is extensively used to describe person-to-person interacting rules associated with epidemic spreading patterns in a population via relevant interlocation connectivity functions. This CA may vary spatially and temporally, which presents a principled way to extend a state-level macroinfectious disease model to a stratified microinfectious model.

It is a three-compartment model for studying how infectious diseases evolve over time on the population level. It defines a mechanism of disease transmission and recovery for a population at risk by a dynamic system of three disjoint states: susceptible, infectious and removed. We note an important distinction between infectious and infected individuals. Infectious individuals are those who are currently infected and not yet recovered or dead (currently infected individuals become infectious immediately in the SIR model, although it may not be true in reality; see the SEIR model in Section 3 where currently infected individuals become infectious with a delay in time), whereas infected individuals could mean only currently infected or both currently and previously infected. For clarity, we will refer to currently infected as infectious so that the three states in the SIR model are mutually exclusive. Individuals in the susceptible state are not immunised and can become infected by coming into contact with infectious cases, so they are at risk at a given time. Individuals in the infectious state contribute to the transmission of the disease until they ultimately recover or die, so they are contagious. Individuals in the removed state include those who either recover or die (without distinction). This is an exit from the infection system, meaning that once an individual leaves this system (recovers or dies), he or she would never return to the system. This is true for people who die from the virus but may not be the case for recovered individuals. Thus, in the SIR model, there is a technical assumption that a recovered individual would become self-immunised to the virus and no longer impact the disease transmission. A possible way to relax this assumption is to create two separate compartments corresponding to recovery and death states, respectively, leading to a four-compartment infectious disease model. To make our presentation focused on the basic three-compartment model, we make this self-immunisation assumption in this section.",

This SIR dynamic system is well posed in the sense that non-negative initial conditions lead to non-negative solutions of the three functional trajectories. These trajectories collectively demonstrate the evolutionary mechanism of an infectious disease. The SIR dynamic system in (1) may be interpreted as follows. Let us consider events occurring instantaneously at time t. In the first ODE, the ratio I.t/=N represents the proportion of contagious individuals in the population, which may be thought of as a chance that a person in the at-risk population may run into a virus carrier. If each individual at risk has an independent chance to meet a contagious person, then, according to the binomial distribution, the expected number of susceptible individuals contracting the virus is S.t/I.t/=N. In reality, a person at risk may run into\u02c7(say, 2) contagious individuals, leading to a modified chance\u02c7I.t/=N. Thus, instantaneously at time t, the system gains an additional number of infected cases equal to\u02c7S.t/I.t/=N, and these cases will leave the susceptible compartment to enter the infectious compartment. Such loss to S.t/ is attributed to the negative sign in the first equation. In the second ODE, the first term is the number of new arrivals of contagious individuals and the second term is the loss of contagious individuals at a rate who either recover or die and then enter the removed compartment. The third ODE is based on an absorbed compartment that always accumulates with new arrivals with no departure cases.

It represents the expected number of newly infected individuals who contract the virus directly from a contagious individual at time t, given that each susceptible individual has a chance of S.t/=N to meet this contagious individual. This is not to be confused with the notation R.t/, the removed population. In the early outbreak of an infectious disease in a large population, R e .t/ R 0 because S.t/=N 1. In contrast to R 0 , which is only descriptive of the disease itself (or the progression of disease near time 0), R e .t/ reflects the progression of the infectious disease in a population at any given time because it directs the sign of dI.t/=dt corresponding to acceleration or deceleration of the infection dynamics. This may be seen by the second-order derivative d 2 I.t/=dt 2 ; a time, say t , at which d 2 I.t /=dt 2 D 0 or the rate dI.t /=dt reaches a peak, is referred to as a turning point (see the peak in the middle panel of Figure 2 ). Hence, R 0 is of most interest during the early phase of an epidemic, whereas R e .t/ is of most interest later on during the controlling phases of an epidemic. For example, the so-called herd immunity is the natural immunity developed when an epidemic reaches R e .t/ < 1. In other words, without interventions, it requires the proportion of susceptible individuals to be no more than 1=R 0 , or the combined proportion of infectious and recovered to be at least 1 1=R 0 in order to contain the spread. As another example, if an effective vaccine becomes available at time Q t > 0, knowing R e . Q t/ allows us to estimate the remaining proportion of population that needs to be vaccinated in order to control the epidemic (i.e. for achieving R e .t/ < 1). Figure 3 shows that the effective reproductive number R e .t/ for Example 1 decreases as the group of susceptible individuals, S.t/, shrinks over time, eventually reaching below the threshold of 1 at time 19. The value at time 0 is R 0 D R e .0/ D 2:5, while R e .19/ D 1. The time of reaching this threshold also marks a special time of interest-when the number of active contagious individuals starts decreasing at time 19 after reaching its maximum, as shown in the middle panel of Figure 2 .",

This is a strong assumption of homogeneity for the SIR dynamic system that is governed by the same transmission and recovery param-eters\u02c7and . In practice, such a homogeneity assumption may be easily violated. Thus, modelling with heterogeneous dynamics of infection is an important and active research area in the literature on infectious diseases. Assumption 3: One susceptible individual can only develop immunity (or selfimmunisation with antibody against the virus) through infection (i.e. no vaccination). In other words, as shown in Figure 1 , the infectious compartment is the only exit of the susceptible compartment, and there is no other state to which an at-risk individual would move next. Once recovered from infection, one becomes immune to the virus for the remainder of the study period and would not return to be susceptible again. In effect, this is a rigorous definition of recovered case in the SIR model. From a view of the graphic representation in Figure 1 , this implies that there is no connection from the removed compartment to the susceptible compartment, or in other words the removed compartment is the terminal state of the infection dynamics. It is worth pointing out that to date the validity of this assumption for the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. In the literature, this condition is assumed for a certain period of time over which risk prediction is considered. Assumption 4: The infection has zero latent period in that one becomes infectious once exposed. This is a key distinction of the SIR model from the SEIR model. Like many infectious diseases, the COVID-19 has a reported average incubation period of between 4 and 7 days (Li et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020) , which adds some additional complexity in the modelling of infectious disease dynamics. As a matter of fact, this latency of contagion is really the timing of being contagious and not that of being symptomatic. Some studies have found that COVID-19 carriers are most contagious in the early phase of illness prior to the occurrence of noticeable clinical symptoms (Ip et al., 2017; He et al., 2020) . Given these findings, it is tricky to see how the compartment of exposure for incubation would be added to extend the SIR model for the COVID-19 pandemic. Assumption 5: Because the SIR model has constant transmission and recovery parameter\u0161 and , which are not time varying, the underlying infection is assumed to evolve in fully neutral environments with no mitigation efforts via external interventions such as a public health policy of social distancing, effective medication or fast testing kits for diagnosis. As far as the COVID-19 pandemic is concerned, this is the biggest restriction of the SIR model, which is not reflective of the reality-almost all countries with reported COVID-19 cases have issued various non-pharmacological control measures. Many researchers have proposed solutions to overcome this unrealistic assumption of the SIR model in the analysis of COVID-19 data (see, e.g. Wang et al., 2020) . Assumption 6: The population size N is large enough to have enough number of incidences, including the number of infections, the number of deaths and the number of recovered cases, so that the SIR model parameters can be stably estimated with high precision. Technically speaking, this is not a model assumption but a condition of sample size for statistical power. Because this mechanistic model will ultimately be used for risk projection, a well-trained model with reliable data is necessary to not only produce an accurate prediction but also to adequately assess the prediction uncertainty.",

            "text": "To further understand the mechanism of infection governed by the SIR model, we now give a brief summary of its analytic properties that provide useful guidelines for us to build statistical models and methods to learn the SIR model from available surveillance data from public health databases. (2). More importantly, although the dynamic system defined by the SIR model is continuous over time, available surveillance data are reported at discretised measurements over discretised time points. For example, most of the COVID-19 public databases update data on a daily basis, in which 'a day' is the unit of time for measurement. Knowing this discrepancy between the continuous time underlying mechanistic model and the sampling frequency at discrete times for available data is essential to create a statistical framework to link the SIR model with the data at hand. Property 2: The SIR model is deterministic and does not contain any probabilistic components. It is noteworthy that dynamics and stochasticity are two different mathematical properties; a dynamic system (e.g. the SIR model) is not necessarily stochastic, while a stochastic system is not necessarily dynamic. As shown in Figure 2 , the compartment sizes S.t/; I.t/ and R.t/ are time-varying functions with no random fluctuations, which are completely determined by the model parameters and the initial conditions of the SIR model. Obviously, this is a limitation of the SIR model when it is applied for data analysis, where data collection is subject to profuse uncertainties and random errors. Property 3: It is easy to show that the number of individuals at risk (in the entry of the system), S.t/, is monotonically non-increasing and that the number of removed cases (at the exit of the system), R.t/, is monotonically non-decreasing (see Figure 2 ). Hence, the total number of individuals who have been exposed to a virus is equal to N S.t/ D I.t/ C R.t/, which is monotonically non-decreasing. I.t/, the number of active contagious cases, or the difference between the two groups of the exposed cases and the recovered cases, can be either increasing or decreasing. The middle panel of Figure 2 nicely conveys such directionality of movements, in which the time of I.t/ reaching the peak and the time of I.t/ reducing to zero are two important turning points of interest in epidemiology. The former indicates the turning point of disease mitigation, and the latter corresponds to the turning point of disease containment. Property 4: It can be shown that I.1/ D 0 (or equivalently, \u00c2 I .1/ D 0), meaning that the disease will eventually die out. This is because when t ! 1, the rate of prevalence \u00c2 I .t/, given by .\u02c7\u00c2 S .t/ / in (2), will become negative at a certain time and then become more and more negative until converging to zero because \u00c2 S .t/ is a decreasing function and \u00c2 I .t/ is bounded in the succeeding text by zero. However, this property of decaying to zero is conditional on the assumptions listed earlier. Violation of Assumptions 1 and 3 are most likely to cause a disease to persist because the monotonicity of S.t/ used in the earlier argument is no longer valid. An example of such diseases includes seasonal influenza, where immunity does not last long. Property 5: The SIR model has a recursive property in that at any given time, disease progression (i.e. shapes of the three functions) is only dependent on their current values and not on other information from the past. This property of recursion should not be confused with the Markov property that has exclusively used in the literature of stochastic processes under the conditional probability law. Here there is no probability law involved in the recursive operation, which is indeed a fully deterministic recursion. Such conceptual distinction may help understand the differences between dynamics and stochasticity.",

A direct impact of these external interventions is that both the transmission and recovery rates are no longer constant over time. Thus, an important generalisation of the SIR model is to accommodate different degrees of mitigation policies, including social distancing, limiting transportation, mandatory mask wearing and city lockdown. As observed in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, mitigation strategies are changing over time. Limiting mobility of susceptible individuals and medically isolating contagious individuals in the population would reduce the rate of contracting virus, leading to a decreasing disease transmission rate\u02c7.t/. At the same time, gaining better knowledge on both treatment and self-management of symptoms and improving medical resources may increase the rate of recovery .t/ over the course of an epidemic.

One useful feature for the use of a parametric function of\u02c7.t/ is to incorporate seasonality in the transmission rate. It is well known that many infectious diseases spread most quickly in some of the winter months. Especially, respiratory infectious diseases caused by some coronaviruses exhibit seasonal behaviours that are consistent with the trends of temperature and humidity (Barreca & Shimshack, 2012; Sajadi et al., 2020) . Accounting for such seasonal periodicity in the model would produce a better long-term prediction of an epidemic. As the public attention for COVID-19 pandemic projection gradually shifts from the short term to the long term, it becomes increasingly important to take seasonality into account.

First, incubation period varies from one person to another; in the case of COVID-19, the incubation period ranges from 0 to 15 days, with a median of 5.1 days (Lauer et al., 2020) . In another study of COVID-19 patients in China, Guan et al. (2020) have reported that the estimated incubation period is between 0 to 24 days with a median of 3 days. It is clear that this quantity is very person dependent. Second, ascertainment of contagion may be largely delayed because of shortage of virus testing sources. This length-biased sampling problem is notoriously challenging for the estimation of the incubation period (Qin et al., 2020) . Third, in the literature (e.g. He et al., 2020) researchers found that COVID-19 carriers tend to be more contagious right after contracting the coronavirus than a week later because they are not self-quarantined in the absence of clinical symptoms. In other words, in the case of the COVID-19, the incubation period (or sojourn at exposed state) is too short to play a substantial role in the modelling of the pandemic. ",

The latter is built upon a random sampling scheme that enables a stochastic extension of the mechanistic model (e.g. SIR model) given in the systematic component.

This added uncertainty is crucial to policymaking as models not only generate an average estimation or prediction but also present the best and worst possible scenarios for more robust and confident handling of epidemics, given that surveillance data are subject to various issues in the data collection. An example presented in Britton (2010) vividly shows the uncertainty in the progression of an infectious disease. Consider patient zero, who will go on and infect on average R 0 number of other individuals, as defined by a certain disease mechanism. The number of individuals who contract the virus from this patient is in fact stochastic, varying around the expected number of infections R 0 , which could be described by a distribution (e.g. Poisson or negative binomial) with mean R 0 on the support of non-negative integers. With a non-zero probability of taking the value zero due to the variability in human activities, there is a non-negligible chance that an epidemic is completely averted. The opposite could be an outbreak with a non-zero probability that infects tens of thousands of people. Without modelling such uncertainty, we cannot see all these possibilities and associated likelihoods of their occurrences during the course of an epidemic (Roberts et al., 2015) . Infectious disease systems governed by the class of multi-compartment models, though describing the population average, are useful to describe individual-based stochastic processes if certain random components are introduced into the modelling framework. Thus, the resulting statistical models present more natural approaches to the analysis of surveillance infectious disease data.",

Those that can be determined a priori with no need for estimation, which we term as hyperparameters. Those that cannot be fully determined and need to be estimated using the data at hand, which we term as target parameters. The choices of which parameter should be a target parameter versus a hyperparameter vary widely across methods. Intuitively, the more we know about the biological characteristics of a disease, the more parameters can be held fixed a priori in the analysis. It is however very difficult to determine most of the model parameters early in an outbreak because of the limited amount of knowledge and data about the disease. Indeed, many model parameters are not identifiable because of the lack of relevant data availability. One such example is the rate parameter of immunity\u02dbin the SAIR model (6). As relevant knowledge accumulates, literature reveals increasingly precise characterisation of the disease, such as its latency period, recovery rate, death rate, immunity duration and antibody acquirement. Such information is typically obtained from surveys of high-quality individual-level data, which may provide much better quantification of these hyperparameters than having to be re-estimated by epidemic models, which, on the other hand, are largely based on much coarser surveillance data. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, this survey-based approach may be too costly to carry out in countries with large and heterogeneous populations. In general, target parameters are mostly those that are location specific, for example, transmission rate and fatality rate. They vary largely across regions because of non-uniform mitigation effort and hospital resources; hence, datadriven estimations are preferred. In Section 6, we introduce an areal spatial modelling approach to account for spatial heterogeneity in the analysis of infectious disease data.",

To relax this technical weakness, later in Section 5, we introduce a Bayesian framework in which such prior information (e.g. hyperparameters) enters the statistical model via certain prior distributions rather fixed values, so that the uncertainty on those hyperparameters is adaptively compensated with the amount and quality of observed surveillance data.

Give\u0148 and , numerical approximations (e.g. Runge-Kutta methods) can be used to solve for the trajectories, S.t/; I.t/ and R.t/. These expected trajectories are then compared with the observed trajectories to compute a discrepancy score, such as the sum (over time) of the squared errors, represented as a loss function of target parameters. Now, it remains to find the estimates of these parameters that give rise to the curve that best fits the data through standard optimisation tools.

For simplicity, we fix D 0:2 in this example. We then evaluate the sum of squared error (SSE) loss between the expected cumulative infectious count I.t/ and its sample counterpart I obs .t/, and the value that minimises this loss gives an estimate of\u02c7. Figure 7 plots the SSE loss versus\u01d4 sing the simulated data I obs .t/, t D 1; : : : ; T, with T D 10; 20; 50, respectively. It is found that the SSE loss is minimised at \u01d1 D 0:5 as expected. The longer the observed sequence, the more curved around 0.5 the SSE appears, so the better we can identify the minimum of the SSE curve. The R script shows the example for the case of T D 10. Note that the sequence we used to define the fit is I.t/, but S.t/ and R.t/ can also be used in the estimation. Similarly, a two-dimensional grid search can be used for estimating\u02c7and jointly when is not fixed in which the data of R.t/ must be used in the estimation. Here we present only one replicate for illustration. Example 3. We apply the same approach as given in Example 2 for analysing the daily time series of the COVID-19 cumulative infectious counts in Michigan during 11 March to 1 May 2020. Details of the data are described in Appendix A2, including the I.t/ sequence. The already defined SIR function from Example 1 is used as the dynamic model, and the already defined sse function from Example 2 is used as the loss function. By fixing D 0:2 (i.e. average contagious period of 5 days) the following code computes the solution \u01d1 D 0:79 using the first 10 observations (11 to 20 March). We then increase the number of observations in the estimation; as shown in Figure 8 , the value of \u01d1 decreases when more data are used. This is noticeably different from Example 2 where \u01d1 remains constant regardless of the number of observations used. The gradual decrease in our estimate of\u02c7indicates a potential reduction in the transmission rate over time in Michigan due to the enforcement of statewide social distancing. In other words, the assumption of a constant transmission rate\u02c7is inappropriate for the Michigan data. This result suggests a need for using a more proper modelling technique, which will be demonstrated in Section 5.5. Being often used as a classic textbook example, this least squares approach is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) under the assumption that measurement errors are independent and normally distributed with a homogeneous variance. In general, this approach gives consistent estimation and does not require a distributional assumption for the data generation and thus can be applicable to non-normal data. However, the ordinary least squares loss used in the earlier example assumes that data are independently sampled over time, which is not true because the observations are time series and are thus temporally correlated. Because of this, the least squares estimation is not efficient. Cintr\u00f3n-Arias et al. (2009) have discussed the use of a generalised least squares approach to account for more complex error structure, including temporal autocorrelations.",

Distribution assumptions can be made for many quantities in an infectious disease model. Some are fully specified based on given knowledge. For example, the distribution of incubation period of a disease can be represented as a probability mass function by days (Lauer et al., 2020) . On the other hand, some distributions are only specified to be from a family of shapes, with the exact form to be estimated. We illustrate the latter using a stochastic SIR model.",

Hence, the number of newly exposed in an instantaneous duration of dt follows a Poisson distribution with mean\u02c7S .t /I.t / N dt.

When we jointly consider all I.t/ infectious subjects at time t, exit events occur independently with a rate I.t/, and the gap times between two adjacent exits are exponentially distributed with mean 1=f I.t/g. In summary, the number of removed individuals is a counting process following a Poisson process with rate I.t/.

(ii) State-space model allows an explicit sampling scheme to be part of the model specification, which enables the quantification of both estimation and prediction uncertainties in the statistical analysis. (iii) State-space model is built upon the compartment probabilities (or rates or proportions) that automatically adjust for potentially varying population sizes. This conveniently relaxes the condition of a constant population size in the basic SIR model. (iv) State-space model provides a flexible statistical modelling framework that embraces time-varying model parameters and integrates prior knowledge of disease mechanisms (e.g. R 0 value from other studies) via prior distributions of the model parameters. (v) Implementation of MCMC methods in statespace modelling provides a powerful approach to parameter estimation and predictions using conditional distributions given the history.

This quarantine compartment collects in-home isolated individuals who would have no chance of meeting any infectious individuals in the infection system.

This four-compartment model is termed as SAIR model, which has been discussed in detail in Section 3.3. Because the antibody compartment is also a second exit from the infection system, similar to the quarantine compartment, one can turn the SAIR model given in (6) into a similar form of the SQIR model in (14), where .t/ is replaced by\u02db.t/, the rate of self-immunisation. It is known that the population immunity rate cannot be estimated from observed surveillance data, which needs to be figured out by using large-scale serological surveys in the population. Thus,\u02db.t/ may be specified as a Dirac delta function (e.g. Figure 10 (G)-(I)) with jumps at times when the surveys are conducted and function values based on the survey results. It is worth pointing out that although the SQIR and SAIR models have very similar model structures, their interpretations are very different. The former is applicable to the case of very stringent self-isolation control measures in Hubei, while the latter is reflective to the situation of selfimmunisation due to mild control measures in the USA, so that a substantial proportion of individuals who contracted the virus, recovered and became immunised.",

Convergence diagnostics of the MCMC algorithm may use standard diagnostic tools such as the Gelman-Rubin statistic based on multiple chains with different initial values, monitoring trace plots of the model parameters and so forth. The R package coda provides a comprehensive toolbox of convergence diagnostics (Brooks & Gelman, 1998) . Using the MCMC draws collected after the burn-in, various summary statistics may be obtained to estimate model parameters, conduct inference and make prediction. The summary statistics (e.g. posterior mean and posterior mode) from the in-sample draws of the model parameters can provide point estimates and 95% credible intervals with the left and right limits set respectively at the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile, and those of the observed processes may be used to check the goodness of fit of a proposed model and to perform model selection via the deviance information criterion (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002; Gelman et al., 2013) . More importantly, the summary statistics from the out-sample draws of the latent process \u00c2 t ; t > t 0 provide point predictions and their 95% credible prediction intervals.

For the Michigan data analysis example in Section 5.5, using an average personal computer, we spend 1.5 h completing all MCMC calculations of 200 000 draws with thinning bin size of 10 after the burn-in judged by four separate MCMC chains. This computing speed can be improved by using highperformance computing facilities and/or some recent posterior sampling methods. As suggested by Zhou and Ji (2020) for a state-space SIR model, one may set a more efficient sampler over highly correlated posterior spaces by parallel-tempering MCMC algorithm (Geyer, 1991) , which provides rapid mixing in MCMC chains. Also, along the line of online learning, sequential Monte Carlo methods for posterior sampling (Doucet et al., 2001; Dukic et al., 2012) are promising, as they permit efficient updating of existing posteriors with sequentially arrived data, in the hope to avoid refitting the model by running MCMC from scratch using the updated complete data. Wang et al. (2020) and have developed a series of extended SIR models by introducing time-varying transmission rate, quarantine process and asymptomatic immunisation process (details in Section 5.2). The proposed methods have been established in an open-source R package eSIR, available on GitHub (https://github.com/lilywang1988/eSIR). This package calls rjags to generate MCMC chains and retains a few MCMC controllers from rjags. The package is also updated weekly with new summarised US state-level count data for the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Once an epidemic evolves further into its middle phase, with more and more surveillance data collected from local communities, a macromodel is no longer suitable for an in-depth analysis of microinfection dynamics owing to the existence of substantial heterogeneity across local communities. This section concerns a review of significant extensions of infectious disease models by incorporating spatial heterogeneity across different geographical locations into modelling and analysis. The focus will be on the recent development of integrating the classical spatial cellular automata (CA) (von Neumann & Burks, 1966) with the previously discussed temporal multi-compartment models, leading to an important class of spatio-temporal multi-compartment models. This class of models is useful to predict local infection risk.",

This means that the spatial characteristics that could potentially play a non-trivial role in the development and outcome of disease infection are not taken into consideration. This is a valid assumption if the population vulnerable to the infectious disease is mixed well and the human interventions (e.g. vaccination strategies) are homogeneous across different spatial locations. However, in reality, there exists substantial heterogeneity in the urbanisation, ethnic distribution, political views, governance and economic composition across different subgroups of individuals distributed over geographical locations, all of which will influence the spread of infectious disease and make the previous macromechanistic model not appropriate to address the dynamics spatially. One possible extension is to utilise partial differential equations (PDEs) (Murray et al., 1986) in spatial homogeneity, which is relaxed to allow area-specific spread patterns of epidemics. As noted in the literature, one limitation of PDEs is that this approach ignores the fact that infectious disease is spread through person-to-person interactions, rather than by a continuous population. Thus, PDEs may lead to impractical results about the dynamics of an epidemic (Mollison, 1991) . A natural strategy is to embrace a micromodel mimicking an interactive particle system, and CA is one of the well-studied systems with the strength of modelling spatially varying infection dynamics. Originated in the works of von Neumann and Burks (1966) and Ulam (1962) , the CA paradigm has been used in many applied fields, including the modelling of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "When applied to model spatial variations of epidemic spread, CA has three distinctive features: (i) it treats individuals as discrete entities in order to study person-level movements in the infection dynamics. This high-resolution paradigm necessitates the incorporation of individual's heterogeneity such as residential address, age, race, pre-existing medical conditions and others in the modelling. In surveillance data, geographical information is publicly available (e.g. county that an individual lives), so it is feasible to utilise this variable in the extension of the macromechanistic model. (ii) CA allows to introduce local stochasticity; for example, the CA paradigm may be built upon a person-to-person infectious mechanism if individual-level information is available; otherwise, it may be based on a group-group infection process. (iii) CA is formulated in a network of particles (e.g. individuals, groups, villages and counties) with certain rules of connectivity and stochastic laws of disease transmission. This network topology is well suited for computations and simulations. Because of these unique advantages, the CA paradigm has been employed by researches as an efficient method to study spread patterns of epidemics (Beauchemin et al., 2005; Ahmed & Agiza, 1998; Boccara et al., 1994; Quan-Xing & Zhen, 2005; Fuks & Lawniczak, 2001; Willox et al., 2003; Rousseau et al., 1997; Sirakoulis et al., 2000; Fuentes & Kuperman, 1999; Liu et al., 2006; Yakowitz et al., 1990; Sun et al., 2011) . In the modelling of infectious diseases, the basic CA formulation involves three primary components: (i) a two-way array of cells (e.g. an age group or a county) that contain groups of individuals under study, and each individual belongs to one cell; (ii) a set of discrete states (e.g. susceptible, self-immunised, contagious, recovered and death) that describe different conditions of individuals during an epidemic; and (iii) some specific rules or updating functions that determine spatially how local interactions with a target cell from its neighbouring cells can influence and change the states of individuals in the target cell; all cells in a CA system achieve a global propagation of infection status updates instantaneously and continuously. In the application of the CA, determining neighbouring cells is tricky, and different types of neighbourhood topology have been proposed in the literature, including von Neumann neighbourhood, Moore neighbourhood, MvonN neighbourhood and extended neighbourhood (Hasani & Tavakkoli, 2007 ) (see Figure 13 for an example of these four neighbourhood types).",

(2005) use a simple two-dimensional CA model to investigate the influence of spatial heterogeneity on viral kinetics. Their study population consists of two types of cell species, the epithelial cells and the immune cells. The epithelial cells are the target of viral infection, and the immune cells are those fighting the infection. The CA model is built upon a two-dimensional square lattice with the Moore neighbourhood (see Figure 13 (B)), where the condition of a certain cell will only be influenced by the eight closest cells around it. The set of states for the epithelial cells include healthy, infected, expressing, infectious or dead, while an immune cell can be in any of two states: virgin or mature. Decision rules of updating the CA system are governed by parameters, such as INFECT_RATE that models the probability of a healthy epithelial cell being infected by contacting each infectious nearest neighbour. Detailed updating functions are discussed in Beauchemin et al. (2005) . Simulations show that the proposed CA model is sophisticated enough to reproduce the basic dynamic features of the cell-to-cell infection.",

It is assumed that the status of individuals will change between three types, susceptible, infectious and recovered, denoted as fS; I; Rg. The space where the epidemic takes place is set as a group of regular hexagonal cells, in which the individuals are located at the centre of each cell and can move through a channel that is created by connecting two centres of adjacent cells. The evolution of the CA occurs at discrete time steps under the operation of three basic functions, including contact C, randomisation R and propagation P. With the application of function C, an individual who is susceptible can become infected with probability 1 .1 \u02c7/ N I , where\u02c7is the transmission rate and N I is the number of infectious individuals within the same cell. Meanwhile, an individual who is infectious can recover with probability , where is the recovery rate. The function R randomly assigns individuals in each cell to move through the channels, which contributes to modelling the mixing process of individuals. In the final propagation step, individuals simultaneously move to the cells that they are randomly assigned to by R. In addition to the basic epidemic dynamics modelled by the proposed lattice gas CA, Fuks and Lawniczak (2001) also study the effect of heterogeneous spatial distribution of individuals with states S, I and R and the influence of different types of barriers in controlling the spread of an epidemic.",

            "text": "We illustrate the predicted risk of infection with the COVID-19 for all 83 counties in Michigan state using the state-space model with the mechanistic CA-eSAIR latent process . In the first step, we apply the MCMC method to estimate the model parameters (\u02c7and ) and the vector of four probabilities \u00c2 t of being susceptible, self-immunised, infectious and removed by fitting the eSAIR model with the state-level surveillance data since 11 March. This can be performed easily using the R package eSIR, which has been illustrated in Section 5.5. Both the antibody rate function\u02db.t/ and the transmission rate modifier .t/ are pre-specified using other data sources with the detail given in the succeeding text. After getting the estimates of the model parameters, we use them as the initial values to make county-level risk prediction by the CA-eSAIR model (15). In this example, we consider only a 1-day ahead infection rate prediction (i.e. 3 May 2020) for all the counties in Michigan, namely, \u00c2 I c .t 0 C 1/. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic evolves fast in the state of Michigan in early May 2020, this kind of short-term forecast or nowcast is of great interest to the Michigan government for timely decision making on either extending an existing governor's 'Stay-At-Home' order or relaxing this executive order. To perform the prediction, one important task is to specify the inter-county connectivity coefficient ! cc 0 .t/. As discussed in , it is challenging to define ! cc 0 .t/ objectively, as it involves many variables. In this illustration, we specify this coefficient as ! cc 0 .t/ D cc 0 expf \u00c1r.c; c 0 /g, where \u00c1 is a tuning parameter to be determined. Briefly speaking, the first factor c,c 0 is the inter-county mobility factor characterising the decrease of human encounters in terms of their potential movements between counties, which has been given online (https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard). The second factor r.c; c 0 / is a certain travel distance between two counties c and c 0 in terms of both geodesic distance (Karney, 2013) and 'air distance' based on the accessibility to nearby airports. In addition, the tuning parameter \u00c1 enables to adjust the scale of the travel distance by minimising the sum of (county-level) weighted absolute prediction error for the one-step ahead risk prediction of the infection rate. In addition to the specification of the connectivity coefficient ! cc 0 .t/, the self-immunisation rate\u02dbc.t/ is calculated based on the results of the New York statewide antibody test surveys released by the New York governor Andrew Cuomo on 29 April (New York State Report, 2020), and the transmission modifier function c .t/ is specified by the effectiveness score of state-specific social distancing using cell phone data in the USA from the Transportation Institute at the University of Maryland (https://data.covid.umd.edu/). Additional details of the determination of c,c 0 , r.c; c 0 /,\u02dbc.t/ and c .t/ and the tuning of \u00c1 can be found in . Figure 14(A) shows the 1-day ahead projected infectious rate for 83 counties in Michigan on 3 May, and Figure 14 (B) plots the corresponding county-level weighted prediction errors (WPE), which is at the order of 10 7 for the counties.

Within the stochastic modelling framework, both the frequentist and the Bayesian schools of modelling considerations and statistical methods are visited, along with high-level review and illustrative examples. Epidemic models have played a key role in the past century to provide understanding of past and ongoing infectious diseases, and it is our belief that they will continually be valued and be improved to help us better understand the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as future infectious diseases.

This is indeed an open problem to date with no appropriate solutions yet. With no insurance of reliable data, statistical methods, regardless of macromodels or micromodels, would fail to produce meaningful results. One potentially promising solution to such a fundamental concern is to build reliable and well-validated open-source benchmark databases that include not only traditional surveillance data but also personal clinical data from various sources such as hospital electronic health records, drug trials and vaccine trials. In addition, data from serological surveys and data from mobile devices or as such are also useful to increase information resolution and reliability, to remove major measurement biases and to calibrate data analytics. This task requires also efforts of data integration and international collaborations.

The design of this nationwide serological survey is a challenging statistical problem.

As most methods and models for the COVID-19 pandemic are fairly recent and many have not yet been carefully peer reviewed, researchers should document the sources of data used, data preprocessing protocols, source computing code and sufficient modelling details to allow external validation from the public. Such details are also necessary to allow others, who may have better quality data but without sufficient statistical expertise, to easily adopt new methodologies to obtain high-quality results. As mentioned in an original post by Dr Nilanjan Chatterjee (https://link.medium.com/hqUQILEAd6), transparency, reproducibility and validity are three criteria to assess and assure the quality of prediction models. His essay also mentioned the difficulty in reproducing the work given by the IHME to obtain accurate predictions and appropriate confidence intervals. Similar to the IHME method that has no software available, Gu's method for the COVID-19 prediction (https://covid19-projections. com/) that has recently received much attention does not provide software, either, unfortunately. Without clear guidance and full reproducibility, even models that currently do well might fail in the future because predictions are relying on certain kinds of extrapolation assumptions that need to be unveiled to the scientific community with full transparency for validation and comparison.",

As shown in the data example in Section 6.5, the optimal tuning parameter is determined by the minimal short-term 1-day ahead prediction error. As pointed out by Huppert and Katriel (2013) , transmission models with different underlying mechanisms may lead to similar outcome in one context (e.g. short term) but fail to do so in another (e.g. long term). The further we project, the more we are uncertain about the validity of model assumptions. Hence, extra caution is needed when reporting and interpreting long-term projection results. With the available surveillance data, making a nowcast of infection risk in next few hours is difficult; but it may become feasible when certain data sources of local information are accessible, such as electronic health records from local hospitals, viral testing results from local testing centres and mobile tracking data from individual cell phones. This requires a finer-resolution prediction machinery that may be established by generalising the CA to certain spatial point processes. Despite being challenging, such prediction paradigm would be very useful and worth a serious exploration.",

The current strategy of handling these extra variables is via stratification, which would end up with strata with small sample sizes, so that subsequent statistical analyses lose power in both estimation and prediction of infection dynamics. An extension from the CA seems promising as the CA presents a system of particles distributed in different cells (or strata), where individual characterisations on particles may be added via covariates. The resulting model would assess and predict personal risk, as well as identify hotspots of new infection. This is worth serious exploration in the future with appropriate data available (e.g. electronic health records from hospitals).",

Given the fact that a pandemic evolves typically in a certain time lag, experiences from countries with earlier outbreaks may be shared with countries with later outbreaks, where statistical methods may borrow relevant information to set up prior distributions in the model fitting. For example, the estimated reproduction number estimated from the European COVID-19 data may be a hyperparameter in the statistical analysis of the US COVID-19 data. There is a clear need of more comprehensive meta-analysis methods to better integrate data from different countries than using the data to create hyperparameters. Along this line, one of the earliest attempts is to combine COVID-19 forecasts from various research teams using ensemble learning (see, e.g. https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub).",

Long-term projection of the COVID-19 is most sensitive to and highly dependent on public health policy. A major source of uncertainty is due to the conflicting demands between public health (disease mitigation) and the need to sustain economic growth (livelihood), and the balance of the two is a moving target. One way to account for the modelling uncertainty is to factor in economic planning as a time-varying modifier of projection models. Although some efforts have been made to incorporate economical data, most are retrospectively oriented, and we believe more efforts should be spent to prospectively incorporate expert inputs and economic forecasts. This is a research area of great importance worth serious exploration.",

Answers to these questions need a relatively accurate long-term prediction of the infection dynamics. Among so many different statistical models being able to predict future spreading patterns, we need to identify few ones or their combinations that are particularly useful to make long-term predictions. Question 2: As many countries and regions started to reopen business, how would government monitor the likelihood of a recurring surge of COVID-19 caused by business reopenings? Does the social distancing measure help reduce a potentially rising risk? Answers to these questions require adequate data that may not be easily collected by routine approaches. Statisticians may work with practitioners to develop good sampling instruments and schemes for community risk surveillance. Question 3: Is face mask protective? If so, how to assess the compliance of face mask wearing? Questions about the causal effect of face mask wearing on disease progression are very challenging. This is because there is no randomisation in the intervention allocation and many confounding factors are unobserved. Question 4: Is there evidence that the contagion of the coronavirus decays over time because of an increasing recovery rate of virus carriers and a decreasing rate of case fatality? Statisticians ought to work out some thoughtful and convincing answers to the public. such surveillance data, there are data reporting gaps shown in Figure A1 that are possibly caused by the so-called clustered reporting; that is, the recovered cases have not been released on the daily basis. To mitigate this data reporting artefact, we invoked a simple local polynomial regression procedure (LOESS) to smooth such unnatural jumps, resulting in a smooth fitted curve shown in Figure A1 . The calibrated cumulative numbers of removed cases from the fitted curve (rounded to the corresponding integers) are available from the corresponding author upon request. The total population in Michigan is set as 9.99 million. The summarised US state-level count data, which are weekly updated, can be also be found directly from the eSIR package introduced in Section 5.4.",

            "text": "Although the two applications discussed earlier in Section 6.2 give a framework of how CA models the dynamics of epidemic spread, White et al. (2007) provide a more direct incorporation of spatial CA with the temporal SIR compartments at the population level, where each cell stands for a small population (e.g. a county) with different proportions of susceptible, infectious or recovered individuals. The resulting CA-SIR given in White et al. (2007) is formulated by four parts (C, Q, V and f). First, C D f.i; j/; 1 \u00c4 i \u00c4 r; 1 \u00c4 j \u00c4 cg defines the cellular space, or a collection of r c cells on a two-way array, where r c is referred to the dimension of the cells. Second, Q represents a finite set that contains all the possible states of a cellular space. In the case of the SIR model, Q D fS; I; Rg corresponding to the susceptible, infectious and removed states. Third, V D f.p k ; q k /; 1 \u00c4 k \u00c4 ng is the finite set of indices defining the neighbourhood of each cell, and consequently, V ij D f.i C p 1 ; j C q 1 /; : : : ; .i C p n ; j C q n /g denotes the set of neighbouring cells for the central cell .i; j/. Specifically, V D V f.0; 0/g represents all the neighbouring cells without the cell at the centre of consideration. Fourth, function f stands for certain updating rules to govern the dynamics of interactions between cells in the a CA-SIR system. For each cell at a discrete time t (say, today), its current status is described by three cell-specific compartments f\u00c2 S ij .t/, \u00c2 I ij .t/ and \u00c2 R ij .t/g, where \u00c2 S ij .t/, \u00c2 I ij .t/ and \u00c2 R ij .t/ 2 OE0; 1 represent the cell-specific probabilities of being susceptible, infectious and recovered, respectively.

            "text": "Based on the basic CA-SIR model proposed in White et al. (2007) , extensions can be easily applied to better model the dynamics of infectious diseases using real data. propose a spatio-temporal epidemiological forecast model that combines CA with an extended SAIR (eSAIR) model to project the county-level COVID-19 prevalence over 3 109 counties in the continental United States. This model is termed as CA-eSAIR model in which a county is treated as a cell. To carry out cell-level infection prevalence updates, the macroparameters\u01ce nd need to be estimated from the macromodel eSAIR model. In comparison with the eSIR model discussed in Section 5.2, a new antibody compartment (A) is included in the eSAIR model to account for the individuals who are self-immunised and have developed antibodies to the coronavirus. The inclusion of the antibody compartment can address the under-reporting issue known for available public databases and to build self-immunisation into the infection dynamics. In this way, better estimation of the macromodel parameters can be obtained. The eSAIR model can be described using the following ODEs, which govern the law of interactive movements among four compartments or states of susceptible (S), self-immunised (A), infectious (I) and removed (R):where\u02db.t/ is the self-immunisation rate, .t/ is a time-varying transmission rate modifier,\u02c7is the basic disease transmission rate and is the rate of being removed from the system (either dead or recovered). The earlier eSAIR model is an alternative expression of model (6) based on the compartment probabilities. In order to apply the CA-eSAIR system to model the epidemic spread in the USA, relax the classical CA-eSAIR from spatial lattices (or cells) to areal locations of counties. Let C be the collection of 3 109 counties. Here we consider the extended neighbourhood type (all counties are neighbouring ones given high mobility in the US population). For a county c 2 C, N c denotes the county population size, and C c denotes the set of all the other counties except county c. For county c at time t, the county-specific probability vector is denoted by \u00c2 c .t/ D .\u00c2 S c .t/; \u00c2 A c .t/; \u00c2 I c .t/; \u00c2 R c .t// > . The CA-eSAIR model at discrete times is expressed by the following form:where\u02dbc.t/ is the county-specific self-immunisation rate and c .t/ is the county-specific transmission modifier. Same as the parameter mentioned in the CA-SIR model (15) earlier, ! cc 0 .t/ is a connectivity coefficient that quantifies the inter-county movements between counties c and c 0 . By applying the proposed CA-eSAIR model, have proposed a t-day ahead risk forecast of the COVID-19 as well as a personal risk related to a travel route.",
