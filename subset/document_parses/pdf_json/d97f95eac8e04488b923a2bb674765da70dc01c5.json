            "text": "Motivation: InterARTIC is an interactive web application for the analysis of viral whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data generated on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) devices. A graphical interface enables users with no bioinformatics expertise to analyze WGS experiments and reconstruct consensus genome sequences from individual isolates of viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. InterARTIC is intended to facilitate widespread adoption and standardization of ONT sequencing for viral surveillance and molecular epidemiology. Results: We demonstrate the use of InterARTIC for the analysis of ONT viral WGS data from SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus, using a laptop computer or the internal computer on an ONT GridION sequencing device. We showcase the intuitive graphical interface, workflow customization capabilities and job-scheduling system that facilitate execution of small-and large-scale WGS projects on any common virus. Availability and implementation: InterARTIC is a free, open-source web application implemented in Python that executes best-practice command line workflows from the ARTIC network. The application can be downloaded as a set of pre-compiled binaries that are compatible with all common Linux distributions, Windows with Linux subsystems, MacOSX and ARM systems. All code can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/Psy-Fer/interARTIC/ and documentation can be found at https://github.com/Psy-Fer/interARTIC/.",

Viral WGS is used to define the phylogenetic structure of disease outbreaks in order to better understand geographical spread, resolve transmission networks and infer the origin of unknown cases (Eden et al., 2020; Fauver et al., 2020; Gonzalez-Reiche et al., 2020; Rockett et al., 2020) . Viral WGS can also identify novel strains, and monitor virus evolution over time or in response to public health interventions, such as vaccines (du Plessis et al., 2021; Fiorentini et al., 2021; Tegally et al., 2021; Williams and Burgers, 2021) .",

The genome (FASTA format) and primer site (BED format) reference files used during these steps can be selected from a range of popular options or supplied as custom files, according to the user's needs. Genetic variants (SNVs and indels) are then identified relative to the reference genome. InterARTIC currently supports two alternative workflow choices for variant detection that utilize the popular tools Nanopolish or Medaka/Longshot, with the user selecting either or both workflows [ Fig. 1A(v) ]. Low-quality variant candidates are then excluded [ Fig. 1A(vi) ] and regions of low coverage are masked from the reference genome (Fig. 1A(vii) ). Finally, variant candidates are incorporated into the masked reference genome using Bcftools to generate a consensus genome sequence for the viral isolate under analysis [ Fig. 1A(viii) ]. This consensus genome sequence is suitable for downstream applications including lineage classification and phylogeographic analysis [ Fig. 1A(ix) ], and ready for upload to public repositories (e.g. GISAID).",

Installation of the multiple third-party tools (and their underlying dependencies) currently required for WGS analysis can be a major challenge, even for experienced users. During this process, dependency conflicts are frequently encountered between the various software environments on a user's PC. InterARTIC employs a novel containment approach, described in Supplementary Note S1, which removes any risk of dependency conflicts.
