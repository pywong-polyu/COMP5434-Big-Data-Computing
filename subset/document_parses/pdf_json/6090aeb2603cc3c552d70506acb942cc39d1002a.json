These measures can generally be of different kinds such as social distancing, partial or total confinement, etc. It would therefore be interesting to be able to effectively analyze the effects of the measures taken on the spread of the pandemic. Here we offer an analysis of the impact of the measures taken that we apply to the case of Senegal. In previous papers [4] , [12] and [13] we proposed a start of study using the results of [10] . In [10] , a useful method for the study of the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic has been resented by using a compartmental model with Susceptible, Infected, Infected reported and unreported (SIRU). In [4] , the author use that method to study the COVID-19 spread in Senegal with a classical SIR model. In this work we aim to analyze the impact of the anti pandemic measures taken in Senegal. It is a continuation of the work done in [4] . We do a two-step analysis. The first uses the SIRU epidemic model introduced in [10] , and the second uses two machine learning tools: Predict of Wolfram Mathematica using Neural Networks method and Prophet. We conduct the work in the following way. In the first section we will study the effect of the nationwide measures, using a model presented in [10] and machine learning tools. We will show, in the second section, the numerical results. Then in the third section, we will discuss the results.

The aim was to analyze the effect of the nationwide measures using the data after nationwide measures. In fact, throughout t 0 to T , we fitted an exponential function to the data of the total cases of infection of this period. T represents the date of the nationwide measures, and t 0 is the starting time of the epidemic. We consider that the effects of the measures are such that they lead to a reduction in the contact rate. To describe this reduction, we chose a slowly decreasing function over time. We consider that the measures taken are not strong enough to systematically drop the contact rate to 0. This new function corresponds to the first one and the data in the period before measures from t 0 to T , then takes a slower trajectory than that of the first function. In other words, from the date T , the new curve goes under the old one. We consider that if on the dates t > T the data goes under the new curve obtained with a contact rate after measures then, we can say that they affect the evolution of the pandemic. In the previous paper [4] , the function we fitted to the data from 2020 March 02 to March 31 by least square method, is T NI(t) = b exp(ct) \u2212 a with a = 13.9324, b = 9.61779 and c = 0.100095 (figure 1a).

One of the main functions of the brain is to process information, and the primary information processing element is the neuron. This specialized brain cell combines (usually) several inputs to generate a single output. Depending on the animal, an entire brain can contain anywhere from a handful of neurons to more than a hundred billion, wired together. The output of one cell feeding the input of another, to create a neural network capable of remarkable feats of calculation and decision making (See [14] ). If we could qualify the brain as a computer, then we would say that it is the best of computers. For this reason, the engineer seeks to improve mechanical computers to be closer to the biological computer, i.e., the brain. The more neural connections there are, the more the network can solve complex problems. Pattern recognition is a task that neural networks can easily accomplish. For this task, introducing as input a pattern to a neural network, yields as output a pattern back (See [6] ). In general, neural network problems involve a dataset used to predict values for later datasets. For that, the neural network needs to be trained. Then, neural networks can predict the outcome of entirely new datasets based on training from old data sets. Most neural network structures use some type of neuron, node, or unit. An algorithm called a neural network will generally be made up of individual interconnected neurons, see figure 3 . The artificial neuron receives input from one or more sources, which may be other neurons or data entered into the network from a computer program see figure 4 . This entry is usually a floating-point or binary. Often the binary input is coded floating point representing true or false like 1 or 0. Sometimes the program also describes the binary input as using a bipolar system with true as 1 and false as \u22121. An artificial neuron multiplies each of these inputs by a weight.

Then T = 23. For \u03b2 given by(3), results are shown by figures 5a and 5b. For\u03b2 given by(4), results are shown by figures 7a and 7b. We see that the maximal number of reported case goes up to 340000 with the time peak at t = 310, which correspond to 2021, January 05.

Particularly figure 5c and figures 7c shows results of parametric solve of the SIRU model 2 with the parameters \u03c6 = 0.
