            "text": "The qualification of a preschool teacher is one of the important factors that determine the quality of preschool education. To increase the quality in education, teachers should be equipped with the necessary knowledge starting from pre-service training, and in-service training should support the upgrading of their knowledge. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an e-Mentoring-Based Education Program (e-MENTE:PT) for preschool teachers and to test its effectiveness on their professional development during the in-service support period. The study used a designbased research approach. First, focus group interviews were conducted with onehundred-and-five preschool teachers to find out their needs. Then, an e-MENTE:PT Program was developed based on these needs and devised to be used on the Canvas learning management system (LMS), which involves all opportunities of e-learning and allows one-to-one e-mentoring. The e-MENTE:PT Program involved twelve modules related to the pedagogical content knowledge of the preschool education program. Each module included contents, goals, module materials, e-books, videos, pre-and post-module evaluation questions, discussion questions, live lessons and e-portfolios, all of which were integrated in the LMS. Next, eighteen full-time and nine substitute voluntary teachers from five different provinces were selected as mentees by means of criterion sampling. Nine academicians working in these provinces acted as mentors and implemented the application, each working with two mentees for two months. Qualitative data were analysed by means of descriptive analysis and quantitative data were analysed by means of the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The research concluded that the e-MENTE:PT program supported preschool teachers' professional knowledge, learning environments and classroom applications, and an e-mentoring based teaching management system was effective on professional development.",

One of the key instruments to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is education for sustainable development (ESD) as it \"empowers learners to take informed decisions and responsible actions for environmental integrity, economic viability and a just society for present and future generations\" (UNESCO, 2017 p. 7) . International recognition of ESD as a key enabler for sustainability has been growing steadily and expanding to different stakeholders, which encourages early childhood education (ECE) to be more active in the transformative process (Samuelsson et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "To be able to reach the global objectives and local targets mentioned in the above paragraph, the competency of teachers become an important issue. Accordingly, the General Directorate of Teacher Training and Development of Turkish MoNE prepared a report on the general features of professional teaching competency, titled the General Competencies of Teaching Profession (MoNE, 2017) . In this document, competencies are examined under three headings: Professional Knowledge (content knowledge / pedagogical content knowledge / knowledge of rules and regulations), Professional Competencies (planning education and training / creating learning environments / managing the learning process / assessment and evaluation) and Attitudes and Values (national, moral and universal values / attitude towards students / communication and cooperation / personal and professional development). Given these competencies, when studies about the qualifications of preschool teachers were examined in terms of their personal characteristics and their knowledge and skills of being able to implement the MoNE program, it was found that they were incompetent in many areas, some of which can be listed as: child development, communication with families, family participation and family education (Ba\u011f, 2015; G\u00f6r\u00fcr, 2020) ; planning, implementation and evaluation of the preschool / early education curriculum (Arslan, 2017; Aydemir, 2018; D\u00fczg\u00fcn, 2015; Gelebek, 2020; Haktan\u0131r et al., 2011; Haktan\u0131r, 2014a; I\u015f\u0131k, 2015; K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, 2019; K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7, 2019; \u00dcnver, 2016) ; counselling / mentoring and supervision (K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, 2019; I\u015f\u0131k, 2015) ; communication with children, not implementing the education curriculum with a child-oriented approach (Kaya, 2012) ; children with disabilities, mainstreaming, classroom management (K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7, 2019; T\u00fckel, 2017) . This indicates that teachers experience problems in understanding the main principle of the program, arranging learning environments, and planning, implementing and assessing learning processes. The results of these studies, conducted at different time periods, have parallels with the problems dealt with in this paper. Almost all of them criticise in-service training programs in that they are based on theoretical knowledge, they are not implementation oriented and they are inadequate. Some studies recommended small group training, distance training and mentoring systems. B\u00fcmen et al. (2012) 's research focused on papers, doctorate theses and wide scope reports published in the last decade and examined effective professional development of teachers. The paper assessed the problems in Turkey and reported that professional development models other than courses, seminars and conferences were not utilized, and there were not continuous and systematic professional development applications that were planned in detail, extended over time and recorded (B\u00fcmen et al., 2012) . In its 2009 report, ERG emphasized the necessity of presenting training opportunities that is far from the traditional educational approaches, that is continuous, and that can enable the development of personal knowledge and qualifications. MoNE's Early Childhood Education Process Internal Audit Report also yielded similar results (MoNE, 2010) . Bozku\u015f (2018) conducted an action research in which the state of application of a dynamic approach in teachers' professional development was examined; the results were discussed in the light of many other studies, and it was concluded that an ideal professional development model should not only enable teachers to do reflective thinking, but also to get support and feedback from their colleagues in sharing meaningful learning experiences that they can apply in their classrooms. It was maintained that professional development techniques should be planned and applied in a way that would help teachers to solve the problems they face during implementation; if it must be remote learning, then it should not be in the form of a teleconference with hundreds of listeners at a time; and distance education methods and techniques should ensure active participation of teachers. Can (2019), Ero\u011flu and \u00d6zbek (2020) , Hazar (2020) , and S\u0131cak and Parmaks\u0131z (2016) also presented similar results and recommendations.",

            "text": "In-service training and education programs for teachers, which provide support for upgrading their knowledge, are usually performed by the MoNE in Turkey. Teachers who attend in-service training studies state that they try and apply the new knowledge they gain from such programs in their classes, but they experience difficulties at times as they are on their own to do so; however, if they stayed only in practice, then they would not have access to new knowledge and applications (\u00d6RAV, 2009) . Therefore, teachers need accessible leaders who are experienced in the field so that they can keep their professional development up to date and can produce solutions for problems they might encounter during the education-teaching process (Erdo\u011fan et al., 2017; Haktan\u0131r, 2014b) . In this context, in addition to the traditional methods such as seminars, conferences and workshops, professional development models such as coaching and mentoring are needed, during which the development of a teacher is individually monitored by a leader and supported throughout the process (Guskey, 2000) . As a matter of fact, in her research study on preschool teachers, Aras (2019) also pointed to the role of professional development designs in assessing learning and emphasized that professional development models needed to be improved for investigating teachers' professional practices, meeting their needs and contributing to their practices. A professional development model in this context is mentorship, which means sharing knowledge and experience; the person who transfers knowledge is called a \"mentor\" and the one who receives this knowledge to use in her/his own education and professional development is called a \"mentee\" (Guskey, 2000; Uysal & S\u0131\u011fr\u0131, 2011) . The primary objective is to enable the individual to improve her/his knowledge and skills in accordance with her/his personal development goals. There are various kinds of mentorship, but the fundamental models can be listed as follows: one to one mentoring, peer mentoring, group-team mentoring, reverse mentoring and self-mentoring (Crisp & Cruz, 2009 ). Among these approaches, one to one mentoring is the closest model to the one studied in our research.",

The electronic mentoring system, which started to be used with the advances in technology, can be a complementary approach for the traditional one to one mentoring practice. E-mentoring is important in that it enables users to share knowledge and experience independent of time and geographical location, and it offers easy and different interaction methods without any social prejudices. Single and Single (2005) examined e-mentoring programs from mid-1990s to 2007; they concluded that e-mentoring practices were facilitating as they were more flexible in terms of response time and more individuals could be reached through the opportunities it provided. They also emphasized that e-mentoring had two valuable gains, namely, \"objectivity\" and \"ease of organisation through electronic interaction\". Nevertheless, those participating in an e-mentoring program should have a certain level of skills about the technology used.",

            "text": "A teacher should be able to perform her/his career in a professional manner at her/his best. Moreover, it is important for a preschool teacher to follow the developments in the pedagogical field as educational process has a dynamic structure. When a teacher feels incompetent in knowledge and applicational issues, s/he should participate in conferences, seminars and in-service training, and s/ he must share her/his experiences with colleagues (Da\u011fl\u0131o\u011flu & Gen\u00e7, 2019) . Studies in the literature indicate that e-mentoring influences teachers' professional development positively in many respects (Anthony & Kritsonis, 2006; Burgstahler, 2006) . Research proved that the modules prepared for professional development increased the knowledge and awareness of teachers (\u00c7etin, 2013; Mcaleer & Bangert, 2011) , provided social support (Brintnall, 2002) , had positive impacts on formal education (Kahraman & Kuzu, 2016) and the groups who received e-mentoring had higher self-efficacy beliefs about their teaching than those who received one to one mentorship (Tolbert, 2008) . Other studies reported that emotional support increased, feeling of loneliness decreased, reflective thinking skills were improved, willingness for teaching increased, and problem-solving skills were developed (Hew & Knapczyk, 2007; DeWert et al., 2003; McDiarmid, 2006) . In addition, it was established that the technical, academic, pedagogical and professional skills of both mentors and mentees improved (Alemda\u011f & Erdem, 2017; Baran, 2016) , and the support provided by the mentor was beneficial (Ligadu & Anthony, 2015; Dempsey & Christenson-Foggett, 2011; Ceven McNally, 2016 ). E-mentoring increased the motivation of teachers, developed creativity, and decreased their anxiety (Langhey, 2008; Simonsen et al., 2009) . It was further demonstrated that the approach was influential on pedagogy and content knowledge, new and different teaching methods, learning resources and strategies, and leadership characteristics (Ark\u00fcn-Kocadere & K\u0131z\u0131lkaya Cumao\u011flu, 2015; McAleer & Bangert, 2011) . These studies suggest that e-mentoring can be used as an approach that will support professional development.",

Descriptive analysis process involves the correlation of the data according to predetermined themes, explaining the meaning, interpretation, examining the reason-result relationships and achieving results (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & \u015eim\u015fek, 2013) . A thematic framework was determined in line with the research objectives and interview questions. Within this framework, an \"Interview Coding Key\" was created by making use of the responses to the interview questions. The reliability of the research was verified by comparing the codings calculated by the researcher and a field expert using the following formula: Reliability = Consensus / Consensus + Disagreement (Miles & Huberman, 1994) . Accordingly, the inter-coder reliability was found to be 92%. The quantitative data obtained from the ECERS-R and Module Activities Pre-and Post-Evaluation Questions were analysed using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test, which is one of the non-parametric tests, as sample size was small. Bonferroni adjustment was made to determine a stronger alpha level in order to reduce the possibility of finding meaningful results as multiple comparisons were made for the ECERS-R results in the same groups (Akbulut, 2010, p. 125) . Therefore, the new alpha value was considered as 0.007 for the scale results. However, since the data from the module activities pre-and post-evaluation questions were obtained from different groups, no new alpha value was determined for this data.",

In another study, it was notable that the number of teachers who used a portfolio to get to know and evaluate children was very few (Y\u0131lmaz Topuz & Erbil Kaya, 2016) . The same study also revealed that teachers had problems with sparing time for child recognition and evaluation, and cooperation with the family. Ba\u011f (2015) 's study also concludes that teachers see themselves less competent in the education curriculum field than other fields and they need to be supported through in-service training. Aysu and Aral (2016) also state that teachers need support in program planning and application. The e-MENTE: PT Program was prepared based on these findings and the recommendations presented after the focus group interviews; thus, it can be asserted that the program was created according to the needs of teachers in terms of its scope and content.",

In this way, each mentor saw the responses of her/his mentee only, which not only facilitated feedback but also contributed to the ethical management of the process. In the discussion questions stage, more correspondence was carried on through the learning management system about child recognition and evaluation, learning centres and role of the teacher, planning, implementing and evaluating the education, and classroom management. In a study, it was revealed that a discussion forum was an opportunity for teachers to discuss educational implementations among themselves and get guidance (Gareis & Nussbaum-Beach, 2007) . Babinski et al. (2001) used e-mentoring to solve the problems of new teachers, and they found out that during the process, new teachers generally wrote messages about disabled students, policies, educational experiences, technical issues, teacher perception, classroom management, working with adults and teaching curriculum. In another study, in an asynchronous online platform, it was observed that the contents of messages between mentors and mentees involved pre-planning, teaching process, evaluation of learning, classroom management and professional responsibilities (Gareis & Nussbaum-Beach, 2007) .",

Moreover, live lessons and classroom visits were conducted with some of the mentees to meet their needs. The literature also suggested that mentoring processes could be varied as mentees had different experiences and pedagogical knowledge (Shpigelman & Gill, 2013) . The live lessons were carried out according to the needs and willingness of the teachers. It can be stated that after discussing on various perspectives, the reservations of the mentees started disappearing and they were oriented towards appropriate methods. Furthermore, in the live lessons, recommendations were offered to the mentee to enable her/him to adjust the situation to her/his classroom so that the mentee finds the solution herself/himself.",

Based on these results, it can be concluded that the program improved the knowledge of teachers especially in the following contents: child recognition and evaluation, learning centres and role of the teacher, planning of education, implementation of education, and family participation. Furthermore, it was observed that after the implementation of the e-mentoring program, the quality of early education learning environments increased. There is a meaningful difference between the pre-and post-test results of especially the physical environment, personal care routines and activities sub-scales. In other words, the training provided enabled not only the preschool class to improve physically but also the teacher to develop activity plans and to use the daily routines better. In their research study, Buldu et al. (2018) recommend that to be able to evaluate children effectively, learning environments should be socially and physically arranged, inand out-of-class interactions should be supported, and teachers should be enabled to gain the necessary pedagogical knowledge and skills through pre-service and inservice training. The action research conducted by \u00c7etin (2013) put forth that the e-mentoring program for the evaluation of structuring for English teachers working in disadvantaged areas improved their professional knowledge and awareness.",

Yet, this study proved that the e-mentoring program supported the quality of learning environments in the classrooms of the participating teachers. These results correspond to the qualitative results of our research. The classroom observations conducted after the implementation of the e-MENTE:PT Program indicated that the professional development of some of the teachers were positively influenced in the areas of preparation to school, planning and evaluation of education, learning centres and role of the teacher, family participation, and classroom management. Moreover, the teachers who did not use proper methods in the classroom management replaced them with positive attitudes, they were careful about enhancing the learning centres, they developed ways of positive communication with children, and they prepared and used the daily education plan as required. As a result of the document analyses made after the implementation, it was found that most of the teachers considered gains and indicators while preparing the monthly education plan, they prepared higher quality activity plans, the use of ready-made plans decreased, and they were mainly used as a reference. In addition, the quality of the development observation forms and reports used for the evaluation of children and the recommendations made for families increased.",

Furthermore, the teachers set targets for their future works and the program directed them to investigate on topics other than the modules too. In another study, e-mentoring was conducted to support the professional development of candidate teachers of information technologies, and interviews and researchers' diaries proved that e-mentoring had positive impacts on teachers' not only professional development but also the formal training process (Kahraman & Kuzu, 2016) . Other research also established that thanks to the support from the mentor, teachers' feelings of emotional support increased, feelings of loneliness decreased, teaching self-efficacy increased, reflective thinking skills improved, willingness for teaching increased, and problem-solving skills developed (Brintnall, 2002; DeWert et al., 2003; Hew & Knapczyk, 2007; Langhey, 2008; McDiarmid, 2006) .

Moreover, being able to work on a customised learning management system for each mentor and mentee, the teachers were supported according to their own needs and learning paces by an expert on a one-to-one basis.",

Therefore, it can be stated that the learning management system used in this research, the e-mentoring method and the developed training program can be used not only for the professional development of the teachers but also for the training of teacher candidates in case of another pandemic. Moreover, the research is significant in that it includes supportive elements of media and technology literacy (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2009), which is an important twenty-first century skill. Even though it was not assessed in the study, the researchers also believe that the research period facilitated the participating teachers' and academicians' adjustment to online environments during the pandemic.",

Moreover, longitudinal studies can be carried out to monitor and evaluate the permanence of the positive effects of the program. E-mentoring can also be used to support the professional development of preschool teachers who will start to work for the first time, and the effectiveness of the program on the new teachers and on the experienced teachers can be compared. To ensure professional communication in the mentorship system, a professional development network can be established. Through the network, by reaching more teachers than the number of participants in this study, the practice in this research can be repeated and the results can be assessed. Mentoring can be used in studies with small groups, especially in teaching practice lessons of undergraduate programs of teaching departments, and the results can be evaluated for its effectiveness.",

Nevertheless, the research results have proved that these measures were not adequate, thus, it is recommended that the methods used in this research be additionally employed to support the professional development of teachers.",
