The department was originally formed by an administrative decision that merged three departments in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences intending to save financial resources. Over 25 years, we have developed a transdisciplinary approach that fills gaps that exist between disciplines that have yet to be closed while engaging with a variety of community partners to co-produce solutions to promote positive change. This article describes the evolution of our transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates a three-phased approach to service-learning. This framework enables faculty to offer appropriate service-learning experiences that provide meaningful interactions between students and community partners. CDAE has both honed and expanded curricular offerings to meet student interest and to better address community-based issues at the local, national, and global level.",

The human-centered design approach offers students the opportunity to increase idea generation, co-creation, and multidisciplinary exchange and convey more flexible and open to new process approaches (Minder & Heidemann Lassen, 2018) . Drawing on theory, case studies, and applied practices, students engage in service-learning experiences, which are action-oriented and encourage an experimental and iterative approach to solving open-ended problems with community stakeholders. Frameworks for innovation and creative problem-solving methodologies enable interdisciplinary teams to tackle complex, open-ended challenges (Barry & Beckman, 2007) across many different domains (Kolko, 2015) . As such, it helps students develop resilience, and strengthen their ability to give and receive constructive feedback in realworld situations.

            "text": "In collaboration with the Office of Community-University Partnerships, CDAE embarked on a reflective curriculum mapping exercise where service-learning occurred within the curriculum and found that it was not equally integrated across the three majors. A survey of faculty members found that nearly all had taught a service-learning course yet were encountering capacity challenges, such as lack of planning time, communication issues, and conflicts arising within student groups (Westdijk et al., 2010) . These findings led to the department assessing the types of service-learning experiences within the department's offerings and a strategic conversation about adopting a phased approach to service-learning (Williams Howe et al., 2014) based on student development theory. This approach features the integration of different phases of experiences where students can make a graduated progression from very structured service-learning courses during their first or second years while gaining important knowledge and skills that would then be applied in more advanced service-learning classes later in their curriculum where they may work more independently with their community partner. Service-learning requires significant investments from students, faculty members, and community partners alike. CDAE faculty have adopted the three-phased approach to engaging students in service-learning projects related to community wellbeing (Williams Howe et al., 2014) . This approach is grounded in student development theory to ensure that faculty members are designing course experiences that are appropriate for the students' levels of knowledge and skill while ensuring that community partners benefit from this reciprocal endeavor. The Department has embedded courses for each of the three phases across the curriculum so students can have meaningful community engagement experiences throughout the arc of their CDAE academic career (Fig. 2) .",

Partnership development is based on reciprocity, meeting community partner interests/needs while providing students an opportunity to gain new knowledge and experiences. Exposure is reciprocal, between our students and the communities we serve. Capacity building among partners seeks to align our expertise to match community needs. Responsibility is modeled early in the curriculum and increases in advanced service-learning courses as students take on project leadership roles.",

What sets the CDAE international servicelearning courses apart? These are semester-long courses, with partner continuity over time, where community development projects are co-created and implemented. The point of entry depends on the level of the relationship. With new partners, reconnaissance and trust building are typical in the first year. Projects sometimes emerge based on the need of the community in consort with the course and sometimes are suggested by the community. Regardless, fit, ability, and availability of resources are key components of decisions surrounding project choices-for both the students and the community. This is a type of \"matchmaking\" That requires faculty/partner leader cooperation. Relationships and projects are built to continue over time. The semester approach for a given class allows the development of a project and team building. Built into these relationships with partners are project building, implementation, and debriefing. Because all courses have a community development lens, the process of community development is important. We have yet to experience a partnership where a community need is not matchable to student/faculty expertise. One course that was developed and implemented over four years, with student travel in years two through four, is our Sustainable Development and Education course in both a remote rural community and urban city in Kenya. This class enrolls 12-15 students, and the teaching is shared by a CDAE faculty member and a faculty member in the Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences. UVM student groups were paired with students from a high school in Nairobi, Kenya and a rural community in western Kenya. While it took three years of development, the fourth year is when all pieces fell into place and final project implementation occurred. In the first year, faculty members built trust with a new partner and travelled to identify whether student travel was possible in terms of safety, logistics, and probability of success. In year two, students participated, not in the completion of a project from inception to completion, but in the process of community development. For example, in the second year, introductions were made, and cultural competency built. Student projects focused on international understanding and cultural competence. Both Kenyan and UVM students realized the importance of reciprocity-learning took place on both continents. The final projects included documentation of the process of community development and the landscape Future students would encounter. These projects were passed on to the next student cohort. In the third year, both the UVM faculty and Kenyan leaders agreed on public health, women's empowerment, and food systems as project components. Together, the UVM and Kenyan students met via the internet during the semester and worked together to build skill and deliver demonstrations in the chosen areas. In the final year before COVID-19 caused the cancellation of all travel, Kenyan and UVM student partners worked on building a cold storage unit that did not require electricity, on a grain mill and break-even analysis for the community, and passing cultural foods knowledge across generations, and on documenting the process. These final projects grew out of community need, the expertise of the students/faculty, and available resources. Students with majors in engineering, public communication, nutrition and food science, and community and international development were registered in the final cohort. There is no magic formula to the success of these experiences. Flexibility, knowledge of the community, and building on assets are required. That said, knowledge is built across cohorts, paving the way for the next class, trust is built with partners, and projects emerge that meet the needs of BOTH the community partner and the university course.",

During the project work, student teams ranged in size from 2 to 6 people who were partnered with 2 to 6 government representatives and local partners. Workdays begin at 7:00 AM and end at 7:00 PM. The knowledge and skills that were shared and exchanged between partners were put into use during community development projects.",

Students engaged in nightly oral and written reflection, responding to prompts developed by the faculty, staff, and students based upon ideas, issues, and questions raised during the workday. These regular, responsive reflections were critically important to both the educational and project success during this stage. The reflections enabled students to connect concepts from their previous coursework to their current projects, but even more importantly, they were able to hear from other students about their own, unique experiences from the day. One major takeaway was that students would assume that everyone had a similar experience to theirs, and they were often surprised to hear about differing experiences or perspectives. Faculty and staff meet twice or more per day to reflect and assess the project work and partnership, while government and community representatives spoke with the CDAE faculty daily.",

The trip lengths were shortened from 14 to 11 days to concentrate the efforts of the intense 12-h workdays. CDAE and government representatives still engage in day-long training and workshops, but in the local community instead of in the USA at the UVM campus to reduce the time and administrative burden of travel.

Of CDAE's undergraduate majors, 73% rated learning transdisciplinary theories, methods, and tools that support sustainable and ethical community development as at least somewhat important, 87% rated engaging in service-learning opportunities supporting community development as at least somewhat important, and 77% rated integrating applied economic, ecological, and policy principles in advancing sustainable community development as at least somewhat important to their professional success. Many undergraduate students are not experienced in the work force and yet these responses display the belief among students that what-and how-they are taught in CDAE will apply to their professional lives. As students enter the workforce-as indicated by the results of the alumni survey-these responses are consistent with a slight increase in overall importance once students enter the workforce: 77% find Learning transdisciplinary theories, methods, and tools that support sustainable and ethical community development at least somewhat important, 93% find Engaging in service learning opportunities supporting community development at least somewhat important, and 82% find Integrating applied economic, ecological, and policy principles in advancing sustainable community development at least somewhat important to their professional success.",
