Any deviation of the homeostatic range leads to a stress response, and when the stress response is insufficient to restore homeostasis, an inflammatory response is engaged [1] . In the recent decade, it has become increasingly clear that inflammasomes are critical components of inflammatory response. Inflammasomes are multimolecular complexes that can assemble upon exposure to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMP), and diverse environmental insults [2] . Depending on the stress sensor molecule, inflammasomes can be of different types, such as NLRP1 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 1), NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRC4 (NLR family CARD domain containing 4 or IPAF), AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2), IFI16 (interferongamma inducible protein 16) , and pyrin inflammasomes [3] .",

            "text": "Generally, the two-signal mediated inflammasome activation model is accepted and discussed in the literature. During the first signal-the priming signal-inflammasome component and interleukin gene expressions are increased downstream of the NF\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells) complex [15] . Consequently, the inflammasome is activated following diverse signals, which often culminate at second messengers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), ATP, or potassium levels [16] [17] [18] . e canonical inflammasome complex assembly results in procaspase 1 cleavage into active caspase 1 (CASP1), which subsequently cleaves and thus activates the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1B (IL1B) and IL18 [19] . Cytokines play a crucial role in the innate immune response against invading pathogens; however, the inflammatory response can flare out of control. For example, exacerbated immune response as a result of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in pulmonary tissue can lead to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [20] [21] [22] , which are common clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 . Indeed, studies show the engagement of the inflammasome in COVID-19 leading to uncontrolled inflammatory response and pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death [23] [24] [25] . e complex biological state induced during an inflammatory response cannot be explained by analyzing isolated molecules or endpoints. While the information on the changes in separate molecular species is valuable, a holistic view that integrates committed inflammatory pathways and the interconnections between pathway molecules can provide enhanced understanding of the impacted biology. Compilation of the involved pathways in a network representation is a step toward comprehensive understanding of a system response. Such a network approach is a valuable tool in network medicine, which takes into account how the regulated molecules interact with each other and how information flows along the multiple pathways that constitute a given biological process or pathology [26, 27] . Organizing the established biological data into a network view can help link apparent unrelated processes and pathways, facilitating characterization of known or novel disease mechanisms and prediction of drug effects and treatment outcomes.",

Research articles were prioritized over review articles, and results sections were prioritized over the introduction, discussion, and conclusion sections in order to capture direct experimental evidence. Wherever applicable, the most granular sequence of causal events was captured. Scientific text curation was performed with BEL, which displays biological findings in a computable form. BEL converts the relationships between biological entities into statements of cause, relationship, and effect triples using controlled vocabularies facilitating the subsequent computation of the models. Biological entities of the cause and target are scripted in a namespace format of \"BEL function (namespace identifier: \"entity definition\"),\" for example, \"p(HGNC:NLRP3).\" Custom namespaces (e.g., PMIBP for a biological process) were created if the biological entities were not available in existing namespaces. Table 1 summarizes the BEL terminologies for the namespaces used in this study. e namespaces were connected with causal or associative relationships based on literature evidence. e publication reference and details of the experimental model (such as species, organ/tissue/cell types, or cell lines) were annotated additionally to provide context to the statements. Contradicting evidence was curated without preferential treatment, along with experimental model annotations. e BEL statements for the inflammasome network model were derived from experiments conducted in human, mouse, and rat model systems. To avoid duplicate namespaces for the same gene curated from studies in different species, we orthologized the network model to single species nomenclature.",

In addition to the backbone layer, the network model has a downstream layer that harbors information about mRNAs regulated by some of the entities in the model backbone. e downstream layer is based on a back-reasoning approach, where the activity of a backbone node is deduced from its own downstream transcript abundance [28] . is collective mRNA signature was obtained from publicly available transcriptomic datasets. e activity of the nodes in the model backbone is inferred on the basis of the concordance of transcriptomic changes in the data (chosen datasets for scoring and analysis) with the mRNA nodes underneath the backbone nodes. Such an approach allows one to infer the activity status of the corresponding backbone node (inferred node: iNode) from scoring datasets instead of assuming that the mRNA abundance of the backbone node in the dataset corresponds with its protein activity. e datasets GSE51386, GSE55235, GSE2737, E-MEXP-839, and GSE11258 from public data repositories were used for scoring the inflammasome network model. For model scoring, a threshold-free enrichment method specific for iNode was applied using the Strength Network Perturbation Amplitude scoring algorithm [43] . To illustrate graphically how backbone nodes are inferred on the basis of gene expression differences in the scoring dataset, the inference values were imported to the Cytoscape application and assigned to the model nodes.",

As inputs, the model contains nodes that represent toxins and various pathogenic and sterile insults. Toll-like receptors (TLR), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), Beclin 1 (BECN1), NF\u03baB complex, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling are some of the upstream regulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. Caspase 1 (CASP1) and the subsequent cleavage and activation of IL1B and IL18 are among the downstream targets of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. e inflammasome network model is available for browsing and download in the CBN database (http://causalbionet.com/).",

Particularly, members of the NF\u03baB pathway, including TLR2, TLR4, MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88), and the NF\u03baB complex, were inferred to be upregulated upon virus infection, consistent with the NLRP3 inflammasome priming event. TNF (tumor necrosis factor) and its receptor were also inferred to be upregulated, although TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), through which TNF connects to NF\u03baB in our CBN, was inferred to be significantly downregulated at both 4 and 7 dpi, which hinted at other parallel pathways involved in the infectionelicited inflammation. Furthermore, the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) complex, a known inhibitory factor of NF\u03baB, was inferred to be downregulated. Similarly, SIRT1, which blocks NF\u03baB-DNA binding through deacetylation [44] and also functions as an inflammasome inhibitor, was also inferred to be downregulated. Some other inhibitory factors in the NF\u03baB cascade, such as NFKBIA and MIR155 upstream of MYD88, were inferred to be upregulated; however, it appeared that positive signals toward NF\u03baB overcame these inhibitory effects. Two circadian proteins, CLOCK and ARNTL (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator like, also known as BMAL1)-which have opposing effects on NF\u03baB-were both inferred to be downregulated. NF\u03baB upstream activator IRAK1 (interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1) was also inferred to be downregulated. is complex regulation of NF\u03baB could be a fine-tuning mechanism of inflammation control. In this context, it is important to note that NF\u03baB was shown to also have inhibitory effects on NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting clearance of damaged mitochondria [45] . DAMPs released during mitochondrial damage, such as mitochondrial ROS and mitochondrial DNA, are recognized as triggers for NLRP3 activation [46] .",

Inconsistent with its inflammasome-activating role, the purinergic receptor P2RX7 was inferred to be significantly downregulated at both time points after viral infection. e downstream effector molecules of inflammasome activation, IL1B and IL18, were inferred as significantly affected after virus infection. While, as expected, IL1B was inferred to be upregulated at both time points after viral infection, IL18 activity was inferred to be downregulated. is can be explained by signals other than NLRP3 inflammasome affecting IL18 activity. BCL2 apoptosis regulator and RHOA (ras homolog family member A)-inhibitors of NLRP1 activity and the pyrin inflammasome, respectively-were inferred to be upregulated, suggesting inhibition of both NLRP1 and pyrin inflammasome activities.

Next, we chose GEO dataset GSE55235, where the transcriptomic data were derived from human synovial tissues from osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy controls. RA is an autoimmune joint disease characterized by chronic synovitis that progresses to the destruction of cartilage and bone. e NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to RA pathogenesis and severity [48, 49] . OA is a joint disease where cartilage is damaged because of wearing away during aging [50] . Although commonly regarded as a wear-and-tear disease, there is evidence for an inflammatory component in OA [51, 52] . Indeed, our scoring results suggest that inflammasome components such as NLRP3, PYCARD (PYD and CARD domain containing), and CASP1 are activated in both diseases ( Figure 2 ). NLRC4, an IPAF inflammasome component and stress sensor, was inferred to be significantly downregulated in the synovial tissues of OA patients. Interestingly, several inflammasome-activating factors-such as BTK, the NF\u03baB complex, and beta-catenin (CTNNB1)as well as ROS, calcium cations, and ATP levels were inferred to be downregulated. Our network model has captured paths downstream of NF\u03baB and CTNNB1 that also lead to inflammasome inhibition. Even though it is an inflammasome priming factor, NF\u03baB restricts inflammasome activation through sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, also known as p62), which promotes the clearance of damaged mitochondria [45] . While some studies suggest CTNNB1 to be an upstream promoting factor for the inflammasome [53, 54] , CTNNB1 can also lead to inflammasome inactivation through inhibition of XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), which, in turn, is an NLRP3 activator [55] . Interestingly, XBP1 was also inferred to be downregulated in both OA and RA samples.",

Mice at the age of 16 weeks are generally not affected by senescence, whereas mice over 24 months of age are considered very old and show apparent histological lesions associated with aging [70] . Accordingly, we identified only six iNodes that were significantly impacted at all three ages; moreover, all iNodes that were inferred to be significantly regulated at two time points out of the three showed significant scores for the latter, that is, 96and 130-week time points, with the exception of the TNFRSF family iNode, which was inferred to be down-or upregulated in the liver of 16-and 130-week-old WT mice, respectively. In Figure 4 , we show a subnetwork of the inflammasome activation CBN model, including iNodes, that reached a statistically significant score in the mouse liver in at least two life stages. Some nodes that were inferred to be regulated at only one time point-such as ARNTL, the NF\u03baB complex, and ROS-were included because of their bridging position in pathways leading to inflammasome activity modulation. Analysis of the last two time points showed clear inferred upregulation of proinflammatory entities such as IFNAR1, IRF1, ZBP1, TLR2, TLR4, MYD88, TNF, and the MAPK p38 family, inflammasome constituents NLRP3 and CASP1, and the inflammasome product, active IL1B. However, some proinflammatory factors were inferred to be downregulated, such as the NF\u03baB complex (significant score only in 130-week-old mice) and XBP1. Conversely, we observed inferred downregulation of anti-inflammatory, antiaging molecules, such as SIRT1 and SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1). e inferred scores of AMPK did not reach statistical significance at any time point. Concomitant with the decrease in SOD1 activity, ROS levels increased with age, creating an aging-accelerating milieu due to accumulated damage [71] . Furthermore, from our CBN scoring data, we could conclude that liver cell death rate increased with age, as the activity of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 was inferred to be downregulated at later life stages of the mice. Additionally, the activity of ZBP1, which is involved in PANoptosis, was inferred to be increased in 96-and 130-week-old WT mice. PANoptosis refers to collective activation of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, which can result, for example, from ZBP1 pathogen sensing [72] [73] [74] .

Many studies confirm the presence and activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus [77] [78] [79] . Indeed, treatment with 50 mM KCl for 1, 3, or 6 h causes a time-dependent decrease in the inferred activities of inflammasome components such as NLRP3 and PYCARD (significant scores at 3 and 6 h of potassium treatment) ( Figure 5 ). e CASP1 score did not reach statistical significance. A snapshot of the inflammasome network model shown in Figure 5 includes several infectious agents and chemicals that trigger potassium efflux and consequently activate the inflammasome. Some of them also contribute to inflammasome activation independent of potassium concentration, for example, through NF\u03baB-induced NLRP3 gene transcription during the inflammasome priming step. Presumably, higher intracellular potassium levels can block the inflammasome-triggering potential of these stressors. An example of this blockage is shown in a study by Suzuki and colleagues, where an increase in extracellular potassium concentration inhibited inflammasome-dependent IL1B production triggered by lipopolysaccharide and ATP treatment [80] . Both ATP (significant scores at 1 and 3 h of potassium treatment) and Ca 2+ (significant scores at 3 and 6 h of potassium treatment)-which are upstream negative regulators of potassium levels in our network model-were inferred to be upregulated, likely to counteract the burden of KCl salt exposure. rough the purinergic receptor ATP-gated channel P2RX7, ATP can act as a potassium efflux agent, enabling the influx of calcium and sodium cations to change the membrane potential, which, in turn, facilitates potassium efflux through KCNK6 (potassium two pore domain channel subfamily K member 6, also known as TWIK2) [80, 81] .",

We also scored the inflammasome model with transcriptomic data derived from a viral infection of the lungs, osteo-and rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and aging. In all these diverse conditions, the pathways leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation were significantly impacted, implying inflammasome involvement. More interestingly, some upstream modulating paths were differently affected in individual datasets, providing insights on disease-or condition-specific inflammasome regulation. It is important to emphasize that the results presented in this report are from a small number of studies, and the network scoring needs to be repeated with several other datasets to support our findings. Regardless, the approach is very powerful for generating new hypotheses that, once experimentally verified, could lead to the discovery of new and more efficient therapeutics against conditions that engage inflammasomes, such as viral infections and inflammatory and metabolic diseases. We are continuing these efforts by expanding the suite with network models for other relevant components of innate and adaptive immune biology, including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and B cells.",
