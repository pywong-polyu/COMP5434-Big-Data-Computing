These evolutionary mechanisms complicate our attempts to use modern nanoscale science to develop effective and efficient treatments for disease or other biological dysfunctions. Here we describe the complexity of biology on the nanoscale and the implications for the success of recently-discovered nanoscience, which has resulted in an almost infinite number of potential nanomaterials of unknown efficacy. We discuss how tools to categorize nanomaterials on the basis of structure, properties and interactions can provide insights on promising directions.",

Here we are not seeking to convince an audience that our mastery of those interactions is sufficient to achieve all that is hoped from the arena.

We now surmise that some of these naturally occurring complex (exosomal) nanostructures can act to regulate the immune system and be exploited by tumours to silence our defences, while others contribute to multiple layers of defence [14] [15] [16] [17] . The enormous power of nanoscale biology, however, should not be conflated with the idea that it will lead (effortlessly and phenomenologically) to new cures, nor (accidently) to new hazards.

Much of the focus will of course be, as it started, in medicine design and efficacy, and a new-found realism of the type of precision and intelligence of design required to tap meaningfully into these processes and use them for benefit. There will always be allied to this fundamental thinking the question of whether such complex objects could induce new forms of harm or constitute new hazards. It is hardly surprising that nanoparticles made of toxic materials are also toxic [18] , but whether long lived and slowly degradable new nanostructures of great complexity (of surface, shape, mechanic al properties) could present new risks remains to be seen. There may be some buried hazards, but we need some basic hypotheses to predict what we are looking for. The asbestos phenomenon is perhaps a good analogy: a (thankfully) rare but disturbing substance that exhibits a surprising negative biological impact.

Informing all of this is a growing belief that perhaps some readers will find surprising. The great abundance of complex nanostructures to which biology has had to respond over long ages have been hazardous pathogens or other threats. We are now convinced that coevolution with nanoscale pathogens has led to an astoundingly complex endogenous machinery, operating on this nanoscale, that can deal with complex objects of that size [22] . We see everywhere in our deepening understanding of nanoscale biology the fingerprint of long-fought, hard-won wars of survival in which growing the co-evolution of complex threat was matched by complex biological countermoves [23] [24] [25] . At the time of writing this article, the world is confronting a new virus and while all are aware of the risks involved, we fully expect our natural endogenous defences to finally win, and like so many previous threats, for the virus to recede.",

Far from being a novel and ubiquitous threat, nanoscale engineered entities are quickly transformed in the body to familiar enemies, typically of such mundane levels of threat that it was barely worth raising all but a 'default' response to eliminate them [30] [31] [32] . Our focus in the safety arena is now much clearer. We see that hazards, unlike chemicals, if they exist in engineered nanostructures to an exceptional level, will come from the truly surprising, the 'check mate' move that surprises all, that for millions of years were not contemplated by pathogens nor by the cells to defend against. Indeed, the potential threat exists to turn those well-honed defences against ourselves [33] [34] [35] [36] . As with the recent Covid-19 threat and with asbestos, it may be the over-reaction of our defences that leads to trouble, and the ill-judged capacity of the defence mechanism to know when to stop the danger signals of cytokines and other components there to protect us. There may indeed be other subtle 'check mates' of the established protective mechanisms.",

Of course, the desire to categorize nanostructures is not unique to biology, medicine or related disciplines. Those involved in making new devices will have their own interests. Here in the heart of the search for beneficial biological impacts, the desire to categorise is long and deep. It began decades ago with Chemistry and its desire to learn from previous chemicals of interest, both drugs and toxins, and the belief that shared motifs of chemical identity and structural identity point towards new drugs and new hazards [37] [38] [39] [40] . That has to be considered a tremendous success story of categorization.

For instance, complex biologically coated surfaces (either purposefully or by exposure to organisms), as well as complex nanoscale shape in which structural features are visible on the scale of the particle itself, seem to offer platforms within which to categorise [49] . That is leading to a whole new set of concepts and tools about the subcategories within those broad spaces of parameters, and that endeavour will no doubt accelerate. A recent effort to begin the computation categorization of shape [50] , and link that to biology is illustrated in Figure 1 , and likely points to future progress. Figure 1 : A priori identification of nanoparticle shape groups from a large contour database of different shapes derived from randomised multiple different syntheses [50] a) Clustering using center of gravity method represented as scatter plots for the first three principal components (PCs). Each dot represents one individual NP. Shape group colors are GNP1 (blue), GNP2 (orange), GNP3 (green), GNP4 (red). The first three PCs with magnitude and phase are represented in the expanded space (variance = 88%); b) Normalized probability distribution function (PDF) of shape variability for each shape group. c) Graphical representation of the contours of 5 particles from the centre (red) and 5 particles from the periphery (black) of the cluster of GNP1 and GNP2. On top of each GNP1 particle, the relative values of compactness (1 for a perfect sphere) and on top of each GNP2 particle the relative values of aspect ratio. d) Distribution of aspect ratio for GNP2 and compactness for GNP1. Figure originally appeared in Boselli L, Lopez H, Zhang W et al (2020). Commun Mater 1, 35 [50] There are, however, quite different ideas on the horizon. Intelligent and automated analysis of 'big data' may well lead to new insight and de novo ways of thinking about categorization [51] [52] [53] . The problem is, for the moment, the paucity of good quality data [54] [55] [56] [57] , in common format, and many efforts to go along the big data direction will be cramped for some years to come, unless that data availability problem can be changed.",

Thus , categorizing nanomaterials with respect to potential properties and functionalities is a con text that supports innovation and creativity. In contrast, Peijnenburg argues that the large number of potential nanomaterials precludes individual testing of each new substance, which makes it important to categorize on the basis of what is potential their most important propertyrisk to the environment. The papers by Doa, Sargent and Kobe all focus on the fact that most countries today have fairly stringent regulatory regimes with respect to nanomaterials.
