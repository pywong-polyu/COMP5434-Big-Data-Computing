Clinicians noted early on that COVID-19 fatality rises steadily with age; unlike other respiratory diseases, it did not present the typical U-shaped curve of heightened risk among both infants and older adults (Raoult et al., 2020) . The World Health Organization (2020) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020a) have both defined older adults-individuals aged 60 and 65 and older, respectively-as a vulnerable group. In response, as the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, governments worldwide recommended or instructed older adults to remain in social isolation for a period lasting weeks or months (Brooke & Jackson, 2020) . These simplified accounts of the relationship between COVID-19 and age may have contributed to the portrayal of COVID-19 as a \"disease of the elderly,\" in the US and elsewhere, which some have argued was a key factor in the failure to contain the outbreak (Germani et al., 2020; Nowroozpoor et al., 2020) . Nearly one year into the pandemic, there is now sufficient demographic data to establish key facts about the relationship between age and COVID-19 mortality.",

First, like many agingrelated causes of death, COVID-19 mortality follows the Gompertz law and rises exponentially with age. Second, it progresses with age at a rate similar to the median aging-related cause of death, and similar to seasonal mortality from pneumonia and influenza. COVID-19 mortality in the US, however, is currently 4 to 8 times higher across the adult age range than annual pneumonia and influenza mortality in the past 20 years. Third, the relationship between age and COVID-19 fatality varies considerably across OECD and high-income countries.

            "text": "[ Figure 1 here] 3.2 How does COVID-19 mortality compare with Pneumonia & Influenza? Figure 2 compares the age-specific COVID-19 mortality with a 20-year series of P&I mortality. Since COVID-19 is an ongoing epidemic, annual P&I mortality rates have been adjusted to the equivalent exposure period based on historical seasonal data (i.e., the proportion of P&I deaths occurring between epidemiological weeks 6 through 32). From 1999 to 2018, the P&I mortality-rate doubling time averaged 7.4 years, ranging from 6.8 to 8.9 years over the period. In other words, the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and age is similar to the multiyear average P&I mortality; the proportional increase in COVID-19 mortality with age is well within P&I's inter-annual variation. However, Figure 2 also shows that COVID-19 absolute mortality levels are substantially higher than P&I-it is about 4 to 5 times higher in the age groups 25-34 and 75-84, and as much as 7.6 times higher for those aged 55-64 years.",

In the absence of comparable mortality data, age-specific fatality rates were compared across 33 OECD and high-income countries. The results are shown in Figure 3 . In most countries the Gompertz model fit the data well (median R 2 was 0.96). The FRDT varied from 5.3 years in the Czech Republic to 13.7 years in Mexico, with a median FRDT of 6.7 years and a mean of 7.4 years. It is worth noting that the FRDT in the US was slightly higher than the MRDT (8.2 compared to 7.6 years, respectively). The findings therefore reveal considerable variation in the association between COVID-19 case-fatality and age between countries, and that in the US the FRDT is higher than the MRDT by 0.6 years.",

Figure 4 depicts three such scenarios for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the Gompertz slope estimated across 33 countries. The median scenario, for example, assumes that Israel had the same Gompertz slope as Belgium, with deaths rescaled to Israel's known total and weighted by its age-specific confirmed cases. The 10th and 90th percentiles correspond, respectively, to Uruguay and Austria, providing an interval estimate for the expected number of deaths at each age (a more realistic interval estimate might account in addition for sampling variability and stochasticity).",

COVID-19 mortality is no different, rising exponentially with age. That COVID-19 follows the Gompertz law of mortality, however, is in no way a given. The Spanish Flu, in sharp contrast, wrought havoc among 20 to 40 year-olds, whose mortality was substantially higher than their elders (Ma et al., 2011) . This study finds that COVID-19's relationship with age is approximately log-linear over 30 and its slope sits near the median of aging-related causes of death. Furthermore, the relationship between age and COVID-19 mortality resembles that of annual pneumonia and influenza mortality over the past 20 years; COVID-19 mortality levels, however, are currently 4 to 8 times higher in the US across the adult age range.",

This variation may reflect differences in the prevalence of risk factors, standards of clinical care, readiness of healthcare systems, or data quality and reporting practices (Carinci, 2020; Pasquariello & Stranges, 2020) . In the US, the only country for which fatality and mortality could be compared in this study, the case-fatality doubling times was slightly higher than the mortality doubling time (8.2 compared with 7.6 years).
