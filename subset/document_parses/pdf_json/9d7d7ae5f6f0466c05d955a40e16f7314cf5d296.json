            "text": "The axial and orbital rotations of the Earth generate predictable seasonal and daily rhythms of light and darkness. These conditions in turn generate circadian and seasonal oscillations in ambient temperature, food availability, predation and risk of infection. Evolution has equipped animals with innate timing mechanisms, or \"clocks\", that synchronise physiology to these recurring periods of increased risk. The circadian clock is generated by a series of interconnected transcription-translation feedback loops that regulate the expression of a panel of clock-controlled genes. 8 Most mammalian cells contain a molecular clock and overall rhythmicity is maintained by a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus, conferring time dependence on most physiological parameters through hormonal and neural signals. 8 The mechanisms driving seasonality in humans are unclear, but in animals, the seasonal clock is generated by changes in thyroid hormones in the brain that respond to day length signalled by the pineal hormone melatonin. 9 The circadian clock is entrained by the 24-hour photoperiod, while the seasonal clock entrains to day length patterns in Northern latitudes and to seasonal patterns in rain and food availability in tropical regions, where day length is constant. 10, 11 This is analogous with aspects of seasonality of the human immune system, where viral infection and immune cell numbers are associated with day length (e.g. winter peak in influenza) in Northern clines and with climatic changes in tropical regions. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Together, the seasonal and circadian clock synchronise physiology in two dimensions of time, optimising homeostasis by anticipating changes in the environment. For example, plants 16 , fish 17 , birds 18 and mammals 19, 20 all align their immune defence with the time of day that pathogenic and physical challenge are most likely. This conservation across the biological kingdoms is strong evidence that temporal modulation of immune function is an ancient and fundamental mechanism that has evolved to optimise survival in variable environmental conditions. Laboratory experiments corroborate epidemiological evidence of circadian and seasonal rhythms in disease susceptibility. For example, mice are more resilient to experimental inflammatory, 21,22,23 infectious 24-26 and physical challenges 27 delivered at night (their active circadian phase) or in summer. 28 Importantly, these daily cycles in vulnerability persist in constant conditions (photoperiod, temperature, or humidity) 28, 29 and are absent in animals lacking a circadian clock, 25, 30 demonstrating clock-mediated regulation that is not driven by current environmental conditions. Similar to rodents, humans are more resistant to the effects of inflammatory or infectious challenge 31, 32 delivered during their active circadian phase (day-time), or in summer. 33 Circulating white blood cell counts are known to oscillate across 24h under basal conditions, reflecting distribution of cells between tissues and the periphery. 36 Importantly, these rhythms persist in constant conditions and are absent in animals with ablated clock function 36 , indicating that they are mediated via innate circadian timing mechanisms. The extensive data collection within UK Biobank represents an unprecedented opportunity to assess seasonal and time-of-day variation in levels of human immune parameters. Here we provide new evidence of endogenous seasonal and daytime variability in human immune function at a population level and we demonstrate that these patterns are independent of a wide range of demographic, environmental and lifestyle factors.",

Baseline information was collected at the assessment centre using a questionnaire and an interview, and blood samples and physical measurements were taken. Information on the demographic status of the participants included age at baseline, sex (male/female), ethnicity (White, Black, Mixed, Chinese, Asian, Other). 38 Participants were self-categorised as morning or evening chronotype using the question, \"Do you consider yourself to be: Definitely a morning person; More a morning than evening person; More an evening than a morning person; Definitely an evening person; or Don't know\". The self-reported level and duration of usual physical activity was used to derive total physical activity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET.hours/week). A proxy of sedentary behaviour was derived from the total number of self-reported hours spent driving, using a computer and watching television each day. Smoking status was self-reported and categorized as \"never smoker,\" \"current smoker\" and \"former smoker.\" The frequency and volume of alcohol intake were self-reported. Body mass index (BMI was measured by trained UK Biobank staff using standardized methods and instruments. Habitual sleep duration was self-reported in hours per 24h. 38 Blood samples were collected at the end of the assessment centre visit, and the time was immediately recorded on computerised system by swiping the unique barcode on the collection tube. Blood cell counts were performed within 24 hours using an LH750 haematology analyser (Coulter, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) to determine the total number of white blood cells, plus the numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes, which were expressed as a percentage of the total white blood cell count. Vitamin D was measured using a chemiluminescent direct competitive immunoassay (Diasorin). Serum C reactive protein (CRP) was measured using a high-sensitivity immunoturbidimetric assay performed on a Beckman Coulter clinical chemistry analyser. A subset of participants (n=9724) were chosen at random for assessment of blood levels of antibodies against 20 infectious agents (see tables S7-8 for details of antigens). Antibody levels were measured using a Luminex high-throughput platform following validation against gold-standard assays and independent reference sera. Results of analyses were expressed as median fluoresce intensity for each antigen, and seropositivity status based on suggested thresholds. Full details of the participant measures and analysis procedures are available at www.ukbiobank.co.uk.",

Lymphocytes were lower during the early parts of the day, increasing as the day progressed, consistent with previous reports that lymphocytes circulating in blood are lower during the respective active phase of humans 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 and rodents. 43, 47, 48 Circadian rhythms in the homing and egress of lymphocytes through the lymphatic system and other tissues underlies these diurnal changes of lymphocyte numbers in blood. 43, 47, 49 Since the lymph nodes contain the interaction between lymphocytes and antigen, longer accumulation times increase antigen encounters and potentiate the adaptive immune response. 50, 48 Consequently, lymphocyte numbers in the periphery drop as trafficking to the tissues increases, along with increased tissue surveillance and resistance to infection. 43, 49 Circadian rhythms of lymphocyte trafficking to the periphery are abolished by genetic ablation of clock function and persist in constant conditions 47, 51 confirming their regulation by the innate circadian clock in mice. These endogenous rhythms are associated with time-of-day dependent changes in adaptive immunity, including amplified response to induction of autoimmunity (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), immunisation 48 and viral infection (influenza) during the active phase. 47 Thus the time of day that pathogenic challenge occurs affects the adaptive immune response generated days later, one of the mechanisms through which lymphocyte trafficking might modulate seasonal and circadian vulnerability to infection. In agreement with previous findings, 52,53 lymphocytes were positively associated with day length in our study; cell numbers were lower in autumn and peaked in spring. These findings of lower peripheral lymphocyte counts in winter and in the early active phase suggest that adaptive immune defences might be augmented in summer and during the day, and that humans might have retained some capacity for seasonal regulation of lymphocyte trafficking that might contribute to our increased susceptibility to infection in winter.",

            "text": "In addition to total counts, previous studies have demonstrated seasonality of functional aspects of neutrophil immune function, including adhesive capacity, CD11b/CD18 expression and ROS production, resulting in augmented bactericidal properties of neutrophils collected in summer. 71 The seasonal and daytime patterns in neutrophil count reported here, and in previous studies support evidence from animal studies that time-dependent cycles of tissue migration could contribute to neutrophil-mediated resilience to infection during the active phase, and relative vulnerability to infection in winter time. 67, 68 Monocyte counts were lower in the morning compared to evening in UK Biobank participants, consistent with previous reports that monocytes increase during the active phase in mice 72 and humans. 45 The acute phase protein, CRP showed a weak daily pattern in this study, with levels higher in daytime, again corroborating previous reports of diurnal patterns of CRP humans 73, 52, 74, 75 Circadian rhythms in circulation and tissue migration of monocytes in mice are regulated through an innate cell-intrinsic clock mechanism and their oscillation coincides with an enhanced inflammatory response when monocytes are decreasing at the beginning of the rest phase 72 and increased lethality of endotoxic challenge at this time. 23 In agreement, human volunteers show a heightened response to endotoxic challenge in the evening. 31, 32 This increased inflammatory response in the active phase might maximise innate immune defence at a time when pathogenic challenge is most likely, 76 but could also leave animals vulnerable to the toxic effects of augmented inflammation. Monocyte counts are higher in winter in some 53 but not all 77 previous studies. There was no evidence of a seasonal pattern in UK Biobank participants, and monocytes were not associated with day length in the fully-adjusted model. While peripheral counts are not always seasonal, monocyte function shows strong seasonality ex vivo, with an augmented proinflammatory response to activation in summer time. 78, 79 We found a weak seasonal pattern in the acute phase protein, CRP in UK Biobank, with levels higher in the winter months. Peripheral CRP and other proinflammatory markers were higher in winter in many studies in humans, 80, 81, 77 and this is thought to contribute to seasonal prevalence of cardiovascular disease 75 Seasonality of human viral infections is generally and intuitively thought to be driven by annual changes in temperature or humidity, but there is increasing evidence that innate variation in host disease susceptibility is an important contributor. In support of this, many diseases are seasonal in tropical regions where temperature and humidity are constant. 14, 15 Furthermore, outbreaks of influenza occur annually and simultaneously at latitudes that are oceans apart 82 despite variations in local climatic conditions and human behaviour. Recurrent seasonality is a feature of the epidemiology of infectious disease in animals that do not share human winter time behaviours such as increased time indoors, crowding or school terms. The prevalence of human respiratory viruses does not correspond with the prevalence of the respiratory disease they cause; remarkably, detection of viral infection is relatively low in the months that respiratory disease is highest. 83 Vitamin D is suspected to contribute to disease seasonality due to known associations with immune function and highly seasonal serum levels, 84 but this postulation is not corroborated by models that compared serum vitamin-D with influenza transmission in population based studies. 85, 86 Our findings in UK Biobank showed that seasonal changes in white blood cells and CRP were related to day length independent of vitamin D levels, in agreement with evidence that circulating vitamin D was not responsible for seasonality in the proinflammatory functions of human monocytes. 78 Finally, evidence of widespread seasonal regulation of transcription of genes regulating immune function and of reversed expression patterns in Northern and Southern hemispheres strongly supports endogenous regulation of seasonality in human immune function. 87 Seasonality of human infectious disease may be driven by an endogenous circannual rhythmicity in host immunity that generates cycles of enhancement and suppression of immune function and windows of vulnerability to infection, as proposed by Dowell (2001) . 88 This study in UK Biobank is the largest investigation of the seasonal and daytime patterns in human immune cells, inflammatory markers and antibody titres at population level, but our results are subject to many important limitations. In general, the UK Biobank does not truly represent the UK population, as participation was voluntary, uptake rates were low, and ethnic diversity was poorly represented. Furthermore, UK Biobank specifically recruited participants aged 40-69 years, so our findings may not apply to younger people. Some of the data that we analysed were self-reported, including ethnicity, physical activity, health status and chronotype, and mis-classification errors are possible. The participants denied chronic disease, but we cannot exclude the presence of acute infection at the time of assessment. The study design was cross sectional, and a single blood sample was available from each",

We were unable to assess circadian patterns since there were no night-time blood sample collections, and our results are limited to analysis of daytime variation. Nevertheless, the daily patterns we report in over 300,000 participants are consistent with the results of previous studies where blood was withdrawn at regular timepoints over 24h under experimental conditions. We present results of total cell counts only, and further studies are required to investigate subtypes of lymphocytes and neutrophils. The immune parameters that we report are affected by a multitude of factors related to interactions between host, pathogen and the environment. It is not possible to consider all of these in a population-based study, and the mechanisms driving the associations with day length and time of day that we report require investigation under controlled experimental conditions. Furthermore, the effect sizes we report are small, and likely to be of clinical significance for population-level disease control, rather than for the health of individuals. The strengths of this study are the large sample size and that the times of sample collection were randomly allocated to each participant. It is also a strength that we were able to investigate the effects of day length and time of day on immune parameters while adjusting for other factors thought to affect seasonal and daytime variability including physical activity, vitamin D and outdoor temperature.",
