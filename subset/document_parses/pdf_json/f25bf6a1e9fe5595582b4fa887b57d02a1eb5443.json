Therefore, the structure of the spike protein with the complete amino acid sequences in the prefusion conformation was needed to be constructed by simulation. Fortunately, a useful and trusted simulated structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the prefusion conformation that has been constructed by homology modeling and could be easily downloaded from SWISS-MODEL website (S1B Fig). Additionally, the viral RBD of spike protein bound with human ACE2 protein, the spike-ACE2 complex protein, was also recently resolved by X-ray crystallography (S1C Fig). To investigate whether the conformation between the RBD of spike proteins in ACE2-free state and ACE2-bound state have differences or not, the protein superimposition was performed by PyMOL software using the structural aligning method. The data showed that the value of root mean square (RMS) of the two conformations was 1.735 \u00c5 (< 2\u00c5). It meant that the superimposition between both RBD of spike proteins was good (Fig 1) . However, comparing the RBD regions of both spike proteins in the simulation models, it was significantly different in structural conformation (blue ring in Fig 1) . The simulation showed that the position of receptor-binding motif (RBM) regional structure in prefusion conformation was close to the RBD core than in the fusion conformation. Besides, the pose of RBM regional structure in the fusional conformation was more close to ACE2 protein than in the prefusion conformation.

Additionally, we have observed that the conformation of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the prefusional state is different from in the fusional state (Fig 1) . In other words, we can speculate that the conformation of the dynamic RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein would change to well bind and fit dynamic ACE2 protein. Therefore, we could design a strategy that two potential hitting sites could be set as the compound docking sites to prevent the spike protein to bind to ACE2 protein. One was that compounds docked on the RBD of the spike protein to prevent spike protein to bind to the human ACE2 protein, and the other was that compounds docked to the site of the connective interface of the spike-ACE2 complex protein to influence the affinity of binding between dynamic viral spike protein and dynamic human ACE2 protein and to cause nonfunctional changing of structural conformation to prevent viral spike protein from cleaved by human proteases. In this study, our aim was going to discover the compounds that not only can bind to the RBD of spike protein in the prefusion conformation but also bind to the site of the connective interface of spike-ACE2 complex protein. To discover the potential compounds, the virtual screening with molecular docking calculation was performed by AutoDock Vina program within PyRX software. All molecular structures prepared for virtual screening were downloaded from TDEC website. The results showed that the numbers of docked compounds (binding energy < -8 kcal/mol) in the prefusion RBD of spike protein and the spike-ACE2 complex protein were respectively 53 and 222. Among those compounds, the numbers of overlapped compounds and non-overlapped compounds were respectively 39 and 197. The binding energies and properties of 39 overlapped compounds were respectively shown in Fig 2, S2 Fig, and S1 Table.

Moreover, it also formed a pi-pi T-shaped interaction (pinking purple dashed line) with amino acid Phe486, and its interactive distance was 5.39\u00c5 (Fig 6B) . Candidine docked with the site near the connective interface of the 14 RBD of spike-ACE2 complex protein and its value of binding energy was -9.8 kcal/mol (Fig 6C) . Besides, it also formed many interactions with amino acids in the space near the connective interface of the RBD of spike-ACE2 complex protein. The results showed that it formed an electrostatic hydrogen-bonding interaction (green dashed line) with amino acid Glu37, and its interactive distance was 2.25\u00c5.

Hence, there is an expedite need for new drug development against SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have been reported many virtually screening drugs targeting proteases, such as 3CL protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro), which processed the essential polyprotein of infectious coronavirus[17,28,29]. The present study aimed to first screen the hit compounds for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We have aimed the conformations of target sites from viral surface protein, the prefusional spike protein and fusional spike-ACE2 complex protein for our virtual screening method to identify the best possible drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The target sites are vital at the entry point of viral particles entering into the cell of the host.

Furthermore, Khana et al. respectively identified 2 potential compounds for viral 3CLpro and 20-O-ribose methyltransferase from an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs by virtual screening[28]. Moreover, Ton et al. found 1,000 potential compounds for viral 3CLpro that may have the efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 from ZINC15 library by structure-based virtual screening using Deep Docking[34]. Additionally, Gentile discovered 17 potential inhibitors against viral 3CLpro from marine natural products by virtual screening integrating with pharmacophore and molecular dynamic[30]. Besides, Wang identified drugs Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir, and Elbasvir had good binding affinities for 3CLpro by virtual screening integrating with docking calculation and molecular dynamics simulations[35].
