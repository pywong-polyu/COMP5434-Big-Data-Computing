            "text": "The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised substantial concerns regarding its impact on populations affected by auto-immune diseases. MS, an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, is being studied for its correlation with COVID-19. [1, 2, 3] MS patients are considered a high-risk population for COVID-19, due to the high prevalence of disability and widespread use of immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapy (DMT). [4] Among MS patients, those who belong to an older age group or have a more progressive form of the disease have been shown to develop complications in addition to respiratory tract symptoms during a COVID-19 infection. [5] Indeed, MS patients are found to be at a greater risk of exacerbations and relapses due to this viral infection. [4, 6] The exact relationship between COVID-19 and MS is still unclear. There are contradictory reports regarding the relation between COVID-19 severity/risk and immunosuppressive medications. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence, severity, and were also extracted from the records. The data were confirmed by either contacting patients by phone or when they visited the clinics for their routine scheduled visits or due to their concern about their DMTs. The patients were asked to complete a self-administered survey sent via email or filled at the clinic that retrospectively collected details of the course of their COVID-19 illness such as symptoms, investigations performed, and requirement of hospitalization. Information was also obtained from their medical records. The severity of COVID-19 was categorized as mild (not requiring hospitalization), moderate (hospitalized), and severe (requiring intensive care). MS patients older than 18 Table 1 . Ninety-eight patients (73.1%) were female, with the median age of the cohort being 35.5 years, and a mean (SD) disease duration of 8.83 (6.0) years. Nonsmokers accounted for 88.8% of the total cohort with 91% reporting no morbid obesity.",

The study was conducted from March 2020 to February 2021. The data was collected from hospital records. MS was diagnosed according to the revised 2010 McDonald criteria. Before the application of these criteria, the diagnosis of MS was based on previously accepted diagnostic criteria. Demographic data including patient's age, gender, date of MS onset (date of first clinical event) and diagnosis, presentation at onset, disease duration (time in years since the first clinical event), type of MS, expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores, and the use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) was extracted from the records.

The small sample size does not let an appropriate assessment of the DMT-related COVID-19 risk of infection. The study did not use the WHO-recommended COVID-19 eight-category ordinal scale for describing disease severity. The lack of a non-infected cohort makes it difficult to make any assumptions and comparisons between MS characteristics in COVID-19 patients and among those in the general MS population. An adequate number of patients were not included in the analysis in Oman due to the lack of a comprehensive follow-up protocol and the prevailing COVID scenario. The strength of the study is that it is one of the few studies on MS patients with COVID-19 from the Middle East and can provide valuable insights on risk factors leading to more severe disease and consequent adverse outcomes in this patient population.ConclusionsThe prevalence of COVID-19 in the MS patient cohort from the Middle East is marginally lower than that in the general population. COVID-19 severity and outcome in this cohort are largely dependent on a few key indicators such as the presence of co-morbidities, higher scores of disabilities, presence of progressive forms of MS, and the use of anti-CD 20DMTs.

The endpoints for this study were the prevalence rate of COVID-19 in the studied MS cohort and measures of association of COVID-19 severity, hospitalization, and outcome with key demographic and clinical variables of MS. Statistical Analysis The prevalence of COVID-19 in MS patients was estimated by dividing the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the cohort by the total number of MS patients as per the hospital records. This was compared to the COVID-19 prevalence in the general population of that country/city. Descriptive statistics were used to compare demographics, disease characteristics, and the severity of MS. Univariate logistic regression models were performed on identified variables, namely, COVID-19 outcome (recovery or nonrecovery), COVID-19 severity (mild or non-mild [moderate/severe]), and hospital admission (Yes/No) to assess their association with covariates such as age (< 45 or \u2265 45), gender, smoking, EDSS score (0-4.5 or 5-9.5), comorbidities, MS diagnosis (RRMS/CIS or progressive [SPMS/PPMS]), MS disease duration, (\u2264 10 years or >10 years), On/Off DMTs, duration of current DMT (\u2264 5 years or > 5 years), and type of DMT.
