The virus responsible, SARS-CoV-2, has been found to possess a very close association with Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. The nucleocapsid protein can serve as a decent model for determining phylogenetic, evolutionary, and structural relationships between coronaviruses. Therefore, this study uses the nucleocapsid gene and protein to further investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses have revealed the nucleocapsid gene and protein in SARS-CoV-2 are both closely related to those found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. Evidence of recombination was detected within the N gene, along with the presence of a double amino acid insertion found in the N-terminal region. Homology modeling for the N-Terminal Domain revealed similar structures but distinct electrostatic surfaces and topological variations in the \u03b2-hairpin that likely reflect specific adaptive functions. In respect to SARS-CoV-2, two amino acids (S37 and A267) were found to exist only in its N protein, along with an extended \u03b2-hairpin that bends towards the nucleotide binding site. Collectively, this study strengthens the relationship among SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789, providing additional insights into the structure and adaptive nature of the nucleocapsid protein found in these coronaviruses.

Furthermore, there are four recognized and distinct genera in Coronavirinae: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus. 4 Additionally, these four genera then split into a variety of distinct subgenera (https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/). Officially, SARS-CoV-2 has been ranked within the genus Betacoronavirus and the subgenus Sarbecovirus, which are the same groups that contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 5 An overall 96% genome identity revealed the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 was Bat-CoV RaTG13, followed by an 88% genome identity with bat-SL-CoVC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. 6 In relation to SARS-CoV, only 79% genome identity was found to indicate a more genetically distant relationship exists between each virus. 6, 7 Recently, CoVs that were isolated from pangolins were found to have a 90-91% genome identity with SARS-CoV-2. 8, 9 In the spike protein, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 held greater similarity with pangolin CoVs in six key RBD residues unlike in Bat-CoV RaTG13 which only shares a single residue. 10 Therefore, it has been hypothesized that recombination occurred during the evolution of pangolin CoVs and Bat-CoV RaTG13, contributing to the development of SARS-CoV-2. 8, 9, 10 Additionally, these particular CoVs tend to form a separate clade in the Sarbecovirus subgenus when viewed on either genome-based or gene-based phylogenetic trees, furthering the likelihood of a shared ancestry that is more distinct from other distantly related CoVs. 8, 11, 12 Although phylogeny for SARS-CoV-2 is largely established, the complete evolutionary history for the virus is still in question. A recent investigation that focused on the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 indicated majority of the open-reading frames undergo purifying selection, and there exists little evidence of positive selection. 13 Furthermore, bats are natural reservoirs that possess a variety of CoVs. 14, 15 With greatest similarity to Bat-CoV RaTG13 found in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis), SARS-CoV-2 likely has its origin in bats as well. While bats serve as the natural reservoir, the identity of an intermediate host is largely unresolved. A range of conflicting studies have come out to suggest, but not definitely prove, that snakes, turtles, yaks, and/or Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) could potentially be the intermediate host(s) for the virus. 8, 9, [16] [17] [18] Even if one of these animals is the intermediate host, SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be isolated from any of them. 19 Nonetheless, many CoVs go through an intermediate host prior", "cite_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 362, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 688, "end": 689, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 860, "end": 861, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1003, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1005, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1118, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1120, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1321, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1493, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1496, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1499, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1768, "end": 1770, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1774, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1775, "end": 1777, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2114, "end": 2116, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2190, "end": 2193, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2194, "end": 2196, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2654, "end": 2656, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2657, "end": 2659, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2660, "end": 2664, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2665, "end": 2669, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2670, "end": 2674, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2782, "end": 2784, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "to reaching their intended host; therefore, it seems unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 would fail to possess an intermediate host of some kind. 15, 19 In the remaining one-third of all CoV genomes, there are several open-reading frames near the 3'-terminus that encode four main structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins. 4, 20 The N protein is multifunctional and involved in a variety of processes such as genome encapsidation and circularization, transcription, RNA packaging, genome transport to viral budding sites, repressing interferon production, cell cycle inhibition, and blocking RNA interference. [20] [21] [22] [23] Furthermore, the N protein is also highly immunogenic and largely overexpressed during replication, thereby capable of inducing large-scale immune responses against CoVs. 24, 25 Overall, the N protein possesses two highly conserved domains: the N-Terminal Domain (NTD) and C-Terminal Domain (CTD). 23, 26 Between each domain is an intrinsically disordered but flexible region known as the Linker Region (LKR) that is rich in serine and arginine residues. 26 There are two additional intrinsically disordered regions located at each terminus: the N-Terminal Region (NTR) and C-Terminal Region (CTR). 26 Each disordered region can interact with either the genome or viral proteins following the phosphorylation of residues that induce conformational changes to promote high affinity binding. 26, 27 In particular, the NTD is divergent in sequence and length; however, it has a \u03b2-sheet core along with a highly electropositive groove and \u03b2-hairpin extension that binds RNA to neutralize negative charges found within the phosphate-sugar backbone. 26 For majority of CoVs their NTDs are structurally similar; nevertheless, multiple electrostatic surface comparisons have revealed uniquely arranged charge distributions, suggesting that CoV NTDs utilize distinct modes of RNA-binding. 26, 28 In terms of function, the NTD serves as scaffolding to assist in genome packaging and virion assembly. 28, 29 From an evolutionary standpoint, the N gene in SARS-CoV-2 was found to be under strong selective pressure and displayed higher genetic diversity, increased host adaptation, and was prone to natural selection. 30 The structure of the dimerization domain in the SARS-CoV N protein has also helped to provide a link between Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae, highlighting the importance of structural data in assessing the relationship between different viruses. 31 Since the N protein is largely conserved and found to be evolving faster than other CoV proteins, it can serve as a model for establishing phylogenetic relationships, assessing mutations, calculating divergence times, and determining if recombination events occurred among specific CoVs. 14, 30 Currently, there is a limited amount of research focusing exclusively on the N protein in SARS-CoV-2.

This does not imply SARS-CoV-2 rose directly from either Pangolin-CoV MP789 or Bat-CoV RaTG13, but this is evidence of a close phylogenetic relationship. Additionally, it is unknown whether or not the common ancestors which gave rise to these lineages of CoVs are still in existence. At most, these data suggest a naturally intermingled bat and pangolin origin for SARS-CoV-2; however, the scope of this relationship is largely unclear. Both the N genes and proteins found among pangolin CoVs isolated between 2017-2018, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and bat-SL-CoVZC45 expressed lower identities suggesting a slightly weaker relation to SARS-CoV-2. Perhaps these groups of viruses served as precursors that contributed to the evolutionary development of the SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789 lineages.

Nonetheless, this feature reinforces a shared evolutionary history among these CoVs.

According to the protein alignment, this residue is flanked by arginine and lysine residues. If a purpose for this mutation exists, it most likely associates with RNA binding. This serine could be phosphorylated, yielding a conformational change that allows flanking electropositive amino acids to bind with an RNA molecule. Although majority of phosphorylation sites are within the LKR region, a prior study investigating the SARS-CoV N protein found additional sites elsewhere, including the N-terminal region. 26, 53 Therefore, it is possible S37 could undergo phosphorylation to promote effective and high affinity RNA-binding. In support of this function, the prediction method that detected for residues likely to undergo phosphorylation indicated that S37 (score: 0.766) has a high potential of being phosphorylated. Experimental analysis is absolutely necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Alternatively, S37 lacks any functional role and is just the result of a random non-deleterious mutation.

A recent study performed by Kang et al. 2020 elucidated the crystal structure for the NTD in SARS-CoV-2, and researchers discovered that when compared to the NTDs found in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, the \u03b2-hairpin presented structural and topological variations. 54 From this, it is understood these differences likely result in adaptive features that determine how specific CoV N proteins will bind to their own RNA genomes. Varying electrostatic surface potentials help support this concept. With varying distributions of positive charge, the mode of binding for the NTD will vary among N proteins. These differences in binding were also noted by Kang et al. 2020 outward; therefore, this feature and the \u03b2-hairpin region might function together in allowing for a binding site that contains RNA of higher ordered structure. 54 This could have further implications on how the genome is packaged when forming a helical nucleocapsid to make a complete virion. In addition, the topological variations observed in the \u03b2-hairpin region are likely not the result of intrinsic disorder.

In regard to both Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, they either formed phylogenetically distinct sister taxa or independent lineages based on their NTDs and CTDs (Figure S2). A similarity plot reveals that sequence identities are not homogenous among N genes found within SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV MP789, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L. The complete span of the N gene found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 shares higher nucleotide identity with Pangolin-CoV MP789 and SARS-CoV-2 than with either bat-SL-CoVZXC21 or Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L (Figure 3). However, nucleotides 485-565 found in Pangolin-CoV MP789, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and Bat-CoV RaTG13 share nearly the same identity to each other and with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). Interestingly, that same region does not possess any shared identity alongside Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L. As with percent identities, this similarity plot also reveals how the NTD and CTD in Bat-CoV RaTG13 is most similar to the domains in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). Disorder predictions for the N protein revealed nearly identical values of disorder for each residue", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "in which they found the NTD in SARS-CoV-2 employs a unique binding pattern for ribonucleotides when compared to binding patterns for domains in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43. 54 For the NTDs found in SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin-CoV MP789, and Bat-CoV RaTG13 a structural relationship exists. However, electrostatic surfaces suggest unique modes of RNA-binding. Given that structures for the NTDs in Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789 share greater similarity to the NTD in SARS-CoV-2 than with each other, it is likely these CoVs influenced the evolution leading up to the structural features observed in the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and how it binds to the genome. Also, an extended \u03b2-hairpin in SARS-CoV-2 might allow for a larger binding pocket that can accommodate RNA possessing higher ordered structure. Moreover, bending closer towards the binding site could permit a potentially tighter interaction with the genome.
