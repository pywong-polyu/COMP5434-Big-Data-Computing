However, worldwide distribution of mRNA molecules has been limited by their thermostability, which is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic instability of RNA molecules to a chemical degradation reaction called in-line hydrolysis. Predicting the degradation of an RNA molecule is a key task in designing more stable RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we describe a crowdsourced machine learning competition (\"Stanford OpenVaccine\") on Kaggle, involving single-nucleotide resolution measurements on 6043 102-130-nucleotide diverse RNA constructs that were themselves solicited through crowdsourcing on the RNA design platform Eterna. The entire experiment was completed in less than 6 months, and 41% of nucleotide-level predictions from the winning model were within experimental error of the ground truth measurement. Furthermore, these models generalized to blindly predicting orthogonal degradation data on much longer mRNA molecules (504-1588 nucleotides) with improved accuracy compared to previously published models. Top teams integrated natural language processing architectures and data augmentation techniques with predictions from previous dynamic programming models for RNA secondary structure. These results indicate that such models are capable of representing in-line hydrolysis with excellent accuracy, supporting their use for designing stabilized messenger RNAs. The integration of two crowdsourcing platforms, one for data set creation and another for machine learning, may be fruitful for other urgent problems that demand scientific discovery on rapid timescales.",

However, the chemical instability of RNA sets a fundamental limit on the stability of RNA-based therapeutics such as mRNAbased vaccines 1, 6-8 . RNA hydrolysis is the limiting factor in lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based formulations 9, 10 . Hydrolysis in LNP formulations degrades the amount of mRNA remaining during shipping and storage, and hydrolysis in vivo after vaccine injection limits the amount of resulting protein produced over time 9 . Better methods to develop thermostable RNA therapeutics would allow for increasing the equitability of their distribution, reducing their cost, and possibly increasing their potency 10, 11 . Initial results have demonstrated that more stable mRNAs can be designed via stochastic algorithms that identify mRNA sequences that code for the same protein 12 , but are predicted to be more resistant to hydrolysis 13, 14 . Importantly, these mRNAs are demonstrated to produce equivalent amounts of protein to non-optimized mRNAs 14 . These design strategies are predicted to be able to produce mRNAs that do not activate double-stranded RNA immune sensors 13, 15 , and have also demonstrated to be compatible with mRNAs synthesized from modified nucleotides including pseudouridine 14 , which are used in mRNA vaccine formulations 16 .",

Computational studies with this model suggested that at least a two-fold increase in stability could be achieved through sequence design, while maintaining a wide diversity of sequences and features related to translatability, immunogenicity, and global structure 14 . However, it is unlikely that degradation depends only on the probability of a nucleotide being unpaired: local sequence-and structure-specific contexts may vary widely, as evidenced by ribozyme RNAs found in nature, whose sequences adopt specific structures that undergo selfscission 17 .",

The aim of the OpenVaccine Kaggle competition ( Figure 1B ) was to develop computational models for predicting RNA degradation patterns. We asked participants on the Eterna platform to submit RNA designs using a web-browser design window ( Figure   1C ), which resulted in a diversity of sequences and structures ( Figure 1D ). 150 participants in total (Table   S1 ) submitted sequences. A secondary motivation was an opportunity for participants to receive feedback on RNA fragments they may wish to use in mRNA design challenges described in Leppek et al. 14 3029 RNA designs of length 107 nt were collected in the first \"Roll-Your-Own-Structure\" round I (RYOS-I), which was opened March 26, 2020, and closed upon reaching 3029 constructs on June 19, 2020 ( Figure   1E ). We then obtained nucleotide-level degradation profiles for the first 68 nucleotides of these RNAs using In-line-seq 14 , a novel method for characterizing in-line RNA degradation in high-throughput for the purposes of designing stabilized RNA therapeutics. Degradation profiles were collected in four different accelerated degradation conditions, and the structures of the constructs were also characterized via selective 2' hydroxyl acylation with primer extension (SHAPE; termed \"Reactivity\" below) 22, 23 , a technique to characterize RNA secondary structure. The Kaggle competition was designed to create models that would have predictive power for three of these data types, given RNA sequence and secondary structure as input ( Figure 1F ). Though SHAPE reactivity is distinct from the degradation measurements we wished to be able to predict for the application of mRNA design, the SHAPE reactivity datasets had higher signal-to-noise ratio ( Figure S2 ), and we hypothesized that models would demonstrate improved performance predicting SHAPE reactivity and that the data would serve as a \"positive control\" for a predictable data type. Additionally, models with highly accurate predictions of SHAPE reactivity would have utility in biological applications. 24 In total, each independent construct of length N required predicting 3xN values for the 3 data types. In addition to these experimental data, Kaggle participants were also provided with features related to RNA secondary structure computed from available biophysical models to use if they wished. These features included 107x107 base pairing probability matrices from EternaFold 20 , a recently developed package with state-of-the-art performance on RNA structural ensembles; dot-parenthesis notated minimum free energy (MFE) RNA secondary structure from the ViennaRNA package 25 ; and a sixcharacter featurization of the MFE structure calculated using bpRNA 26 .",

Kaggle entries significantly outperformed the \"DegScore\" linear regression model for RNA degradation 14 by 37 % in MCRMSE for the public test set and 25% for the private test set ( Figure 3A ). An additional benchmark model which widely-used community-developed featurizations was a graph-based distance embedding depicted in Figure 3B . Several teams, including the top three teams, used a publicly-shared autoencoder/GNN/GRU kernel (https://www.kaggle.com/code/mrkmakr/covid-ae-pretrain-gnn-attn-cnn/), which alone achieved a MCRMSE of 0.24860 on the Public and 0.36106 on the Private test set ( Figure 3A ). This notebook was the most forked (forked 936 times as of March 2022) and upvoted (upvoted 386 times). The architecture of the winning \"Nullrecurrent\" model ( Figure 3C ) depicts the architecture of this shared kernel, which feeds 1D and 2D features, including adjacency matrices based on the secondary structure of the RNA inputs, into multi-head attention network that is then fed into convolutional neural net layers.. Many teams additionally cited pseudo-labeling and generating additional mock data as being integral to their solutions. The architecture of the second-place team ( Figure 3D ) demonstrates an example implementation of using pseudo-labeling. The machine learning practice of pseudo-labeling involves using predictions from one model as \"mock ground truth\" labels for another model. Effective pseudolabeling usually requires a high level of accuracy of the primary model and is most frequently used with classification problems. To generate additional mock data, participants generated random RNAs as well as structure featurizations using 5 different secondary structure prediction algorithms using the package Arnie (https://github.com/DasLab/arnie) and iteratively scored based on these predictions for their model as well (see Supplement for more detailed descriptions of solutions from Kaggle teams).",

We analyzed predictions from the first-place model (\"Nullrecurrent\") in depth to better understand its performance. Across all nucleotides in the private test set, 41% of nucleotide-level predictions for SHAPE reactivity agreed with experimental measurements within an error that was lower than experimental uncertainty; for comparison, if experimental errors are distributed as normal distributions, a perfect predictor would agree with experimental values over 68% of data points. For Deg_Mg_pH10 and Deg_Mg_50C, 28% and 42% of predictions were within error, respectively. Per-construct RMSE between data types was moderately correlated, with the highest correlation being Spearman R=0.63 between deg_Mg_pH10 and deg_Mg_50C ( Figure S3 ). The nucleotides with the highest RMSE in the Deg_Mg_pH10 data type were any nucleotide type in bulges, and U's in any unpaired context. Figure 4A depicts representative constructs with the lowest RMSE for the Deg_Mg_pH10 data type out of the private test data, demonstrating that a diverse set of structures and structure motifs were capable of being predicted correctly. Aggregating the predictions from the Nullrecurrent model over secondary structure motifs ( Figure 4B ) demonstrates that the Nullrecurrent predictions by motif captured patterns previously observed in the experimental signal 14 . The most reactive RNA structure motifs were triloops, a previously unknown biological finding. Another unexpected finding from these data were that internal loops with symmetric lengths on either side recovered stability over internal loops with asymmetric lengths. The fact that the Nullrecurrent model was able to capture this trend indicates that using such models within a design algorithm would allow for an automated way to impart such biological attributes within a designed mRNA. Constructs with the highest RMSE demonstrate indicators that the provided structure features were incorrect. Figure 4C depicts two constructs with the highest RMSE for the SHAPE modification prediction. The SHAPE data for the first construct, \"2204Sept042020\", has high reactivity in predicted stem areas, indicating the stems were unfolded in solution. In contrast, construct \"Triple UUUU Tetraloops\" has experimentally low reactivity in the exterior loop, suggesting that a stem was present.",

Carrying out predictions on the full RNA sequence and then summing over the probed window allows to account for interactions between the untranslated regions and CDS, as can be seen for two example constructs in Figure 5B --nucleotides in the 5' and 3' UTRs are predicted to pair with the CDS. We made predictions for 188 mRNAs in 4 classes: a short multi-epitope vaccine (MEV), the model protein Nanoluciferase, with one class consisting of varied UTRs and a second consisting of varied CDSs, and enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP). We found that the Kaggle second-place \"Kazuki2\" model exhibited the highest correlation to fit degradation rates, followed by the Kaggle 1st-place \"Nullrecurrent\" model ( Figure 5C) (Table 1 ).",

My model takes in two kinds of features, (1) 1D features with length n (the length of the mRNA sequence), representing features at each location of the sequence; (2) 2D features with size n^2, representing \"distance\" or \"relationship\" concepts between each pair. The strongest 1D features are the distance to the closest paired position, as well as the distance to the closest unpaired position -reactivity increases as the distance to the closest paired position becomes larger. The strongest 2D feature is the distance between each pair in the primary pairing based graph -this allows the model to capture the \"neighbors\" caused by pairing. One major difficulty of this problem is generalizing the model to different sequence lengths, and I use a semi-supervised approach to make my model more generalizable. In particular, I randomly generate sequences of different length, calculate their BPP matrix and pairing structure using the Arnie library, pseudo label their targets, and train them together with the original train dataset. This semi-supervised learning approach is particularly useful in this problem, for which sample size is small and labeled data is expensive to obtain. https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/discussion/189620",

Therefore, we thought of constructing LSTM/GRU and GNN independently, and integrating the prediction results with XGBoost. The base pair probabilities (bpps) are calculated by prediction, and the calculation results differ depending on the algorithm used. Therefore, we used several algorithms in Arnie to predict base pairs, and used these algorithms as data augmentation and input multiple bpps simultaneously to improve the performance. We prepared 38 LSTM/GRU-based and 49 GNN-based bpps by changing the types of bpps and their architectures, and integrated them with XGBoost to help improve the stability of prediction. Also, since the sequences in the test set tended to be longer than those in the training data, we confirmed in preliminary experiments that the model trained by shortening the sequences in the training data (107 to 88) was applicable to sequences of the original length (107 The 4th place solution is a blend of 4 different models, in which the RNN layers were varied (LSTM+LSTM, LSTM+GRU, GRU+LSTM and GRU+GRU). We represent the RNA sequences as graphs where each base corresponds to a node. The network then learns a representation for each of these graphs and passes this representation through bi-directional RNN layers to obtain a sequence of predicted targets. Both the edge and node features were derived from the given sequence and provided Base Pairing Probability (BPP) matrix. One-hot-encoded bases (A, G, C, or U), one-hot-encoded positional feature (the remainder of the base index divided by 3), one-hot-encoded loop types, loop type probabilities (CapR) and BPP sum and number of zero's were beneficial node features. The distances (manhattan) between bases, normalized by sequence length and whether there is a base-pairing indicated in the structure were used as edge features. All these features were also inferred for newly generated BPP matrices, generated with 6 libraries available within the ARNIE software package. The new information derived from the CONTRAfold library was the most useful for this task, followed by RNAsoft, RNAstructure and Vienna. We also tried to use 3D angle information (binned and then categorically encoded) extracted with AMIGOS: this boosted our simple LSTM architecture used to fast check the feature importance but deteriorated the performance of our final model. 7th Place -One architecture Main features for my solution used were base pairing probability matrix, nucleotide sequence, structure, and loop type. Additionally, an inverse distance matrix (nucleotides at position i and j have distance |i-j| between them) was added to the base pairing probability matrix before inputting it as a bias for the selfattention matrix. The conventional type of positional encoding as detailed in the original transformer or learnable positional encoding were not used; instead, position was encoded by the inverse distance matrix. Further, 5 secondary structure packages were used to generate pairing probability matrix, structure, and loop type at 37 and 50 C, resulting in 10 sets of features for each sequence. The architecture used was almost identical to bert aside from the 1D/2D convolution/deconvolution layers (without padding). The core module (ConvTransformerEncoder) was constructed as follows: (1) 1D convolution on the sequence of encodings and 2D convolution on the bpp feature map.",

All available sequences were used to pretrain (unsupervised) models on randomly mutated or masked (with NULL token) sequence retrieval loss (basically just softmax to retrieve correct nucleotide/structure/loop). For convenience, two linear decoders were initialized before pretraining, one for sequence retrieval, and another for degradation predictions later on. The Ranger optimizer was used with a flat and anneal schedule. Some sequences were excluded during training on degradation targets based on signal to noise threshold (0.25, 0.5, or 1). My biggest discovery from this competition is that the vanilla positional encoding used in the original transformer paper does not generalize well to this task at least. It seems that the type of positional encoding used in most transformers does not adequately describe the concept of position, which is fine for NLP because I believe order and position of words are not as important as for RNA. The vanilla positional encoding is more of an absolute positional encoding, whereas the inverse distance basically encoders relative position in a very simple way that generalized better to longer sequences. Best ensemble achieved MSRMSE's of 0.23056/0.34550 on the public/private leaderboard.",

For features, bpps was augmented with different temperature parameters (T=37, 50) using the ARNIE package (vienna, nupack, rnastructure, rnasoft, eternafold, contrafold). I also added the shannon entropy at each base position. Because all of the data in this competition are predicted values except for the sequence, I think it would have been effective to use an ensemble of bpps predictions from various algorithms. At high temperature: Since the secondary structure of RNA is temperature-dependent, I think it was effective to use bpps with T changed as input. At high pH: Alkaline hydrolysis of RNA can occur at any position in the sequence (probably) as well, so I think the prediction itself is difficult. https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/discussion/190314",

The RNA sequence length used for training was 107, and the final ranking was obtained for 130 sequences. Different models with fluent feature engineering to enhance the generalization of predictions. Because RNA can have both graph and sequence, traditional recurrent neural networks (LSTM, GRU), transformer and graph-neural networks were applied. For feature engineering, (A, G, C, or U) were represented by embedding layers. And, various (N, N) adjacency matrices called bpps, which are probabilities of being linked between nucleotides are calculated with various softwares, such as CONTRAFold, RNAFold. The statistical features such as ratio of (A, G, C, or U) in sequence are added. has are also included.I created the (N, N) matrix for fixed attention in various ways. Bpps was created using several packages. The distance matrix was augmented using gaussian. With these features, dozens of models were created by differing hyperparameters of sequential blocks and graph convolution layers. https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/discussion/189845",

The first type is a combination of 1D Convolution Layers, Graph Convolution Layers, and RNN Layers. The second type is a combination of WaveNet layers and RNN Layers. The most powerful features are the adjacency matrices constructed by the given structure sequence and the given base-pair probabilities. The adjacency matrices are used for the Graph Convolution Layers. Another useful trick we have used is to apply a lower training weight to the top 6 sequence position, it is because the sequence start is similar across the different sequences. We also used 2 different Linear Regression models to ensemble the predictions in different sequence positions that are seqpos[:6] and seqpos [6: ].",

Although each library provides sub optimal bpp, their consensus provides a better solution. We also included several architectures in the ensemble and the best of them consisted of 1D convolution, static graph convolution and bi-directional LSTM layers. A static graph convolution layer processes each two connected nucleotides in the predicted secondary structure (zeros added when a nucleotide isn't connected). All our models were trained on all the data using self supervised learning then fine-tuned on the training data only using supervised learning.",

I focused mainly on augmentation. (1) I used eternafold, vienna, nupack, contrafold and rnasoft to extract structure and loop_type. These backend engines are used to extract additional bpps too. Especially eternafold and contrafold worked well.(2) In this competition, the sequence length of the test data was longer than that of the training data, so we added a dummy sequence to the training data. (3) I added reversed sequence to training data. I think augmentation was important in this competition.6th Place -nyanp The data in this competition is very unique in two ways: 1) the sequence length is different between the training data and the private test data, and 2) the sequence has long-term dependencies via pairing. My NN model is constructed by stacking 1D SE-ResNet Layer and Graph Convolution Layer in order to make the model invariant to sequence length and to capture the long-term dependency. The Graph Convolution Layer is computed by a simple sum of products of the BPP matrix or adjacency matrix and the sequence feature vector. The best single model was ranked 42nd (0.35045) on the private leaderboard, while it was 513th (0.24371) on the public leaderboard. This indicates that my model is more robust to changes in sequence length compared to the other participants.
