The goal of the current study was to test whether or not neuroticism, conscientiousness, and personal belief in a just world are associated with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the contribution of neuroticism and conscientiousness was assessed over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions, and the unique contribution of personal belief in a just world was evaluated beyond all the other study variables. Samples were collected in three different countries-Israel (N = 917), Germany (N = 213), and India (N = 160). Online self-report questionnaires were utilized to measure age, gender, COVID-19 perceptions (probability, severity, and self-efficacy), neuroticism, conscientiousness, personal belief in a just world, and depression. The findings indicated that, across the three countries, neuroticism was positively associated with depression (correlations ranging from .24 to .44), and conscientiousness and personal belief in a just world were negatively associated with depression (correlations ranging from \u2212 .31 to \u2212 .21, and from \u2212 .35 to \u2212 .23, respectively). Moreover, neuroticism and conscientiousness explained unique variance over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions (except conscientiousness in India), and the effect of personal belief in a just world on depression was significant beyond the effects of all other study variables. These findings support the role of personality in explaining depression regardless of situational characteristics and stress the role of just world beliefs as protective factors against negative emotions.",

In other words, greater perceptions of susceptibility or severity of COVID-19 may cause greater fear, which authorities hope would be translated to a greater willingness to follow health guidelines. However, both the fear aroused and some of the behavioral recommendations (e.g., isolation) can have detrimental effects. Consequently, there is a growing concern regarding the emotional costs of the pandemic and its disruption of daily life, such as experiencing depression and anxiety (Hyland et al., 2020) . The purpose of the current research was to assess whether or not general personality traits were able to predict depression, in light of the concerns and findings regarding negative emotional states related to COVID-19. Specifically, we examined the associations between depression and neuroticism, conscientiousness, and personal belief in a just world.",

This model, also referred to as the predisposition model, was proposed to explain psychological co-morbidity, i.e., that the presence of an existing disorder increases the probability of developing an additional disorder. It postulates that an individual with a specific subset of maladaptive personality traits may be predisposed to particular disorders, such as depression, by evoking certain responses that facilitate the development of such disorders (Krueger & Tackett, 2003) . Following mixed results regarding the relationships between the five personality traits and depression, a meta-analysis concluded that only higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness were significantly and robustly associated with depression (Kotov et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Neuroticism, sometimes inversely labeled emotional stability, relates to a person being anxious and easily upset (John & Srivastava, 1999) . The link between depression and neuroticism can be explained by the vulnerability model, since neuroticism is strongly associated with high levels of negative affect and low levels of positive affect (Watson et al., 1999) , which may lead to depression (Clark & Watson, 1991) . Conscientiousness, which refers to a person being dependable, orderly, an thorough (John & Srivastava, 1999) , consistently yielded strong negative effects on depression and other psychopathologies (Malouff et al., 2005) . This corresponds with findings regarding low conscientiousness as the strongest personality predictor of poor engagement in health behaviors and of mortality (Bogg & Roberts, 2004; Kern & Friedman, 2008; Nudelman & Ivanova, 2018) . One explanation for this association relates to the vulnerability model, suggesting that individuals low in conscientiousness are predisposed to academic difficulties, job loss, and other failures, which can contribute to psychopathology (Klein et al., 2011) . Consequently, the first goal of the current study was to investigate the pattern of associations between depression during the COVID-19 pandemicwhich many people might experience due to situational factors-and neuroticism and conscientiousness.",

This belief is thought of as a stable personality trait (Dalbert, 2001) , since it serves as an important adaptive function that provides psychological protection from unjustified consequences (Lerner & Miller, 1978) . The literature distinguishes between two forms of the belief in a just world (Dalbert, 1999) : personal (concerning the self) and general (concerning others or everyone). Personal belief in a just world, and not the general belief, was found related to subjective well-being and life satisfaction (Correia & Dalbert, 2007; Dalbert, 1999; Lipkus et al., 1996; Sutton & Douglas, 2005; Sutton et al., 2017) .

For example, a weak belief in a just world may lead to lower internal locus of control (Nudelman & Otto, 2021) , which in turn may translate into perceived helplessness, a well-known antecedent of depression (Pryce et al., 2011) .

Since it may take some time for depressive symptoms to develop, we collected data about two months after the initial lockdown. This period included limitations to daily life and the people were strongly advised to stay at home, allowing enough time to pass to cause emotional strain that may result in depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 2013, p. 160).",

Consequently, we examined the effects of neuroticism and conscientiousness on depression over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions, which may be strong determinants of negative emotional states during the pandemic and overlap with variability explained by personality. Moreover, considering the associations of personal belief in a just world with neuroticism and conscientiousness (Nudelman, 2013; Nudelman & Otto, 2021) , we assessed the effect of personal belief in a just world on depression after controlling for the contribution of all other study variables, to test for its unique protective properties, unrelated to other major personality traits, during the threatening COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, Israel is closer to India on the cultural dimension of collectivism compared with Germany (Hofstede et al., 2010; Purohit & Simmers, 2006) . Moreover, trust in government was higher in India than in an average of the OECD countries, and higher in Germany compared with Israel (OECD, 2013 (OECD, , 2021 , and Germany and Israel are considered high income countries, while India is part of the lower-middle-income group (The World Bank, 2020). These differences might influence the reactions during COVID-19, such as individuals in collectivistic cultures-compared with individualistic cultures-suffering more from social isolation. Therefore, this study was expected to contribute to the literature by examining the replicability of previously found relationships between personality traits and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluating these effects beyond those of demographic and situational characteristics, and assessing them across three nations.

The correlations with neuroticism ranged from 0.24 to 0.44, and with conscientiousness from \u2212 0.31 to \u2212 0.21. In line with hypothesis 2, significant negative correlations were found between personal belief in a just world and depression across the three samples, ranging from \u2212 0.35 to \u2212 0.23.

Hypothesis 3 was mostly supported: Neuroticism and conscientiousness (step 3) explained significant variance over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions across all three countries (Table 2) . However, while both personality traits were significant in the samples from Israel and Germany, only neuroticism was a significant predictor of depression in the regression equation in the sample from India. This is also reflected in the largest change in explained variance demonstrated after adding neuroticism and conscientiousness in the samples from Israel and Germany, but not in the sample from India (Table 2) .",

This pattern was also found in the current study, across three countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, since the associations were lower than the average associations found in a previous meta-analysis, but within an 80% credibility interval (Kotov et al., 2010) , the links between depression and neuroticism and conscientiousness appear to remain stable during the pandemic. Neuroticism also emerged as a strong predictor of depression beyond COVID-19 perceptions and demographic variables. Higher neuroticism, symbolizing less emotional stability, was associated with higher levels of depression, which is logical since both constructs are strongly related to higher negative mood and anxiety (Lerman et al., 2015; Paulus et al., 2016) . Conscientiousness was a significant predictor in the samples from Israel and Germany, although less prominent than neuroticism in predicting depression, and did not reach significance in the sample from India when COVID-19 perceptions and demographic variables were included in the regression equation (although the coefficient was in the expected direction). This might be due to its medium-effect-sized correlation with age, suggesting that, at least in India, older people are both more conscientious and less depressed. Nevertheless, since individuals with higher conscientiousness also engage more in health behaviors, and achieve higher academic success and job performance (Bogg & Roberts, 2004; Dudley et al., 2006; O'Connor & Paunonen, 2007) , all linked to better health and well-being (B\u00fccker et al., 2018; Cropanzano & Wright, 1999; Nudelman & Ivanova, 2018) , it is likely that the negative association between conscientiousness and depression has unique characteristics beyond those of demographic or other factors.",

This relationship replicates past findings depicting an association between stronger personal belief in a just world and higher well-being (Donat et al., 2016; Hafer et al., 2020) and lower depression (Kamble & Dalbert, 2012; Otto et al., 2006) . Most investigations of the link between personality and depression do not include just world measures (for a review, see Klein et al., 2011) , and previously found associations between personal belief in a just world and neuroticism and conscientiousness (Nudelman, 2013; Nudelman & Otto, 2021) might imply that the effect of personal belief in a just world on depression is a byproduct of an overlap between these personality constructs. However, our findings revealed that personal belief in a just world explained depression over and above not only demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions, but also neuroticism and conscientiousness. This attests to the unique role of personal justice beliefs in providing protection from negative mood (Dalbert, 2002; Nudelman & Nadler, 2017) , in line with the vulnerability model. It is also consistent with the representation of the personal belief in a just world as a resource that maintains well-being in everyday life, which is achieved by providing a sense of meaning and control that leads people to act in a just manner-since they expect their behaviors to result in just consequences, i.e., that they will get what they deserve (Dalbert, 2001) . In the context of COVID-19, this might manifest itself as a belief that one will not get infected or not become severely ill if infected, or that a person is protected as long as s/he does not do anything to bring about the disease. Thus, future studies should examine which personal belief in a just world functions are more dominant in explaining its link with depression, and whether there is a way to influence those perceptions so that people might experience less negative emotional states (e.g., ensuring people that following the necessary guidelines would most likely prevent infection).",

            "text": "Another shortcoming is related to the measures utilized in this study. Although short measures are an acceptable way of assessing personality traits, scales encompassing more items to reach better reliability scores should be used to replicate the current findings. Moreover, COVID-19 perceptions were limited to single items assessing probability, severity, and self-efficacy. Although these are central in fear processes (Ruiter et al., 2014) , the effects of personality traits on depression should be examined when controlling for additional factors such as perceived risk for close others (Mertens et al., 2020) . Furthermore, it is important to determine which COVID-19-related constructs that are associated with depression, e.g., fears and social isolation (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Santini et al., 2020) , explain part of the variance in depression that was originally associated with personality traits. This may imply possible mechanisms through which personality affects depression, such as particular perceptions (Dalal et al., 2015) , and thus indicate pathways that might be addressed in order to alleviate depression.",

The patterns uncovered in this investigation might change over time, as COVID-19 perceptions become more stable, and certainly after a vaccination is developed. Moreover, other personality traits, such as self-esteem (Sowislo & Orth, 2013) , may also play a role in depression during pandemics. Thus, future studies should continue to explore the degree to which personality traits explain changes over time in depression and other negative emotional states. Furthermore, this should be assessed beyond the effects of the demographic and COVID-19-related variables measured in the current research, as well as include additional relevant factors that are associated with depression, such as socioeconomic conditions (Lorant et al, 2003) , religiosity (Braam & Koenig, 2019) , and social support (Grey et al., 2020) , with the latter having critical importance due to the widespread social isolation during the pandemic.",
