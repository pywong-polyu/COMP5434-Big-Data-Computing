Thus, it is critical to identify compounds able to inhibit virus replication and thwart the inflammatory reaction. Here, we show that the plasma levels of the immunoregulatory neuropeptide VIP are elevated in patients with severe COVID-19, correlating with reduced inflammatory mediators and with survival on those patients. In vitro, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), highly similar neuropeptides, decreased the SARS-CoV-2 RNA content in human monocytes and viral production in lung epithelial cells, also reducing cell death. Both neuropeptides inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators in lung epithelial cells and in monocytes. VIP and PACAP prevented in monocytes the SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of NF-kB and SREBP1 and SREBP2, transcriptions factors involved in proinflammatory reactions and lipid metabolism, respectively. They Abbreviations: VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide; PACAP, pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B;",

During the inflammatory response to human pathogenic coronaviruses, circulating neutrophils and monocytes migrate and infiltrate the lungs 15, 16 and other organs, contributing to potentiate and perpetuate the inflammation and eventually exacerbating the tissue damage [17] [18] [19] . Previous studies showed that MERS-CoV-and SARS-CoV-infected macrophages produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines 20, 21 , and, more recently, that lung monocytes from severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 are potent producers of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, whose levels were increased in the serum of the same patients 7 . Also, we and other authors have found that SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammasome activation and cell death by pyroptosis in monocytes, either by experimental or natural infection, which are associated with lung inflammation and are risk factors in critically ill COVID-19 patients 13, 14 .",

We report here that VIP levels are elevated in the plasma of individuals with severe manifestations of COVID-19, which correlated with survival on critically ill patients. We also verified, in in vitro assays, that VIP and PACAP inhibit the production of proinflammatory mediators in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and lung epithelial cells, and reduced viral production and cell death.

The finding that nonsurvival of severe COVID-19 patients is associated with lower levels of circulating VIP, a molecule with prohomeostasis and anti-inflammatory activities 32, 37 , moreover pointing to an application as a prognostic marker, also implies to a therapeutical potential of VIP in COVID-19. In fact, VIP has been approved for 3 clinical trials against COVID-19 in intravenous 38 and inhaled 39, 40 formulations. Our initial clinical data prompted us to evaluate the Severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU were subdivided between those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or noninvasive O 2 supplementation (J) and according to the 28-day mortality outcome as survivors or non survivors (K). Linear regression (with the 95% confidence interval) and Spearman's correlation were calculated according to the distribution of the data.

We found that VIP reduced the SARS-CoV-2 RNA content in monocytes, achieving up to 40% and 50% inhibition at 5 and 10 nM, respectively (Figure 2(A) ). PACAP similarly decreased the levels of viral RNA synthesis with 5 and 10 nM (up to 50% for both doses) (Figure 2(B) ). We next evaluated whether VIP and PACAP could also be able to restrict virus production in pulmonary cells, one of the major targets of SARS-CoV-2. We found that VIP reduced viral replication, reaching up to 50 and 40% inhibition with 1 and 5 nM, respectively (Figures 2(C) and S1(A) ). PACAP also diminished F I G U R E 3 Receptor contribution for the VIP-and PACAP-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Monocytes (A) and Calu-3 cells (B) were exposed (overnight) or not to antagonists for VPAC1/2 (atVPAC1/2; 100 nM for monocytes; 50 nM for Calu-3 cells) and PAC1 receptors (atPAC1; 150 nM for monocytes; 300 nM for Calu-3 cells) and to VIP or PACAP (antagonists were added 10 min before exposure to neuropeptides, and were kept in the culture medium). Also, monocytes (C) and Calu-3 cells (D) were treated (overnight) or not with agonists for VIP and PACAP receptors, as indicated, at different concentrations. Upon overnight exposure (A-D), culture medium was removed and then cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h, as described in Material and Methods. After infection, viral input was removed, and cells were washed, and then reexposed to receptor antagonists and VIP or PACAP (A and B) or to receptor agonists, as before (C and D). Viral RNA synthesis was evaluated by qPCR in monocytes 24 h after infection. In Calu-3 cells, supernatants were collected at 48 h after infection, and viral replication was evaluated by quantifying PFUs in Vero E6 plaque assays.

In parallel, VIP and PACAP protected monocytes and Calu-3 cells from SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytopathic effect, as measured by LDH activity in supernatants (Figures 2(E) and 2(F)). Overall, these results show that SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated cell death are decreased in cells exposed to VIP or PACAP.",

            "text": "The different optimal concentrations of VIP and PACAP to reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells might be explained by the relative abundance of the neuropeptide receptors, since it has been shown that these cells express only VPAC1 43 . However, all 3 recep-tors are reported to be expressed in lungs, with some studies showing that VPAC1 levels are higher than VPAC2 or PAC1 (to which PACAP binds with higher affinity than to VPAC1 and VPAC2 22, [44] [45] [46] . With that in mind, we evaluated the role of the individual receptors in the neuropeptide-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in both cells. To this end, monocytes and Calu-3 cells were exposed to VIP or PACAP in the presence of antagonists for VPAC1/2 receptors (VIP antagonist) and PAC1 receptor (PACAP 6-38), and then infected with SARS-CoV-2. In both cells, only when in the presence of VPAC1/2 receptor antagonist, the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by VIP and PACAP was reverted (Figures 3(A) and 3(B) ). We also performed assays in monocytes and Calu-3 cells treated with specific agonists to VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1 (Ala-VIP, Bay 55-9837, and Maxadilan, respectively). Activation of VPAC1 at 1, 5, and 10 nM, and of VPAC2 at 1 nM, significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 RNA content in monocytes (Figure 3(C) ). In Calu-3 cells, we verified that VPAC1 is the main receptor involved the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells, resembling the level of inhibition achieved with VIP, while exposure to a VPAC2 agonist resulted in a more modest inhibition ( Figure 3D ). The stimulus with a PAC1 agonist had no effect on viral replication (Figures 3(C) and 3(D) ). Likewise, we verified the cytopathic effect, as measured by LDH activity in supernatants, in both uninfected and infected cells exposed to VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1 agonists. Uninfected cells displayed no viability alteration in the presence of VIP and PACAP receptor agonists ( Figures S2(A) and S2(B) ). In infected cells, reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated cell death was observed mainly upon VPAC1 activation ( Figures S2(C) and S2(D) ). As a whole, these findings suggest that VPAC1 receptor is the main contributor for the VIP-and PACAPmediated SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in monocytes and Calu-3 cells, and that activation of this receptor can lead to a diminished viral replication similar to that induced by the own neuropeptides.",

As shown in (Figure 4(B) ), implying that VIP and PACAP may offer a critical protection to inflamed lungs affected by SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because proinflammatory cytokines may favor SARS-CoV-2 replication, which, in turn, can amplify the cellular synthesis of these mediators, these findings may support our assumption that VIP and PACAP offer tissue protection by inhibiting virus replication and regulating the boost of cytokine production.",

We found that activation of CREB was diminished in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes ( Figure 5(B) ), a result coherent with NF-kB activation in the same cells. Consistent with this finding, VIP and PACAP promoted CREB activation (as measured by increase of CREB phosphorylation) in those infected monocytes, a result matching the inhibition of NF-kB and the reduction of cellular production of proinflammatory cytokines. We also evaluated in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes the expression of the active form of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, transcription factors that also interact with CBP/p300 54 and are crucial for the replication of several viruses, including coronaviruses [55] [56] [57] .",

            "text": "In this work, we identified that the plasma levels of the neuropeptide VIP are elevated in patients with severe forms of COVID-19, to express only VPAC1 43 . However, lung tissues, while reported to express high levels of VPAC1, also express VPAC2 and PAC1 44, 46 , and, more specifically, VPAC2 mRNA was detected in airway epithelial, glandular, and immune cells of the lung 45 . Therefore, while the inhibition curve of SARS-CoV-2 by VIP and PACAP in Calu-3 cells points to different optimal doses than those obtained for monocytes, it is possible that in normal lung cells and tissue, VIP and PACAP could present a broader range of action in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, VIP and specific agonists for VPAC1 or VPAC2 have been proposed and tested for respiratory conditions, such as asthma [77] [78] [79] , pulmonary arterial hypertension 77, 80, 81 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 77, 78, 82 , demonstrating that the anti-inflammatory actions of VIP and PACAP can be achieved in lung tissues. Future studies should define which of these receptors would preferentially be activated by specific agonists to restrain SARS-CoV-2 replication in lungs or other sites. Also, as G protein-coupled receptors ligands, it is expected that VIP and PACAP curve profiles be subject to variation due receptor density in cell membrane, receptor isoforms, and subtypes of associated G proteins. Those factors can influence the threshold and outcome of activation, and have been described for a variety of G protein-coupled receptors, including VIP/PACAP receptors [83] [84] [85] . Together with the possible differences of receptor expression and self-regulatory characteristics of GPCRs, a third regulation level of VIP and PACAP action on pulmonary cells can be achieved by the activity of proteases and peptidases, as lungs are described to express high levels of several of them in both normal and pathologic conditions [86] [87] [88] . Some of these peptidases could target VIP and PACAP, thus altering the ligand/receptor ratio and modulating the signaling pathways.",

Inhibition of NF-kB and SREBP in monocytes reduces SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, production of proinflammatory mediators, and protects the cells from virus-mediated cytopathic effects. To directly connect these latter findings with viral replication and production of proinflammatory mediators, we treated SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes with pharmacologic inhibitors of NF-kB (Bay 11-7082) or SREBP (AM580) 55,59 , together or not with VIP and PACAP. We found that the sole inhibition of SREBP decreased viral RNA synthesis and production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, and reduced cell death, measurements that were all amplified when the inhibitors were associated with either neuropeptide (Figures 6(A)-6(D)). Except for viral RNA synthesis, the sole inhibition of NF-kB, or in combination with VIP or PACAP, produced similar results (Figures 6(A)-6(D)). Importantly, the protecting effects mediated by VIP or PACAP alone were identical to those seen when the signaling pathways triggered by NF-kB or SREBP activation were specifically inhibited. Together, our data suggest that the restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication in monocytes and in pulmonary cells by VIP and PACAP can be the outcome of the intrinsic modulation of inflammatory mediators and transcription factors that are involved directly and indirectly with the viral replication. Considering that VIP and PACAP regulate inflammatory reactions, it is possible that their increased circulating amounts reflect a counter-regulatory effect elicited by the dysregulated immune response typical of the more severe clinical status of COVID-19 patients. Since SARS-CoV-2-induced NF-kB and SREBP activation are key events involved in the elevated production of proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 58,60,61 , the inhibition of these transcription factors, associated with the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and with the decrease of viral replication by VIP and PACAP, strengthens the potential of these neuropeptides as possible therapeutical candidates for COVID-19.",

Each dot represents an independent assay with 3 replicates correlating with viral load, associated with reduced inflammation, and that the elevated VIP levels at ICU admission predicted patients' favorable outcome, including association with patient survival. In in vitro SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and epithelial lung cells, the neuropeptides VIP and PACAP, endogenous molecules presenting antiinflammatory properties, reduced the exacerbated synthesis of proinflammatory mediators, coupled with the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our findings support and encourage clinical trials with VIP in COVID-19 patients, which are in progress with intravenous 38 and inhaled39,40 formulations and are expected to be disclosed throughout this year. An initial release of the data, as preprint, shows an increase in survival rates and reduction of IL-6 levels on those who received intravenous Aviptadil (VIP)62 . Our present data may substantiate additional larger trials with VIP, an overlooked molecule associated with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and enhanced survival activities.Both neuropeptides regulate the inflammatory response due to their ability to decrease the production of proinflammatory mediators and to elicit the production of anti-inflammatory molecules. Given that VIP and PACAP and their receptors are systemically distributed, including lungs 22,63 , brain, and gut, we believe that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of both neuropeptides would not be restricted to the respiratory tract, as shown by many studies in other chronic inflammatory illnesses.VIP and PACAP decreased SARS-CoV-2 genome replication in monocytes, while protecting them from virus-induced cytopathicity.By diminishing the intracellular levels of viral RNA and other viral molecules, VIP and PACAP could prevent the cell death by pyroptosis, which has been described as one of the main causes of cell damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection13,14 . VIP and PACAP also diminished the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and MIF by these cells, in agreement with the reported ability of these F I G U R E 7 Graphical summary of study data. In severe COVID-19 patients, VIP plasma levels correlated with decreased inflammatory markers and survival. In in vitro assays with monocytes and lung epithelial cells, VIP and PACAP were found to decrease SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis (monocytes) and viral replication (lung epithelial cells). Both neuropeptides also reduced inflammatory factors and cell death of infected cells. Created with BioRender.com neuropeptides to regulate the inflammatory response[24][25][26][27]64 . Wefound similar results with lung epithelial cells, supporting that VIP and PACAP may offer a critical protection to inflamed lungs affected by SARS-CoV-2 replication. It is possible that the higher amounts of VIP in patients with severe forms of infection may reflect a counterregulatory feedback elicited by the dysregulated immune response of these patients. We detected that the transcription factor CREB, which can act as a negative regulator of NF-kB 65,66 , is down-regulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes, in opposition to NF-kB activation in the same cells, and that VIP and PACAP reversed both phenomenon in infected monocytes. In some models 67-72 , CREB activation is related to induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines concomitant with reduction of proinflammatory molecules and through competition with NF-kB by their shared coactivator protein CBP/p300 51,65,66,72 . CREB activation is also involved with the antiapoptotic response in monocytes and macrophages, during differentiation and inflammatory stimuli 73,74 . The imbalance between CREB and NF-kB, either as a direct effect of infection by SARS-CoV-2 or a consequence of exposure of bystander cells to viral products and inflammatory molecules, could be an important target for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 deleterious effects, at least in monocytes and probably also in lung cells, as a similar imbalance between CREB and NF-kB was observed in an acute inflammatory pulmonary condition 53 . Induction of SREBP activity by SARS-CoV-2 was consistent with data showing its increase and association with COVID-19 severity in patients 60 . SREBP1 regulates the expression of genes of fatty acid biosynthesis, whilst SREBP2 regulates genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, intracellular lipid movement, and lipoprotein import 75 . While crucial for metabolic homeostasis, both transcription factors are involved in pathologies when misbalanced or overactivated 75 , and several viruses are reported to induce their activation, as the up-regulation of host lipid biosynthesis is a requirement for their optimal replication 55-57 . As reported by our group 58 and others authors 59 , SARS-CoV-2 activates SREBP-1 and other pathways of lipid metabolism in human cells, and that lipid droplets enhance viral replication and production of inflammatory mediators. Similar to NF-kB and CREB, the association of SREBPs with CBP/p300 54 makes its function susceptible to the availability of this cofactor, the abundance of which can be low or high depending on the state of activation of NF-kB and CREB. Thus, the modulation of each one of these factors by VIP and PACAP can reflect a fine tuning of the transcriptional regulation of metabolic and inflammatory pathways, which in turn can affect the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Our results with inhibitors of SREBPs and NF-kB, used alone or in combination with either neuropeptide, provide further connection between the ability of VIP and PACAP to regulate the activity of these transcription factors and to control viral replication and production of proinflammatory mediators, as well as to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damages. The decline of viral genome replication and production of inflammatory cytokines secondary to SREBP blockage are in agreement with previous reports showing that this transcription factor is essential for replication of a broad range of viruses, including coronaviruses in Calu-3 cells 55-57,59 and contributes to cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients 60 . The diminished production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in our assays due to NF-kB inhibition agrees with its well-known role to eliciting inflammatory responses. Overall, we believe that the protecting role of VIP and PACAP against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro can be explained, at least in part, by their ability to simultaneously regulate the signaling pathways elicited by these transcription factors. Our findings are summarized in the model presented in Figure 7. Since VIP and PACAP signaling outcome is dependent of the combined action of the receptors activated by them (VIP and PACAP receptors can elicit cell signaling in homo and hetero dimers 76 ), we evaluated whether they were involved in the final outcome analyzed. Our assays suggest that signaling through the receptors VPAC1 and VPAC2 contributed for VIP-and PACAP-mediated reduction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis in monocytes and viral production in Calu-3 cells, with VPAC1 activation alone being able to reproduce the SARS-CoV-2 inhibition promoted by the natural neuropeptides. The inhibition profile of SARS-CoV-2 by VIP and PACAP in Calu-3 cells may be biased regarding the expected action in the lungs, since Calu-3 cells appear",
