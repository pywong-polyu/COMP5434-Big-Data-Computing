            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly emerging coronavirus. This virus poses a great threat to human society and has been marked as the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population. This is following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the 21 st -century. While China has achieved initial success in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and treating those infected with SARS-CoV-2, up to 14% of COVID-19 convalescents can still be detected with virus nucleic acid. Thus, there is an urgent need for more information to understand this new virus. Here we report the detailed clinical characteristics of three cases of COVID-19 convalescents that had repeated positive quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test results for over three months. This may arouse concerns regarding the present quarantine protocol after convalescence and provide a reference for governments to consider when to reopen the community.",

In just three months, it swept the globe, with more than three million confirmed cases and over 210,000 deaths reported 1 . While it is pleasing that over one million patients with COVID-19 have recovered, there is evidence indicating that some recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients who have been discharged subsequently return positive tests and some patients with resolved infection will exhibit prolonged viral detection [2] [3] [4] . This raises concerns regarding the present standard for discharge and quarantine time for these convalescents [5] [6] . We found that three patients had repeated positive results in viral nucleic acid tests over more than three months, where the possibility of reinfection was ruled out in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We report these cases below. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Wenzhou Central Hospital, and the requirement of informed consent was waived. 4 ",

The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity 14 , host status, and virologic factors 15 . These three patients had 11 positive qRT-PCR results for over three months, despite the short interval of negative qRT-PCR results during the disease. These cases indicate a greater likelihood of the virus remaining in certain cells to be reactivated, rather than the reoccurrence of infection 15 . This is because the patients retested positive a relatively short time after being released from quarantine. During the short interval of discharge time, they had no contact with anyone displaying respiratory symptoms. The ELISA assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgG and IgM were positive and negative, respectively. This further confirms the absence of a new infection 16 .",

The three cases reported had few respiratory symptoms and no fever. Further, the CT indicated that lung inflammation had significantly subsided or disappeared. For patients of case two and case three, a second peak (around 50-60 days after disease onset) in viral load was detected; the viral loads then slightly decreased but were still relatively high over time. Our findings suggest that, consistent with other studies 2-4 , the present symptom-based strategy which allows for discontinuation of isolation 10 days after symptom onset should not be used to all patients 5 , because at least a small proportion of recovered patients may still be asymptomatic virus carriers and the virus may rebound after shedding 7 . Case two became very anxious and developed severe insomnia, which may have been due to the long-term isolation from relatives and uncertainty relating to the course of the disease 17 . The patient was given psychological counselling and Estazolam tablets at night to improve her sleep. It remains unclear how long it will take for the qRT-PCR test results of these three patients to become negative. At 12 present, the combined Chinese and Western medication regimes proposed in the protocol appeared ineffective at achieving persistent viral clearance.",
