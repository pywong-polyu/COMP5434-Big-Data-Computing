Mild to moderate cases met the following criteria: fever and respiratory symptoms, CORAD 1-5 and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 \u226592%) while severe cases met the following criteria: fever and respiratory symptoms, CORAD 4-5 and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 <92%). A free informed consent form was signed by all participants or their corresponding companions. The study was done after approval of the research ethics committee of Faculty of Medicine (Girls), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt with approval number (202106884) and was in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration. Moreover, this study protocol was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov database with identifier ID (NCT05249751). Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, COVID-19 patients with morbid obesity, malignancy, autoimmune diseases and those who received immunomodulators or began COVID-19 treatment protocol.

The second tube was for serum separating in which 4 ml was centrifuged. Serum was divided into four parts.

The second portion was used for the measurement of sodium (Na + ) and potassium (K + ), by electrolyte analyzer (AVL 9180, Roche diagnostics, Germany). The third portion was used for measurement of CRP turbidimetrically (Cobas Integra 400 plus, Roche diagnostics, Germany). The fourth portion of serum was used for measurement of copeptin levels using its commercially available ELISA technique-based kits supplied by Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc, USA (Stat Fax R 2100 Microplate Reader, Awareness Technology, USA).

Third, the activation of the vasopressinergic system with subsequent increase in copeptin level is not exclusive or specific to COVID-19 cases only; however, the cut-off values and the pattern of increase could be promising for risk stratification.
