BCoV belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviruses and subfamily Coronavirinae within the genus Betacoronavirus. BCoV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded nonsegmented positive-sense RNA genome with five structural proteins: (S) spike glycoprotein, (M) membrane protein, (HE) hemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein, (E) small membrane protein and (N) nucleocapsid phosphoprotein [9] . The S glycoprotein is composed of two subunits: S1 and S2. Upon viral uptake, S1 binds the receptor on target cells while the S2 domain facilitates the fusion of viral and host membranes, which allow the viral genome to enter the host cell [10] . BCoV infection is initiated by HE and S protein attachment to target tissues and both are important for BCoV pathogenesis [11] [12] [13] . The hypervariable region of the S protein is used to determine the genetic variability and evolution of BCoV viruses, and S protein sequence alignments are important in evaluating novel variants of BCoV strains [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

Among these positive samples, 87 showed severe symptoms of WD (around 10% of total samples). Following RT-qPCR, we selected 13 positive samples with Ct values ranging from 14.75 to 25.3, and further analyzed them (Table 1) . These 13 samples represent 13 WD-diseased animals and were obtained from 12 large dairy farms in Israel (Table 1) . Most of these animals were in the first and second lactation (Table 1) and showed distinct clinical signs of WD including fever, anorexia followed by hemorrhagic diarrhea, dehydration and subsequently, a significant drop in milk production (Table 1) . Although WD is characterized by low mortality, its high morbidity rates usually lead to a substantial reduction in animal health and significant economic losses [24] . Most of the WD cases diagnosed in local farms were sporadic cases in adult cows (Table 1) . However, two farms were affected the most, and BCoV outbreaks were observed in these farms (Table 1 , farm #1 and #8). In farm #1, 57/700 (8%) adult dairy cows were diagnosed with WD clinical signs and in farm #8, 150/300 (50%) were affected with WD and eventually two animals died in this farm (Table 1) . Overall, a 30% drop in milk production was reported in diseased cows in both farms.",

Three days post-infection, a cytopathic effect (CPE) was visible and characterized by the appearance of several dense clusters of enlarged and rounded cells (Figure 1, white arrows) . We further verified BCoV replication in these cells by infecting HRT-18G with ISR2182 and performed RT-qPCR for BCoV RNA detection at different time points (0, 7, 24 and 44 h) ( Figure 1B ). Viral replication results indicate efficient viral replication, emphasized by the decrease in Ct values over the course of the experiment, shifting from Ct 29.45 at T0 to Ct 14.5 in T44 ( Figure 1B) . To support our RT-qPCR data, we performed immunofluorescence, targeting BCoV antigen replicating in HRT-18G cells ( Figure 1C ). To this end, we infected HRT-18G with isolate ISR2182 grown for 48 h and then analyzed viral replication and infectivity by immunofluorescence ( Figure 1C ). Our results show efficient replication and spreading of isolate ISR2182 compared to uninfected cells ( Figure 1C ). ",

For instance, isolates ISR2182 and ISR2348 clustered together as a distinct variant, while ISR1255 and ISR2382 belong to a different variant (Figure 2A) . We next performed deduced amino acid sequence alignments of the S1 region of local isolates with the Mebus reference strain ( Figure 2B ). These alignments resulted in 56 amino acid sites that differ from Mebus ( Figure 2B ).

Interestingly, several amino acid changes found were common to all local isolates (e.g., positions 151-179, Figure 2B ), while some strains showed polymorphism in amino acid sites that differed from other local strains ( Figure 2B ).

Next, we performed phylogenetic analysis of the HE gene (Figure 3) . To this end, we sequenced the complete HE gene of local strains. Amplified sequences were used in alignment with selected HE sequences of reference strains ( Figure 3A ). Nucleotide analysis of the full HE gene revealed that local isolates cluster in a different branch from the reference strain Mebus, which is similar to and supports the S1 analysis ( Figure 3A ). Local isolates are closely related to HE of European strains (EF445643 and KX982264, Figure 3 ). Amino acid analysis of local strains compare to Mebus revealed overall 22 sites of amino acid substitutions, and some of them are similar in several strains ( Figure 3B) . Additionally, consistent with S1 analysis, HE amino acid analysis supports the existence of several genetic variants ( Figure 3B ).

BCoV infection is usually identified by the appearance of hemorrhagic diarrhea and decrease in milk production of diseased cattle [6, 9] , which overall leads to significant economic losses. During 2017-2021, we detected several cases of WD in dairy farms in Israel. Some of the cases represent sporadic infections while others were part of BCoV outbreaks (Table 1) . Although BCoV infections occurred in local farms, little is known about local BCoV enteric strains. Therefore, we aimed to detect, isolate and characterize local BCoV strains causing WD in Israel. To this end, we collected feces from 12 large dairy farms from different geographical areas in Israel; all samples showed distinct WD clinical signs and were found to be positive for BCoV by RT-qPCR (Table 1 ). Initial isolation of selected local strains on HRT-18G resulted in efficient replication, spreading of BCoV and finally induced significant changes in the monolayer, characterized by the presence of enlarged and dense cell clusters, which is in agreement with previous reports describing CPE induced by BCoV (Figure 1, [25] ).",

            "text": "In Israel, the current strategy in preventing BCoV infection includes a recommendation to vaccinate adult cattle with commercial vaccines, which contain the enteric reference strain Mebus. However, several reports showed that current BCoV strains are genetically distant from the reference strain Mebus [14, 22] . Additionally, reoccurrence of BCoV infections in vaccinated cattle in local farms was reported (Table 1) . Therefore, we aimed to initially identify local BCoV variants and determine their genetic distance from selected reference strains (Figures 2 and 3) . To this end, we performed molecular analysis of the S1 hypervariable region and HE gene of local BCoV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 domain and HE gene revealed that local BCoV variants are distinct from the reference strain Mebus and clustered together with other BCoV circulating in the Middle East and Europe (Figures 2 and 3 ). In addition, we found that local isolates belong to different variants regardless of geographical distributions, suggesting the movement of animals between farms in Israel (ISR1255 and ISR2382, Figure 2A ). Overall, this data is consistent with several reports describing the genetic distance between Mebus and current BCoV strains [14, 26] . Moreover, when compared to the Mebus strain, amino acid analysis of S1 from local isolates showed significant changes in numerous positions in Spike NTD and Spike RBD domains ( Figure 2B ). Some of the amino acid substitution positions found in local isolates were already reported in novel variants [14] . Interestingly, we found that in our analysis 26/56 sites were consistent with substitutions already published in variants that differ from Mebus. The additional variations in S1 were also clustered in the same major regions (amino acid 33-257 and 458-571). Overall, this suggests that these regions are subjected to selective pressure and might affect viral-host interactions. Yet, the effect of amino acid variations, found in local strains, on viral virulence and host response, and in particular, their effect on the protective immunity of adult cattle, needs to be tested by future studies. Although HE of BCoV is considered as a secondary receptor, its important role in the identification of novel emergence strains was recently published [27] . HE amino acid sequence analysis of local strains compared to Mebus revealed 22 amino acid substitutions ( Figure 3B ). None of these changes were common to all local strains; still, variations in HE amino acids of local strains support the results from S1 amino acid and nucleotides analysis, showing that several genetic variants are circulating in Israeli dairy farms.
