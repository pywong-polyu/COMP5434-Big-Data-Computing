Progress to date has been uneven, with recent estimates that one in three people (33.6%) in Eastern Africa is chronically undernourished [1] . Of 41 countries in which high levels of three forms of malnutrition (i.e., child stunting, anaemia in women of reproductive age and overweight amongst women) coexist, 30 (73%) are in Africa [2] . There is growing interest in the concept of the food system to identify a broad range of entry points to address these nutritional problems [3] . This includes examining the influence of the food environment: the spectrum of external and personal factors that mediate food acquisition and consumption [4, 5] . A food systems approach encompasses system-level drivers of governance and sustainability and also focuses attention on the roles and responsibilities that different actors play in ensuring that food is available, accessible and acceptable to all [6] .",

This process was conducted by two researchers, with consensus reached on the inclusion and exclusion of articles. Our review considers both quantitative and qualitative research findings. All study designs were eligible for inclusion, including case studies, cross-sectional studies and impact evaluations. We included studies published since 2010 in peer-reviewed journals in English.

Similarly, high fish consumption by Tanzanian women [28] and Malawian children [29] in lakeside communities was linked to their easy physical access to fish.

In Tanzanian communities with high levels of poultry-keeping, fish were more commonly eaten than chicken meat or eggs, with income from poultry-keeping used to purchase fish from markets [33] .

Around three quarters of low-income urban households in Nairobi [42] and Lusaka [47] reported taste as the main reason for consuming fish. The latter study reported no significant difference in the influence of taste on fish purchases between households of different wealth strata; however, tilapia was the most common fish for twice as many households in the highest wealth quartile compared to the lowest quartile (49% and 22%, respectively). The authors suggested that while a majority of households reported their fish purchases to be driven by taste, this is likely to reflect familiarity and food habits, with poorer households' frequent acquisition of low-cost small fish informing their expressed \"preferences\".",

In Kenya and Tanzania, caregivers of children 6-23 months of age generally associated animal-source foods with positive attributes for children; however, negative perceptions of consuming fish included fears that children might choke on bones [53] . This led some caregivers to completely avoid giving fish to young children, whereas other cares took extra care in separating bones. Elsewhere in Kenya, a small number of caregivers raised concerns that whole small fish were not appropriate for young children due to chewing difficulties, which was a reason for infrequent consumption by children under 12 months of age [37] .",

            "text": "Availability and physical access emerge as key determinants of fish consumption, though often as an inference based on the location of study sites, rather than direct assessment of households' engagement in fishing activities or opportunities for market purchases. This corresponds with several studies' findings that a higher likelihood of children consuming fish is associated with proximity to coastal areas or inland water bodies [62] [63] [64] . Economic access was examined in almost two thirds of included studies. Affordability relative to other animal-source foods and the opportunity for households to purchase small quantities of fresh fish or fish-based products according to their financial means are key advantages of fish, as has been highlighted elsewhere [65] [66] [67] . Despite this, diets containing optimal amounts of fish to meet nutrient requirements were shown to substantially increase the overall cost of diet in populations largely reliant on plant-source foods [41] . Complementary strategies to increase affordability are necessary to ensure that fish contributes to the nutrition and health of more people, particularly those that experience economic and nutritional vulnerability.",

Findings aligned with the \"acceptability\" dimension of the food environment were drawn largely from studies that examined attitudes towards fish, overall or according to species or mode of preparation, rather than broader assessments of the extent to which preferences influence food purchasing decisions.

Temporal variation in fish consumption is likely to accompany changes in both physical access, due to the seasonal nature of catches and fishing restrictions, and economic access, due to fluctuations in market prices and consumers' purchasing power (e.g., amongst smallholder farming households reliant on income from an annual or biannual crop harvest).

Eight studies reported on practices and perceptions relating to fish consumption by children, highlighting fish to be a common food for children when not constrained by physical and economic access. Caregivers generally associated fish with positive attributes for children, although some expressed concerns about the appropriateness of fish for infants.

Identifying differential access to fish between, and within, households is essential to ensure that increases in national fish supply actually translate to nutritional benefits for the most vulnerable. Of recent food environment frameworks, variation in food access between household members is most directly articulated by the Innocenti Framework, which considers intra-household dynamics, eating patterns and the role of caregivers as mediators of children's and adolescents' diets [84] .

            "text": "This scoping study identifies several priorities for future research: (1) capturing temporal variation in fish acquisition and consumption, which is likely to accompany annual seasonal changes, as well as economic, environmental or political shocks that affect availability and affordability; (2) evaluating how expansion of export and urban markets and interregional trade affect fish access in lakeside and more distant communities; and (3) developing interventions, including supply increases, value chain developments or behaviour change strategies, that respond to the identified constraints of cost, availability, convenience and perceptions about quality and suitability for children. Integrated food systems research and development, with a focus on addressing constraints in rural and urban food environments, offers the potential to translate increased fish supply into improved dietary intake and nutritional status of people in the AGLR.",
