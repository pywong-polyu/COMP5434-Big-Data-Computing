            "text": "A mathematical model has always been an important tool in the study of infectious diseases; there are many works about epidemic such as SIS, SIR, SEIR, and so on. In recent years, research on infectious diseases has been developing, and some good results have been achieved. Elaiw and Agha considered the delayed partial differential equation model to analyze Oncolytic virotherapy based on previous work about ODE [1] . In [2, 3] , they all applied different models to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 and some useful suggestions were put forward. There are many other papers about epidemic model, such as [4] [5] [6] . All of these works show that it is an effective method to analyze infectious diseases using the infectious disease model. However, in real life, some infectious diseases may be transmitted vertically from one person to another; that is, the offspring of infected parents may be infected with infectious diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis at birth, called vertical transmission [7] , so how to effectively prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases has become an important topic in epidemiology, on the current research shows that vaccination has become an important and commonly used strategy to eliminate infectious diseases, it can effectively reduce the infection of infectious diseases [8] [9] [10] . Based on the SIR epidemic model with vaccination and vertical transmission model proposed by Meng and Chen [11] , we establish the following model, and a framework diagram of the disease model is shown in In the above model, S(t), I(t), and R(t) denote the number of susceptible, infective, recovered individuals at time t, respectively. We suppose that b and b are the birth rate coefficients of the non-infected person (S + R) and infected person; I, d, and d are their corresponding death coefficients, respectively. The infection rate of the disease is \u03b2; the susceptible person is an infected as infected person at a bilinear rate of \u03b2I(t), and the infection recovery rate is \u03b3 . The proportion of the offspring of infectious parents who are susceptible is p; the proportion of the offspring of infectious parents who are infected is q, 0 < p < 1, 0 < q < 1 and p + q = 1. m (0 < m < 1) is the proportion of the successfully vaccinated population to the entire susceptible population.",

To model the disease transmission process, several authors improved the following bilinear incidence rate \u03b2SI to get a more suitable infection rate, where \u03b2 is a positive constant [20] . However, there are many forms of nonlinear incidence rates for a more generalized form. The incidence rate \u03b2SI/(1 + \u03b1 1 S + \u03b1 2 I + \u03b1 3 SI) was introduced by Hattaf et al. [21] and used in [22] ; it is a general form, which represents mutual interference between S and I, \u03b2I and measures the infectivity of the disease when it enters a fully susceptible population. 1/(1 + \u03b1 1 S + \u03b1 2 I + \u03b1 3 SI) measures the inhibition effect from the behavioral change of the susceptible population and the infected population when their number increases or from the crowding effect of the infected individuals, that is, due to the information of the disease. The infected or susceptible population will cause behavioral changes and inhibitory effects; therefore, it is more interesting and valuable than bilinear incidence rate. It has been widely applied in epidemiological studies. When \u03b1 1 = \u03b1 3 = 0, then we have the saturated incidence rate \u03b2SI/(1 + \u03b1 2 I) [23] , which was used in [24] [25] [26] ; when \u03b1 3 = 0, we get the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response \u03b2SI/(1 + \u03b1 1 S + \u03b1 2 I) [27] , which was used in [28, 29] ; when \u03b1 3 = \u03b1 1 \u03b1 2 , we get the Crowley-Martin functional response \u03b2SI/(1 + \u03b1 1 S + \u03b1 2 I + \u03b1 1 \u03b1 2 SI) [30] . \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , and \u03b1 3 are used to measure the inhibitory effect on infectious diseases when crowding effect or behavioral changes caused by the increase of susceptible individuals occur, and the infection coefficient can be effectively reduced by reasonably selecting appropriate parameters.",

In addition, we consider a specific functional response incidence rate. In this model, firstly, we have proved the global existence, positivity, and boundedness of the solution. In addition, we have shown that the disease fades when the white noise is large enough such that \u03c3 2 > \u03b2 2 2(pb+\u03b3 ) . Moreover, when the noise is small, i.e., \u03c3 2 \u2264 \u03b2(b+\u03b1 1 b+m(1-e -b\u03c9 )) b , the extinction of the disease can be determined by the value of R s 0 ; if R s 0 < 1, the disease fades. The persistence of the disease is determined by R s 0 , i.e., if R s 0 > 1, the disease persists. Finally, we have simulated our theoretical result and have also found that when the white noise is small, the stochastic system is similar to the deterministic system, but when the white noise is large enough, the stochastic system will appear to be a different phenomenon. Large white noise can suppress the spread of disease. And the higher the p value, the higher the proportion of susceptible newborns and the fewer patients with vertical transmission. With the development of modern medical treatment, there will be more medical measures to block the vertical transmission of infectious diseases. In addition, the increase in vaccination rate m and time delay \u03c9 have some influence on the development progress of the disease, they can effectively suppress the occurrence of the disease under the right circumstances.",
