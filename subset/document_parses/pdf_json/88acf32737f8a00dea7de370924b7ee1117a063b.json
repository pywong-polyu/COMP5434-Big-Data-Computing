Little has been published toward validation of quantitative adaptability models. This paper proposes a scoring system for evaluating the design-based adaptability of college campus buildings. This system was created to be a tool to guide future designs. Different physical features (i.e., floor-to-floor height and structural span lengths) of the buildings are considered in the scores. Adaptability scores are calculated for four buildings on Clemson University's campus. Scores are compared to those from an earlier study of the same buildings; the earlier study quantified adaptability by surveying experts through an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Both approaches rank the subject buildings in the same order with respect to adaptability. Additionally, scores from both approaches are linearly correlated. These encouraging results suggest that the proposed scoring system is a starting point for quantifying the adaptability of college campus buildings.",

Similar definitions are presented in books by Schmidt and Austin [2] and Cowee and Schwehr [3] . Physical, economic, functional, technological, social, legal and political factors all impact a building's adaptability [4] . Physical factors that impact adaptability include a building's age and state of repair, as well as the features of its design. The portion of adaptability based on design features has been described as Design-Based Adaptability (DBA) [5] . While DBA is only one contributor to overall adaptability, it is critical because it is the only portion that can be directly impacted (intentionally or otherwise) by design decisions. This paper proposed a quantitative model for scoring DBA of college campus buildings. The model is intended as the first step toward a tool for architects and engineers who are seeking to design more adaptable buildings.",

Scores are then multiplied by weighting values based on the scale and importance of the parameters, and then products are summed to determine an overall score.

Plan depth is related to the proximity of interior spaces to exterior walls. In the context of adaptability, access to exterior walls is desirable because many potential building functions, particularly those on college campuses, benefit from exterior windows.

Standard 7 from the American Society of Civil Engineers [22] lists uniform design live loads between 20 and 300 psf (1-14 kN/m 2 ) for different occupancies. Live loads for most college campus occupancies fall between 20 and 100 psf, and these values form the first segment of the adaptability scale for live loads shown in Fig. 6 .5. Live loads over 100 psf have increasing adaptability scores, but with diminishing returns (lower slope on figure) because design loads over 100 psf are only needed for special conditions such as data centers and libraries. Different design live loads are typically applied across different portions of a building. In these situations, the weighted average design live load is used to determine the adaptability score. For example, the majority of areas in the Stadium Suites building is designed for 40 psf. Common rooms and corridors have higher design loads. The weighted average is 47.5 psf; therefore, the design live load adaptability score is 3.8. Plan depth. The percentage of a floor plate area that is within 12' (3.7 m) of an exterior wall is an indicator of the plan depth strategy. A relatively skinny building has low plan depth and high percentage of area close to exterior walls. A \"big box\" store is an example of a building with high plan depth and a corresponding low percentage of space near exterior walls. While interior spaces in \"big box\" buildings can be adapted for a variety of uses, experts from the Becker et al. [14] study preferred shallower plans. This is because shallow plans provide greater proximity to exterior walls and windows which is desirable for many college campus occupancies. Shallow plan depths facilitate more occupancies making them more adaptable.",

Stacking floor plates are also related to the simple DBA strategy; stacking floor plates are indicators of simple structures and details.

The system considers eight different physical parameters, such as floor-to-floor height and design live load, which can be readily measured. Adaptability scores for the individual parameter scores are aggregated to determine a building's overall adaptability score. The system is intended as an aid for designing new buildings for adaptability and also for evaluating adaptability of existing buildings. Four case study buildings from the Clemson University campus were used to evaluate the proposed scoring system. DBA of these same buildings has previously been quantitatively determined by Becker et al. [14] using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Results from the proposed scoring system and the earlier AHP study are in good agreement (R 2 = 0.84). While these results are encouraging, more research on a larger, more diverse group of buildings is recommended to further develop and validate the proposed system. Traditional office buildings and multi-family residential buildings could be a starting point for a new group to test.",

If structural spacing varies throughout the building, then the average spacing should be used.Floor-to-floor height. Adaptability score for floor-to-floor height is defined byFig. 6.4. This parameter is related to the open DBA strategy. The scale begins at 9 ft (3 m) for a floor-to-floor height. Values below this height are impractical and deemed to restrict adaptability. Increasing floor-to-floor height between 9 and 15 ft improves adaptability; this is represented by the relatively steep slope between these heights. A floor-to-floor height of 15 ft (4.5 m) is considered ample for most campus occupancies. Adaptability scores increase more gradually for floor-to-floor heights between 15 and 30 ft. The score reaches the maximum value of 10 for a floor-to-floor height of 30 ft. At this value, the story could be split into two well-heighted floors.",
