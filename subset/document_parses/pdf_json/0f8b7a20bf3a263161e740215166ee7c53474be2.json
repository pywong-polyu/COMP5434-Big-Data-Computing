Media play a critical role during pandemics by affecting values, opinions, public knowledge about stigmatized groups. When media ignore and stereotypically represent a social group, the social value of the group decreases, and their problems are trivialized.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease started as an epidemic limited to China in December 2019 and spread across the countries accompanied by a rapid rise in number of cases and deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in January 2020 and announced a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1] . Calling on all countries to combat the spread of the disease, the WHO aimed at taking measures against severe negative impacts of the pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on March 11, 2020 in Turkey. It was later than all its neighbor countries except Syria ( [2] p2). 1 Considering that Syrian refugees in Turkey hold \"temporary protection\" status since 2014, not granting full citizenship rights, permanent residency, regular employment and even claiming to refugee status led to precarious situation. 2 The restrictive framework of temporary protection makes them more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation ( [5] p317-8). 3 The pre-existing inequalities and impoverishment of Syrian refugees have exacerbated by the pandemic. Pandemics are out of the ordinary periods marked by high levels of uncertainty and risk, people with high perception of risk for infection tend to blame sociological outgroups for the outbreak of the disease to overcome fear when diseases are lethal. Disadvantaged groups including immigrants, ethnic, racial, religious, and sexual minorities are stigmatized as disease vectors who pose threat to health and security of the society ( [8] p462). This can lead to increasing stigmatization, scapegoating, and discrimination ( [9] p246-7). Stigmatization includes labeling, stereotyping, status loss and discrimination which co-occur in the power context ( [10] p367). First, human differences are labeled, second labeled person is stereotypically characterized, third status loss and discrimination occur at the last stage. Being refugee is a stigma by itself, which leads to discrimination in many aspects of life [11] . Refugees are more vulnerable to stigma, hate speech and discrimination during the pandemics [12] [13] [14] .",

People belonging to certain ethnic groups and minorities have been stigmatized for spreading the virus during the COVID-19. Stigmatization, disinformation, misinformation, and hate speech fuel the spread of the virus and discriminatory speech, which can result in discrimination against certain groups in terms of COVID-19 issues [16] . News coverage activates public knowledge and public perception is influenced more when public relies on news for public affairs information those beyond the understanding of personal experience. ( [17, 18] p17). Media representations influence values, norms, beliefs, opinions by selecting some aspects of a perceived reality and making them more salient ( [19] p52-3). Valued cultural groups are frequently represented in the media but unvalued groups such as refugees or outgroups have been historically marginalized, trivialized, humiliated, and underrepresented in the mainstream media. When certain groups are ignored and stereotypically represented in the media, they are symbolically annihilated. Early researchers introduced this concept in the 1970s, and it has been used in many studies. In recent history, several disadvantaged and historically marginalized groups have been symbolically annihilated by the media [20] . In such cases, social value of those groups declines, they are excluded from the media, and their problems are trivialized. \"Near-total absence\" gives an implicit message about the members of social groups who are excluded from the media [21] . This causes lack of knowledge about underrepresented groups since peculiarities, and implied cultural value of the minority groups are learnt through media consumption. Since media exposure affects beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, when a social group is ignored in the media, public assumes that the group is nonexistent, insignificant, or worthless [22] .",

Media framing of the COVID-19 pandemic on the leading 1 On March 22, Syrian officials announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19. 2 According to the 1951 Refugee Convention, a refugee is someone \"owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.\" The 1951 Convention had geographic and temporal limitations. Only persons fleeing events occurring before 1 January 1951 within Europe were considered refugee within this limitation. The 1967 Protocol removed the limitations. However, the Republic of Turkey holds the geographical limitation to the 1951 Refugee Convention. Syrians are not provided refugee status in Turkey. Turkey adopted EU-inspired Law on Foreigners and International Protection (LFIP), which is a legal framework for asylum in Turkey in April 2013. It established Turkey's obligations towards all persons in need of international protection, regardless of country of origin. Turkey adopted Temporary Protection Regulation for on October 22, 2014 . Syrian nationals, stateless persons, and refugees from Syria are under temporary protection and they cannot be sent back to Syria according to this regulation with the rights. In this study, Syrians are called as refugee in terms of sociological definition. In this respect, people who flee political violence including threat for persecution are considered refugee regardless of legal framework of countries. For further information on definition of refugee, see [3] [4] .

Media coverages affect social representations of emerging infectious diseases by producing information during pandemics/epidemics. When Ebola (the first outbreak of the Ebola epidemic was in Ebola River in Democratic Congo Republic in 1976) spread across other parts of Africa, it received widespread media coverage in the British press in the mid-1990s. Especially in the British tabloids, Ebola was depicted as intrinsically African and spread partly by African traditions of close contact with monkeys as well as eating them ( [25] p966). The SARS epidemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome, which occurred in Hong Kong, took media attention in the spring of 2003. News stories on SARS pervasively covered the themes of difference between the West and the East through othering Chinese authorities and Chinese people's dirt, unhygienic lifestyles in the British press ([26] p2568). When the H1N1 influenza emerged in Mexico in June 2009, the WHO declared a pandemic. However, media stories which pointed out that the outbreak supposedly started in Mexican pig farms played a role in the denunciation of Mexicans and Latinos as usual suspects in the US in 2009 ( [27] p1), while also exonerating the dominance of white Americans.",

National press dramatized problems of refugees such as health problems, deaths, and impoverishment more than local press. Only 11.3% of news stories in 2017 and 2018 covered education, healthcare, and housing issues of Syrian refugees ( [41] p33). Syrian refugees were depicted as a burden on Turkish public services, claiming that Syrians had priority over Turks in health access, business ownership and other governmental resources ( [42] p383). Newspaper articles expanded otherization of Syrian refugees in the society ( [43] p46). Syrian refugees were the most targeted group of hate speech in the Turkish press in 2019 [44] . Online hate speech against Syrian refugees was associated with political and economic problems, division in terms of Islam and secularism, hate against government policies. Online hate speech posed a more severe threat against Syrian refugees more than traditional media. Online hate speech reproduced pre-existing otherization of Syrian refugees and spread the discourse of discrimination. This affected very much ordinary individuals compared to other individuals with extreme beliefs. ( [45] p147-8, p153).

Following all member states could not reach a solution of receiving refugees fairly within the EU borders, cooperation with the origin and transit countries came to the fore. Since the EU needed an urgent solution to stop refugees crossing the borders, the EU regarded Turkey as a potential partner ( [52] p2-3). The EU and Turkey agreed on Joint Action Plan in October 2015 cooperating on preventing undocumented migration to the EU borders [53] . Following the Joint Action Plan, the EU-Turkey Statement of November 2015 was agreed on and according to the Statement, the EU committed an initial 3 billion euros to Turkey to be spent for improving the socio-economic situation of the Syrians under temporary protection. Through 'structured and more frequent high-level dialogue' between the EU and Turkey, the EU pledged to accelerate visa liberalization once the requirements of the Roadmap are met. In return to concessions of visa-free travel for Turkish citizens in the Schengen zone, re-energizing accession negotiations of Turkey's membership to the EU and opening of the new chapters, Turkey committed to prevent undocumented migration flows to the EU [54] .",

Turkey would take any necessary measures to prevent new undocumented migration and resettlement process of Syrians would be ensured according to the Statement. As of 20 March 2016, Turkey would readmit all new undocumented migrants crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands [55] . Since the EU needed Turkey to keep Syrians out of the EU borders and Erdogan threatened the EU to open the doors to Greece and Bulgaria in February 2016, the EU had to expand the concessions of Turkey [56] . Recognizing and treating Turkey as a safe country of return were among these concessions, which lead to ignoring human right violations and authoritarian crackdowns ( [57] p328). Weaponizing Syrian refugees by using them as a tool to extract concessions from the EU helped Erdogan to be less subject to the EU's scrutiny and criticism ( [58] p178). Empowering the Erdogan regime has undermined Turkish democracy ([59] p207) and press freedom. International refugee law has been breached by Greece, the EU and Turkey in many aspects according to the expert [60] . Erdogan threatened to open the borders to send back Syrian refugees, and when he opened the northern border with Greece in spring 2020, asylum seekers were subject to violations of human rights on both sides of the border. At least one Syrian lost his life, while trying to enter Greece. Although illegal and violent pushback took place, the EU has not taken any action to protect international law in terms of protecting human rights and stopping pushbacks at the borders. The EU aimed at preventing enters of asylum seekers to its borders by providing \"cooperation packages\" with third states and amended the New Pact on Migration and Asylum in September 2020. It has been considered a further step in reducing access to asylum in the EU and increasing deportations from EU territory [61] .",

Although some health measurements were taken in 178 Migrant Health Centers in 29 provinces of Turkey ([68] p9-10), according to the report of Refugee Support Association, Syrian refugees were reluctant to go to health centers due to problems of social integration, mainly such as language barrier, worries, and lack of information. It was revealed that even employed Syrian refugees were reluctant to go to hospitals due to fear of being deported, eviction or dismissal, in case of testing positive. According to the survey, 52% of Syrian refugees did not have sufficient information on updates on access to healthcare, such as hospital appointments, medicines, and renewal of health reports.

'Portrayal as a source of problem' category includes negative depictions of Syrian refugees such as carriers of the disease, threat to Turkish population, burden on national economy. 'Socio-economic issues and/or the smuggling of refugees' category includes issues such as poverty, employment, education. The support Syrian refugees receive is mentioned in few of these news stories. In this category, the smuggling of refugees involves facilitation of Syrian refugees' illegal entry into European states. 'Acclaim for Turkey's policies and/or criticism of the EU, the West & opposition parties' category includes statements of government officials, power and success of Turkey in dealing with refugees, disapproval of the EU and mostly Greece. This category includes both acclaim for government and the criticism of the European countries and opposition parties because these topics were mostly covered in the same news story.

Lack of representation of Syrian refugees and ignoring vulnerabilities of them perpetuated the dominance of official viewpoints and political actors during the pandemic. Syrian refugees faced greater socioeconomic problems, issues in healthcare, discrimination, and attacks; but ignoring the plight of the refugees caused reinforcement of already existing inequalities. Contrary to some news stories; other news stories, surveys, and research reports revealed lack of hygiene measures and facemask shortage. Impoverishment and rise in discrimination against Syrian refugees were also some issues exposed in those studies. Media representations affect world views and when a particular group is valued, the group is more visible in the media. Other groups and the whole society can find out more about their implied attributes and implied value of this group by media consumption [22] . Underrepresentation of Syrian refugees in Turkish news media demonstrated their low value in society. Moreover, epidemics reveal the valued social groups and increase stigma against disadvantaged groups such as racial minorities or refugees. Stigma reduces health-seeking, help-seeking, and treatment-seeking acts [74] . The findings in this research corroborates stigmatization of disadvantaged groups during pandemics. Media representations can partly determine public opinion and change attitudes towards certain groups. Regarding this, rise in intolerance for Syrian refugees and backlash in Turkish society can be associated with less coverage of the plight of Syrian refugees as they have been stigmatized as economic burden to the welfare system of Turkey. Moreover, regarding widespread negative attitudes against Syrian refugees in the urban population as one of the most prominent reason for Justice and Development Party's historic loss in local elections in 2019, should be taken into consideration. Symbolic annihilation of Syrian refugees during the pandemic has served the authoritarian regime by obscuring the plight of Syrian refugees. In authoritarian regimes, stigmatized groups like refugees may be more at risk of suffering from not only political or legal problems, but also from access to healthcare especially during the pandemics.",
