            "text": "Senecavirus A (SVA) is a cause of vesicular disease in pigs, and infection rates are rising within the swine industry. Recently, anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1) was revealed as the receptor for SVA in human cells. Herein, the role of ANTXR1 as a receptor for SVA in pigs was investigated by CRISPR/ Cas9 genome editing. Strikingly, ANTXR1 knockout (KO) pigs exhibited features consistent with the rare disease, GAPO syndrome, in humans. Fibroblasts from wild type (WT) pigs supported replication of SVA; whereas, fibroblasts from KO pigs were resistant to infection. During an SVA challenge, clinical symptoms, including vesicular lesions, and circulating viremia were present in infected WT pigs but were absent in KO pigs. Additional ANTXR1-edited piglets were generated that were homozygous for an in-frame (IF) mutation. While IF pigs presented a GAPO phenotype similar to the KO pigs, fibroblasts showed mild infection, and circulating SVA nucleic acid was decreased in IF compared to WT pigs. Thus, this new ANTXR1 mutation resulted in decreased permissiveness of SVA in pigs. Overall, genetic disruption of ANTXR1 in pigs provides a unique model for GAPO syndrome and prevents circulating SVA infection and clinical symptoms, confirming that ANTXR1 acts as a receptor for the virus.",

The first confirmed case of SVA in the United States was reported in 2010 in Indiana 8 . Between 2014 and 2015, the number of SVA cases in the United States increased from 2 to over 230, demonstrating that SVA is a growing concern for producers 4, 9 . Experimental infection studies confirmed the ability of SVA to cause vesicular lesions 4, 10, 11 ; however, SVA infection can be present in pigs without overt signs of clinical disease. Since vesicular lesions caused by SVA are clinically indistinguishable from lesions caused by FMDV and SVDV, the appearance of IVD results in herd closure followed by a foreign animal disease investigation. Today, the prevalence of SVA on swine farms in the United States is estimated to be 43% in grow-finish pigs and 76% on sow farms 12 . In addition to causing IVD, SVA is associated with increased mortality in neonatal piglets 5, 13, 14 .",

Knockout (KO) of the ANTXR1 gene resulted in the resistance of permissive cell lines; and non-permissive cell lines, such as SCLC H69 and H146, are made permissive for SVA after transfection with a plasmid expressing ANTXR1 cDNA. The porcine ANTXR1 gene encodes a 564 aa protein, anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1), also known as tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8). ANTXR1 binds the protective antigen protein of anthrax toxin; however, anthrax toxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2) has a greater binding affinity for the toxin 16 . The type I surface glycoprotein possesses a single transmembrane domain, and the increased abundance of ANTXR1 in tumors is responsible for permitting SVA replication and its oncolytic activity 17 . Besides binding anthrax toxin and SVA, ANTXR1 also binds type I and VI collagens, mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix 18, 19 . In humans, mutations in ANTXR1 result in a rare disease known as growth retardation, alopecia, pseudoanodontia, and optic atrophy (GAPO) syndrome, as well as a reduced lifespan 20 . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological relevance of ANTXR1 in SVA pathogenesis in its natural host by infecting ANTXR1 KO pigs with a pathogenic field strain of SVA.",

Individual colonies were collected, genotyped, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The KS15-01 virus was originally isolated from a pig nasal swab sample submitted to the Kansas Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory 10 . The virus was propagated on PK-15 cells with Minimal Essential Medium (MEM; ThermoFisher) supplemented with 2% horse serum (Sigma), antibiotics (100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/mL of streptomycin, 0.25 \u00b5g/mL fungizone; ThermoFisher), and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . For titration, the virus was serially diluted 1:10 in quadruplicate on confluent PK-15 cells in a 96-well tissue culture plate (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). After two days, the wells were examined for the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE). The last well showing CPE was used as the titration endpoint, and the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) per mL was calculated by using the method of Reed and Muench 24 . Modification of KS15-01 included the insertion of an EGFP gene fused with a Teschovirus 2A element between SVA genes 2A and 2B of the KS15-01 infectious clone and propagated as described by Chen et al. 10 . The EGFP-expressing virus, KS15-01-EGFP (GenBank accession No. KX349734), was used to infect fibroblast cells from WT and KO pigs. All images were captured at the same exposure. The growth kinetics in culture for the KS15-01 and the EGFP variant are the same 10 .",

Between six and eight days after infection, the WT pigs showed characteristic coronary band lesions on the feet (Fig. S2) 10 . The two KO pigs showed no evidence of vesicular lesions or other disease-associated clinical signs. Virus in sera was measured by using a commercial SVA qRT-PCR assay and by virus isolation of PK-15 cells. All pigs were negative for SVA by qRT-PCR prior to infection (Fig. 3A) . The WT pigs produced a pattern of viremia typical for SVA infection by the KS15-01 isolate 10 . Ct values showed that both WT pigs were productively infected, with peak viremia appearing at three days after infection. Importantly, Day 3 samples from the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ WT pigs were positive for SVA by virus isolation (Fig. 3A) . By the termination of the study, the Ct values for the WT pigs had returned to near background levels. All serum samples from the two KO pigs were negative for detectable amounts of viral nucleic acid (Ct > 40) and were negative by virus isolation. Even though the KO pigs were constantly exposed to virus shed by the two WT pigs, the KO pigs remained negative for detectable amounts of SVA in their sera (Fig. 3A) . Infection of the WT pigs was confirmed by the appearance of SVA-specific total antibody and by virus neutralization in the sera. The WT pigs seroconverted by Day 7 after infection and remained seropositive (Fig. 3B ). KS15-01 neutralizing activity in the WT pigs was detected on Day 3 and continued to increase until the end of the study (Fig. 3C ).

All samples from the KO pigs were negative for neutralizing activity (titer < 8).",

As such, it was not known if the homozygous IF piglets were resistant to SVA and were therefore subjected to in vitro and in vivo SVA challenges.

The IF cells were obtained from piglets 95 and 96 from breeding the founder boar. Cells in the WT cultures exhibited CPE characteristic of SVA infection, including cell rounding and detachment from the monolayer (Fig. 6) .

            "text": "ANTXR1 participates in a variety of seemingly unrelated activities, including the host response to infection with Bacillus anthracis, the regulation of collagen deposition in tissues, and as a receptor for SVA. Moreover, the upregulation of ANTXR1 in tumors makes SVA a convenient therapeutic treatment for the targeted killing of cancer cells. For this study, the biological relevance of porcine ANTXR1 as a receptor for SVA was evaluated by infecting pigs that possessed a deletion and/or insertion of nucleotides in the first exon of the ANTXR1 gene. In addition to DNA sequencing, mutations in ANTXR1 were confirmed by the appearance of anatomical and tissue abnormalities, similar to those found in KO mice and mutations in ANTXR1 associated with the rare disease, known as GAPO syndrome, in humans 20, 25 . In pigs, these changes included frontal bossing, short snouts, postlegged stance, partial anodontia, hair and skin abnormalities, and ophthalmic changes along with alterations in lung, muscle, and nervous system tissues, which become more prominent with age. Histological examination of skeletal muscle did not reveal differences between WT and ANTXR1 KO mice 26 , but skeletal muscle degeneration and edema were observed in KO pigs at several locations. However, the age of the mice was not stated, which could influence the extent of degeneration. Importantly, cardiac muscle fibrosis and degeneration was present in numerous areas of the heart section from the KO pig and may contribute to the reduced lifespan of patients with GAPO syndrome 20 . One unique anatomical feature observed in this study was the appearance of cataracts in the eyes of KO and IF pigs, a phenotype that has so far only been reported in GAPO patients 27 . A mechanistic link between cataracts and ANTXR1 is not known. Thus, the ANTXR1-edited pigs provide a useful model for investigating GAPO syndrome in humans as the pigs more closely recapitulate the disease phenotype. Senecavirus A continues to be an issue for swine producers as vectors, including mice and flies, are involved in the transmission of the virus within and between farms 4 , and SVA has been shown to be stable in several The founder boar who was used for breeding was mosaic for edits in ANTXR1 with two knockout alleles and one in-frame (IF) allele ( Figure S3) , and he exhibited a strong GAPO phenotype. After breeding to propagate his alleles, only the IF mutation was detected in progeny, and piglets were produced that were homozygous for this mutation. As shown, these piglets exhibited (B) frontal bossing and shorter snouts and (C) a post-legged stance as compared to WT piglets from the same litter. (D) Two homozygous IF piglets also had cataracts at birth (black arrow). 30, 31 , and KO Pig 53 did not have clinical symptoms, presence of SVA nucleic acid in the serum or lung, nor produce any SVA-specific antibodies during the challenge. Thus, the negative responses by KO pig 53 to SVA in vivo and the resistance of KO fibroblasts from Pig 52 with a confirmed genotype to SVA infection in vitro were instrumental in verifying that ANTXR1 is the receptor for SVA in pigs. Interestingly, we produced piglets that were homozygous for an in-frame (IF) mutation in the N-terminus that was predicted to alter a region of 13 amino acids immediately proximal to the signal peptide. These piglets also exhibited the GAPO phenotype, indicating that these amino acid changes may be sufficient to disrupt interactions with extracellular matrix molecules, or that the levels of ANTXR1 on the cell surface were reduced due to aberrant cleavage of the signal peptide. When cells from the IF piglets were challenged with SVA-EGFP, only a few became round and exhibited fluorescence, pointing to a decreased level of infection. After nasal inoculation with SVA, the IF piglets did have detectable but lower levels of circulating SVA nucleic acid by the end of the challenge, consistent with the in vitro results. While the regions of ANTXR1 responsible for binding collagen have not yet been mapped, studies have shown that 16 amino acids of ANTXR1 directly interact with SVA 32 . Therefore, it is possible that mutation of some of these key amino acids could block SVA without disrupting collagen binding. Furthermore, N-linked glycosylation of specific ANTXR1 residues has recently been shown to be critical for SVA entry into human cells 33 , thus revealing new targets for potentially blocking SVA infection without interfering with the normal physiological function of ANTXR1.",

This supports the results of Miles et al. who demonstrated that cells possessing a KO of ANTXR1 are resistant to infection with SVV-001 15 . Similar results were obtained for the ANTXR1 KO pigs after infection with SVA. The design of the animal infection experiments included housing KO and WT pigs in the same pen, which allowed for constant exposure of the KO pigs to virus shed by the infected",

Even though the KO pigs showed no evidence of circulating virus or disease, SVA qRT-PCRpositive results were obtained for feces, nasal swabs, tonsil, and lung samples from the KO pigs, and KO Pig 52 seroconverted on Day 10. Detection of SVA nucleic acid in fecal and nasal swabs of the KO pigs may have been due to contaminating virus shed from the WT pigs. Moreover, because the KO pigs were generated by injection of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into the zygote, unequal editing of the blastomeres may have occurred. This could have resulted in mosaicism that was not detected after genotyping and the potential for the presence of a low number of WT alleles that permitted reduced infection in KO Pig 52. Importantly, previous studies have shown that only one KO pig is required to demonstrate resistance to a virus",
