Their extent and duration vary across countries but mainly include bans on public gathering and travel, closure of public institutions and non-essential businesses, increased home office, and virtual schooling. The wearing of face masks, the maintaining of distance from other people, and hand disinfection in public places are mandatory behavioral measures in many countries. In some regions, total or overnight curfews belong to the measures (Galea et al., 2020; Sohrabi et al., 2020) .",

Furthermore, enhanced levels of stress and anxiety can reduce the adherence to actively participate in the governmental COVID-19 prevention measures, while positive emotions increase the cooperation of the population . Therefore, it is of great importance to investigate factors and mechanisms that can predict the level of burden caused by the COVID-19 crisis. This knowledge is urgent to identify individuals at risk for high burden and to reduce it. Longitudinally, this can protect mental and physical health and foster adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures (Allington et al., 2020; Salari et al., 2020) . While available research often focused on the risk factors such as depression and anxiety symptoms that can enhance the experience of burden (B\u00e4uerle et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2020) , only less is currently known about protective factors in the COVID-19 situation. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate positive variables that have the potential to reduce the COVID-19 burden. The findings could contribute to the development of programs that protect mental and physical health from negative consequences of the current COVID-19 situation.",

Notably, following the recommendations of the World Health Organization, (2020b), moderate physical activity (e.g., jogging, cycling) for at least 150 min throughout a week can significantly contribute to mental and physical health. It increases individual's resilience to adequately cope with stressful experiences and reduces depression, anxiety, and addictive symptoms (Brailovskaia et al., 2018b; Klaperski et al., 2013; Rebar et al., 2015) . Steady physical activity improves sleep quality and enhances life satisfaction and academic performance (Eime et al., 2013; Wunsch et al., 2017) . Moreover, physical activity reduces suicide-related outcomes (i.e., ideation, behavior) Vancampfort et al., 2018) . Therefore, physical activity is often a part of therapeutic treatment of various mental disorders (Firth et al., 2015; Kvam et al., 2016; Schuch et al., 2016) .",

The present cross-national study provides cross-sectional and longitudinal findings from China and Germany on two protective factors that could reduce burden experienced by COVID-19, and it explains how they might interact. Despite the different national COVID-19 contexts, similar result patterns were found in both countries. Notes. c = path of predictor to outcome, without inclusion of mediator (total effect); a = path of predictor to mediator; b = path of mediator to outcome; c' = path of predictor to outcome including mediator (direct effect); BL, baseline; FU, follow-up As expected, physical activity assessed one (in Germany) and five (in China) years before the pandemic outbreak (longitudinal data), as well as physical activity assessed in both countries after the pandemic outbreak (cross-sectional data), was negatively associated with burden caused by COVID-19 (confirmation of Hypothesis 1a). Regular physical activity (e.g., jogging, cycling, yoga) not only fosters physical health, but also increases the individual level of self-efficacy and confers resilience to deal with stressful and uncertain situations (Eime et al., 2013) . In line with this knowledge, the current findings show that individuals who regularly engaged/engage in physical activity in the past and in the present are at less risk to experience high burden by COVID-19. Furthermore, physical activity was positively associated with PMH (confirmation of Hypothesis 1b). This corresponds to earlier research that described that people who engage in physical activity often experience flow -a state of joy, happiness, and mastery (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990 ) -that fosters positive mental health (Drane & Barber, 2016; Richards et al., 2015) . Furthermore, PMH can be increased by the achieving of selfdetermined physical aims such as the enhancement of own cycling speed and endurance .",

For example, it contributed to the longitudinal treatment success of individuals with anxiety disorders and reduced the risk of suicide ideation and behavior in individuals who previously experienced cyberbullying (Brailovskaia et al., 2018a) . The current findings reveal that PMH assessed up to five years before the pandemic outbreak as well as PMH measured in the present can predict the level of burden by COVID-19. Moreover, PMH mediated the relationship between physical activity and COVID-19 burden (confirmation of Hypothesis 2). Thus, it can be hypothesized that the protective effect of physical activity against COVID-19 burden depends on heightened PMH: If physical activity translates to PMH, then the experience of high COVID-19 burden becomes less likely. This assumption corresponds to earlier research that showed the combination of physical activity and PMH to be a protective factor against suicide-related outcomes . Notably, in the current study, the hypothesis about the mediation role of PMH was confirmed in the longitudinal mediation model that included physical activity and PMH five years (Chinese sample) and one year (German sample) before the pandemic outbreak and in the crosssectional model that included all data at the same measurement time point. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between physical activity at the BL and at the FU, as well as between PMH at the BL and at the FU. The present results reveal the stability of the protective effect of physical activity and PMH. Moreover, they emphasize the importance of the permanent maintenance of both variables on a high level to reduce the impact of negative external factors such as the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Moreover, there is a gap of four years between the BL assessed in China and the BL assessed in Germany which limits their direct comparability.

High burden by COVID-19 can contribute to maladaptive behavior such as enhanced alcohol consumption, aggression, and less adherence to governmental measures (Barzilay et al., 2020; Margraf et al., 2020 ). An early identification of and a targeted providing of support for people who are at risk to experience high COVID-19 burden can reduce the negative consequences which in the longer term harm the individual and the society. For example, freely available online programs could be offered and promoted by official governmental communication that foster physical activity and PMH. Such programs could include instructed gymnastic exercises that can be carried out at home without expensive equipment and are adapted to specific focus groups (e.g., considering age, health status). Online sportive programs that allow participants to see each other and to interact with each other during the exercises could at least partly satisfy the need for belonging and increase the perception of social support. Both are of great importance in the current COVID-19 situation that requires social distancing to fight the pandemic spread (Galea et al., 2020) , and both were previously shown to foster the level of PMH (Hu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, these programs might contribute to a more regulated daily routine during curfews and for people who must stay in quarantine. They could not only support people who currently suffer from high level of burden, but also preventively reduce the risk of later burden experience.",

Future research is suggested to include further measures to gain a more detailed overview of physical activity (e.g., which activity is performed; how intensively is it daily performed) and its relationship with PMH and burden. This could contribute to conclusions about the best form and intensity of physical activity to reduce COVID-19 burden. Second, the low internal consistency of the burden measure in the Chinese sample might reduce the reliability of the present results. Third, there was a high drop-out rate in the Chinese sample. Of the overall 2,723 persons who participated in the BL survey, only 474 (17.4%) responded to the FU survey. The high drop-out can at least partly be explained by the long time period between the BL and the FU measurement. The university email addresses were used to contact the participants. Therefore, it could be that after five years, some of them do not longer check or use this email address. Moreover, previous research reported that especially young adults (between 18 and 23 years) tend to drop-out in longitudinal studies (Young et al., 2006) . The mean age of the Chinese sample was 21.66 years at the BL. In contrast, in the German sample, the drop-out rate was relatively low (8.2%, n = 32) after one year. Notably, in both samples, there were no significant differences considering the demographic variables as well as the levels of physical activity and PMH at the BL between persons who participated in the FU survey and these who did not participate. Furthermore, the levels of physical activity, PMH, and burden in the present study did not remarkably differ from the previously reported levels of these variables Lukat et al., 2016; Sch\u00f6nfeld et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, it cannot be controlled for further selective factors (e.g., mental health issues, issues of the living environment, family issues) that might influence whether individuals who participated in the BL survey continued their participation in the FU survey.",

Thus, the enhancement of physical activity and PMH could strengthen the people in the current uncertain situation, it could decrease maladaptive coping strategies, and it could increase adaptive ones. This could foster adherence to the governmental COVID-19 prevention measures, and thus this could contribute to the fight with the pandemic spread. Therefore, reducing the burden of COVID-19 through the fostering of protective factors such as physical activity and PMH should belong to preferred strategies. As with most communicable disease, the COVID-19 response worldwide has been dominated by care and infection prevention including widespread quarantine and shutdowns of public life and economy (Su et al., 2021) . The present findings show that a basic approach to health promotion can have a longer-term protective advantage that might reduce the burden of outbreaks such as COVID-19 and thus significantly support the success of the other measures.",
