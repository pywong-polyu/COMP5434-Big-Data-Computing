Data such as symptoms before hospitalization, presence of fever, and contact with sick persons were collected using a patient's self-report questionnaire, that was stored in the hospital's electronic medical record. In some points, there was a loss of data, such as the question regarding if the patient had contact with a sick person. In this situation, a smaller number of analyzed patients will be seen. As stated above, only medical records in which a variety of information was missing were excluded. Therefore, the lack of only some specific information did not fit the exclusion criterion. Consequently, in some fields, the absence of these data will be evident, and there will not be a total of 266 participants.",

This approach provided advantages over other generalized linear models, which may oversimplify data by assuming equal intervals between response categories. Instead, ordinal regression treats a dependent variable as pairwise, ordered groupings of consecutive nominal elements. The ordinal regression captures the odds of moving up 1 level in the ordering under the proportional odds assumption across multiple levels. The dependent was hospitalization, with three levels: 1) not admitted or discharged, 2) hospitalized in a regular ward, and 3) admitted to the ICU. The covariables used for the model were: sex, age, systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes, asthma, coronary disease, fever, heart rate, respiratory rate, and patient characteristics, such as if the patient was a health professional and/or reported having contact with a sick person. We excluded 45 cases due to missing data regarding age and patients\u00b4characteristics, and the final model had 221 participants. This analysis was conducted using R and the MASS and Brant packages [7, 9, 10] . Adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, and the Brant test was used to verify the OR assumptions and proportionality. We also calculated the generalized variance inflation factor (GVIF) to confirm the absence of any substantial multicollinearity. The GVIF was used due to the nominal nature of some independent variables.",

[11] , in which the value obtained was 48,7%. This difference can be explained by the lower average age and number of comorbidities per patient in our study. Age is a well-established risk factor for hospitalization by SARS-COVID, especially among the elderly population (> 60 years), with a relative increase in the Odds Ratio for higher ages [11] [12] [13] [14] . Among our patients, the mean age was 44.71, a lower value than that found in studies conducted outside Brazil, where the elderly population is proportionally more significant. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed a higher chance of hospitalization for older ages. According to a meta-analysis published by the European Journal of Epidemiology, although the mortality rate of infection is higher in the elderly and infirm patients, middle-aged adults are also at risk: the mortality rate for this group, when infected, is two times greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident, and much greater than the risk of death by seasonal flu. Consequently, public health measures should also be targeted at these groups to reduce the incidence of mortality [15] .",

A meta-analysis published by Nature evidenced that although there were no differences between males and females regarding the number of confirmed cases, male patients were almost three times more likely to require intensive care or to die. The explanation for this is multifactorial, involving female estrogen protection and greater innate and adaptive immune response (higher number of CD4+ T cells and more robust CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity, along with a higher production of immunoglobulin by B cells) [16, 17] . Underlying diseases increase the risk of affection and hospitalization by COVID-19, in addition to being important indicators of severity. Among them, systemic arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus stand out, followed by COPD, CKD, and immunosuppression (HIV, transplants) [11] [12] [13] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Hypertension occupies the most prominent place and has received the most attention in recent studies, with values ranging from 4,5% in non-critically ill individuals [22] up to >50% in hospitalized groups [11, 13] . It is important to highlight that the majority of studies showed a prevalence of hypertension between 15 to 35%, especially in China [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .

Most recent studies show a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare professionals, especially those on the front lines. Lack of or inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), contact with colleagues or patients in the early stages of unsuspected infections, with high viral loads, are the main causes that lead to increased risk in this population [33, 34] . In China, 3,300 had been infected and, in Italy, 20% tested positive for the disease at the beginning of March [35] . In our sample, 18.9% of the admitted patients were health professionals. Furthermore, being a healthcare professional did not denote a chance of hospitalization, but patients who claimed to have had contact with a sick individual, with the health professionals participating in this group, proved to have a protective factor for hospitalization, which may suggest the formation of prior immunity, leading to them not requiring more specialized treatment. However, it is worth remembering that the study was conducted in only one hospital and there may be limitations in this result.",

This assessment is indispensable, since reduced SPO 2 and increased blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are independent risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID -19, with emphasis on SPO 2 and high blood pressure [36, 37] . A study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) revealed that at the time of screening, 30.7% of patients were febrile and 17.3% tachypneic [13] . Our study found an important agreement: 19.1% febrile and 13.4% tachypneic, with tachypnea being a significant parameter to increase the chance of hospitalization. In a review by Pascarella G et al., the most prevalent symptoms found were fever, which affected more than 80% of cases, dyspnea, and cough, followed by other symptoms such as rhinorrhea, headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and myalgia [20] . In agreement with this study, a meta-analysis later published by the Journal of Medical Virology found that fever was the most common symptom (80.4%), followed by cough (63.1%) [17] . In our sample, the most common symptoms were similar, but unlike the referred meta-analysis, cough (75.6%) was more frequent than fever (58.8%) in our study. It is important to advise the patient that when fluid replacement is performed correctly, fever is usually self-limited and rarely indicates a serious problem. It is a tool to fight the virus and inhibit its replication [38] . Cough in SARS--CoV-2 is usually persistent, can be either dry or productive, and has a multifactorial etiology. The likely mechanisms that cause coughing involve inflammation, epithelial damage, mucoid impaction, and neuromodulatory changes [39] .",

Among these medications, Paracetamol is recommended, due to the lower likelihood of adverse effects [41] . Furthermore, Paracetamol can help reduce fever, but it is important to note that maintaining a mild fever can be a favorable tool in fighting the virus [38] . 32.5% of the patients used Azithromycin and 9.1% Hydroxychloroquine. Both have been tested in association in a series of clinical trials, due to a possible acceleration of the virus eradication process, but more studies are needed [41] . Tests with isolated Hydroxychloroquine showed apparent efficacy and safety against COVID-19 associated with pneumonia [42] . Another 9.1% of patients used Ivermectin, which has shown benefits in vitro tests, but not in vivo when it comes to the treatment of COVID-19 [41] . Regarding Ivermectine, while the effectiveness of in vivo response still requires more research, it is already known that it can have a positive influence in some therapeutic options, such as reducing side effects related to Hydroxychloroquine use, such as QT prolongation, myopathy, and neuropathy [43] . Other medications less used at the time of admission were Amoxicillin + Clavulanate, Systemic Corticosteroids and Enoxaparin, each corresponding to 3.9%, and finally, Sulfamethoxazole + Trimethoprim, used by 1 patient (1.3%). These medications are less common in the literature and also have no evidence of efficacy to date.",

Whatsmore, some can also be used as prophylactic and adjuvant therapy to COVID-19. Examples of these are vitamin D, zinc, and probiotics. Vitamin D inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases those with anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, vitamin D deficiency is related to a greater intensity of inflammatory response, which increases morbidity and mortality in Sars-Cov-2 infection [44] . Zinc, in turn, has shown to be effective in reducing susceptibility to pathogens [45] . Probiotics increase immunological activity and help eliminate or reduce infections related to the respiratory tract, helping to balance the pulmonary microbiota [46] . Unfortunately, these studies are recent, and questioning the use of vitamin D, zinc, and probiotics at the time of admission was not part of our study.",
