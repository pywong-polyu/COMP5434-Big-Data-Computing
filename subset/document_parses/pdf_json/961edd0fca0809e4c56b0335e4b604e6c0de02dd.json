Following intubation, the ECG ( Figure 4 ) revealed ST-segment elevations in V1-V4 and reciprocal ST-depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Due to concerns about COVID-19 and inability to obtain further medical history, computed tomography (CT) of the head, and chest was performed which revealed bilateral lower lung lobe infiltrates and pulmonary oedema with moderate calcification in the mid-left anterior descending artery ( Figure 3 ). Bedside echocardiogram demonstrated reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% with antero-apical wall hypokinesis. After discussion between the emergency department, cardiology, and ICU teams, a decision was made to perform coronary angiography. Moderate diffuse atherosclerotic disease was observed in the left system with no significant luminal obstruction elsewhere ( Figure 4 and Supplementary material online, Movies S5 and S6) corresponding to the ECG findings. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was elevated at 30 mmHg.",

The patient was managed as presumed Non ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) with decompensated heart failure and loading dose dual antiplatelets, therapeutic low molecular weight heparin, high-dose IV diuretics, and IV nitrates were administered. On Day 2 of admission, a run of rapidly conducted atrial fibrillation was treated successfully with IV digoxin.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is expressed within the myocardium and up-regulated in heart disease, and patients with cardiovascular disease may therefore be more vulnerable. This may lead to endothelial cell and microvascular dysfunction or occlusion. 9 A recent case report from Bergamo, Italy, described evidence of coronary microthrombi at post-mortem in a patient with COVID-19 who presented with ST-segment elevation without obstructive coronary disease. 10 This is consistent with reports of pulmonary microvascular thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, 11 and diagnostic criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation have been observed in 71.4% of non-survivors with COVID-19. 12 COVID-19 and infection with other coronaviruses may lead to myocarditis. [13] [14] [15] A recent report described lone COVID-19 myocarditis in a patient with no respiratory symptoms, 2 and fulminant COVID-19-induced myocarditis has been described and treated with corticosteroids and human immunoglobulin. 13 In addition, transfusion of convalescent plasma with an SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) in addition to corticosteroid therapy has been described, leading to improvement in clinical state in a patient with myocardial injury. 16 These treatments have not demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials.",
