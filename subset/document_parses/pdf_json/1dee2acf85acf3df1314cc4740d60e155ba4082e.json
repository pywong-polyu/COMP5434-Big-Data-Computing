Cardiac impairment has been reported to varying degrees by varying methodologies in cross-sectional studies. Using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), we investigated the 12month trajectory of cardiac impairment in individuals with Long Covid. Methods 534 individuals with Long Covid underwent baseline CMR (T1 and T2 mapping, cardiac mass, volumes, function, and strain) and multi-organ MRI at 6 months (IQR 4.3,7.3) since first post-COVID-19 symptoms and 330 were rescanned at 12.6 (IQR 11.4, 14.2) months if abnormal findings were reported at baseline. Symptoms, standardised questionnaires, and blood samples were collected at both timepoints. Cardiac impairment was defined as one or more of: low left or right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF and RVEF), high left or right ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV and RVEDV), low 3D left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), or elevated native T1 in \u2265 3 cardiac segments. A significant change over time was reported by comparison with 92 healthy controls.",

We included healthy, age-matched controls. All MRI was non-contrast. We recruited a real-world cohort at lower risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Unlike other studies(10), our approach offers quick, scalable assessment using standard MRI scanners. There are limitations. First, our CMR protocol excluded gadolinium contrast due to concerns regarding COVID-19-related renal complications, relying on native non-invasive T1 mapping to characterise myocardial inflammation, validated for acute myocarditis (31) . Second, we did not have follow-up scans on individuals without impairment at baseline. Third, we did not have pre-COVID cardiac or multi-organ imaging available in participants. Third, our study population was not ethnically diverse, and COVID-19 has disproportionately affected nonwhite individuals.",
