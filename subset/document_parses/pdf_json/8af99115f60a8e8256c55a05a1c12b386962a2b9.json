            "text": "The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has led to rapid and profound changes in healthcare system delivery and society more broadly. Older adults, and those living with chronic or life-limiting conditions, are at increased risk of experiencing severe or critical symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection and are more likely to die. They may also experience non-COVID-19 related deterioration in their health status during this period. Advance care planning (ACP) is critical for this cohort, yet there is no coordinated strategy for increasing the low rates of ACP uptake in these groups, or more broadly. This paper outlines a number of key reasons why ACP is an urgent priority, and should form a part of the health system's COVID-19 response strategy. These include reducing the need for rationing, planning for surges in healthcare demand, respecting human rights, enabling proactive care coordination and leveraging societal change. We conclude with key recommendations for policy and practice in the system-wide implementation of ACP, to enable a more ethical, coordinated and person-centred response in the COVID-19 context.",

These measures are aimed at flattening the epidemic curve and enabling health services to manage the predicted increase in demand for acute and intensive care services. 3 Health services have also been compelled to plan for worst-case scenarios in which rapid surges in severe cases overwhelm the capacity of intensive care and other healthcare settings. 4 Measures implemented to date have included securing alternative sources for critical medical supplies, increasing acute and intensive care capacity, ceasing elective surgery, closing specialist clinics, establishing dedicated wards or spaces for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, transitioning sections of the healthcare workforce to telehealth delivery, limiting hospital visitors, and limiting resident movement and family visitation in residential aged care facility (RACF) settings. 5 In the absence of an effective vaccine or antiviral treatment, these measures are an unquestionably important public health response to COVID-19, with evidence from previous outbreaks indicating that they will slow infection rates and reduce overall mortality. 3 However, from a broader bio-psycho-social model of health, it is also important to reflect on how these rapid changes may impact on other valued health and social outcomes, particularly for older adults and those with chronic or lifelimiting conditions. 6 These people are at increased risk of experiencing severe or critical symptoms associated with COVID-19, 2 but are also more likely to be regularly accessing health or aged care and may be on an end-oflife trajectory for other reasons. Advance care planning (ACP) is always important for these groups, 7 and as we argue below, for several reasons is now more important than ever. However, it is not simply a matter of accelerating a 'business as usual' approach; several factors will impact on ACP in the current context. This paper argues there is an urgent need to include ACP as part of the health system response to COVID-19, and concludes with key recommendations on how this might be facilitated in the current context.",

Importantly, ACP is a voluntary person-led approach that should not be conflated with unilateral clinical decision-making regarding 'futility' or 'rationing' of scarce healthcare resources (although it may reduce the need for such decision-making). ACP has been associated with a range of positive end-of-life care outcomes, including reduced use of life-sustaining treatments, 10 increased compliance with patients' end-of-life wishes, 11 and reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety among bereaved relatives. 12 In Australia, the best estimates of ACD prevalence place rates at around 14% in population-based surveys, 13 25% among older adults accessing health or aged care settings, with relatively higher rates in the RACF setting (38%) than hospital (11%) or general practice (6%) settings. 14 These later findings are significant, given the complex circumstances of the study participants, many of whom were of advanced age, with multiple co-morbidities, resided in aged care facilities and had significant functional impairment.",

The current low rate of ACD documentation among susceptible groups reflects an urgent need for increased engagement with ACP, at both a healthcare system and societal level. There are existing, evidence-based approaches that can increase ACP uptake 12 and facilitate a more ethical, coordinated and person-centred response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

This will also reduce healthcare professional exposure to unnecessary infection risk associated with administering unwanted life-sustaining treatments. 16 In a rationing scenario it is arguably unethical to provide treatments without actively seeking to offer patients and families ACP discussions wherever possible. It is of course critical that the person-led ACP process is upheld, and not conflated with clinical or health systems-level decision-making processes regarding futile/non-beneficial treatment or rationing. It is also imperative to emphasise that 'no intensive care' or 'no hospitalisation' does not mean 'no care'; all available resources should be used to ensure person-centred palliative care is available to all, with particular priority for those who have refused aggressive treatments. 15 ",

General practitioners, hospital discharge teams, nurses and allied health practitioners, aged care facility staff, trained community volunteers and public health communication strategies may all play a role in raising community awareness and facilitating ACP discussions. Non-acute, community settings provide a more comfortable context for exploring patient views, 21 and these preparatory discussions reduce the burden on acute health practitioners, who will be able to communicate with patients and family members who have already started an ACP process. Starting ACP prior to an acute event may also reduce the likelihood of patients misinterpreting a routine 'goals of care' discussion on hospital admission as a signal of poor prognosis or that further treatment is not appropriate. The risk of these perceptions is particularly acute with COVID-19 given the extensive media coverage and international experiences of overt healthcare rationing. All of these proactive measures aim to increase ACP discussions and documentation, and thus ease the ethical burden and likely trauma that would be experienced by health practitioners associated with having to make unilateral decisions to withdraw or withhold medical treatments. 16, 18 Respecting human rights There are long-standing concerns about the capacity for emergency powers activated in response to public health or national security threats to compromise human rights. 22 The United Nations Siracusa Principles provide a framework for public health responses, to ensure that any measures infringing on human rights are necessary, proportionate, non-discriminatory and subject to review. 23 While parliamentary processes may provide at least some scrutiny of the rapidly legislated response to the COVID-19 outbreak over coming months, 24 at a health service level, clinicians and managers are charged with real-time implementation in their local context, while maintaining key healthcare system functions. Part of a proportionate and non-discriminatory response to COVID-19 will include protecting patient autonomy and procedures underpinning full informed consent wherever possible (including through ACP) and taking action to promote equitable access to healthcare regardless of group membership (e.g. gender, ethnicity, disability or religious belief).",

In the COVID-19 context, accessing hospital or residential aged care may come with a risk of periods of isolation from full family visitation, 5 a possibility of dying without access to visitors, 26 and the potential for healthcare-associated infection if localised outbreaks occur. Given these constraints, some may choose to forego treatments, hospitalisation or admission to residential aged care. 6 A facilitated ACP process involving health practitioners can help patients and family members discuss their concerns, with opportunities to address misinformation or unfounded fears. Practitioners can provide contextualised information about the person's underlying conditions, available treatment and care options and the likely burdens and benefits in the unique COVID-19 context, enabling the person to express and document their preferences. Encouraging and assisting in ACP discussions explicitly demonstrates to patients and family members how health practitioners continue to value patient preferences, in spite of having to enforce strict infection control measures. 16, 26, 27 Protecting core bioethical principles of autonomy, dignity and informed consent in healthcare decision-making, even in constrained and extraordinary situations, may provide a sense of higher meaning and shared purpose for health practitioners and the broader community. A rights-based approach that incorporates ACP can thus enable a proportionate and person-centred approach to care provision during COVID-19.",

Physical distancing measures have complicated normal visiting practices and face-to-face healthcare delivery, making telehealth the 'new normal' in some settings. The use of face masks may obscure verbal and non-verbal cues and hinder communication among those with auditory or cognitive impairments. 28 Family members or social support networks who normally contribute to informal care in the community may be less (or more) available to provide care in person. In this context, commonly expressed preferences for end-of-life care, such as receiving support to die at home, may be more complicated to deliver. An important benefit of ACP is that it promotes understanding of a person's preferences for future care, enabling health practitioners and the person's existing support networks proactively to address logistical challenges and coordinate formal and informal care arrangements, so the person's choices can be respected. This may include ensuring supplies of consumables, medications or personal protective equipment to a person's home, acquiring or re-purposing equipment for remote video-conferencing, organising influenza vaccinations to enable visitation in RACF settings and developing contingency plans in case care partners are infected and required to quarantine. An ongoing process of ACP discussion, with information communicated between family members, support networks and the healthcare team, may enable proactive and creative solutions to the challenges that COVID-19 infection control measures present to high-quality end-of-life care.",

Research has indicated that individual readiness to engage in ACP is influenced by personal experiences, particularly those that increase an individual's sense of susceptibility (e.g. health scares or experience with end-of-life care for family members). 29 In the COVID-19 context, intensive media coverage and confronting images from abroad have brought the limits of medical technology, and our personal vulnerability to sudden illness, into the forefront of community consciousness. Anecdotal clinical experiences suggest that patients with and without COVID-19 are more actively seeking information about ACP.
