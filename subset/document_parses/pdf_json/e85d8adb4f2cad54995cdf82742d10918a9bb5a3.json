In this work, we updated a previously published review by Price et al. (2018) , on effectiveness of interventions to improve the public's antimicrobial resistance awareness and behaviours associated with prudent use of antimicrobials to identify which interventions work best in influencing public behaviour. Methods: Five databases-Medline (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL-OVID)-were searched for AMR interventions between 2017 and 2021 targeting the public. All studies which had a before and after assessment of the intervention were considered for inclusion. Results: In total, 17 studies were found to be eligible for inclusion in the review. Since there was a variety in the study interventions and in particular outcomes, a narrative synthesis approach was adopted for analysis. Whereas each study showed some impact on awareness and knowledge, none measured long-term impact on behaviours towards antibiotic use, awareness, or knowledge. Engagement was higher in interventions which included interactive elements such as games or videos. Social media was not used for recruitment of participants or as a mode of communication in any AMR interventions included in this review.",

Any conflicts or disagreements in the assessment were resolved by the three reviewers in a discussion meeting. Standard EPOC risk of bias criteria were used for randomised trials, non-randomised trials, and controlled before-after studies. In the previous review, risk of bias was not assessed for Before-After Studies with No Control Group and the risk of bias was assumed to be high for these studies [12] . However, in this review we assessed the risk of bias for Before-After (Pre-Post) studies with no control group using the quality assessment tool developed by NHLBI in 2013 [15] . This was done as the potential biases are likely to be more significant for non-randomised studies than randomised trials, especially if they compare the results between the same group of designs [16] .",
