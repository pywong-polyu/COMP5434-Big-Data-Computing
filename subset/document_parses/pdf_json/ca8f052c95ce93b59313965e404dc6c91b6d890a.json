This may suggest that their pathogenesis may also be similar [2] . We believe that any hypothesis covering COVID-19 pathogenesis should explain very high serum levels of both ferritin and D-dimer levels disproportionate with the severity of infection, as well as a tendency for monocytosis, rather than lymphocytosis, including a low number of natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T cells, and finally tendency for DIC.

The number of regulatory T cells is also very low. Severe lymphopenia is a very early sign of the disease, preceding pulmonary problems, and tends to normalize as the patient improves. Lymphopenia is included among diagnostic criteria in China. Despite low numbers, both CD4 and CD8 positive lymphocytes express the high amount of HLADR4 and CD38, showing hyperactivity. Additionally, CD8 T cells harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granules; i.e., 31.6% were perforin positive, 64.2% were granulysin positive, and 30.5% were both granulysin and perforin positive. Total leukocyte and neutrophil counts and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are increased especially in severe cases; NLR may be used as a follow-up parameter in patients with COVID-19 infection [10, 11] . Generally, the number of CD8 T lymphocytes recovers in 2-3 months, whereas it may take nearly a year for the memory CD4 T lymphocytes to recover in SARS CoV infection [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Among PRRs, the membranebound family of toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognizes mainly the PAMPs in the extracellular and to a lesser account in the intracellular milieu. The triggered signaling process leads to the expression of proinflammatory cytokine-inducing transcription factors, such as NF-kB, as well as to activate interferon regulatory factors that mediate the type I interferondependent antiviral response [17] . The second set of pathogen recognition sensors is present in the cytosol and includes another family of nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins (NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP7, and NLRC4), the protein absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and pyrin. These sensors are essential for the detection of endogenous dangerassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) expressed inside the cell. Binding of DAMPs activates NLRs, triggering the formation of multiprotein cytoplasmic complexes called inflammasomes, which convert procaspase-1 to active caspase-1. Then, caspase-1 converts proIL-1\u03b2 to active IL-1\u03b2, which is a very important proinflammatory cytokine [17, 18] (Fig. 1 ). It should be noted that if these signaling activation processes are kept under control, they serve for the benefit of the human body.",

They also suggested that dornase alpha treatment may be beneficial for the management of this infection [31] . Transfer of DNA fragments to extracellular space may be due to the release of mitochondrial DNA together with disruption of the plasma membrane or caused by a process known as NETosis. NETosis is a type of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis and necrosis. Viral RNA and proinflammatory cytokines may stimulate the formation of both NETs and NETosis. Although the exact role of NETs in anti-viral immunity has not been elucidated yet, they might contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis [30] [31] [32] .",

Why disease course is variable ranging from asymptomatic to lethal may be explained by genetic and host factors [37] . This may also explain why the number of deaths may be high in some families. Given that genetic factors also play a role in primary HLH/MAS cases, a meta-analysis was performed to analyze both the countries where HLH/MAS cases are frequently reported and where the frequency of severe and lethal COVID-19 infections are high [38] . Interestingly, geographical distributions were found to be similar. Genetic mutations causing a tendency for primary HLH may constitute a risk factor for severe disease course in COVID-19. Just the opposite, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)-associated genetic mutations may be speculated to confer milder disease course, based upon the historical hypothesis claiming that such mutations may confer resistance to some viral and bacterial pathogens. Indeed, lower death ratios in COVID-19 infections reported from Turkey and Israel may support this speculation (based on https:// covid19.who.int/accessed in 25.04.2020). Interestingly, MAS occurrence is not frequent in FMF despite being an autoinflammatory disease [39] .",

Anakinra is a recombinant IL-1R antagonist (rHIL-1Ra) and is the first IL-1 blocking biologic agent produced. Anakinra blocks the binding of both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 to IL-1R, thereby inhibits the proinflammatory effects of IL-1 [59] . Anakinra was found to be beneficial in patients with severe sepsis without significant adverse effects based upon the data of phase 3 randomized clinical trial [60] . The recommended SC adult dose of anakinra ranges from 100 to 200 mg daily to 100 mg three times weekly; the pediatric dose is 1 mg/kg daily. The bioavailability of SC injections is 95%with a half-life of 4-6 h. In the presence of renal failure (GFR < 30 ml/min), it should be given in every 2 days. Hepatic disease does not require dose adjustment. Unlike TCZ, anakinra does not inhibit CRP synthesis directly; therefore, serum CRP levels can be used to follow up systemic acute phase response [59] . Another molecule produced for IL-blockage is canakinumab, which is a high affinity, fully humanized, monoclonal anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibody with IgG1/\u03ba isotype. Following SC injection of 150 mg, peak serum concentration is achieved in 7 days. The recommended dose interval is every 2 months [59] . The third molecule developed for IL-1 blockade is Rilonacept, which is a recombinant soluble IL-1 receptor. The half-life of rilonacept is 6.3-8.6 days. The recommended loading dose is 2.2 mg/kg, with the maximum dose of 160 mg; the maintenance dose is half of the loading dose weekly [61] . The use of canakinumab or rilonacept for severe COVID-19 infections has not been reported yet.",

International guidelines recommend using moderate doses of systemic CS treatment for a short time, only when hemodynamic parameters are not improved following fluid replacement and vasopressor support [40, 41] . Current use of systemic corticosteroid treatment during COVID-19 infection is limited to patients having lethal complications related to cytokine storm such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, renal failure, and to those patients with higher serum levels of D-Dimer. Since, there is no positive evidence coming from randomized clinical trials, WHO guideline dated March 13, 2020 does not recommend using systemic CS treatment for patients with COVID-19 routinely [62] .

This study has some limitations. Firstly, the literature about COVID is changing at great speed and the Chinese literature could not be included in the manuscript. The lack of standard published studies and the differences in the treatment approaches between Chinese and Western sources (such as Chinese medicine) remained an obstacle for making correct recommendations.",
