Thus, misinformation about health is increasingly prevalent. We roughly divided the users in social networks into ordinary users, medical elites, and super-influencers. In this paper, we propose a communication model of health information based on the improved Hegselmann-Krause (H-K) model. By conducting MATLAB-based simulation, the experimental results showed that network noise was an important factor that interfered with opinion propagation regarding health. The louder the noise is, the harder it is for health opinions within a group to reach a consensus. But even in a noisy environment, super-influencers could influence the overall cognition on public health in the social network fundamentally. When the super-influencers held positive opinions in public health, the medical elite keeping silent had a noise-tolerant effect on opinion communication in public health, and vice versa. Thus, three factors concerning noise control, the free information release of medical elites, and the positive position of super-influence are very important to form a virtuous information environment for public health.",

Facebook had 2.8 billion monthly active users by the end of 2020, and its daily active users reached 1.8 billion (1) . There are thousands of updates per second. Compared with traditional media such as newspapers, radio, and television, these online social media tools are changing the way information is shared and opinions exchanged. However, for public health, low-credibility information is increasingly prevalent in social networks. Thus, the dissemination of misinformation has become an important factor affecting the cognition of public health concepts. The misinformation not only prevents individuals from engaging in behaviors, but also likely raises public health risks, and even prevents the public from considering policy choices regarding health issues. In the field of vaccinations alone, the World Health Organization declared that measles cases had gone up 300% in 2019 because of the absence of vaccinations.",

Firstly, the elderly surge into social network platforms amid aging societies. Due to their lesser capacity to screen information online and low sensitivity to health-related information, the elderly tend to be misguided. Secondly, some self-publishing and social media exaggerate or even fabricate their health-related posts as stunts or for profitable purposes. These highly controversial and contagious contents are prone to the formation of information cascades (2, 3) . Thirdly, as the prevalence of cyber-gangs and network violence rise, influential medical elites are more inclined to keep silent, which narrows the space for accurate and authoritative health information to spread (4) . All these facts significantly aggravate the prevalence of misinformation about public health, leading to distorted choices from individuals.",

Based on the traditional opinion leaders influence theory (5), we divided users into three categories including ordinary users, super-influencers, and elite users. Medical elites refer to opinion leaders in the medical field, and super-influencers are taken as super opinion leaders. Base on this, we designed parameters for the targeted opinion interaction model according to the different attributes of users, and proposed the misinformation (about health) propagation model based on medical elites, and conducted the simulation. This paper may the first concern of elite silence in social networks using a quantitative method, and help to understand the mechanism of how distortion in health opinion propaganda happened.",

Tustin et al. (7) reported the widespread misinformation about side effects, as well as mistrust in government or pharmaceutical companies, on vaccination. From the perspective of chronic non-infectious diseases, Chua and Banerjee (8) reported that online users are more likely to trust and share cancer-related misinformation if the misinformation is pessimistic instead of optimistic.

They quantified the reasons for the public opinion evolution and opinion deviation. Li et al. (11) integrated the non-trust relationships between users, which could trigger opinion distortion online as a core parameter into the evaluation model. Based on real data, Hosseinipozveh et al. (12) found that non-trusting relationships widely existed in social networks where opinions could spread without barriers and finally lead to opinion distortion. Katz et al. (13) believed that interpersonal relationships play an important role in information spreading through the public and assessed the extent of its influence through empirical analysis. Also, information itself influences distortion. Later, Chadwick et al. (14) studied four datasets based on a customized survey of individual blogs, interactive websites, news articles, and Twitter users during the 2017 British election campaign, and found that an important factor causing democratic misinformation and disinformation behavior is the sharing of \"tabloid news.\" Lu et al. (15) quantitatively estimated the distorted opinions of users by mining controversial topics in social networks and found that opinions would change over time. Tucker et al. (16) also believed that political polarization was closely related to online disinformation, and the use of social media positively promoted such a relationship. The study also found that individuals' distortion of information content would eventually evolve into a collective distortion of opinion. Wei and Meng (17) address online opinion distortion from a super-influencer perspective and put forward a simulation model to explain the phenomenon. Sasahara et al. (18) focus on the unfriending effect on opinion exchange and find that very small changes of influence and unfriending can cause online communities to become segregated.",

(5) simulated the path of opinion propagation and proved that opinion leaders could speed up information propagation. Clauset et al. (19) found that independent spreaders in a scale-free network were closely related to the occurrence of public opinion deviation. This study believed that such special nodes, which are unaffected by their neighbors, could spread information through ways other than the links, and change the attitudes of non-neighbors, causing cross-range deviation of public opinion values. Li et al. (20) proposed the Ising model and studied the mismatch and the interactions among nodes within social networks, and found that nodes with high degrees tended to be connected by nodes with low degrees, which took the super-influencers as the benchmark for reference and imitation and thus led to the opinion distortion. In terms of elite users, based on their influence and information transmission mode, Anagnostopoulos et al. (21) defined elite users as bloggers, celebrities, media organizations, and representatives of other official organizations. Khan (22) defined elite users as \"people who have extremely disproportionate access to or control over a resource.\" Based on a real-time data analysis, Bastos et al. (23) found that only 10-15% of users retweeted the posts from traditional media and more generally of original views and highquality content from elite users.",

Although elite users do not possess the super-power the super-influencers do, they are producers of high-quality information and spokespeople of original opinions (26) , especially in the field of public health.

According to the degree of confidence, opinion leaders could be further divided into super-influencers and general opinion leaders. The initial opinions of super-influencers who had the highest level of confidence were distributed in the interval (0, 0.25] [0.75, 1).

Based on noise-silence causality, this paper established an opinion evolutionary model of public health to study the medical elite silence and compare the influence of user type and silence on health opinion propagation through simulative experiments. The main findings in this study can be concluded as follow. Network noise is an important factor that interferes with the dissemination of health opinions. Under the ideal network condition without elite users, super-influencers, and noise, the overall network opinion converged in a short time. In particular, the appearance of noise that represented network violence brought great uncertainty to the dissemination of health information. People's opinions on health presented great controversy and uncertainty, which may bring great hidden danger to the health choices of individuals and groups.",

Secondly, the medical elite should be encouraged to share points, and different points of view among them should be permitted, even welcomed, if supported by evidence. A tolerant environment for medical elites is urgently needed, even policy specifically to protect them could be considered.
