            "text": "The Stone (limestone) and Marble (trade name) Industry (SMI) is one of the most important and active industries in Palestine, as being economically and financially rewarding and greatly beneficial to the public and private sectors. This industry, which employs about 15,000-20,000 workers, contributes 20-25% to the total industrial revenues of Palestine, and 4.5% to the total gross national product. Despite its benefits, SMI has adverse effects on public health, the environment, biodiversity, water systems (both surface and underground), green cover, and ecosystems in general, as it is considered one of the most air-water-, soil-, and noise-polluting sources. To achieve the purpose of this research paper, available data and literature are analyzed, evaluated, and used, in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the status of SMI, in light of sustainable development. This relates to various perspectives, including limestone geology, geopolitics, socioeconomics, culture, technology, legislation, as well as climate change, acid rain, and harmful effects of the SMI scale on public health and safety, environmental well-being, and challenges facing the industry. Two field studies, carried out in northern and southern West Bank, dealing with particulate matter (PM 1 , PM 2.5 , PM 7 , PM 10 , and TSP) and environmental pollution, were analyzed, and their results were compared with each other, as well as with the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines. It is found that both West Bank's areas are heavily polluted, resulting in considerable adverse impacts on public health, the environment, and green cover. Based on the findings of this paper, it is recommended that SMI should properly adhere to WHO guidelines and international standards to make the industry safer and more durable and sustainable, with fewer negative impacts on public health, the environment, and green cover.",

These rocks and others, in various locations across the globe, are usually excavated by open-pit quarrying. Limestone, as a sedimentary rock, is a carbonate rock often composed of skeletal fragments of marine organisms, such as corals, foraminifera, and mollusks. Its major ingredients are the calcite and aragonite minerals, which have different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). A closely related rock to limestone is dolomite, which is also a The \"marble\" term used in the title of this paper is a trade (commercial) term, indicating the polished and finished limestone, which was naturally originated as a sedimentary rock. It is not the natural \"marble\" that was naturally originated as a metamorphic rock under high pressures and temperatures. Further details on this issue are given in the paper.",

Limestone and dolomite that belong to the same rock's group (sedimentary carbonates) share usually the same color that ranges from white-to-gray to white-to-light brown, and sometimes yellowish, pink, or rosy. Marble, on the other hand, is originally a natural limestone rock that is primarily composed of carbonate minerals (calcite, aragonite, and dolomite). Marble is a metamorphic rock, originated through the metamorphism process under high pressures and temperatures, transforming the sedimentary rocklimestone-into the metamorphic rock-marble. The color of marble is usually white-to-light gray, and sometimes bluish, dark gray, pink, or yellowish. Notably, the \"marble\" term, included in the Palestinian industry's name-Stone and Marble Industry (SMI), as being the focus of this paper-is widely and wrongly used in Palestine as a trade or commercial term rather than a scientific name. However, the metamorphic rock-marble-is not exposed in Palestine as an outcrop rock, and if used at small scales in Palestine, it is imported from abroad. Figure 1 shows two examples of polished limestone (sedimentary rock- Fig. 1a ) and polished marble (metamorphic rock- Fig. 1b) , whereas both of them are used for decorative purposes.",

            "text": "Both types of rocks (sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble) have several usages. They are often used for both construction and decoration purposes (Fig. 1a, b) , due to their beautiful coloration and glossy finish. There are two main types of building stones, which are dimension stone and decorative stone. Dimension stone is often extracted and prepared in blocks, according to standard specifications, and can be used without much processing; while decorative stone, after quarrying, is cut and/or carved to improve its appearance. Decorative stone is often used in indoor construction for decoration and monuments rather than as standard building material. These two types of rocks are used in building construction, due to their good properties, such as durability, attractiveness, and economy. They have been used for centuries to create iconic buildings in many cities around the world. It is often associated with luxury and extravagance, and as such it is used in many stately buildings, memorial buildings, and monuments. These include mosques, churches, cathedrals, temples, cemeteries, theaters, universities, public libraries, palaces, villas, hotels, malls, and so forth. For example, marble was used in famous buildings, including the Taj Mahal in Agra, India; Parthenon in Athens, Greece; and the US' Supreme Court in Washington, DC, USA. These two types of rocks (limestone and marble) are not only used for construction and decoration purposes, but their global markets can be segmented into several fields, including architecture, agriculture, pharmaceutics, and others. However, construction is the main consumer of both types of rocks, as they are used in various applications, including laying sidewalks, stairs, kitchen platforms, floors, sculpture, and exterior walls. Depending on the shape, limestone and marble products can be separated into widely used slabs and powders. The slabs are formed and shaped into tiles and blocks for suitable usages. Hence, stone markets in some countries around the world are booming, due to the great demand on both types of rocks. Also, the numerous applications and usages of both types of rocks have led to an increased demand for them, globally. The global demand for these two types of rocks is increasing, especially in the construction industry due to their aesthetics, such as beauty and sculpture, and their importance in other industries. The rapid growth of the construction industry, in particular, in many countries around the world is likely to increase the demand for both types of rockssedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble.",

The impact of particulate matter (PM) can be disproportionately large, even though PM only makes up a small fraction of the total suspended particles. The presence of high silica content in the dust indicates that the occupational environment of the workers and surrounding areas may be dangerous to human health. The air quality and sanitary survey conducted at the site indicated that the observed dust may cause significant damage to the health of the respiratory system of workers and others affected. The study, through a combination of an extensive air quality assessment and a limited set of health assessments, indicated the imminent need for a comprehensive occupational and environmental health management's strategy for this type of basic industry. It is hoped, however, that the information provided in the study will be used to provide additional impetus for environmental policy measures for the SMI's sector. Sivacoumar et al. (2006) Health screening of workers involved in the stone industry in India, as they are exposed to breathable crystalline silica and a number of other particles in both occupational and domestic conditions. The results showed high elevations in particulate air pollution, resulting from exposure under certain environmental and/or working conditions. Exposure of workers and their families to PM has the potential to impair lung function over a short period of time. Simple measures are needed to reduce exposure to PM from both occupational sources and the use of biomass fuels in homes in screened and similar sites. It is found that the overall environmental and local exposures to particles of 2.5 \u03bcm or less (\u2264 PM 2.5 ) were high. Semple et al.

Stone extraction and crushing involve a variety of processes that create exposure to a wide range of physical, chemical, and ergonomic hazards. Quarrying, drilling, blasting, breaking, loading, unloading, overhauling, crushing, and screening are just a few of these operations that work in all units, regardless of their size. Dust emissions represent considerable health risks to the workers involved in this industry, as well as to the inhabitants of local communities. Accordingly, the situation of occupational health and safety in this sector needs to be greatly improved. The World Bank (2012) Evaluated the environmental impacts of abandoned quarrying sites in Ibadan, Nigeria. Soil and water samples were collected at different locations in and around the study areas, in order to undertake laboratory analyses. Soil samples were analyzed for the determination of macronutrients and micronutrients, while water samples were analyzed for determination of the pH and several chemical constituents. The results obtained revealed that most of the deficiencies observed in chemical analyses of soil and water samples from the study areas have no direct link with previous mining operations carried out in the study areas. It was also revealed that the abandoned quarries of granite rocks have more of physical constraints than the chemical constraints. Akande et al.

The stone dust generated from the crusher units (10-11 t/day) is not only harmful to human's health, but also to other valuable components of the environment, such as air, water, soil, and green cover (forests and vegetation). As a result, the temperature increases by 1-1.5\u00b0C; the concentration of PM 10 was > 180 \u03bcg/m 3 in the lower atmosphere; health of vegetation was badly deteriorated; the soils were specifically degraded, as they became highly alkaline and with low organic carbon; the water quality was badly deteriorated (i.e., high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and low dissolved oxygen); loss of 15-60% of agricultural productivity; loss of fish productivity; and noise emissions exceeding the maximum permissible specified (> 85 dBA).

Filipova and Rasputna (2018) Carried out a qualitative analysis of the impacts of the quarrying industry in the municipality of Wenchi, Ghana. Information was collected from 90 households. The results indicated that the stone industry has positive and negative impacts on the economic, social, and environmental aspects of the Wenchi municipality, Ghana. Some of the positive effects include the support of local communities in providing social facilities and infrastructure. Some negative impacts were detected, namely soil degradation and loss of topsoil, pollution and vibration, as well as the development of cracks in buildings. Despite the negative impacts, the positive impacts seem to outweigh the negative ones, due to the corporate mitigation measures. It was concluded that quarrying has contributed to the socio-economic development of the Wenchi municipality in Ghana.

Available data and literature were analyzed, technically, culturally, environmentally, socioeconomically, health-wise, and legislation-wise. Also, some interviews were conducted with people living in the investigated areas. Particular emphasis is directed towards environmental and health impacts of the industry-SMI. It is noteworthy to mention that such environmental and health impacts were given very little attention by the Palestinian Government, as well as by researchers in Palestine. Most of the work published on the Palestinian SMI has focused on the SMI's positive impacts, particularly, the economic and financial ones. Therefore, this paper is the first of its kind, as it critically investigates, analyzes, and discusses several of the SMI's perspectives, mentioned above. Statistically, the data available on SMI in Palestine indicates that the published work in internationally peer-reviewed periodicals is very little, though some Palestinian universities are directly involved in SMI. However, some technical reports about the economic dimension of SMI are made available by local and international organizations.",

This is in terms of the damages and adverse impacts caused by SMI to the environment, public health, and green cover. This can be attributed to the lack of control and monitoring system on the industry, and due to the lack of law enforcement. This requires from the Palestinian ministries and institutions in charge to undertake an evaluation of such damages and impacts resulted from the air, water, soil, and noise pollution caused by SMI. In view of this, some strategies are needed to be implemented, regarding SMI, in order to improve the industry, to make it environmentally friendly, and with less adverse impacts to the environment, public health, and green cover. At the same time, it is needed to keep SMI greatly productive and rewarding, economically and financially, so that the private sector (companies, families, and communities) and the public sector (in terms of tax revenues) can greatly benefit from it. While the evidence from environmental and health points of view shows that pollution caused by SMI imposes an economic cost to the Palestinian society, urgent steps should be taken to control the sources of pollution originated from SMI. However, if nothing would be done to improve the industry, with respect to its laws and regulations, as well as to short-term and long-term strategies, the SMI's impacts will be devastating. This is particularly important in view of climate change impacts (higher temperatures, less precipitation, etc.), as well as the widespread of infectious diseases, such as Covid-19 and others.",

According to the Oslo Agreements signed in 1993/1995 between the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships, the OWB was divided into area A (forming about 18% of the OWB and is controlled by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), security-wise and administration-wise), area B (forming about 22% of the OWB and is controlled by the PNA, administration-wise and by the Israeli Occupation Authorities (IOA), security-wise), and area C (forming about 60% of the OWB, and is totally controlled by the IOA, administration-wise and security-wise) (Salem 2019a; . Most of the quarrying sites and the major natural rock reserves are located in area C, whereas the PNA presumably imposes a ban on quarrying in densely populated regions located in area A and area B. According to a representative of the union of SMI in Palestine, the industry struggles from a set of different challenges, many of which are common to all Palestinian industries, such as those created by the Israeli Occupation Authorities. The major natural rock reserves are located in the Israeli-controlled area C, where acquiring permits for opening new quarries is extremely difficult and close to impossible. The SMI will soon face severe problems if quarries are unable to expand into area C, because the currently accessible reserves in area A and area B are being depleted (TPT 2019).",

These impacts result from rock quarrying and crushing operations in open areas, cutting and polishing of massive rock blocks in stone-cutting plants, pulverization, chemical alteration, and transportation of rocks, as well as from building and construction's activities. The SMI's activities result in air, water, soil, and noise pollution, in addition to their negative impacts on the green cover (trees and vegetation). Furthermore, this industry, as largely being an uncontrolled industry, has certainly increased the amounts of the waste generated from its operations, including the limestone waste (LSW).",

            "text": "When dealing with SMI's environmental impacts, a special attention should be given to the amount of water used during the various processes of SMI. Roughly, half a million cubic meter (500,000 m 3 = 0.5 MCM) of fresh water are used in this industry annually (Paltrade 2013) . Though this water is used at various stages in the value chain of the SMI's excavation and production, the main purpose of the water consumed is to cool and lubricate the saws used to cut the massive blocks and large slabs of limestone. This large amount of fresh water is turned into an environmental hazard when mixed with the dust and powder generated from the processes of stone cutting, resulting in heavy, viscous wastewater in the form of wet mud, commonly known as \"slurry\" generated from the processes of cutting and shaping the limestone, with an annual quantity of around 600,000 t (600 million kg). This is in addition to the dry mud, with an annual amount of around 190,000 t (190 million kg). Additionally, the limestone's remains, resulting from the manufacturing processes, are estimated at an annual amount of about 450,000 t (450 million kg) (Al-Joulani 2008; Paltrade 2013; Al-Joulani and Salah 2014; Ihsheish and Falah 2018) (Fig. 6a-f ). This means that the total solid and fluid waste generated annually from the Palestinian SMI is no less than 1.24 million ton (1.24 billion kg). If this amount of waste is multiplied by 25, it means that we have had approximately 31 million ton (31 billion kg) of waste just in the last 25 years alone. Accordingly, one can imagine the damages caused by such large amounts of waste to the public health, the environment, biodiversity, and ecosystems. LSW contains suspensions of solids, varying between 5000 and 12,000 mg/l (Al-Joulani 2008), which (solids) consist mainly of high-purity calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) of between 94% and 98% (Al-Joulani and Salah 2014). Luckily, the hazardous heavy metals' concentration in the LSW in Palestine is very low, suggesting an inert waste (JICA 2017). The LSW, in the form of powder generated from the stone-cutting and turned into slurry when mixed with cooling water, is considerably large in volume. Approximately 49 m 3 of stone is wasted as powder when 181 m 3 of stone blocks were cut into stone slabs of 2 cm thickness, and approximately 78 m 3 of stone is wasted as powder when 365 m 3 of stone blocks were cut into stone slabs of 3 cm thickness (Alhaj 2013) . Accordingly, the quantity of stone, wasted as powder, ranges from about 21% (78/365) to about 27% (49/181) for 3-cm and 2-cm slabs' thicknesses, respectively. This indicates that an inverse relationship exists between the cutting thickness and the percentage of the generated powder waste, meaning that the less the thickness of the slabs cut, the greater the amount of the powder's waste generated.",

The wet LSW either flows in open areas (Fig. 6c-f) , causing harm to the soil and green cover, or is dumped in sewerage systems, creating blockage and damage to the pumping stations. LSW (wet and dry), generated through quarrying and cutting operations in Palestine ( Fig. 6a-f ), reduces soil fertility, due to changes in the pH-value, electric conductivity (EC), salinity, and total dissolved solids (TDS). According to laboratory measurements, the EC of different soil samples, contaminated by LSW, dropped by a range of 30-60%; and by adding more LSW to the soil's samples, the pH decreased from 6.72 to 6.63, meaning that it became more acidic; the TDS decreased by a range of \u224813-31%; and by adding only 3% (by weight) of LSW to the investigated soil's samples, the samples' permeability (hydraulic conductivity) decreased by a range of 46-92% (Al-Joulani 2007; Al-Joulani 2008). Also, as time passing, some of the wet LSW infiltrates, at slow speed, the surface soils and subsurface layers through fissures, ruptures, and cracks, reaching the groundwater aquifer systems and, thus, contaminating their water storage. On the other hand, when LSW becomes highly viscous, thick, and heavy, it prevents rainwater from infiltrating the surface to recharge the aquifer systems, as it considerably disturbs the physical properties of the affected soils and underlying layers and, thus, reduces the drainage system.",

Fig. 7 a A diagram illustrating how acid rain is formed: (1) Emissions of SO 2 and NO x are released into the air, where (2) the pollutants are transformed into acid particles that may be transported long distances, (3) these acid particles then fall to the Earth as wet and dry deposition (dust, rain, snow, etc.), and (4) those acid particles may cause harmful effects on soil, forests, streams, and lakes (after EPA 2020). b NASA's spectacular image of the sandstorm swept the Middle East (started on September 8, 2015 and lasted for more than a week) (after Salem 2015) Both studies carried out measurements for different localities in each of the areas investigated, with respect to rockquarrying sites and stone-cutting plants in both areas. The ground distance between the operational rock-quarrying sites and the stone-cutting plants, on the one hand, and the airquality monitoring devices, on the other, is in the range of hundreds of meters. Those in situ monitoring processes included measurements of the particulate matter with all sizes (PM s ) and the total suspended particulates (TSP) in \u03bcg/m 3 (\u03bcg = 0.001 mg). The PM s included measurements of 1 \u03bcm or less in diameter (\u2264 PM 1 ), 2.5 \u03bcm or less in diameter (\u2264 PM 2.5 ), 7 \u03bcm or less in diameter (\u2264 PM 7 ), and 10 \u03bcm or less in diameter (\u2264 PM 10 ) ( Table 2) . Table 2 , summarizing the results of the two studies, indicates that both areas investigated are highly polluted. However, the sites investigated in Beit Fajjar, southern West Bank, are less polluted than those investigated in Jammain, northern West Bank. It is noteworthy to mention that the Beit Fajjar's study was undertaken in mid-March 2009, while the Jammain's study is not known when it was undertaken. Furthermore, the measurements' results for both areas show wide differences, in relation to the WHO guidelines for PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and TSP (Table 2) . Table 2 also indicates that the emitted particulates from the limestone quarries in both investigated areas are believed to be comparatively big, as the readings increase gradually and obviously from PM 1 to PM 2.5 to PM 7 , and to PM 10 . This could be an indication that the particulates emitted by the investigated rock-quarrying sites and stonecutting plants are not carried on very long distances. This situation generally depends on the weather conditions, mainly wind speed and humidity, as well as whether it was raining or not at the time of measurements. The results given in Table 2 suggest that the very high concentrations of PM s and TSP in both areas of investigation represent real problems, regarding public health, including the health of workers who are directly working on sites, and the health of population who are living in the near neighborhoods, as well as the well-being of the environment, ecosystems, and green cover. According to the results obtained from the questionnaire distributed among farmers in the Jammain's area, 95% of the respondents stated that their yields of crops have decreased by at least 30% annually (Sayara et al. 2016 ). The adverse impacts of air pollution, resulting from SMI's activities, might be attributed to several factors, including (1) dust that covers the leaves of plants creates a thick white layer that decreases the total chlorophyll cells exposed to light and, thus, reduces the total photosynthetic activity; (2) dust can also reduce plant's growth (number of leaves, leaf surface and size, etc.), affecting, therefore, photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration systems of the affected plants; (3) some released chemical compounds, accompanying the released dust from SMI, are injurious and can be considerably harmful to the plants affected; (4) dust can badly affect leaf trichomes (hairs) and, therefore, decrease the natural defense' mechanisms of the affected trees and vegetation against pests and diseases; and (5) dust causes considerable degradation of the soil fertility characteristics, including changes in the physical, chemical, biological, and mechanical properties, such as the pore size (porosity), permeability, and electric conductivity of soils (as indicated above), leading to reduction of the water-holding capacity of the affected soils, which results in decreasing crops' yield over time (e.g., Hirano et al. 1990; Farmer 1993; Naik et al. 2006; Lameed and Ayodele 2010; Matsuki et al. 2016; Sett 2017) . Many of these adverse impacts, affecting soils and the green cover (vegetation and trees), appeared in the Jammain area, where the air pollution's measurements were carried out in northern West Bank (Sayara et al. 2016) , and also in the Beit Fajjar area, where the air pollution measurements were carried out in southern West Bank, as discussed below.",

These may have components that include minerals of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and others, as well as gases such as sulfur oxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ), as happened in other regions of the world (Table 1 ). The presence of these pollutants in the atmosphere, especially SO 2 and NO x , can cause acid rain, resulting from the reaction between these oxides and water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere, forming sulfuric and nitric acids that fall to the ground as acid rain (Fig. 7a) . Kalu and Ogbonna (2019) tested some water and soil samples taken from vicinities of quarry sites in Nigeria, and found that the rainwater was acidic, containing many metallic ions. That was attributed to the suspended particulates \u2264 PM 10 released from quarries' dust to the air and soil. Compared with the dry season, the analyses indicated that the effect of acid rain was more evident directly at the quarry sites, and the negative environmental effects were more prevalent in the older quarry sites, due to the length of quarrying operations (Kalu and Ogbonna 2019) . These observations were also noticed by Peter et al. (2018) through their study on other quarry sites in Nigeria.",

However, as much as the SMI's activities intensify, the amount of SO 2 , NO x , and CO 2 will also increase, especially in the presence of other airpolluting sources. These include other kinds of industrial activities (Salem 2009 ) and traffic, which can cause acid rain, and also intensify the heavy, adverse impacts of KWs. The term \"Khamsin,\" derived from the Arabic word for \"fifty,\" represents a 50-day period of dry, hot, sandy, silty, and dusty winds that originate mainly in the North-African deserts and move towards the Mediterranean Basin and, thus, affecting the region of the entire Basin. This 50-day period of KWs can be divided into two equal sub-periods: one in spring (from March to May) and the other in autumn (from September to November) (Philologos 2003 ). The KWs usually take place in these two sub-periods, but due to climate change impacts, they sometimes take place in other times of the year. When the KWs blow, causing sand, silt, and dust storms (Fig. 7b) , and carrying heavy amounts of PM s , their damages will be much more devastating, especially in the presence of SMI's activities. The combination of SMI's activities, KWs, and climate change impacts can result in considerable air pollution that may cause severe damages to public health, the environment, biodiversity, water systems, and ecosystems. Kittipongvises (2017) investigated the impact of SMI (limestone quarries) on climate change in Thailand, by using a life cycle assessment's approach. The study showed that the amount of process-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the SMI's operational sites were about 2.76 kg CO 2 eq./t. However, the study revealed that the GHGs' emissions were mainly from the consumption of large amounts of diesel fuel to generate electricity that used to crush and grind limestone rocks. In view of this, more research should be done to investigate the linkage between the environmental pollution caused by SMI, on the one hand, and climate change impacts, on the other.",

The other event happened, according to Watan (2014) , when a young boy, under the age of 18, fell from the top of a stone-cutting plant, hit the saw machine, and was killed immediately. This happened though the Palestinian Ministry of Labor's law prevents the work of juveniles. In addition to these and other horrifying SMI's accidents, the residents of Beit Fajjar keep talking about the extinction of many fruitful trees that Beit Fajjar used to be famous of, such as olives, grapes, almonds, quince, peach, and grains-all of which used to be sold in the markets of the big cities of Bethlehem and Jerusalem. Today, Beit Fajjar's residents buy vegetables and fruits from other places of the West Bank. In brief, Beit Fajjar and other areas that host rock-quarrying and crushing sites, and stone-cutting facilities have turned into disastrous highly polluted areas, according to Palestinian residents living close to them (Watan 2014) .",

This is in addition to the lack of adequate techniques and equipment, and the lack of environmental waste management's system. This means that proper laws and regulations should be legislated and enforced. Also, penalties should be applied against those who violate the laws and regulations in effect, in order to protect SMI's workers, public health, and the environment; to manage, in a sustainable manner, the natural resources, including limestone, as being a precious resource; and also to manage all kinds of waste generated from this industry-SMI. The lack of certain laws and regulations or the weakness in applying them, in relation to SMI in the OPT, has encouraged some people to seize lands that do not belong to them (especially in area A and area B) and to establish on those lands new quarries, crushers and/or stone-cutting plants, and also to expand the areas that they already use for their SMI's operations, without being questioned. The other problem is the irresolute governmental control over the industry-SMI-even in area A and area B, which are, as discussed above, under direct administration of the Palestinian National Authority. The provisions, concerning the licensing of quarrying activities and permitting the operations of quarrying and excavation of rocks, are expressly stipulated in the \"Natural Resources Law No. 1/1999 \" (BZU 1999 . For instance, the Fourth Chapter, Article (13) of the Natural Resources Law No. 1/1999 states, under \"Search and Exploration of Natural Resources,\" the following: \"No person may search, excavate, extract or exploit any natural or mineral source from the ground within the Palestinian lands, regional waters and its exclusive economic zone, except after obtaining a license to do so from the Ministry in return for a fee determined by the Ministry under a special system issued by the Ministry\" (BZU 1999).",

These challenges and others have considerably hindered the development of SMI; weakened its strength and competitiveness (particularly since the Oslo Agreements were signed in 1993/1995 between the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships, as indicated above); and worsened the industry's circumstances and conditions. Geopolitically The Palestinian SMI has been facing many restrictions imposed by the Israeli Occupation Authorities (IOA), which represent the most impeding challenge facing SMI in the OPT. This is due to the fact that most of the quarrying sites are located in area C, which forms more than 60% of the occupied West Bank's total area and is entirely controlled by the IOA, administration-wise and security-wise, as mentioned earlier. So, under these circumstances, this challenge forms a strategic threat that has been, actually, materialized and greatly realized since 1993/1995. The Israeli restrictions on SMI also include acquiring of new excavation's permits or renewal of the existing ones. These include heavy restrictions on excavation's facilities, tools, and equipment needed for SMI. According to the Palestinian Union of Stone and Marble (USM), acquiring permits from the IOA for excavation in new quarries is not an easy task at all (USM 2011; TPT 2019). The Palestinian owners of quarries, existing in area C, have to endure arbitrary procedures and continuous raids by the IOA, which result in heavy fines on them and confiscation of their equipment. Meanwhile, the Israeli companies, operating in area C, can quarry large amounts of rocks, freely, easily, and all the time (Ghattas et al. 2016) , as well as without facing any of the IOA restrictions that are enforced on the Palestinian owners of quarries in the same area-area C.",

            "text": "In addition, an endogenous, national challenge facing SMI is the fact that the Israeli settlements built illegally on lands of the occupied West Bank are built with stones taken from Palestinian quarries and stone-cutting plants in the West Bank. This, in turn, prolongs the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories, and strengthens the occupation's economy at the expense of the Palestinian economy which is already weak and fragile, in comparison with the Israeli economy (Khalidi and Taghdisi-Rad 2009; Kubala 2015; DAAR 2020) . Moreover, SMI faces other challenges, including more predicaments and difficulties at the Israeli crossings. For instance, the process of back-to-back truck's loading and unloading impedes the transfer of products to the Israeli market and the exports to foreign destinations, and, thus, increasing shipping costs (Ihsheish and Falah 2018) . By doing so, Israel strongly violates international law and treaties. It is prohibited, according to international law, to operate any kind of industries, such as the Israeli quarries existing in area C, which is due to the fact that this area is part of the West Bank occupied militarily by the Israeli Occupation Authorities in 1967. Paragraph 1 of the Principle of Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources (UNGA Res. 1803 (XVII)) states \"The right of peoples and nations to permanent sovereignty over their natural wealth and resources must be exercised in the interest of their national development and of the well-being of the people of the State concerned\" (UN 1962) .",

Pit miners still use traditional methods of quarrying, which can lead to great losses, due to drilling in wrong places that include sites of rocks of bad quality. In addition, most, if not all, quarries and stone-cutting plants, as well as stone crushers lack modern equipment required to properly treat waste and, thus, suitable waste collection's sites are very scarce. Also, equally challenging is the lack of skilled labor with good management, planning, and marketing skills. In an effort to enhance capacity building, the Palestinian Stone and Marble Center (PSMC) was established in 2009 at the Palestine Polytechnic University (PPU), Hebron, West Bank, in cooperation with the Ministry of National Economy and the Union of Stone and Marble (USM). The PSMC aims at supplying SMI with skilled labor, and also aims at conducting the required tests for export-oriented stone products. The Center's deliverables are, unfortunately, still below expectations, according to Ihsheish and Falah (2018) .",

For instance, a total of 87% of the studied quarries in Lebanon represents serious hazards to groundwater quality, and approximately 62% of the quarries are located in a highly unsuitable environment (Darwish et al. 2011 ). The situation in Lebanon, however, is not much different than that in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, though there is no data available about such issue in Palestine. Accordingly, the Palestinian governmental institutions in charge should pay attention to this issue-the rock-quarries and stone-cutting plants that are out of business-and, thus, should make every effort to rehabilitate and reuse them, effectively, for different purposes.",

Accordingly, a combination of extensive air quality assessment and public health assessment indicates a pressing requirement for a comprehensive occupational and environmental health management's strategy that is urgently needed for SMI. (2) There is strong scientific evidence that high concentrations of nanoparticulates (\u2264 PM 1 ) and microparticulates (\u2264 PM 2.5 ) pose greater health risks than other particulate matter, such as \u2264 PM 7 and \u2264 PM 10 . It is noteworthy to mention that particulate matter is a term referring to airborne particles, including dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. Systematic monitoring procedures of the particulates \u2264 PM 1 and \u2264 PM 2.5 , specifically, should be regularly carried out at the SMI's sites. (3) Questionnaires should be distributed among SMI's workers and residents of SMI's neighborhoods to know the occupational safety, health risks, and the workers' awareness levels of those risks. (4) Based on the fact that SMI pollutes, not only the air, but also water and soil, samples of surface water, groundwater, and soil should be frequently collected at different locations in and around the SMI's sites, and laboratory analyses should be undertaken to find out the level of SMI's pollution affecting water and soil. (5) SMI's workers should be educated and well-trained on how to use protective clothing while working. Hence, there is an urgent need to provide them with training programs and personal protective equipment to reduce health impacts and safety risks affecting SMI's workers. (6) Clinical research should be carried out on SMI's workers to confirm any development of SMI's related diseases. (7) A multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, health care specialists, environmentalists, industrialists, economists, and other professionals concerned must be formed to conduct annual surveying on the SMI's sites, in order to check the licensing processes, and monitor the mitigation measures related to the safety and health of the SMI's workers, the well-being of the environment and the residents living in the SMI's neighborhoods. (8) Occupational safety and awareness programs, as well as medical and workers' screening must be implemented. (9) Research must be conducted to study SMI's waste management and the feasibility of utilizing it in several industries. (10) Attempts should be done to model the socioeconomic, environmental, and health impacts, regarding SMI, in general, and the abandoned quarries and stone-cutting sites, in particular.",

The largest quarries in northern Jordan are located in urban areas. Due to the limestone quarrying activities (such as drilling, blasting, exploration, and transportation), a primary source of increased level of PM 10 was observed, which has led to air pollution of the surrounding areas.
