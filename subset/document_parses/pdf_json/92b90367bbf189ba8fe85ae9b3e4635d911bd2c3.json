First, data from GT are used to predict COVID-19 incidences or to communicate risks [13] . An increasing number of studies covering occurrence and risks appearing in different countries was published. Second, the initial reports describing the coronavirus were mainly dominated by the presence of cough, difficult breathing, and fever. GT reveals, e.g., interest in various other coronavirus symptoms, like loss of taste and smell, before these symptoms were identified as typical for infection [29] . Third, GT is used to measure interest in nonpharmaceutical interventions, e.g. personal protection measures like protection masks, hand washing, social distancing and mobility restrictions [15, 27] .",

            "text": "This study has some limitations. First, Google's popularity varies globally. For example, the search engine is not very popular in Russia, China, Japan, and South Korea. In the rest of the world, Google has more than half of the search market share. Therefore, for regions where Google has a higher market share, the results may be more representative. Second, by selecting the keyword \"diabetes\" for search through PubMed, we may have overlooked more suitable terms introduced through literature. In a One Health approach, in addition to focusing on the health effects of the human population, it is also important to consider implications for and interactions with nature and the environment. In particular, the various corona viruses with their zoonotic origins teach us not to neglect veterinary public health issues [9, 24] . As [11] describe, the health of humans, animals, and ecosystems should be reconnected, and Google Trends data can also provide a usable database for research on nature conservation issues [11, 30] . From a One Health perspective, existing data can therefore be ideally combined and evaluated in a multidisciplinary approach in further studies and thus go beyond the disease focus. For example, Big Data are available from PubMed and Google Trends, which enable a variety of multifactorial evaluations and are to be used more intensively in the future. The present work exemplarily shows the use of several data sources and provides insights for further studies as well as for a better knowledge of how Google Trends takes health and medical search terms into account during a pandemic situation. Therefore, it creates a basis for future research on epidemic data with information from search engines and databases. In summary, it can be suggested that, in addition to the scientific challenges of the coronavirus crisis itself, the current situation could favour the publication of papers as a positive factor, which is based on contactless data analysis in silico.",
