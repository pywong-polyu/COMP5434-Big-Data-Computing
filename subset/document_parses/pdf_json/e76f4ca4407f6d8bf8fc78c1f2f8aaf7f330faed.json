The viral RNA is surrounded by the nucleocapsid. The overall structure looks similar to other viruses of the Coronaviridae family. The S-protein forms a clover-shaped trimer, with three S1 heads and a trimeric S2 stalk. The envelope-anchored spike protein guides coronavirus entry into host cells. This state of the spike on the mature virions is called \"prefusion\" [1, [8] [9] [10] . After viral replication and before the viral release, the spike proteins move from the Golgi apparatus to cell membrane, and the ribonucleoprotein core interact with this S-rich membrane. Not microscopic evidence of this final stage has previously been shown for SARS-CoV-2, but following its similarity with SARS-CoV, understanding its historical similarity with that of this characteristic has been assumed [8] .",

            "text": "It is important to note that this high-resolution microscopy study was done directly in positive SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples rather than viruses grown in cell cultures as the previous investigation of the topology of virions made in the past for SARS-CoV [11, 14] . However, our observation is very close to describing the real cellular pathology and damage of SARS-CoV-2 to the respiratory tissue in the patients. The use of hyperimmune serum of a convalescent patient could lead to the detection of other viruses, due to cross-reactivity with other co-infecting viruses such as influenza virus. Thus, it will be preferable to use a mono-specific (S proteinspecific). This could be possible to cross-reactivity with another respiratory virus that could be present in the sample. If they use a different cellular receptor to ACE2 (e.g. influenza A virus), the coinfection is possible, and a false positive signal will be recorded and misunderstand as SARS-CoV-2 [8, [22] [23] [24] .",
