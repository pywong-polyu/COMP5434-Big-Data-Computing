Seventy-two hours after the admission to the ICU, a decompressive craniectomy was necessary due to edema of the left hemisphere with a midline shift of 6 mm. Further ICP management was uncomplicated. On the day of the second intervention, the patient developed a maculopapular erythematous exanthema, which progressed to a papulovesicular rash within 24-48 hours.

His body temperature was 39 \u00b0C. About 72 hours after the admission, a maculopapular erythematous exanthema predominantly on the trunk and upper and lower extremities was noted. Mucosae, palmar surfaces of hands, and plantar surfaces of feet were spared (Fig. 1) . The exanthema was initially interpreted as a possible cutaneous manifestation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, over the following days the exanthema progressed to a papulovesicular rash. The patient developed severe septic shock requiring volume substitution and high-dose vasoactive agents, as well as progressive respiratory failure with rapidly rising oxygen demand.",

A PCR from a swab taken from a cutaneous vesicular lesion was positive for VZV and negative for herpes simplex virus types 1-2 and SARS-CoV-2.

Microbiological testing of the tracheal secretion revealed a polymicrobial bacterial flora with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens.

A chickenpox-like rash with a median latency period of 3 days and a median duration of 8 days is being considered a rare but specific manifestation of COVID-19 [9] . Vesicular lesions seem to appear mostly in the early stages of COVID-19 in middleaged patients and are usually associated with an intermediate severity of the disease. On the other hand, the potential immunosuppressant effect of COVID-19 could not only facilitate the development of possible coinfections but also have an influence on their severity. In vitro studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could affect the quantity and the function of cluster of differentiation(CD)4+ and CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells [3, 5] . It could also affect the synthesis and functionality of interferons 1 and 2, which lead to higher viral loads [2, 4] . Both mechanisms may lead to significant immunosuppression. Bacterial coinfections and superinfections have been described in up to 28% of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU [10] . They have a great prognostic and therapeutic impact, and early implementation of empiric antibiotic therapy is often crucial in case of progressive pulmonary deterioration. Viral coinfections, in contrast, appear to be less common. Lansbury et al. reported viral coinfections in 3% of patients with COVID-19 [11] . The possible role of SARS-CoV-2 in the reactivation of viral infections such as VZV and herpes simplex virus has been suggested previously [12, 13] . In the clinical case described here, the cause of the skin lesions was a primary VZV infection, not a reactivation, which is a rare condition in adulthood, representing only 5% of all varicella cases. Nevertheless, mortality in adults is responsible for up to 55% of all varicella-related deaths [14] . Similar average incubation periods of COVID-19 and varicella as well as the timing of clinical manifestations in our patient lead us to the conclusion that VZV and COVID-19 were in our case community-acquired coinfections.",

Pregnancy, history of pulmonary disease, and smoking, as well as a compromised immune system, render patients more susceptible to pulmonary complications of varicella [15] . Varicella pneumonia is associated with a mortality of around 10% in adult patients, which almost doubles in the absence of antiviral treatment [16] . Varicella pneumonia usually becomes symptomatic 1-6 days after the onset of the rash, presenting with signs of massive respiratory distress. Acyclovir reduces mortality and should be initiated early in patients with suspected or diagnosed varicella-pneumonia [16] . In this case, it may be postulated that a compromised immune system due to several factors including trauma and operation but also as a consequence of the COVID-19 might have made our patient prone to pulmonary complications of varicella. Therefore, the onset of unusual skin lesions should raise suspicion of a concomitant infectious process, prior to interpreting the entire picture as COVID-19 related.",

This case of an adult presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection and simultaneous primary VZV infection illustrates the importance of considering coinfections in patients with COVID-19 with unusual clinical manifestations.
