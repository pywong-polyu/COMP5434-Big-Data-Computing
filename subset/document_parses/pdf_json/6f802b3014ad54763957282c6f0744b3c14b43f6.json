This importance has been recently highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, in which, despite being a global event, local conditions are needed in decision making for both community members and public health experts (Gollust, Fowler, and Niederdeppe 2019; Branswell 2018) .",

Another example of this phenomenon has been termed the Sinclair Effect after the wide ownership of local cable news by the Sinclair Broadcast Group.

However, despite local media's known and well documented importance, local news article data is rare, particularly at a large scale over time. Hence, there are very few large scale studies of local news environments. For example, many of the current studies utilize journalist interviews, small, study specific collections that are not made publicly available, or large data about ownership that does not capture article content. While these data sources are certainly useful, many research questions cannot be sufficiently explored using them. For example: How do local outlets differ in the coverage of major events? What sub-topics of coverage are emphasized? How much content is shared across local outlets? What proportions of coverage are dedicated to local issues, rather than national events? To explore these types of large-scale, content-based questions, researchers need stable collections of news article data.",

Furthermore, to aid studies using this dataset, we have mapped several open county-level datasets to each outlet, allowing researchers to estimate characteristics about each outlet's local audience. This county-level metadata includes demographics, political leanings, and community resilience estimates. Our hope is that this data can not only fuel novel, large-scale research on local news environments, but also benefit current lines of local media research.",

On average, the dataset has 1.23 outlets per county and 6.80 outlets per state (see KDE plots in Figure 3h and 3i). The max number of outlets in a single county is 11 (Middlesex County, MA) and the max number of outlets in a single state is 33 (Massachusetts). Two notes about the skew towards Massachusetts: First, 20 of the outlets in Massachusetts are all run by the same parent company, WickedLocal, and could be combined or removed depending on the analysis being done. However, these 20 sites do produce different content. Second, Middlesex County is the most populous county in both Massachusetts and New England 9 . In addition to geography, we see diversity in various demographic factors. On average, the populations of counties in our dataset are 37.6% rural, with the minimum percent rural being 0% and the maximum being 100% (See KDE plot in Figure 3d ). To add context, an example of a county with 0% rural population in our dataset is Denver County, Colorado and a county with 100% is Lewis County, Kentucky. On average, counties contain a population of 355,998.82, with a minimum population of 4347 and maximum population of 10,057,155. Furthermore, the average median household income per county is $52,077.22, with a minimum of $28,136 and maximum of $115,224 (see KDE plot in Figure  3e ).

Similar to Media Cloud, the NELA-GT datasets contain a large variety of news outlets around the globe and includes low-veracity, disinformation-peddling outlets. While similar in collection method, NELA-Local is not focused on providing data for veracity tasks, but rather providing data to examine local news environments.
