            "text": "How can countries cooperate to shelter migrants? We use experimental economics to study the distinct challenges of cooperation in migrant crises. We designed an economic game, pass the buck, where participants are leaders of countries who decide whether to shelter migrants or pass them to the next country. We examine the difficulties posed by one-way migration and differences in wealth. We find that leaders sheltered migrants less often when they received them first on a one-way route, compared to when everyone received migrants at the same time. Moreover, the first leader became more likely to shelter migrants when the last country could return them to the first. When one country was wealthier, the wealthy leader sheltered more and the other leaders passed more. We discuss the implications for international cooperation in migrant crises. 'We can do it!' exclaimed Chancellor Angela Merkel on August 31, 2015 as she announced that Germany would welcome hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees 1 . Germany's announcement showed not only compassion for refugees but also remarkable solidarity with European nations who had struggled with migrant crises. Previously, European governments argued over who was responsible for caring for migrants. As often happens, some governments diverted migrants to neighboring countries to avoid the costs of sheltering them. For instance, governments transported African migrants and Syrian refugees back and forth across European borders, even trespassing the border with the military to enforce deportation 2,3 . Similarly, the US disputed with Mexico over migrants from Honduras 4 while Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia argued over their responsibilities for Burmese and Bangladeshi migrants 5 .",

But migrant crises differ from standard dilemmas such as the prisoner's dilemma and the public goods game. Due to the constraints of geography, economics, and politics, migrants often follow one-way routes. Countries at the beginning of the route receive most of the migrants and then decide whether to shelter them or pass them to the next country by various means, including by force, encouragements, neglect, and weakening security at the borders. If the first government passes the migrants, then the next government makes the same decision. Migrants may be unable to return to the previous country, creating a one-way route 11 . Thus, the first government decides whether to shelter, and the next governments face the same choice only when the previous government passes.",

            "text": "Of course, governments often refuse to shelter migrants because sheltering is expensive 12, 13 and may anger voters 14 . For instance, in 2017, Italy spent over 4 billion euros to care for migrants 15 . At the peak of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2016, Germany spent 20 billion euros 16 . Governments might try to dodge these costs leading to a tragic game of pass the buck, where each government diverts the costs to other countries which only adds to the total cost of the crisis. When countries pay costs to transport migrants or encourage them to move on, these expenses do not resolve the crisis but only add to the total costs while passing on the responsibility to other countries. Also, diverting migrants can duplicate expenses such as the costs of determining refugee status, screening for health conditions, and providing temporary housing in detention centers. International accords such as the UN Global Compact aim to manage this problem, but they are not binding 17 . Sheltering migrants depends on the goodwill of governments such as Germany in 2015 18 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The European Union has designed rules to regulate migrant crises. The Dublin Regulation prescribes that the country where migrants first arrive must register and shelter them if they cannot be legally returned to the country of origin 19 . But this principle of first arrival is rarely enforced because most migrants arrive at the same southern countries 20, 21 , and these countries argue that the principle is unfair 20 . The first countries divert migrants to neighboring countries in various ways, such as failing to register migrants, letting them leave detention centers, and overlooking stowaways on trains 22 . Many migrants travel throughout the EU 23 and end their journey in the wealthier countries in northern Europe. Overall, this situation harms migrants and adds to the costs for the host countries.",

If they pass, then they pay 2 dollars to transport the migrants to the second leader, who then decides to shelter or pass to the third leader. If the second leader passes, then the third leader must pay 3 dollars to shelter the migrants, because they are at the end of the route. Importantly, to model a one-way route a leader can pass migrants only to the next leader and not backward. The leaders have common knowledge of all aspects of the game. Figure 1 shows the game. As the payoffs make clear, the leaders face a social dilemma. If the first leader shelters, then the group's payoffs are $9 in total. But if everyone passes, the group's payoffs decrease to $5 in total. Particularly, each time a leader passes, they save $1 for themselves while diminishing the group's payoff by $2 (out of a possible $9, or 22%). Hence, passing is best for the individual but inefficient for the group.",

Concrete themes add the content and frames that the mind uses to make decisions in a complex world, alongside the quantities and payoffs that they frame. Thus people's decisions depend on both payoffs and frames, and not only economic frames such as gains and losses 37 but also social frames such as relationships and morality 36, [38] [39] [40] . Since framing affects people's decisions, matching the theme better approximates the dilemmas under study. We also note that the migrant theme is constant across conditions so it could not explain differences between conditions.

This observation underscores how difficult it is for governments to cooperate in migrant crises. We further dissected the problem with experimental manipulations. In Experiments 1 and 2, when migrants arrived everywhere symmetrically, roughly half of the first leaders sheltered the migrants, substantially more than the one-way route. This supports the hypothesis that cooperation is more difficult on one-way routes because they preclude the hope of reciprocity, which is a critical foundation for cooperation 44 . Thus, cooperation improved when the migrants arrived everywhere so that leaders could shelter and hope for the same from their neighbors, even though their self-interest was the same and they didn't know if others in fact cooperated.",

This result confirms that one-way routes are difficult because leaders can pass the burden without consequences. When the migrants could be returned, cooperation improved substantially, indicating that the cooperators looked ahead in the game and rationally responded to the deterrent. The threat of future costs in the circular route is similar to the threat of defection in future rounds of a repeated social dilemma, often called the shadow of the future 44 . Accordingly, the difficulty of cooperation on one-way routes, where shirking lacks future consequences, mirrors the classic finding that cooperation unravels without a shadow of the future. Further, this comparison suggests that leaders would cooperate less when future consequences are uncertain, such as when the regulations that assign responsibilities are not reliably enforced.",

This result supports the hypothesis that leaders considered fairness in their decisions to shelter, causing them to depart from self-interest which was constant as wealth www.nature.com/scientificreports/ varied [28] [29] [30] . As a result, the group's efficiency depended on the rich leader's place along the route. The group was most efficient when the first leader was rich and least efficient when the last leader was rich. Thus, these findings show that one-way routes are further complicated when the wealthier countries are down the line. This consequence of fairness particularly applies to migrant crises in Europe and North America, where migrants arrive at poorer countries such as Greece and Mexico before wealthier countries such as Germany and the United States. Future work could examine other distributions of wealth such as two rich countries and one poor country, along with varying their order on the route. This could help understand more international situations, such as the combination of wealthy countries in Northern Europe relative to neighbors along the migrant routes. Importantly, the results of these experiments do not automatically generalize to government leaders in a migrant crisis, who must weigh many additional considerations. We use methods from experimental economics to isolate key elements of these problems including unequal burdens, the sequence of decisions, differences in wealth, and the psychology of reciprocity and fairness. Even so, these elements are common in migrant crises, and leaders' decisions are likely to depend on the psychology of reciprocity and fairness as in these experiments, due to their own psychology and their attention to public opinion. However limited, experimental findings add evidence beyond assumptions, like that leaders choose rationally and selfishly, or that they follow a rigid ideology without strategizing and weighing the costs. These common assumptions were falsified in the present experiments, since participants were neither fully selfish nor blindly ideological no matter the incentives and the routes. Thus, the results show that these assumptions about rationality and ideology have limited generalizability even in simplified games.",

In previous experiments on sequential dilemmas, participants contributed more money in the public goods game when their contributions were sequential compared to simultaneous [45] [46] [47] [48] . The sequential contributions foster reciprocity because the second player knows whether the first player cooperated, which adds to the first player's incentive to cooperate. In contrast, when the players decide sequentially whether to pass a burden, reciprocity is precluded: sheltering means the next player does not make a choice so they cannot reciprocate.
