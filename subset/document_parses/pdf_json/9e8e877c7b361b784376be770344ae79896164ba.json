The virtual interview will remain novel to applicants for each match cycle until the graduating medical student class has experience from virtual interviews during their medical school admissions. The virtual interview poses unique challenges that are unique from in-person formats. Given the lack of experience of applicants in the 2022 match, practicing interviewing skills prior to the actual date is vital to success. We describe a postgraduate year 1 (PGY1)-run mock interview session for applicants preparing for the 2021-2022 otolaryngology interview cycle and discuss the methodology. Deliberate practice with PGY1 residents who have just recently undergone the virtual interview process can better prepare applicants for their virtual interviews, improve on-camera behaviors, and ameliorate mental health challenges unique to the virtual format.",

Frequently, interviews are conducted by faculty and senior residents; however, these individuals often have the busiest, most difficult schedules to coordinate. Furthermore, although faculty and senior residents have experience as interviewers in the last application cycle, they do not have experience as an interviewee during a virtual interview. These members of an academic otolaryngology department lack the interviewee experience and perspective when providing advice and mentorship for applicants in the coming match.",

Feedback was provided to each applicant's background and camera setup. 7 The mock interview day was made as realistic as possible. We felt it was important that applicants experience the disconcerting wait at their computers in the moments prior to the interview and understand relaxation techniques to use in this period. Some applicants experienced technological challenges and had to practice remaining calm while troubleshooting these issues or contacting the interview coordinator. Applicants must also be mentally prepared for the abrupt transition of one session ending and being connected to a different interview session.",

Etiquette can vary during group socials, where applicants take turns interacting and speaking with panels of attendings or residents. Oftentimes, applicants will not be invited to speak individually and will have to be aware of an appropriate time to share their insights and get noticed. Applicants also experienced the beginning of Zoom fatigue. Extended periods on Zoom can result in exhaustion and inattention, which may be inadvertently misinterpreted as lack of interest in a residency program during an interview. The lack of in-person contact can make a successful interview feel indifferent and remote, resulting in a loss of confidence. During the feedback at the end of the simulation, applicants had an opportunity to decompress and then reflect after the period of intense focus. We emphasized to the applicants the importance of accepting past interviews, avoiding ruminating on poor answers, and practicing ongoing wellness activities. These activities can help applicants maintain a high level of performance throughout the interview season by showing energy, resilience and enthusiasm to each program.",
