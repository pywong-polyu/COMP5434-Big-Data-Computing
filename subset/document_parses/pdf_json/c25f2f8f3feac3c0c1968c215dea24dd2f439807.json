Secondly, the diagnosis of influenza can help guide antiviral treatment for individual patients. Prompt diagnosis of influenza is also critical in long-term care facilities and other closed populations in the event that institutional chemoprophylaxis is needed to limit outbreaks. Although antiviral treatments are not currently available for the other respiratory viruses, diagnosis of infection these agents may also be increasingly important as more efforts are made to curtail unnecessary antibiotic use [13, 14] .

In a prospective study of patients with obstructive lung disease [22] , the presence of fever had a sensitivity of only 26%, compared with culture and serological test results, when used to diagnose influenza in older adults.

We find that a sep-arate nose and throat swab that are combined in a single vial of viral transport media is more acceptable to patients and provides an acceptable sample. To collect an adequate sample, the nasal turbinates should be rubbed gently but firmly for \u223c5 s.

Definitive identification of a viral pathogen may take days to even weeks. As noted, older adults generally have lower viral loads in their respiratory secretions, which may affect the sensitivity of cultures. Viral culture is most useful for relatively hardy viruses, such as influenza virus, which can survive transportation to a laboratory, whereas more labile viruses (eg, RSV) cannot [25] .

This technique requires centrifugation of the specimen onto a cell monolayer with the use of antigen detection to identify pathogens [26] . To increase the number of identifiable pathogens, some shell vial cultures have incorporated mixed cells, such as the R-mix (Diagnostic Hybrids), which uses 2 cell types (mink lung cells and human adenocarcinoma cells) and can simultaneously detect influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, RSV, and adenoviruses.
