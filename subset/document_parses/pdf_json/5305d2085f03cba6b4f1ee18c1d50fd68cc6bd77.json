The search terms were the Japanese equivalent to the following English terms : \"Great East Japan Earthquake\", \"Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant\", their abbreviations, and \"Tsunami\" for the GEJE ; \"Great Hanshin -Awaji Earthquake\", its abbreviation, and related disaster sites such as \"Hyogo\" and \"Kobe\" for the GHAE. Unrelated publications were excluded manually. In addition to the publication not mentioning the disaster topics targeted in the present study, the following three exclusion criteria were also determined : first, publications with the regional name \"Fukushima,\" such as those regarding the corona virus pandemic recovery in Fukushima ; second, publications written by authors named \"Fukushima\" or \"Kobe,\" which are common Japanese surnames ; and third, publications which partially matched with keywords due to the specifications of the newspaper databases even when an exact match was performed, such as those including the topics of sport events held in \"East Japan,\" in spite of the search using the keyword \"Great East Japan Earthquake.\" The numbers of publications that mentioned GEJE and FNPP were added together because many publications mentioned both GEJE and FNPP, or even in publications that appeared to only mention either the GEJE or the FNPP, there were contents that could be regarded as referring to both GEJE and FNPP when the contents were carefully examined. The total numbers of GEJEand GHAErelated publications included for analysis were 4,809 and 2,092, respectively. To compress the information, such numbers were converted into a logarithm with base 2. Scatter plots with logarithmic approximation curves were depicted using the number of months passed since the earthquakes and the number of publications. Logarithmic approximation curves were employed because the characteristics of the data distribution on the scatter plots showed that the trend in the number of publications rapidly decreased and then flattened out among GEJEand GHAErelated publications.",

The reason that the number of GEJErelated publications did not decline in the first two months may be because of the continuous interest in the critical conditions of the FNPP which created uncertainty among people all throughout Japan. Our finding that the number of the GEJErelated publications was higher than that of the GHAE in almost all time periods may reflect the severity of the longterm social and environmental impacts of the GEJE and the FNPP accident on the public : public anxiety towards radiation spread over a wide area is a specific enduring result of the GEJE. Topics related to the GEJE may have been mentioned by more people in the Letters to the Editor over a longer period of time compared to those related to the GHAE, leading to the gap in the number of publications.",

The media has the right to decide which articles to adopt and how to present such articles. Thus, the present results may be under the influence of such bias ; the decrease in the number of GEJErelated publications may be a sign of declining interest on the part of the media rather than citizens. On the other hand, citizens refer to public opinion and also create new public opinions based on information from the media 8) . The decline in the number of publications related to the GEJE and FNPP accident Interest in the Great East Japan Earthquake in the Letters to the Editor may lead to a decrease in opportunities for citizens to be exposed to such topics, and therefore public interest may decline. Such a decline in the number of publications may be explained by the changing media environment. Although these newspapers were mainstream media at the time of GHAE, they may have been superseded by social networking services which have been spreading rapidly since 2011, when the GEJE and FNPP accidents occurred. Thus, the public may have had fewer opportunities to come into contact with topics about the GEJE and the FNPP accidents in newspapers. Regardless of whether Letters to the Editor reflect or create public opinion, the results of current analysis may have an equivalent meaning in terms of the difficulty in maintaining public interest in GEJE, FNPP accident, and their victims. Although a causal relationship between public opinion and publications in the Letters to the Editor of newspapers could not be examined due to the research design, it is notable that we found a decreasing trend in the number of publications in the Letters to the Editor of newspapers and that such a trend may be closely related to the decline in the public interest in GEJE.",

Future research should therefore employ procedures to normalize or correct the publication numbers for a more precise comparison.",

            "text": "Even in 2021 with much progress made regarding the recovery and revitalization of affected areas since the GEJE and FNPP accident, mental health problems are prevalent among disaster victims in Fukushima 9) . Importantly, although mental health problems among disaster victims can occur years after a disaster, such victims may be socially neglected, and may not receive adequate mental health support when public interest in the disaster declines. In fact, Japan's government budget for physical/mental health support has been gradually decreasing since the GEJE and FNPP incidents of 2011 10) , and sustainable public mental health support is at stake. Maintaining the public interest years after a disaster may contribute to continued funds and to sustainable public mental health support for disaster victims. Although there is consensus in risk and crisis communication research on the need and importance for public mental health support in the relatively short period after a disaster, our results suggest that communication strategies suitable for the recovery period after the acute phase of disasters are needed in order to achieve sustainable mental health support for disaster victims. While risk and crisis communication are of importance at times of disaster, communication strategies that maintain high public interest in a previous disaster may be necessary in the recovery process to ensure that no victim is left behind.",
