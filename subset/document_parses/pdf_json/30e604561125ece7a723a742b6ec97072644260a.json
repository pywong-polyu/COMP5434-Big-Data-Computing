Differentiation between both origins can be difficult and characteristics such as symptom manifestations, time to relief in rest position and pain localization should be considered when determining diagnosis and the treatment plan. The objectives of this study were to compare changes in walking time to symptom change during treadmill tests and self-reported outcomes measures related to claudication, kinesophobia and global health between individuals with LSS, PAD and non-specific low back pain (nLBP).",

The speed was set at 1.9 km/h (1.2 mph), and each task was followed by a 5-min rest period. Walking time to symptom change and Total walking time were recorded during each walking task. Patients were asked to complete four questionnaires related to the impact of claudication, walking impairment, kinesiophobia and global health. One-way ANOVAs were performed to compare walking time difference from the Upright to the FLT walking tasks and to compare questionnaires results between groups. Results: One-way ANOVAs showed a significant difference between groups regarding difference in Walking time to symptom change between both tasks (F = 4.12, p = 0.022). The LSS group improved its Walking time to symptom change from the Upright to the FLT walking tasks more than the PAD (p = 0.34) and the nLBP group (p = 0.12). The nLBP group was less impacted by claudication and less impaired during walking compared to the LSS and PAD groups (ps < 0.001). The nLBP group also had less kinesiophobia than the LSS one (p < 0.001), but was similar to the PAD group. The global health rating was not statistically different between groups (p = 0.118). Conclusion: The test was able to distinguish neurogenic from vascular or nLBP related claudication. However, further studies are needed to validate this new treadmill walking test.",

Vascular and neurogenic claudication represent both possible origins of IC, and their symptoms are frequently described as pain, cramps, numbness and tingling in the lower limbs [5] . Vascular claudication is a common manifestation in individuals with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), while neurogenic claudication occurs in lumbar musculoskeletal disorders with neurological involvement such as specific low back pain (LBP) conditions. One of these specific LBP conditions causing neurogenic claudication is lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). In some cases, individuals with nonspecific low back pain (nLBP) will experience referred pain into the lower limbs which will also cause difficulty during walking [6] .",

The acquired central LSS form arises from the degenerative process of the lumbar spine. Different osteoarthritic manifestations including ligamentous hypertrophy (ligamentum flavum), disc degeneration (bulging or hernia), spondylolisthesis and/or facet osteoarthritis [3, 15, 16] , may result in decreased space in the vertebral canal, leading to central LSS.

Vascular and neurogenic claudication share similarities in their symptoms [2] , but the posture of relief differs between both types. In fact, in PAD, patients need to stop their activity while in LSS, patients need to adopt a bending forward posture or to sit down. Additionally, both claudication origins lead to several limitations in daily physical activities, such as a reduction of walking time and walking distance [2, 17, 24, 25] . Because of their similarities, clinicians must establish their diagnosis based on the reported symptoms and clinical manifestations in daily activities and combine the clinical history with diagnostic tests or medical imaging. Nowadays, the diagnosis of PAD is obtained using the standard Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) [25, 26] which assess the systolic blood pressure ratio between the ankle and the brachial artery (ratio lower than 0.9 is defined as a sign of PAD) [27] , while the diagnosis of LSS is commonly determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), even if MRI is a diagnostic tool that presents important limitations [28] . In fact, Boden showed that 21% of asymptomatic individuals over 60 years had lumbar spinal stenosis on MRI [29] .",

For example, the mean time between the referral by a general practitioner to the consultation with a neurosurgeon was about 32.9 weeks in Canada in 2017 [30] . For patients with claudication, timely and accurate diagnosis are important aspects to consider as they directly influence the patient trajectory and clinical outcome. Knowing that trunk flexion, well known as the shopping cart sign, represents the hallmark in LSS claudication, the use of this specific clinical characteristic may be useful to rapidly distinguish between vascular and neurogenic claudication. Indeed, people with vascular claudication or nLBP should not be responsive to the modification of the trunk position while walking compared to LSS. Using clinical manifestations, such as the relief of leg pain with the bending forward position, that are specific to neurogenic claudication could be an additional resource to help clinicians to rapidly distinguish between vascular and neurogenic claudication which would also improve directing patients to the most appropriate specialist.",

This questionnaire is an LSSspecific tool used to assess pain, function and satisfaction with care commonly used in spinal stenosis patients. In this study, the part assessing satisfaction of care in patients was removed because no patient had undergone surgery. The pain subscale includes seven questions which six are scored using a five-point Likert scale and the seventh question is scored using 1, 3 or 5 points. The function subscale includes five questions which are scored using a four-point Likert scale. For each subscale, a higher score indicates greater disability. The total score of the FR-SSSQ without the satisfaction subscale was then 55. The second questionnaire, the French version of Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) evaluated patient-perceived walking performance. This validated questionnaire provides estimates of walking distance, walking speed and stair-climbing capacity [32, 33] . Two of the three WIQ components are scored using a fourpoint Likert scale. For walking distance score, zero represents the inability to walk the distance and four represents the ability to walk the distance without difficulty. For the walking speed, 0 represents the inability to walk at the suggested speed and 4 represents the ability to jog or run [32] . The third component, ability to climb stairs, is measured using a three-point Likert scale. The total WIQ score ranges from 0 to 100 (transformation of each subscale was completed using the mathematical formula of the questionnaire).",

Regarding results from the WIQ questionnaire, the Tukey post hoc showed that patients in the nLBP group were able to walk for a longer period, were able to walk faster and had less impairment during stairs climbing than the LSS and the PAD groups. Regarding pain and functional assessments (FC-SSSQ), the ANOVA showed significant between-group differences for pain, function and total score. FC-SSSQ scores for pain and function subscales were significantly lower in the previous month for the nLBP group than for the LSS and PAD groups. For the total score of the FC-SSSQ, the analysis revealed a significant difference between the nLBP group and the LSS group, as well as between the nLBP group and the PAD group. In each case, the nLBP group showed a lower total score. Regarding kinesiophobia, the Tukey post hoc showed a significant difference between the nLBP group and the LSS group, indicating that the nLBP group had less kinesiophobia. The Tukey post hoc also showed a difference between the LSS and the PAD group (p = 0.045). There was no significant difference between the nLPB and the PAD groups.

            "text": "Results from the treadmill walking test used in this study showed that the FLT walking posture increases the Walking time to leg symptom change compared to the Upright walking posture for patients with LSS. This finding was coherent with previous studies showing that leg pain is decreased when patients with LSS bend their trunk forward while walking [39, 40] . Even if claudication impact was similar for the LSS and the PAD groups, patients in the PAD group did not increase their Walking time to symptom change from the Upright to the FLT walking task as much as patients in the LSS group. However, Total walking time was the same for both LSS and PAD groups. The fact that trunk position impacts Walking time to symptom changed in the LSS group as opposed to the PAD group suggests that it was a specific characteristic of LSS patients. As initially hypothesized, such differences between the two walking tasks were not observed in patients with PAD or nLBP because of the different mechanisms that generate claudication. Claudication in LSS is normally caused by pain due to nerve root compression, which is accentuated with upright posture, while claudication in PAD is caused by a narrowing of the arteries; symptoms therefore increase with the increasing oxygen demand from lower limb muscles. For patients with nLBP, referred pain to the lower limbs is not caused by nerve root compression or oxygen demand. Referred pain to the lower limbs will be present regardless of the trunk position. For patients with LSS, the leaned forward posture is well known to decrease leg symptoms [3, 14] . In fact, patients in LSS see their legs symptoms decrease in a seated position or by the trunk leaned forward position, which causes the vertebral canal diameter and dural sac cross-sectional area to increase [41] . On the contrary, and as expected, the inclined walking posture had no positive effect on Walking time to symptom change in patients with PAD and nLBP. Leg symptoms in PAD are caused by the partial occlusion of the blood vessels, which causes a decrease in oxygen supply to muscles, and time to leg symptom change can be influenced by the intensity of the task, which will generate higher needs in oxygen rather than the position of the trunk while walking [10] . During the treadmill walking test, walking intensity was the same for both walking tasks, which means that there was no expected change in Walking time to symptom change and Total walking time for patients with PAD. The nLBP group was included in this study to highlight the differences in leg pain arising from nLBP and LSS.",

In the present study, the kinesiophobia scores were different for the LSS and PAD groups, which is consistent with the results reported in a previous study that compared different characteristics, including kinesiophobia, between three groups (neurogenic claudication, vascular claudication and asymptomatic) [43] . In fact, in the study by Woods et al. (2012), patients with neurogenic claudication had a higher score on the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia Questionnaire than patients with vascular claudication. Regarding quality of life, the present study suggests that patients with neurogenic or vascular claudication still consider having a good health status, according to their rating of health on the EQ-5D VAS scale. In addition, according to the WIQ and FC-SSSQ questionnaires, patients from the current study with LSS or PAD were impacted by claudication; this impact was also observable during the treadmill walking test, as only 55% of patients with LSS and 50% of patients with PAD were able to walk for the entire 5 min.

We did not have access to medical files nor to the clinical test results done by the neurosurgeon and/or the vascular surgeon, which means that some patients could have originally been incorrectly classified or have had coexisting vascular and neurogenic claudication. The coexistence of both claudication types in one patient may have limited the treadmill walking test discriminating performance. In fact, clinicians should not assume that a negative treadmill test definitively rules out LSS. In addition, due to the modest sample size, results should be interpreted with caution. In fact, results may be overestimated due to the low variability between the patients of the three groups concerning their walking capacity and the severity of their pathology. The fixed speed walk was another limitation, as it sometimes made patients uncomfortable during the walking tasks. Another limitation of this study was that the reliability of the treadmill walking test was not measured. For future studies, selfpace walking task should be considered to assess leg symptoms, since it may better represent the daily life activities of patients.",

The next stages of the treadmill test development should include patients with other specific LBP that are associated with leg pain. To our knowledge, this is the first treadmill walking test to assess the difference between neurogenic and vascular claudication in a quantitative way. The approach, when fully validated, could contribute to the early detection of claudication origin and consequently improve care pathways. This early identification should contribute to speeding up the establishment of a treatment plan and allow early referral to the best health care specialist based on the origin of the claudication.",
