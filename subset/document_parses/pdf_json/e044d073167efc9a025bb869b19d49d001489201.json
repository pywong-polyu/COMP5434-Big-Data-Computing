We believe that the challenges arise primarily from the supply side, because conducting an event study involves overcoming a variety of data and analytical hurdles.

While the challenge of linking cause and effect is widespread in the social sciences, it is particularly steep in IB, where increased complexity adds layers of difficulty. Complexity in IB research is rooted in three factors: multiplicity, multiplexity, and dynamism. Multiplicity refers to ''the number and variety of actors, industries, countries, institutions, etc.''; multiplexity refers to the ''number and variety of ties or relationship among these entities'' (e.g., dyadic factors, such as affinity/animosity and bilateral investment treaties); and dynamism reflects the ''changing nature of the international business system'' (Eden & Nielsen, 2020 : 1609 -1610 .",

Multinationality as the cause (e.g., through leverage of firm-specific advantages) is difficult to distinguish from multinationality as the effect (e.g., better-performing firms go abroad). Moreover, the relationship between cause and effect depends significantly on the context and time period; that is, on the multiplicity of actors and their environs, the multiplexity of their crossborder interactions, and the dynamism of the global system. Reeb et al. (2012) discuss several methodologies for addressing causality. Our article adds the event study to the tools in IB researchers' observationaldata kit. Also referred to as the event study method (ESM), the event study is an empirical technique designed to capture the financial impact of an event by examining the behavior of stock prices around the event announcement (Campbell, Lo & MacKinlay, 1997; McWilliams & Siegel, 1997) .",

By focusing on information arriving at the stock market, ESM is able to isolate shocks, in effect assigning firms to treatment groups (those affected by the event) and control groups, a design that aids identification. In our MNE-performance example above, in countries with weak corporate governance, firms may expand abroad despite internationalization's hurting firm value, with shareholders unable to prevent performance-reducing expansion undertaken for managerial benefit. Using ESM, researchers can look at the value of firms announcing international expansion, and see whether changes associated with the announcement are related to hypothesized factors.",

These models (e.g., the traditional domestic market model and several multi-factor models; Fama & French, 1993 , 2015 were developed for the US stock market, which has stronger regulatory and enforcement institutions governing trading and information disclosure than do most countries. As a result, transporting models from the US to other countries usually necessitates adjustments. In addition, incorporating cross-border financial flows can also affect the way ESM is implemented. The singlecountry, closed-economy setting of the US in the 1960s when ESM was first developed is clearly a different setting than the semi-globalized and semidigitalized world of the twenty-first century. These issues, in conjunction with the scarcity of ESM studies in IB, provide the motivation for our paper.",

To achieve this goal, we examine the research opportunities and methodological challenges of using ESM, and suggest practical solutions designed to encourage the adoption of this valuable method by IB scholars. Our paper starts with an overview of the event study, focusing on its advantages and limitations. After showcasing research opportunities for using ESM in IB research, we argue that the limited use of ESM by IB scholars can be attributed, in part, to the method being conceptualized too narrowly, as useful primarily for estimating stock market reactions to selfannouncements by firms. Our analysis of the 29 JIBS articles over 1970-2019 that include an event study supports this conjecture.",

To illustrate the practical solutions, we include an example applying ESM to Brexit, the UK-wide referendum to leave the European Union on June 23, 2016. Our example examines the wealth effects associated with Brexit using ESM: investors' reaction to homecountry (British) firms and EU-member (French) firms.

The multi-layered, complex nature of the IB field (Eden & Nielsen, 2020; Sun, Doh, Rajwani, & Siegel, 2021 ) makes efforts to disentangle driving forces and their effects particularly challenging, even impossible, in ''large-n'' cross-sectional, timeseries datasets. By focusing on investors' reactions, ESM facilitates controlling for some factors, allowing examination of those of interest. In some cases, it can be the only feasible way to establish causality, while in other studies, it can be an effective way to complement other approaches as long as the shocks are exogenous and not fully anticipated (Atanasov & Black, 2016) .",

Thus, the method can be used to analyze events very quickly, almost in real time. In addition to rapid availability of extensive data, ESM is also timely because asset prices (including stock prices) are forward-looking; they depend on expected future cash flows and risk. By analyzing expected outcomes rather than waiting for them to materialize, scholars need not wait years to analyze interesting and important phenomena. For example, ESM has already been used to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Chinese firms (He, Sun, Zhang, & Li, 2020) and US firms (Albuquerque, Koskinen, Yang, & Zhang, 2020) . 2 Third, ESM can be used when event outcomes cannot be clearly separated from overall firm financial performance, or from each other. For example, it can be difficult to disentangle the impact on a British firm's return on assets (ROA) of a strategic decision, such as CEO turnover, that occurs after Brexit. Was the yearly change in the firm's ROA due to CEO turnover or Brexit? However, the IB researcher may be able to separately compute the change in the firm's market value using ESM for the Brexit referendum and the CEO turnover announcement, i.e., ESM has the benefit of event precision.",

ESM allows scholars to examine, from the investors' viewpoint, research questions, such as, ''To what extent do announcements of bribery allegations differentially affect value creation of MNEs based on the MNE's home-country environment?'' or, ''Do CEO terminations have a stronger market reaction in countries with high uncertainty avoidance?'' ESM can also provide insight into the consequences of an event for firm performance. ESM can also generate the wealth effect (i.e., the cumulative abnormal returns, or CARs), which can be used as the dependent variable in multivariate regression analysis to assess firm-, industry-, country-, and event-level determinants (e.g., Eden, Juarez & Li, 2005) .",

In many studies, the short-term and long-term effects are consistent but they can differ, which suggests strategic implementation is also important (Zollo & Meier, 2008) . ESM is also ideal for studying events that affect many firms, and potentially identifying firm behaviors/ characteristics as well as market features that differentially influence investors' reactions to some firms versus others. Another use of ESM is to examine the impact of macro-shocks, such as foreign exchange crises or natural disasters (King, 2015) .",

            "text": "ESM has several major limitations. First, and most important, is that ESM can only be used with listed (i.e., publicly traded) firms. Thus, the method cannot be used with privately held or wholly stateowned firms, where there are no stock market data. However, ESM can be used for listed but partially state-owned (i.e., hybrid or mixed) enterprises (see, e.g., Carvalho & Guimaraes, 2018) . 3 Second, ESM can be challenging to implement when there are multiple events, as mentioned above. One problem is multiple simultaneous announcements during or close to the same time window (i.e., confounding events) that make it impossible to disentangle their effects. The observations involving a confounding event can be removed, although this may adversely affect sample size (McWilliams & Siegel, 1997; Khan, Kalelkar, Miller & Sanders, 2018) . Sorescu, Warren and Ertekin (2017) recommended testing with and without the observations. Third, ESM assumes stock markets are informationally efficient; i.e., all publicly available information relevant to a firm's future prospects is fully reflected in its stock price, both before and after the announcement (Fama et al., 1969) . 4 Hence, an event needs to be at least partially unexpected by investors; otherwise, there will be no abnormal returns, as the information contained in the announcement has already been impounded in the stock price. Thus, ESM is inappropriate when market prices do not fully and accurately reflect available information. The most common source of informational inefficiency is illiquidity. Some stocks are thinly traded, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets, or listed on regional stock exchanges or over-thecounter in developed countries. As a result, their stock prices may be stale (not reflect current information) and, thus, not suitable for ESM.",

Inefficiencies are likely to be more endemic in developing countries where market institutions are weaker, but such problems also occur in developed markets. ESM may still be feasible, but researchers may need to examine abnormal returns prior to the typical event window (days -1, 0, and +1). For example, Miller, Li, Eden and Hitt (2008) used an event window that started 10 days before the public announcement due to concerns and evidence of weak institutions in a study of international joint ventures by Chinese firms. Clougherty and Duso (2011) started their event window 50 days before the public announcement of the horizontal mergers by US and European firms.

First, 24 of the 29 JIBS articles involved self-announcements by the focal firm; only 5 studies were based on announcements by other actors. Almost all the articles (25 of 29) used a stock market for testing hypotheses; 3 articles used other high-frequency markets (foreign exchange and Euro-bond markets), and 1 article examined stock market volatility. In terms of research questions, 20 of the 29 studies examined stock price effects of corporate expansion announcements (18 cross-border alliances, M&As, and joint ventures, and 2 cross-listings). In sum, our review of the 29 JIBS articles using ESM in Table 2 suggests that IB scholars have employed the method fairly narrowly: to investigate accounting or finance questions involving self-announcements.",

In Table 3 , we provide examples of hypothetical IB research questions that can be (and some that have been) addressed using an event study. We view these examples as opportunities for IB scholars to expand our range of testable research questions by thinking more broadly about how ESM could be used to tackle questions that cannot be well addressed -or addressed in real time -by other research methods. Table 3 organizes these research questions by the source of the event (endogenous or exogenous to the firms examined). Endogenous events include proactive ''good news,'' as well as to voluntary disclosures of ''bad news.'' One firm's announcements may also have spillover effects on other firms. Exogenous events can range from scandals to government policy changes or macro-economic crises. Also, an exogenous event can be viewed through various lenses, which we demonstrate below in our case study of Brexit. A key advantage of ESM is its ability to address these questions from an ex ante perspective using highfrequency data, with potential follow-up studies using annual data on firm financials or other outcome measures (e.g., surveys of executives) as a means of triangulation.",
