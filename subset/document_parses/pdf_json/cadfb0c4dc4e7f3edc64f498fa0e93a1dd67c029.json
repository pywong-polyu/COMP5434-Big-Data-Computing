Posterior epistaxis is typically managed with posterior nasal packing. If posterior packing does not resolve the bleeding episode, either ligation or embolization of the sphenopalatine artery can be considered. 7, 8 Merocel\u00ae is a nonabsorbable nasal tampon designed to be used as a packing material. The sponge is composed of hydroxylated polyvinyl acetate that will increase in size within the nasal cavity and compress a bleeding vessel through rehydration with normal saline.",

As seen in cases 1, 2, and 3, absorbable packing was able to control epistaxis without the need for regular follow up contact with the patient. 11, 12 Nonabsorbable nasal packing is not recommended unless other measures as shown in Figure 1 are not first successful. Merocel\u00ae packing requires removal after 48-72 hours, and there is a higher chance of aerosolization of nasal secretions and disruption of nasal mucosa in the process of removing the nasal packs. [13] [14] [15] The Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery has recommended several studies which show that nasal endoscopy with cautery produced a significant amount of airborne aersols. 16 Due to these recommendations, we also would avoid nasal endoscopic control of posterior nasal bleeding with clipping or cautery of the F I G U R E 1 Epistaxis management for COVID-19-positive patients sphenopalatine artery.
