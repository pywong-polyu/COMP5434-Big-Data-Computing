Many researchers are studying novel Coronavirus pneumonia from chest X-ray images. In order to improve the detection accuracy, two modules sensitive to feature information, dual-path multiscale feature fusion module and dense depthwise separable convolution module, are proposed. Based on these two modules, a lightweight convolutional neural network model, D2-CovidNet, is designed to assist experts in diagnosing COVID-19 by identifying chest X-ray images. D2-CovidNet is tested on two public data sets, and its classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score are 94.56%, 95.14%, 94.02%, 96.61%, and 95.30%, respectively. Specifically, the precision, sensitivity, and specificity of the network for COVID-19 are 98.97%, 94.12%, and 99.84%, respectively. D2-CovidNet has fewer computation number and parameter number.

In Figures 1 and 2 , h, w, and c denote the height, width, and channels of the feature map, respectively. k is the kernel size, s is the strides, and f is the number of filters in the convolution. In these modules, \"h-swish\" is employed as the activation function, which can reduce the time delay and make the model suitable for mobile devices [14] . e DPM module contains 2 branches, and each branch contains 1 pooling layer and 3 convolutional layers. Maximum pooling layer with the filter size of 2 \u00d7 2 and step size of 2 \u00d7 2 is used as the pooling layer. Maximum pooling can ensure the invariance of the position and rotation of the features, which reduce the number of parameters of the model, thereby alleviating the problem of overfitting. e first 1 \u00d7 1 convolutional layer increases the channel number of the feature map for enriching the feature information. e second 1 \u00d7 1 convolutional layer is used to correlate the output feature maps with different channel information, which is depthwise convolution or dilated depthwise convolution, for example, depthwise convolution using convolutional filters with the dilation rate of 2. Since the dilated convolution [15] does not increase the number of parameters and the amount of computation, the complexity of the two branches is the same, making the model better suitable for dual-path-parallel computing. e features extracted by the convolutional layer close to the input contain detailed texture information, so the DPM module is used in the shallow layers of the network.

In Table 6 , among the 4 comparison models, DarkCovidNet [11] has the least number of parameters, but it is still 5.50 times that of D2-CovidNet, and its classification accuracy is 7.41% lower than D2-CovidNet. CoroNet [10] has the highest accuracy, which is only 0.16% higher than D2-CovidNet, but its parameter amount is 165.00 times that of D2-CovidNet. For such a large difference, an intuitive explanation is that deep separable convolution is used many times in our network. Considering the network performance and complexity, D2-CovidNet is a recommended intelligent method for identifying chest X-ray images of COVID-19. Figure 7 shows the confusion matrix of D2-CovidNet on test set, and Table 7 shows the specific performance of D2-CovidNet on various performance indicators.",

Based on these two modules, D2-CovidNet is designed with strong representation and low complexity. 4265 chest X-ray images of common pneumonia patients, 1575 normal chest X-ray images, and 412 chest X-ray images of COVID-19 patients are selected from two open-source datasets to train and evaluate the model. e experimental results show that D2-CovidNet has good performance, and its classification accuracy for images tested is 94.43%. Specifically, its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for COVID-19 are 98.97%, 94.12%, and 99.84%, respectively. Using D2-CovidNet to detect COVID-19 chest X-ray can effectively improve the diagnostic efficiency and help to detect and isolate patients in time, preventing the spread of 2019-nCoV. Although D2-CovidNet has good experimental results, it needs further clinical research and testing [32] . After further training and testing, D2-CovidNet is expected to be put into practical application in auxiliary diagnosis COVID-19.",
