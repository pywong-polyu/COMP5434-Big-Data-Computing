            "text": "Purpose of Review Social media platforms such as Twitter are increasingly utilized to interact, collaborate, and exchange information within the academic medicine community. However, as Twitter begins to become formally incorporated into professional meetings, educational activities, and even the consideration of academic promotion, it is critical to better understand both the benefits and challenges posed by this platform. Recent Findings Twitter use is rising amongst healthcare providers nationally and internationally, including in the field of hematology and oncology. Participation on Twitter at national conferences such as the annual meetings of American Society of Hematology (ASH) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has steadily increased over recent years. Tweeting can be used advantageously to cultivate opportunities for networking or collaboration, promote one's research and increase access to other's research, and provide efficient means of learning and educating. However, given the novelty of this platform and little formal training on its use, concerns regarding patient privacy, professionalism, and equity must be considered. Summary These new technologies present unique opportunities for career development, networking, research advancement, and efficient learning. From \"tweet ups\" to Twitter journal clubs, physician-scientists are quickly learning how to capitalize on the opportunities that this medium offers. Yet caution must be exercised to ensure that the information exchanged is valid and true, that professionalism is maintained, that patient privacy is protected, and that this platform does not reinforce preexisting structural inequalities.",

Twitter provides novel opportunities for physician-scientists to interact and collaborate across institutions and diverse fields. It increases access to research and enables real-time discussion of new publications [3] . Not only does it serve to disseminate information, it also may be utilized as a means to generate data [4, 5] . As this platform is increasingly integrated into the academic medical community, it is important to consider both the benefits and potential challenges posed by this technology. opportunity to connect and advance common interests.

Social media may blur the line between the professional and personal identity of a physician and missteps may harm the professional reputation of users [15, 16] . It is therefore critical to compose each \"Tweet\" with the understanding that the post will be public and permanent [5] . In one 2010 study let by Chretian et al., 5156 tweets from selfidentified physicians were analyzed over one month. Of those, 144 tweets were categorized as unprofessional with 38 representing potential patient privacy violations, 33 containing profanity, 14 with sexually explicit material, and 4 with discriminatory statements. And amongst the 27 users responsible for privacy violations, 25 (92%) were identifiable by full listed name on profile, photo, or linked website [17, 18] . Furthermore, physicians are not simply at risk of disapproval by colleagues and patients or punitive actions by employers. A survey of the directors of medical and osteopathic boards revealed 92% (44 out of 48 respondents) indicating at least one of several online professionalism violations had been reported to the board. In response 71% held disciplinary hearings and serious disciplinary outcomes including license restriction, suspension, or revocation occurred at 56% of the boards [18] .",

While many maintain that Twitter can increase equity by opening new channels of communication to diverse individuals across geographic, socioeconomic, and disciplinary barriers, others argue that social media may increase the impact of those who already have the most impact and exacerbate inequality [12] . Gender inequalities have already been identified in many key areas across medicine, and gender bias in the way women are addressed and perceived may affect career advancement [20, 21] . How Twitter reinforces these biases must be considered. One study by Zhu et al. identified Twitter users amongst speakers and coauthors presenting at Academy Health's 2018 Annual Research meeting and evaluated their most recent tweets. Amongst more than 3000 health services researchers, women had less influence on Twitter than men with half of the mean number of followers, and fewer mean likes and retweets per year. These differences were largest amongst full professors and similar across the distribution of number of tweets [22\u2022 ].

            "text": "Twitter has also encouraged innovative forms of communicating research findings. Another recent prospective case control crossover study looked at 44 research articles published in the same year in Annals of Surgery. Each article was tweeted in two formats: as the title alone or as the title with a visual abstract. A strong correlation was found between the use of visual abstracts and increased dissemination on social media. Additionally, the articles with a visual abstract tweeted received more site visits than the articles without visual abstracts. [25] One area that has expanded rapidly on Twitter is postpublication peer review and Twitter journal clubs. Journal clubs have long served as important tools for propagating new research, practicing evidence-based medicine, and developing skills to evaluate research design and validity of the findings [26] [27] [28] . Recently a diverse range of Twitter journal clubs have arisen including ID journal club, NephJC, JGIM Twitter Journal Club, and others [27, 28] . Organizers will choose articles and indicate a date and time for the meeting. Tweets are organized and referenced by hashtags and participants can follow along or interact by commenting on individual tweets. Content experts or authors may be invited and physicians at all levels may join in to learn collectively. And while these meetings often cater to physicians and physicianscientists, journal clubs are typically open to any individual including patients, allowing improved public dissemination of new research advances.",
