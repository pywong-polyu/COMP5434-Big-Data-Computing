She was obese (body mass index, 29.5 kg/m 2 ) and had diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and a history of cholecystectomy. Remdesivir and dexamethasone (6 mg) improved her symptoms. On the 14th day after the development of COVID-19, her serum levels of pancreatic enzymes were elevated (Picture, upper). Simultaneously, abdominal tenderness appeared and computed tomography showed an enlarged pancreatic parenchyma (Picture, lower). She was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, which was ameliorated by fasting and fluid therapy.",

In such cases, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in pancreatic cells may be associated with the pathogenesis (2) . Considering that pancreatitis occurred after the administration of dexamethasone and remdesivir, these drugs might have been involved in the pancreatitis of our case. This case suggested that acute pancreatitis could develop immediately after treatment for COVID-19.",
