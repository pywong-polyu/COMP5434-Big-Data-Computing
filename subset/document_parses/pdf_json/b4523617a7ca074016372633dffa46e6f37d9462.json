This paper's first goal is to present the learning path we designed, influenced by cryptography core ideas rather than technical knowledge. We will detail how we used Snap! (a visual programming language) to realize hands-on activities: programming playgrounds to experiment with cryptosystems and their limits, and interactive support for an unplugged activity on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The second goal is to evaluate our intervention in terms of both student perceptions and learning of core cryptography ideas. The students appreciated the course and felt that, despite being remote, it was fun, interesting, and engaging. They said the course helped them understand the role of cryptography, CS, and Math in society and sparked their interest, especially in cryptography and CS. The third goal is to discuss what worked well and areas of improvement. Pedagogically, remote teaching caused high \"instructor blindness\" and prevented us from giving the optimal amount of guidance during the exploration activities with Snap! playgrounds, making them sometimes too challenging for total programming novices. On the other hand, the \"remote-unplugged\" Diffie-Hellman worked well: it embodies a coherent metaphor that engaged the students and made them grasp this groundbreaking protocol. The students praised the activities as engaging, even when challenging. The final assessment showed that the core cryptography ideas were well understood.",

As recognized by [20] , various frameworks (e.g., [5] ) and curricula (e.g., the K-12 Computer Science Framework [15] and the UK computing curriculum [8] ) include competencies related to cybersecurity. Some of them are more oriented on using security for personal purposes, others on understanding how digital security works, but they all recognize that cybersecurity skills are essential for students to be active citizens of digital society. The fact that cryptography is the foundation of cybersecurity implies its scientific and cultural value. In addition, novices identified cryptography \"as an interesting context for computer science lessons\" [20, p. 3 ]. However, not much research has been done in teaching cryptography for K-12. Considering that K-12 education does not aim to train professionals but to provide lenses to understand the world and skills to act in it, we consider it important to teach the fundamental principles of cryptography in a way that could be understood by novices. We wanted to create a course that, while short and without prerequisites, would help students understand the principles of cryptography and their importance in our society. To do so, we designed a learning path and two non-traditional and complementary types of activity. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we had to design the intervention as remote-only.",

In addition, very few papers specifically address cryptography. Our search confirmed this. While some research is focused specifically on university-level cryptography courses [see, e.g., 4, 14] , in many proposals, cryptography was just one of the many parts of a cybersecurity course or curriculum [see, e.g., 3, 9, 35, 38] , most often applied as a tool rather than explained deeply in its inner workings. The use of visualization tools or interactive simulations for cryptographic algorithms (e.g., Caesar, Vigen\u00e8re, DES, AES, RSA, SHA) has been proposed [33] and developed [25, 31, 32] , showing how ciphers work, their weaknesses and possible attacks. Sometimes these visualizations and simulations are accurate but too detailed for young students. Some ideas relevant to our work are: using a message board to simulate a person-in-the-middle attack on a public-key cryptosystem [13] ; having students implement cryptographic algorithms (from classical to modern) with computer algebra systems [26] ; helping novice developers securely use cryptographic APIs by providing them with cryptographic building blocks designed in line with the visual metaphors of block-based programming languages [39] .",

For example, for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we thought that having an already working program that supported students in simulating the shared secret generation could suit better understanding the protocol at a high level. So instead of providing a Snap! playground, we gave students an executable-only Snap! project (i.e., they could not modify it nor explore its code) that guided them in performing the actions of one of the two actors involved in a Diffie-Hellman key exchange [22] . There are at least two typical ways to didactically present Diffie-Hellman [see, e.g., 41]: one based on mixing colors (more evocative yet simplified), the other on performing the algorithm with small numbers (more accurate yet complex). We tried to combine these two modes to gradually move from color metaphor to mathematical functioning. In particular, our Snap! program assigns a color to each number from 0 to 99. Color mixing is not done with classical additive or subtractive algorithms but is based on the actual Diffie-Hellman calculations (initially hidden to the students), made between the simple numbers that in Snap! represent colors. Through this program, the students in pairs were able to generate a shared secret color for every couple. The necessary communications between the two students (i.e., choosing an initial shared color and exchanging the calculated color) took place on the public chat, which effectively represented the insecure channel since everyone could listen over it.",

We refer to it as \"remote-unplugged\" because it has almost all the characteristics of a CS Unplugged activity (i.e., real computer science-presenting fundamental CS concepts and algorithms; learning by doing; fun; cooperative; stand-alone; resilient to student errors; see [6]) except that it was delivered via technological devices. In this case, however, the devices acted as a necessary means of communication rather than being the specific tool of computer scientists. In addition, we believe that an interactive, executable-only Snap! project that guided the students through the steps of the Diffie-Hellman activity made the activity more concrete and easier to follow than with pen and paper and a list of rules, especially in a remote setting.",

However, half of the students found the more advanced playgrounds difficult. We believe that the setting did not help: the course was held online, with students we did not know in advance (and mostly did not know each other, coming from different classes). This resulted in severe \"instructor blindness, \" making it hard for us to act as facilitators and provide the students exploring the Snap! playgrounds with the optimal amount of guidance [36] . Consequently, these activities were \"minimally guided\" [37] , which can be too hard, especially for weaker students. Hence, our aim to \"teach\" at least the fundamental principles of the path devised (see 3.2), even in the short duration of the course, led us to a less open approach. First of all, we moved to a more guided exploration with the \"remote-unplugged\" activity on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. After that, in the final phase, we moved to a more traditional approach to illustrate the more advanced schemes of asymmetric cryptography, yet maintaining a Socratic approach with discussions and suggestions from the students. We taught the fundamental mechanisms behind secrecy and authentication through engaging animations [22] (using Power Rangers so that actions and messages of the different actors would be evident through their respective colors), leaving out technical and implementation details. Students highly appreciated the animations, explicitly saying they were really helpful to understand.",

From a learning programming perspective, however, inspecting the code of our Snap! playgrounds does not have the straightforward educational value it could have. The student who had the curiosity would find extensive use of Javascript needed to integrate the functionalities of Snap! and some uninteresting workarounds put in place to overcome its limitations.
