Historically, members of both genera were frequently associated with cases of enteric disease and seldom associated with extraintestinal manifestations [2] [3] [4] [5] . In the last decade, members of the genus Mamastrovirus have been increasingly associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease [6] . In 2010, both human and mink neurotropic strains were associated with cases of encephalomyelitis [3, 7] . More recently, multiple neurotropic strains of astroviruses have been associated with cases of CNS disease affecting wild and domesticated animals including swine, sheep, cattle, muskox, and alpacas [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Primer pairs were designed to amplify overlapping amplicons targeting the complete genomes of two previously published PoAstV3 sequences (Table 1 , GenBank accession Nos. JX556691 and KY940545). The viral genomic RNA was amplified using a 25 \u00b5L reaction utilizing custom qScript \u00ae XLT One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Each primer was present in the final reaction at 320 nM, and 4 \u00b5L of RNA template was used per reaction. PoAstV3 RNA amplification was performed on an Applied Biosystems SimpliAmp thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) under the following conditions: initial reverse transcription at 48 \u2022 C for 20 min, followed by initial denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 3 min and 45 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 30 s; annealing at 50 \u2022 C for 50 s; extension at 68 \u2022 C for 90 s; and final elongation at 68 \u2022 C for 7 min. Phosphate buffered saline was extracted as a negative extraction control and nuclease-free water was used as a negative amplification control. The RT-qPCR products were visualized using QIAxcel Advanced System (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and purified using the ExoSAP-IT PCR Product Cleanup Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was completed via Sanger sequencing with the BigDye\u2122 Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on a 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at the Iowa State University DNA Facility. Sequences were assembled using Geneious Prime 2020.2.4 software.",

Sequences with incomplete 5 and 3 UTR were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, a 31 nt poly (A) tail, as the one present on PoAstV3 USA/IA/7023/18 (GenBank accession number: KY940545), was added to all PoAstV3 3 UTRs. The consensus sequence of both 5 UTR and frameshift signal regions were modeled using RNAfold webserver under default settings except for temperature rescaling at 39 \u2022 C to represent physiologic normal parameters of swine [48, 49] . Previously described sequence frameshift signal of human astrovirus 2 (HAstV-2, GenBank accession: L13745) was modeled as comparison [33] . The s2m plus 3 UTR regions of PoAstV3 were segregated upon what country they were originally identified (i.e., USA, Japan, Hungary, Spain, and Germany) and the resulting consensus sequences for each geographic cluster were modeled using RNAfold webserver under default settings with temperature rescaling to 39 \u2022 C. Additionally, the s2m plus 3 UTR consensus sequences were analyzed for the presence of pseudoknotted structures with nested pseudoknots using IPknot webserver using the McCaskill model with refining parameters and weight of base pairs set at 50 in all levels [50] . Maximum expected accuracy (MEA) structures were visualized using FORNA webserver [51] .

On the contrary, PoAstV3 CNS cases did not have a clear seasonal distribution: summer (n = 9), autumn (n = 8), and winter (n = 8), and spring (n = 4).

PoAstV3 USA strains identified in this study follow the ORFs delimitation described for sui generis US-MO 123 strain with a nsp1a, nsp1ab and capsid protein composed by 855, 1356 and 809 residues, respectively. The range sequence similarity of nsp1a, nsp1ab and the capsid protein of the USA strains characterized in this study is 94.79-100%, 96.3-100% and 93.51-100%, respectively. Not surprisingly, the lowest percent homology was observed in the capsid protein. These twenty novel USA strains cluster with previously described strains into three well-defined clusters. Nine strains originating from six farms/systems and six strains originating from four farms/systems clustered with the original neurotropic PoAstV3 strain USA/IA/7023/2017 (KY940545) and original fecal strain US-MO 123 (JX556691), respectively. Five of these novel strains originating from 2 farms/systems clustered with strains USA/IA/48142/2018 (MT394895) and USA/IA/53214/2018 (MT394896) which recently resulted in PoAstV3-polioencephalitis following experimental inoculation of CDCD pigs [12, 21, 28, 31, 60, 61] . Interestingly, strains from one farm/system (Farm N) clustered with both strain USA/IA/7023/2017 (KY940545) and strain US-MO 123 (JX556691). Based on the genetic analysis of strains originating from system N, it appears that within a system distinct PoAstV3 strains can cause neurological disease in sows with one strain also been found in feces of suckling piglets (Table S1 ). In contrast, on Farm B a subset of highly homologous PoAstV3 strains (>99% nt ORF2) was detected in multiple polioencephalomyelitis cases spanning a year (2018). Similarly, on Farm E and O highly homologous PoAstV3 strains (>99% nt ORF2) were detected in two individual animals experiencing PoAstV3associated neurological disease at the same time.",

We have also pursued virus isolation in a few of the samples identified in this study using multiple cell lines (i.e., PK-15, ST, BHK, Vero cells [data not shown]) with similar negative results. The inability to isolate neurotropic strains from clinical samples appears to be a common factor for many neurotropic astroviruses and this impediment may be partially compensated by the development of robust reverse genetics systems, as previously described, or by the development of specific permissive cell culture systems [44] . Hence, the study and characterization of RNA motifs associated with virus replication and translation initiation, as those commonly found in both UTRs may serve as an initial approach to develop future studies [17, 38, 40, 62] .",

This high degree of sequence conservation within the 5 UTR of PoAstV3 and other mamastroviruses, and the presence of conserved motifs among PoAstV3 and human astroviruses supports the notion of common ancestral origins and possible recombination events between members of the genus Mamastrovirus, including human astroviruses.",

In this study we identified a conserved polyprotein within the ORF1ab of USA PoAstV3 strains spanning between previously described cleavage sites encompassing the putative human astrovirus VPg. Furthermore, we found the RNA binding site [SATTFIQAKGKNKK] between residues 633-647 containing the conserved motif KGK(N/T)K previously characterized as the Nterminal end of calicivirus VPg, and the conserved proteolytic cleavage site [Q(K/A)] previously described in human astroviruses. In addition, the conserved motif EEY found in calicivirus VPg (including a tyrosine residue postulated to covalently associate with viral RNA) was also identified. This suggests that both KGK(N/T)K and EEY motifs of PoAstV3 putative VPg could bind viral RNA. Interestingly, the molecular weight of the putative PoAstV3 VPg is approximately 4.81 kDa, considerably smaller than those found in human astrovirus and caliciviruses with an estimate molecular weight of 11 kDa and 13-15 kDa, respectively [36, 45, 47, 48] . Future research directed to infer the role of this putative PoAstV3 VPg can aid in the development of in vitro infectivity studies designed to assess the relevance of this protein in cell culture systems [49, 50] .",

            "text": "In contrast to the 5 UTR, multiple protein binding sites analogous to human astroviruses are observed in the 3 UTR of PoAstV3. The 3 UTR secondary structure of PoAstV3s is complex and may adopt multiple secondary RNA conformations. This appears to be related to the presence of the duplicated tandem motif UUGAUUUUCU(U/C)UUUUUUCUU UAGGC found in USA and Spanish strains ( Figure 3 ). This sequence motif is absent in other European and Japanese strains and clearly demarks the conformation of the secondary structure and putative binding sites of PoAstV3 strains. The 3 UTR of Hungarian and Japanese PoAstV3 strains and German strain GER/L00919-K17/2014 is shorter and therefore possess fewer protein binding sites in comparison to USA and Spanish strains ( Figure 5 ). In GER/L00919-K17/2014, ESP/B333/2017, USA/IL/53219/20 and all Hungarian strains, SRSF5 is the first binding motif found at position 19-23 after the ORF2 stop codon. This binding site is replaced in 16 American strains and strain ESP/B377/2017 for hnRNPE2 binding site, spanning generally from nucleotides 19-22 upstream of the ORF2 stop codon. Adjacent to these motifs, the first PTB binding site is generally found spanning from nucleotides 24-29. Multiple intercalated PTB binding sites are found in all PoAstV3 strain. PTB motifs varies from two to four copies, with the fewest copies found in strain JPN/Bu4-2-1/2014 and the most in multiple USA strains. A dual binding site for PTB and hnRNEP2 is found as the last binding region of the 3 termini in all USA and Spanish strains. In contrast to the 3 UTRs of human astroviruses, no putative binding sites for SRSF2, SRSF3 and SRSF6 were identified, indicating that RNA binding motifs for these cellular proteins are different from those identified for human astroviruses. These features and the absence of predicted RBPs in the 5 UTR of PoAstV3 could indicate that translation initiation and replication of PoAstV3 differs from that postulated for human astroviruses, and other cellular proteins and RNA binding sites may play a role in these processes. In addition, the 3 UTR of all PoAstV3 strains have multiple additional amber, ochre, and opal stop codons after standard amber stop codon (opal in strain USA/IA/53797GA/2019, Figure S2 ) suggesting the possibility of non-canonical elongation and termination mechanisms, and the use of stop-codon read-through strategy by PoAstV3, as it was previously described in other viruses [51, 52] . Perhaps, the presence of repeat motif UUGAUUU-UCU(U/C)UUUUUUCUUUAGGC containing multiple additional RBPs as observed in the 3 UTR of USA and Spanish strains is an evolutionary strategy used by PoAstV3 to maximize its replication by stop-codon read-through elongation and termination [53] . Future in vitro studies analyzing the interaction of swine orthologues for PTB, SRSF2, SRSFF3 SRSF5, SRSF6, TIA and hnRNPE2 with the 3 UTR of PoAstV3 may elucidate if binding of these cellular proteins is a requirement for PoAstV3 replication.",

            "text": "In seminal work, Willcocks and Carter described two distinct stem motifs within the 3 termini of human astrovirus 1 (GenBank accession Z11682) [20, 65] . In this study, two partially homologous regions are consistently found in the 3 UTR of PoAstV3 sequences. The first motif found in the 3 UTR of all PoAstV3 located immediately after the stop codon, GAACGAGGGUACAG, makes up the 3 termini of s2m. The second motif, AAAUU-GAUUU, is found consistently in USA and Spanish strains but not in other PoAstV3 strains and is part of a transition sequence region between subsequent stem structures found on these PoAstV3 strains. These two motifs [GA(A/T)CGAGGGUACAG, AAAUUGAUUU] are also conserved in the 3 UTR of all classical human genotypes (HAstV1 to HAstV8) as shown by Monceyron et al. constituting the s2m and s1m motifs, respectively; however, in PoAstV3 due to the differences in length of their 3 UTRs and secondary RNA structure, the second motif AAAUUGAUUU is predicted to participate in the folding of two stem structures instead of one (s1m) as seen in human astroviruses. This remarkable difference between human astroviruses, possessing two conserved stem motifs within their 3 UTR, and PoAstV3, that may present 1 to 3 stem structures in their 3 UTR, as shown by USA and Spanish strains (three stems), Hungarian strains (two stems) and Japanese strains and strain GER/L00919-K17/2014 (one stem) may indicate promiscuous binding by PoAstV3 strains with unknown cellular proteins ( Figure 5 ). This difference is further accentuated when pseudoknots are predicted. Pseudoknot prediction indicates that the secondary structure of the 3 UTR of USA and Spanish strains remains as a three stem structure, while Hungarians strains adopt the conformation of a multibranched stem, similar to strain GER/L00919-K17/2014. Thus far, no predicted pseudoknots have been described in the 3 UTR of human astroviruses, although future in silico studies may corroborate the presence of pseudoknots in this region of human astroviruses and other members of the genus Mamastrovirus.",

Our analysis indicates that homologous binding regions are present in the 3 UTR of PoAstV3s. The elongation of the 3 UTR of USA and Spanish strains provides additional binding motifs when compared to other strains with shorter 3 UTRs (i.e., GER/L00919-K17/2014, Hungarian, and Japanese strains). The hairpin of the first and second stem motifs of USA and Spanish strains have binding sites for hnRNPE2 and SRSF5, respectively; and multiple PTB binding sites are predicted at the internal loops and bulges between these two stems. In contrast, GER/L00919-K17/2014 and Hungarian strains lack binding sites for hnRNPE2 within their secondary structure. Additionally, the stop codon is invariably present in the hairpin of stem loop analogous to s2m in all strains, with the exception of Japanese strains.",

Future in vitro studies should contemplate the association of the cellular proteins described herein and focus on the identification of unknown cellular proteins relevant for the replications of PoAstV3 in cell culture systems. In addition, the increasing number of PoAstV3 genomes available in public databases can help to understand hidden complexities of this virus and aid in the development of permissible cell lines for neurotropic astroviruses; however, the validity of predicted RNA structures described in this study should be further correlated in context with the global RNA structure of PoAstV3. Future analysis considering the global structure of PoAstV3 and other neurotropic mamastroviruses would be valuable for assessing possible interactions of the UTRs with other genomic regions. Global analyses may elucidate secondary or tertiary structures potentially crucial for translation and replication of neurotropic mamastroviruses, and therefore, useful for the development of cellular culture systems to study viral pathogenesis.",

Our results indicate that both antigenic epitopes identified are highly homologous within USA PoAstV3 strains and may elicit specific antibodies against PoAstV3.
