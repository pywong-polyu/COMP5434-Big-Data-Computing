            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to medical education systems and medical students. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on medical career and specialty choices among medical students. An online cross-sectional survey of Chinese medical students was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic from February to April 2020. The students' willingness to be a doctor before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and changed willingness to specialize in respiratory medicine and infectious diseases were investigated. Multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression was used to explore factors that were associated with changes of willingness. A total of 1,837 medical students, including 1,227 females (66.8%), with a median age of 21.0 years, were recruited. Of the participants, 10.6% and 6.9% showed increased and decreased willingness to be a doctor after the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. Moreover, 11.7% showed increased willingness and 9.5% showed decreased willingness to major in respiratory medicine and infectious diseases. Students with younger age, lower household income, fewer depressive symptoms, less exposure to negative pandemic information and more satisfaction with their own major after the pandemic were associated with increased willingness to be a doctor. Students who engaged in regular exercise, were males and undergraduate level, were interested in medicine, paid more attention to positive information, were satisfied with their majors, and had increased willingness to be a doctor after the pandemic were more likely to choose to specialize in respiratory medicine and infectious disease. However, the severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with decreased willingness to work in the specialties of respiratory medicine and infectious diseases. Psychological problems and professional satisfaction appear to be independent factors that affect medial career and specialty choices. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students require further research.",

The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent cancellation of clinical clerkships and rotations has posed unique challenges to students' education, which may affect their occupational belief formation. Although medical students may have more time to consider their own interests in terms of subspecialty selection, their opportunities to gain a deep understanding of the specialty of respiratory medicine and infectious diseases though clinical clerkship and rotation decreased during the pandemic [3] . In addition to the adverse impacts, there were also positive impacts of the pandemic on medical students in terms of the opportunities to solve the puzzles and mysteries of emerging infections and the encouragement to pursue altruistic and dedicated healthcare careers in a more determined way [4] .",

The pandemic and changes in educational patterns also had psychological effects on medical students [6] . Approximately 30% of medical students experienced psychological distress during the pandemic, and this distress was associated with several specific COVID-related stressors [7, 8] . More notably, 68% of medical students reported deterioration in their mental health since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic [9] . Both the COVID-19 pandemic and its related mental repercussions may exert some influence on students' future medical career choices. Psychological problems are related to decreased interest and increased regret of their career choice, and dropout rates among medical students have increased [10, 11] . Twenty percent of medical students believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect their choice of specialty [12] . Approximately one-third of medical students preferred not to return to the clinical setting after the pandemic [13] . Furthermore, witnessing the stress of frontline workers and the psychological distress from which they suffer while fighting the COVID-19 pandemic may also raise concern about the potential occupational hazards of medical professionals. Over one-third of health care workers (HCWs) suffer from psychological distress when exposed to a high risk of infection, heavy work intensity and insufficient medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic [14] [15] [16] . Medical students, who are the reserve force for developing medical and health services in China, may experience anticipated worries and increased stress after witnessing HCWs who are exposed to substantial stress.",

One preliminary study found that only 752,233 (15.91%) of 4,727,977 Chinese clinical medical graduates registered in clinical practice became practicing doctors during the period from 2005 to 2014 [19] . In addition, only onesixth of the 600,000 newly qualified young doctors have been registered at a healthcare institution during a 5-year period [20] . Possible reasons for this extremely low rate are that many Chinese medical graduates want to teach or conduct research at medical universities with a lower work intensity or to work at pharmaceutical companies with a higher salary. More notably, only 7% of internal medicine residents applied to the specialty of infectious diseases, and most of them decided to work in this field at the early stage of their medical education [21] .",

The present study found that the prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia in students with decreased willingness to be a doctor were 59.5%, 56.3% and 38.1%, respectively, and were higher than in other reports conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic [27] . These findings were consistent with previous studies that found that major public health outbreaks could further increase the degree of anxiety and stress in medical students [7, 28] . Interestingly, we found that the severity of depression symptoms was negatively associated with willingness to be a doctor, and the severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with decreased willingness to select majors in respiratory medicine or infectious disease after the COVID-19 pandemic. This may occur because psychological problems could enhance burnout, affect medical career interest and increase career choice regret and dropout rates among medical students [10, 11] . These findings highlight the importance of improving the mental health of medical students and hopefully provide better control and prevention of pandemic infection. On the other hand, there was also a seemingly positive influence of the pandemic on the determination and enhanced interest in medical study in a group of students. Such a positive influence was also witnessed during the previous SARS-CoV epidemic, in which the general population reported enhanced positive mental health impacts [29] .",

Major satisfaction refers to an individual's evaluation of their current majors and major-related future careers, which is critical in the career development process [30, 31] . Besides, we also found that being interested in medicine was associated with increased willingness while making choice of medical career according to their own wishes was less likely to decrease willingness to major in respiratory medicine and infectious diseases. Academic interest is associated with career choice motivation [32] . 'Match with interest' is proved to be more important than job characteristics, major attributes, and other psychological and social factors when choosing a major [33] . In addition, interests are found to be the primary factor in choosing infectious disease specialties among graduating medical residents and are associated with medical students' career choice motivation [3, 32] . Therefore, students should consider their interests when choosing medicine majors, and medical schools should offer diversified and individualized courses in clinical medicine and add career planning sessions to create an appropriate learning environment for medical students, enhance their interest in medicine, increase their major satisfaction and professional belief, and help them make their career specialty decisions.",

Paying more attention to positive information about the pandemic, e.g., the selfless dedication of healthcare workers and the respectable career choice of being a doctor, may reduce professional uncertainties. However, paying more attention to negative information about the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a higher risk of psychological problems among both medical staff and students [16, 34] . This study also found that individuals who had relatives with suspected or confirmed infection may be more likely to decrease willingness to choose respiratory medicine and infectious diseases as their majors. Given the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and specialty choice, the education department should develop effective response measures for medical students, help them establish positive values and attitudes, and strengthen the role of professional ethics in education. In addition, an emerging combined subspecialty of critical care medicine and infectious diseases model may encourage more students to choose this field [35] .",

First, as this study adopted a cross-sectional design, it remains unknown whether medical students' attitudes towards career choice will change when the pandemic is under control or after graduation. Second, we did not use standardized, interviewerrated, and formally validated questionnaires when assessing career and specialty choices. The factors that may influence the career choice of medical students have not been sufficiently investigated. Thus, qualitative studies with a comprehensive understanding of the potential reasons for changes in career choices are needed in the future. Third, the sample size in the current study was modest, and this convenience sample was unlikely to be representative of the group of medical students, which may bias the results. Fourth, although the sample characteristic of respondents was similar with previous online cross-sectional study [36] , we cannot obtain the sample characteristic of nonrespondents in this online cross-sectional survey, no comparison between respondents and nonrespondents can be conducted, there maybe has non-response bias. Fifth, only changes in choosing a career as a doctor and as a respiratory or infectious disease physician before and after the pandemic were investigated, and other majors were not included.",
