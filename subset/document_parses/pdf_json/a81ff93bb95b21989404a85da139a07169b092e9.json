            "text": "Although current industry guidelines to control the spread of aerosols such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) have adopted a six-foot (~1.8 m) spacing between individuals indoors, recent evidence suggests that longer range spread is also responsible for infections in public spaces. The vehicle for long-range spread is smaller (<5 \u03bcm) droplets or particles, termed bio-aerosols, or aerosols for short, which have a large surface area to volume ratio such that aerodynamic drag is much larger than gravity forces. The aerosols remain suspended in air for extended time periods, and they essentially move with air currents. Prediction of the danger to occupants in a closed room when exposed to an infected individual requires knowledge of the period of exposure and the concentration level of aerosols in the breathing zone of an occupant. To obtain an estimate of the concentration level, a common assumption is well-mixed conditions within an interior space. This is obtained from a mass balance between the level of aerosol produced by an infected individual along with the airflow rate into and out of the entire space. In this work, we use computational fluid dynamics, compared with experimental results in several cases, to explore the aerosol concentration distribution in a typical classroom for several common conditions and compare these results to the well-mixed assumption. We use a tracer gas to approximately simulate the flow and dispersion of the aerosol-air mixture. The two ventilation systems examined, ceiling diffusers and open windows, yield average concentrations at occupant breathing level 50 % greater than the well mixed case, and some scenarios yield concentrations that are 150 % greater than the well mixed concentration at specific breathing-level locations. Of particular concern are two conditions: horizontal air flow from an open window in line with a row of seating and, second, an infected individual seated near a sealed cold window. For the former, conditions are improved if a baffle is placed inside the open window to direct the air toward the floor, creating a condition similar to displacement ventilation. In the latter, the cold air flowing down along the cold window recirculates aerosols back into the breathing zone. Adding window covers or a portable heater below the window surface will moderate this condition.",

Despite this impact and the enormity of the research that has gone into prevention strategies, many of the industry guidelines currently in use assume a well-mixed air model [1, 2] , which holds that the aerosol concentration is uniform throughout a room volume at a specific moment in time. This assumption has inherent flaws regarding both personal protection and energy consumption. Building on government guidelines and published literature, six-foot (~1.8 m) spacing between individuals and the wearing of face masks are now generally accepted practices for reducing transmission rates [3] [4] [5] . However, recent evidence has suggested that longer range spread is responsible for infections in public spaces such as restaurants [6] , public transit [7] , hotels [8] , hospitals [9] , multistory buildings [10, 11] , and cruise ships [12] [13] [14] .",

It is even possible that the aerosols are more infectious than larger particles [20] . The upper limit for the size of these bio-aerosols is 5 \u03bcm [15, [21] [22] [23] , with a possibility of particles less than 100-200 \u03bcm becoming aerosols through evaporation [24] . As these aerosols can settle with time, an assumption of the settling velocity can be found from the Stokes equation for the drag between particles and surrounding air [25] , assuming a spherical shape and density of liquid water. The Stokes equation suggests that the relative velocity between the particle and the surrounding air is less than 10 \u2212 3 m/s, or rather, that the bio-aerosols follow the trajectory of the room air currents. Such concerns are not new [26, 27] and serve to raise questions about understanding the efficacy of ventilation systems [16, [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

While the well-mixed values can lend valuable information regarding the air change rate necessary to ventilate a space, we have reason to believe that room specific conditions such as ventilation type and the locations of individuals can have large effects on the distribution of aerosol in the room.",

Kwon [39] presents evidence of the transmission of SARS-CoV2 across the width of a South Korean restaurant where an individual was infected from approximately 6.5 m away. Subsequent measurements of the air flow in the restaurant revealed a horizontal air stream originating from a ceiling diffuser, moving down a wall, and then being deflected by a table to form a horizontal flow with a velocity of about 1 m/s. The air stream passed close to an infected customer seated near the wall and then across the room to a second customer, who became infected. Due to this evidence of location dependent infection, we analyze both the well-mixed concentrations as well as the situation-specific hotspots of high aerosol concentration.",

            "text": "In the past, detailed studies of airflow behavior in interior spaces have been carried out, both experimentally [40] and computationally [41] , to characterize natural ventilation patterns. People at rest generate about 75 W, heating the surrounding air and creating rising plumes of warm air [42] . These plumes have a typical velocity on the order of 0.1-0.3 m/s. As they rise, they entrain cooler surrounding air and continue up until they encounter a layer of air at the same temperature. At this layer, the plumes will dissipate and mix with the surrounding air [43, 44] . Walls and floors heated by solar gains can also warm nearby air to create positively buoyant flows while cold windows create downflowing cold films with negative buoyancy. These buoyant flows, created by heat fluxes into and out of the room, interact with airflow from windows, vents, HVAC supply ducts, diffusers, and other heated and cooled objects in the room. HVAC systems are designed to limit the internal air velocity around humans to reduce discomfort due to draft. Discomfort is observed generally when the air velocity reaches the range of 0.3 m/s and above [42] . Therefore, the thermal plumes and mechanical air flows have velocities that are of the same order of magnitude and together dictate the overall air flow pattern in interior spaces. The only exception is air flow from windows under high wind conditions and possibly flow created by ceiling fans that can dominate the internal flow behavior. Results from natural ventilation studies have revealed a complex pattern of air flow in buildings. In some cases, a thick heated layer of air is present below the ceiling. In others, there are downward flowing streamlines of cooler air or a series of large swirling vortices [41] .",

It has been shown that tracer gases are accurate as a substitute for simulating individual particles since aerodynamic drag is much larger than gravity forces, making them behave similarly to a gas. One main difference between gas and particle simulations is that deposition of droplets on surfaces is not present when using a tracer gas. However, for particles between 200 nm and 1 \u03bcm in diameter, deposition is minimal [10, 51] . Another difference between particle and gas models is that gas models neglect evaporation. Experimental analysis of exhaled aerosols by Morawska et al. showed that non-equilibrium particle evaporation was not detectable for aerosols between 0.5 and 20 \u03bcm in diameter [31] . Thus, evaporation was neglected in our models. Further, the similarity of results between particle simulations and tracer gas simulations has been confirmed experimentally and computationally through many studies [10, 51] . We also ran our own confirmation test by comparing a simulation using discrete water droplet particles the size of aerosols with a simulation using carbon monoxide as a tracer gas.",

The particles in the plume rise to the ceiling at a velocity of about 0.15 m/s.

Based on the nature of double hung windows, we assume a constant inflow of air through the bottom pair of windows at 1 m/s and set the top windows to be pressure outlets. There is no other exhaust vent. This situation would be similar to placing a fan near the lower windows or a breezy day with an overhang blocking the wind approaching the upper windows. There is no other outlet in the room. The results are pictured in Fig. 7 , with infected individuals indicated with a red arrow. In this simulation, a circular airflow pattern arises as cool air enters through the windows and sinks due to buoyancy effects while maintaining a horizontal velocity. As the air is warmed by the students and teacher, it rises and is pulled back toward the upper outlet window due to the positive pressure difference created by the incoming air. As seen in Fig. 7(a) and (c), this creates a dangerous situation when an infected student is seated next to the window, as infected aerosols are pushed directly into the next student by horizontal currents. Since the incoming air is cooler, the airstream drops as it moves toward the next student. If the open window was slightly higher, the concentration around the next student might be higher since the incoming air will blow rising aerosols from the infected individual's plume and reach the next student at breathing level. The infected student farther away from the window does not create a hazardous environment for the person sitting next to them, and we mainly see the infected aerosols they breathed out rise to the ceiling.",

From these simulation results, it was seen that there is no large difference between the mild heating in Fig. 13 (c) and mild cooling case, but as soon as the net heat flux increases across the window, there are greater temperature gradients throughout the room, intensifying airflow patterns, and increasing airflow velocities. When the HVAC system compensates for a higher outside temperature, without adjusting the flow rate, the inlet temperature is decreased. This colder air, causes the air around the diffusers to sink down, including air which has risen in the infected plume. So as the inlet temperature decreases, the temperature gradient increases, causing more air to sink to the floor. This pattern is displayed in Fig. 16 , which shows the streamlines for the more extreme cooling case, Simulation K.",

The infected individual in Simulation M is moved to the front row, to investigate dependence on location with respect to the window. In the CO mass fraction planes in Fig. 17 , the values are much higher than the other simulations, because the mouth velocity was increased without changing the geometry, the total CO volume introduced into the space increases proportionally. To provide adequate comparison between simulations, the scales for simulations L and M have been adjusted accordingly with respect to the well-mixed concentration. From the box and whisker plot in Fig. 18 , we can see that the normalized mass fraction values are higher for Simulations L and M than the lower velocity case in Simulation F. This further confirms our previous study on the effects of varied exhale speed in Fig. 5 . We can see that when the exhalation velocity is high enough, the exhaled air travels fast enough to escape the entraining effects of the thermal plume and spreads more by diffusion in the breathing plane.",

Samples of the average CO mass fraction near the breathing zone of all non-infected individuals in a sphere of radius 0.33 m centered around the head were taken in each natural ventilation and HVAC simulation. The results of these samples are shown in the box-andwhisker graph in Fig. 18 . The values are normalized with respect to the well-mixed CO mass fraction for each simulation. The distribution of CO mass fraction values can then be used as an indicator of infection risk for each of the situations. Cases A through E have ventilation through open windows while the rest of the cases use a standard HVAC ventilation design.

If we assume large disturbances when the occupants leave the room, the well-mixed initial assumption is not far off. From the transient simulation, we found the average, maximum, and minimum volumetric mass fraction at 60 s intervals, and compared them to the corresponding theoretical, well-mixed values.

However, with demand control ventilation and a reduced occupancy level, although the CO 2 remains within prescribed limits, the resultant reduction of the outside air ventilation will result in a higher average concentration of aerosol in the room produced from an infected occupant (if present) than the same occupant in a room at full occupancy. Therefore, with reduced room occupancy, the chance of encountering an infected individual decreases. Yet if an individual is infected, the infection risk for other occupants increases with reduced room occupancy when demand control ventilation based on CO 2 feedback is used. To address these scenarios, the safest operation requires a constant flow of outside air irrespective of occupancy level. To alleviate the energy impact of this strategy, an alternative approach may include a high-performance filtration system. Further work is needed to address this filtration question, as well as additional simulations of airflow to identify safe seating configurations with low occupancy and reduced airflow rates.",

However, higher horizontal velocities (such as a person without a mask or face shield) can escape the thermal plume and can linger within the breathing plane of others. These thermal plumes from people and heated objects continue to have an impact on air flow within the room, along with influences from cold or heated surfaces, mechanical HVAC systems, and outside air ventilation. Two HVAC systems have been examined to show that, even with industry standard air change rates, the well-mixed assumption as applied to a conventional HVAC system made up of ceiling diffusers may underpredict the contaminant levels inhaled by the occupants by half. Even with the window open, the perceived safety of the well-mixed assumption is too conservative and underpredicts the potential exposure by 60 %.",
