Objectives Current short communication study assessed pharmaceutical market crisis during the COVID-19 era; discussing short-and long-term impacts of the pandemic on the pharmaceutical sector. Results Short-term impacts of COVID-19 pandemic includes demand changes, regulation revisions, research and development process changes and the shift towards tele-communication and tele-medicine.

A medicine shortage is defined as a \"supply issue that affects how the pharmacy prepares or dispenses a drug product or influences patient care when prescribers must use an alternative agent\" [9] . On the global levels, many regulatory authorities announced confirmed shortage list, mostly including potential COVID-19 treatments and also associated pneumonia. For example, United States food and drug administration (FDA) shortage list included anti-COVID-19 potential pharmacotherapies, hydroxychloroquine (HQC) and chloroquine (QC), and also frequently prescribed medications for COVID-19 hospitalized patients with respiratory signs in critical care units, azithromycin, dopamine, dobutamine, fentanyl, heparin, midazolam, propofol and dexmedetomidine [10] . In addition, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) announced an 11medicine list of shortage; which mainly included hospital level antibiotics and anesthetic medications; including meropenem, ceftazidim, ampicillin and doxycycline, as antibiotics and vecuronium, rocuronium, as anesthetics. Also, this list included albuterol and fluticasone which are used to open airways in the lungs [11] . In global levels, the impact on medicine shortage was differed by medicine access level, retail and hospital-only, and type. Use of medicines currently being investigated in trials but not yet fully approved by FDA or so-called investigational treatmentsincluding hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir+ritonavir, tocilizumab and sarilumab-had seen a two-fold increase in use over the past month, with 8 times higher use in hospitals [12] .

One of the explanations for this may be the high stock of raw materials; which is justified by the market uncertainties due to Iran's economic and political factors, which leads companies to over-stock. The other reason was currency allocation to importation of COVID-19 required medications, by the government. For example, lopinavir+ritonavir accounted for 0.18% (2 of 1101 billion US Dollars) of six-month approved currency order by IFDA to Iran central bank, for raw materials, finished pharmaceuticals and dietary formula.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "COVID-19 short and long-term impacts on pharmaceutical sector"}, {"text": "This COVID-19 related shortage also affected the health market for medical devices and personal protective equipment (PPE), which includes protective goggles and visors, mouth-nose protection equipment, and protective clothing and gloves, that made countries to legislate regulations in this regards.

In Australia, a one-month-stock regulation for dispensing of prescription medicines, is somehow handling the situation of panic-buying [18] . In Germany, German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) published an allocation order on the storage and demanddriven supply of human medicines, on March 2020. The allocation order requested the pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers not to supply medicines beyond the usual demand [19] .

This is more critical when nonsubstitutional essential APIs, such as amoxicillin, potassium clavulanate, ceftriaxone potassium sterile, meropenam, vancomycin, gentamycin and ciprofloxacin are being concerned. In India, the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) asked government to restrict of all pharmaceutical products, APIs and formulation to domestic consumption only. This shortage has already begun to affect API and bulk prices in Indian party trades. The average increase was reported to be about 10-15%; however, may reach to 50% in some cases [20] .
