Botswana is a signatory to the WHO/World bank vaccine initiative and expects to receive its first COVID-19 vaccines in March 2021. Acceptance and risk perception for COVID-19 vaccines is unknown in Botswana. There have been several conspiracy theories around COVID-19 vaccines which are mostly linked to religious and cultural beliefs which may influence the uptake of the vaccine [20] . The widely used social media platforms have also reported on the negative aspects of the vaccine and its side effects which may also influence the population's attitudes and perceptions resulting in low acceptance [21] . We therefore assessed the acceptance and risk perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines in Botswana in order to inform the planned population roll out of the vaccines.

The first model focused on factors associated with the acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine while the second model focused on factors associated safety perception. When the dependent variable is vaccine acceptance the following variables were significantly associated the outcome; sex, age, education level, willingness to wear mask, employment status and medical history. Generally, males have higher odds of accepting the vaccine compared to females (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.4).

The odds of willing to receive COVID-19 vaccine are lower for those who indicated that religion or cultural beliefs hinder vaccine uptake compared those who did not (OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.3).

In order to achieve herd immunity and prevent hospitalizations as a result of COVID-19, the country needs to vaccinate a high proportion of individuals eligible for vaccination. This requires sufficient vaccine acceptance and low risk perception which can be achieved through social mobilization, health education and health promotion activities targeted towards the eligible groups. The acceptance rate of 73.4% is similar to that of an online survey conducted in France in May 2020 and from other parts of Europe (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the UK) [25, 26] . However, the acceptance rate in Botswana is higher than that of Uganda and Russia [10, 19] . The acceptance rate is lower compared to China and countries like Chile [10, 13] . The study team considered these results satisfactory for an upper middle-income country like Botswana which did not participate in any COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials compared to first world countries like the UK and Germany. The difference in acceptance rate among countries could be attributed to many factors such as population dynamics, literacy levels, experience in management of vaccine preventable disease and other factors. The interesting finding in our study is that the acceptance rate is high and risk perception is low. This could likely be due to \"intervention fatigue\" amongst the community from prolonged compulsory mask wearing laws, nationwide lockdowns and curfews that have been implemented since the beginning of the pandemic, which was earlier and more rigid than in many countries. However, this has not been studied. Those with comorbidities have been adversely affected by COVID-19 compared to those without comorbidities and from this study we see a high acceptance rate among individuals with comorbidities. This is a population that is at high risk for poor outcomes if infected with COVID-19 [27] , therefore it is important that acceptance rate remains high in this group as well as the elderly. Knowing their high risk of severe disease may have contributed to a high acceptance rate in this population. This high acceptance rate is vital for the country's vaccine roll out plan as individuals with comorbidities will be prioritized.",

Having a robust immunization program can bring positive outcomes to vaccine uptake and risk perception. Since 1979 when the EPI program was launched, Botswana has introduced a number of vaccines like rotavirus (2012), Measles and Rubella (2016), and this could also be a factor that contributes to a low risk perception.",

It will provide a foundation for future studies and baseline information for the monitoring of acceptance and risk-perception of COVID-19 vaccination. Participation was on a voluntary basis therefore the survey had potential for self-selection bias by community members who are particularly concerned about the pandemic. However, probabilistic sampling (stratified Sampling method) was employed. The study also used self-administered questionnaires and the disadvantages of self-administered questionnaires is low response rates, exclusion of those who cannot read and write, and that the researcher cannot couch for the validity of the responses from self-administered surveys. However in our study the response rate was high more than 95% and also around 95.7% of participants had at least attended primary school level. Four point three (4.3%) percent of the participants did not respond the question on educational background. Furthermore, the investigators included all the nine COVID-19 zones of Botswana to ensure external validity. A total of 5300 out of 5745 people participated in the study, however an adequate response rate (92.2%) was achieved. The study was carried out at a time when people's perceptions may be highly volatile due to exposure to several other opinions on the internet. Replication of the study at different points during the course of vaccine roll-out will be beneficial. The study did not explore in depth the reasons for the high acceptance rate and low risk perception. A qualitative study is recommended to explore these reasons.",
