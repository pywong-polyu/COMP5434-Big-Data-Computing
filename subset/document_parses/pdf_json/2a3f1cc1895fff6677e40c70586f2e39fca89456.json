In today's interconnected global society, such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards, as exemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the network transmission of contagious diseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the so-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will cause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds from the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the epidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu modeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk sampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small fraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and demonstrate their empirical superiority.",

Many infectious diseases are also contagious, which means the infection can be transmitted from one person to another when there is some interaction (e.g., physical proximity) between them. Today, we live in an interconnected world where such contagious diseases could spread through social contact networks to become global public health hazards. A recent example of this phenomenon is the Covid-19 outbreak caused by the so-called novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has spread to many countries Zhu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) . This recent global outbreak has caused serious social and economic repercussions, such as massive restrictions on movement and share market decline (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . It is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the transmission of contagious diseases through social contact networks from the perspective of statistical inference.",

            "text": "Consider an infection being transmitted through a population of n individuals. According to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model of disease spread, the pathogen can be transmitted from an infected person (I) to a susceptible person (S) with an infection rate given by \u03b2, and an infected individual becomes recovered (R) with a recovery rate given by \u00b5. This can be modeled as a Markov chain whose state at time t is given by a vector (X t 1 , . . . , X t n ), where X t i denotes the state of the i th individual at time t, i.e., X t i \u2208 {S, I, R}. For the population of n individuals, the state space of this Markov chain becomes extremely large with 3 n possible configurations, which makes it impractical to study the exact system. This problem was addressed in a series of three seminal papers by Kermack and McKendrick (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927 , 1932 , 1933 . Instead of modeling the disease state of each individual at at a given point of time, they proposed compartmental models, where the goal is to model the number of individuals in a particular disease state (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered) at a given point of time. Since their classical papers, there has been a tremendous amount of work on compartmental modeling of contagious diseases over the last ninety years (Hethcote, 2000; Van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002; Brauer et al., 2012) .",

An edge connecting an infected node and a susceptible node represents a potential path for pathogen transmission. This framework can realistically represent the heterogeneous nature of social contacts, and therefore provide much more accurate modeling of the contagion process than compartmental models.

It is of particular interest to know whether the pathogen will die out or lead to an epidemic. This is dictated by a set of boundary conditions known as the epidemic threshold, which depends on the SIR parameters \u03b2 and \u00b5 as well as the network structure itself. Above the epidemic threshold, the pathogen invades and infects a finite fraction of the population. Below the epidemic threshold, the prevalence (total number of infected individuals) remains infinitesimally small in the limit of large networks (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015) . There is growing evidence that such thresholds exist in real-world host-pathogen systems, and intervention strategies are formulated and executed based on estimates of the epidemic threshold. (Dallas et al., 2018; Shulgin et al., 1998; Wallinga et al., 2005; Pourbohloul et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2005) . Fittingly, the last two decades have seen a significant emphasis on studying epidemic thresholds of contact networks from several disciplines, such as computer science, physics, and epidemiology (Newman, 2002; Wang et al., 2003; Colizza and Vespignani, 2007; Chakrabarti et al., 2008; G\u00f3mez et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016 .

In this paper, we address these gaps by developing a novel sampling-based method to estimate the epidemic threshold under the widely used Chung-Lu model (Aiello et al., 2000) , also known as the configuration model. We prove that our proposed method has theoretical guarantees for both statistical accuracy and computational efficiency.

As this ratio grows larger, an epidemic becomes more likely, as new infections outpace recoveries. The right hand side of Equation (1) is the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix, which is purely a function of the network and independent of the pathogen. Larger the spectral radius, the more connected the network, and therefore an epidemic becomes more likely. Thus, the boundary condition in Equation (1) connects the two aspects of the contagion process, the pathogen transmissibility which is quantified by \u03b2/\u00b5, and the social contact network which is quantified by the spectral radius. If \u03b2 \u00b5 < 1 \u03bb(A) , the pathogen dies out, and if \u03b2 \u00b5 > 1 \u03bb(A) , the pathogen becomes an epidemic. Given a social contact network, the inverse of the spectral radius of its adjacency matrix represents the epidemic threshold for the network. Any pathogen whose transmissiblity ratio is greater than this threshold is going to cause an epidemic, whereas any pathogen whose transmissiblity ratio is less than this threshold is going to die out. Therefore, a key problem in network epidemiology is to compute the spectral radius of the social contact network.",

The model parameters \u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 n were uniformly sampled from (0, 0.25). Then, we randomly generated 100 networks from the model, and computed \u03bb(A) and T 1 (A). The results are reported in Table 2 . Average runtime for the moment based estimator, T 1 (A), is only 0.07 seconds for n = 5000 and 0.35 seconds for n = 10000, whereas for the spectral radius, \u03bb(A), it is 78.2 seconds and 606.44 seconds respectively, which makes the latter 1100-1700 times more computationally burdensome. The average error for T 1 (A) is very small, and so is the SD of errors. Thus, even for moderately sized networks where n = 5000 or n = 10000, using T 1 (A) as a proxy for \u03bb(A) can reduce the computational cost to a great extent, and the corresponding loss in accuracy is very small. For massive networks where n is in millions, this advantage of T 1 (A) over \u03bb(A) is even greater; however, the computational burden for \u03bb(A) becomes so large that this case is difficult to illustrate using standard computing equipment.",

Therefore, this does not solve the second issue pointed out at the beginning of Section 2.1. We now propose a second alternative, T 2 , to address the second issue. The idea behind this approximation is based on the same heuristic that was laid out in Section 2.2. Since \u03bb(P ) is a function of degree moments, we can estimate these moments using observed node degrees. In defining T 1 (A), we used observed degrees of all n nodes in the network. However, we can also estimate the degree moments by considering a small sample of nodes, based on random walk sampling. The algorithm for computing T 2 is given in Algorithm 1.",

Measuring the cost of uniform node sampling in this setting, for instance, would need to keep track of how many nodes are touched by a Metropolis-Hastings walk that implements the uniform distribution. Figure 1 demonstrates the results. For the two synthetic networks, the algorithm is able to get a 10% approximation to the statistic T 1 (A) by exploring at most 10% of the network. With more samples from the random walk, the mean relative errors settle to around 4-5%. However, once we measure the mean relative errors with respect to \u03bb(A), it becomes clearer that the estimator T 2 (A) does better when the graph is closer to the assumed (i.e. Chung-Lu) model. For the Chung-Lu graph, the mean error \u03bb\u2212T 2 essentially is very similar to T 1\u2212T 2 , which is to be expected.

We considered the two challenges that arise in this context, due to high computational and data-collection complexity of the spectral radius. For the Chung-Lu network generative model, the spectral radius can be characterized in terms of the degree moments. We utilized this fact to develop two approximations of the spectral radius. The first approximation is computationally efficient and statistically accurate, but requires data on observed degrees of all nodes. The second approximation retains the computationally efficiency and statistically accuracy of the first approximation, while also reducing the number of queries or the sample size quite substantially.
