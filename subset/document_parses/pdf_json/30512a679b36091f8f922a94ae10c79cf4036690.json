Perhaps unsurprisingly, head CT interpretation concordance between EPs and radiologists has been shown to be poor across a variety of practice settings.

Existing literature shows poor concordance between emergency physicians and radiologists in head CT interpretation. Prior studies have used passive learning methods to address this knowledge gap. We created an active learning curriculum for teaching head CT interpretation to emergency medicine (EM) residents and compared its effectiveness to a passive learning strategy.",

After consent, residents took a pre-test of head CT interpretation and were subsequently randomized to an active learning cohort (ALC) or passive learning cohort (PLC). Three educational sessions (on intracranial hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, and increased intracranial pressure) were delivered monthly over a three-month period via Zoom conference (Zoom Video Communications, Inc., San Jose, CA). The ALC convened in a virtual breakout room where residents accessed head CT teaching cases on Pascbin using their individual computers (cases in Supplement). Pacsbin simulates a radiology PACS, allowing learners to scroll through CTs (including axial/ coronal/sagittal views), annotate images, adjust brightness and contrast, and access built-in links to instructional diagrams. Residents scrolled through head CTs guided by teaching points built into each case. After finishing the cases the ALC had a 10-minute, live question-and-answer (Q&A) session led by one of the investigators.",

As educators, this forces us to consider the complex issue that teaching one topic to sufficient depth can come at the expense of time for other topics in residency education. In this study, we designed an evidence-based and learner-centered solution for teaching head CT interpretation and found this was achievable within the time and resource constraints of our residency's didactic conference curriculum. Active learning is rooted in constructivist learning theory and posits that learners build knowledge frameworks through active engagement with learning material. 32 Despite extensive evidence supporting active learning approaches, passive learning remains the dominant modality in most educational settings. 14, 19, 21, 22 Avoidance of active learning may be related to the perception that it requires extra time or resources; however, our intervention fit into an existing residency didactic conference schedule without requiring extra time either during or outside the session.",

This intervention embedded the didactic content into a Pascbin and incorporated all the skills needed to correctly interpret a non-contrast head CT (e.g., manipulating window presets, brightness and contrast, and identifying pathologic findings in relation to key anatomic structures). This forced learners to interact with the didactic content in a way that is lost with lectures or videos. This approach to teaching head CT interpretation has not been previously described in the literature and represents an important step forward from the historical reliance on passive learning strategies to address this key content area. We designed this study to specifically isolate the influence of passive vs active engagement with the learning material. Both the ALC and PLC were exposed to identical cases, embedded prompts, and questions. The two groups received identical amounts of time to review the material using Zoom breakout rooms to control length of exposure, and both received the same amount of time to ask clarifying questions. The crucial difference between the two groups was how they engaged with the learning material. The PLC watched videos where an instructor scrolled through cases whereas the ALC had to scroll through cases themselves. Given that all other learning conditions were controlled for, we hypothesize that making residents in the ALC search for and identify key findings on their own may have facilitated deeper knowledge encoding and greater improvement in diagnostic accuracy.",

The videos watched by the PLC were made to be engaging, clear, and easy to follow. It is possible the videos' cognitive fluency produced an illusion of learning and robbed the viewers of effortful learning, leading to poorer retention. 16, [33] [34] [35] In contrast, the ALC had to scroll through images and search for findings, which likely contributed to some degree of effortful learning. We realize that the three 60-minute Pacsbin sessions given to the ALC were insufficient to ensure complete understanding of all this content, despite showing improved performance compared to the PLC. However, this work serves as a proof of concept and a potential springboard for spaced repetition. After residents complete the initial modules, single cases can be delivered synchronously or asynchronously and completed in a shorter time frame. We suspect these subsequent cases might serve as booster inoculations, strengthening knowledge encoding and potentially improving scores on future tests.",
