Human rhinoviruses, which cause almost two-thirds of colds, have demonstrated temperature-dependent replication which is optimal between 33\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C. Methods This randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial completed at a single-centre in New Zealand, recruited 170 participants aged 18-75 years (mean age 27.5 years) who were within 48 hours of common cold symptom onset and had a symptom score (the Modified Jackson Score (MJS)) \u22657 and a negative pointof-care test for influenza. Participants were blinded to the intervention and randomised (1:1) to 5 days of either nasal high flow rhinothermy (rNHF) (100% humidified air delivered at 35 L/min and 41\u00b0C for 2 hours daily) (n=85) or 'sham' rhinothermy (100% humidified air delivered at 10 L/min and 31\u00b0C for 10 min daily) (n=85) and completed daily symptom diaries, which included the MJS, for 14 days, to investigate whether rNHF reduced common cold symptom severity and duration compared with 'sham' rhinothermy. Results An intention-to-treat superiority analysis included all randomised participants and showed no difference between treatment groups for the primary outcome, the day 4 MJS analysed by analysis of covariance: mean (SD) 6.33 (3.97) for rNHF vs 5.8 (3.15) for 'sham'; estimated difference (95% CI) 0.37 (\u22120.69 to 1.42), p=0.49. There was no difference in time until resolution of symptoms: mean (SD) 5.96 (4.47) days for rNHF vs 6.42 (4.09) days for 'sham'; estimated difference (95% CI) 1.02 (0.75 to 1.38), p=0.91. There were no serious adverse events related to the study treatments. Conclusions This well-powered, single-blind randomised controlled trial does not provide evidence that 5 days of rNHF (100% humidified air heated to 41\u00b0C delivered at 35 L/min for 2 hours daily) reduces common cold symptom severity or duration. However, investigation of rNHF in the treatment of influenza is warranted. Trial registration number ACTRN12617001340325.",

In the USA alone, non-influenza viral respiratory tract infections cause an estimated 20 million lost workdays, 110 million physician visits and 6 million emergency department visits annually, 4 producing an economic burden of US$40 billion each year. 4 There are many cold remedies marketed, however, the evidence for their effectiveness is inconclusive or, at most, demonstrates limited symptom reduction. 5 Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) cause up to two-thirds of colds and have temperaturedependent replication. 6 In vitro replication of most HRV strains is optimal between 33\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C, 6 which is the normal physiological temperature of the upper airways, 6 whereas temperatures of 39\u00b0C-45\u00b0C have been demonstrated to inhibit viral replication.

A Cochrane systematic review identified six studies in which participants with the common cold were treated with HHA, and reported no evidence of harm or benefit. 1 However, the evidence quality was low grade, 1 and the studies used a variety of delivery systems which may have been inefficient and inconsistent in their delivery of HHA to the upper airways. 7 14-17 These limitations are potentially overcome with the use of a nasal high flow (NHF) device which can deliver gas at a consistent temperature with minimal entrainment of ambient air.",

Study strengths include the investigator supervised first treatment which ensured the first dose was received, and the use of a sham intervention. The sham intervention reduced any potential device-related effect, as medical devices may have an enhanced placebo effect. 25 26 There are a number of potential explanations for the lack of efficacy of rNHF. The first is that the nasopharyngeal temperature achieved during rNHF treatment was not high enough to inhibit viral replication, either because the temperature of the inspired gas in the nasopharynx was cooler than the 41\u00b0C delivered by the device, or a temperature higher than 41\u00b0C is required to inhibit viral replication. The majority of temperature sensitivity (ts) data for common cold viruses relate to HRV and have demonstrated ts in vitro at 37\u00b0C-45\u00b0C, [8] [9] [10] although some HRV strains have been shown to replicate equally well or better at 37\u00b0C. [27] [28] [29] [30] The variability among HRV strains and limited ts data for other common cold viruses, created a challenge when selecting an optimal temperature for the rhinothermy regimen. For example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, members of the genus \u03b2-coronaviruses of the coronaviridae family, lose infectivity following exposure to temperatures exceeding 56\u00b0C, 31 32 however, there is little ts data for coronaviruses that cause the common cold.",

Nevertheless, this concern remains based on the in vitro study by Conti et al which noted that HRV replication was inhibited by 20 min exposure to a temperature of 45\u00b0C, and that the greatest effect occurred at 6 hours postinfection, with a 99% reduction in virus yield compared with the control. 8 In contrast, this temperature did not change viral protein synthesis at nine and 11 hours post infection, leading to the hypothesis that the antiviral effect of high temperature was a posttranslational event. 8 These results highlight the potential importance of treatment start time, and suggest that earlier start times could be required for optimal impact on viral replication, although the narrow time-window poses practical challenges.",

However, 18% of enrolled participants in this study were positive for other coronaviruses (48% of which were \u03b2-coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43). Therefore, a post hoc analysis testing for an interaction between CoV status and the primary outcome was considered relevant. This analysis provided weak evidence that the rNHF group with a nasopharyngeal specimen PCR positive for a CoV did worse than those in the 'sham' regimen. As such, these findings would not support the use of rhinothermy in reducing symptom severity in SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, as yet there is no available ts data for SARS-CoV-2, but if similar to the temperatures of least 56\u00b0C required to reduce infectivity in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 31 32 it would not be safe to deliver as rhinothermy. Conversely, there is scope to investigate rNHF in the treatment of influenza. A positive point-of-care test for influenza was an exclusion criterion for this study and therefore the results cannot be assumed to be generalisable to patients with influenza. Influenza often produces symptoms similar to other viral URTIs but is one of the most important public health problems around the world, accounting for up to five million severe illnesses and 500 000 deaths each year. 34 Viral replication and the subsequent host inflammatory response play key roles in the pathogenesis of influenza infection 35 and many in vitro studies have demonstrated a reduction in virus replication with exposure to temperatures of 39\u00b0C-41\u00b0C for a number of strains of influenza A and C virus. [36] [37] [38] Furthermore, disease severity and mortality associated with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, have been linked to high pharyngeal viral loads. 35 ",
