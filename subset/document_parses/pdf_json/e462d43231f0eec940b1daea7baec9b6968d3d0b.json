The results suggest that local implementation and enforcement of lockdown restrictions as safety measures for public health and voluntary behavioral responses as reactions to the perceived local COVID-19 spread both played a role. Plain English Summary Business sales dropped by 17% on average due to the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020 in California. Accommodations lost 91% of sales, whereas online sales grew by 180%. Sales fell more steeply in counties with more COVID-19 cases. We examine how much businesses lost in sales using administrative sales tax data. The average losses of 17% in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the second quarter of 2019 occurred even though year-over-year sales typically grow by 3-4%. We find that sales losses were largest in businesses affected by mandatory lockdowns such as accommodations, drinking places, and arts, entertainment, and recreation. Distinguishing between essential and nonessential businesses, which were subject to early lockdowns, and by the level of person-to-person contact, we find that local implementation and enforcement of lockdown restrictions for public health safety and voluntary responses to the perceived local COVID-19 spread both played a role. The results suggest that small businesses may need more support from governments and consumers to mitigate the strong shift to online vendors, and that the pandemic must be brought under control as a prerequisite to a full recovery.",

            "text": "The relative revenue losses among small businesses during the onset of the COVID-19 crisis might be larger than among big businesses. Small businesses likely had a lower ability to quickly adjust to changes in regulations and demand when the pandemic hit. Due to high fixed costs and required knowledge, small businesses may face larger barriers to increasing their web presence, expanding takeout services or adding delivery services, and coping with uncertainty regarding liability during the health crisis. In particular, small businesses may have had less ability to obtain financing needed for adjustments, for example, for investing in online ordering and inventory management, due to lower liquidity reserves, less collateral, and higher uncertainty from the perspective of lenders and investors during the emerging economic crisis. 3 Our findings contribute to the scant evidence on the effects of COVID-19 on the sales and revenues of small businesses. Data from the transactions of financial accounts at JP Morgan Chase (JPMC) indicate that small business revenues dropped 30-50% at the end of March and early April and 40% into May (Farrell et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020) . In surveys conducted by the Kauffman Foundation, Desai and Looze (2020) find that 60% of business owners reported lower sales in April and 50% of owners reported lower sales in May. The Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker reports small 1 Additional evidence of business shutdowns early in the pandemic is provided, for example, from the weekly U.S. Census Small Business Pulse Survey which indicates that roughly 50 percent of businesses report having a large negative effect from the COVID-19 pandemic (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020; Bohn et al., 2020) . Bartik et al. (2020) conducted a survey in late March of nearly 6000 small businesses that were members of the Alignable Business Network. They find that 43% of businesses are temporarily closed, large reductions in employees, and that the majority of businesses have less than one month of cash on hand. 2 Just prior to the pandemic when small business owners were asked what actions they would take if faced with a two-month revenue loss roughly half said they would use their own funds and 17% said they would close or sell the business (Mills et al., 2020). business revenue data from Womply and finds a drop of 50% in April from January and losses of roughly 20% at the end of May from January levels. 4 Bloom et al. (2021) partnered with a large payments technology company to collect survey data from 2500 small businesses and find an average loss of 29% in sales in 2020 Q2. We build on these findings by analyzing data from the State of California that covers all sectors reporting taxable sales across the 58 counties in the state. 5 By using administrative data on the universe of firms in California, our paper complements studies on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses and on their responses using surveys 6 or qualitative research designs (e.g., Kuckertz et al., 2020) .",

Typically year over year growth for the same quarter is between 3% and 4% (see Fig. 1 ).

We obtain confirmed COVID-19 cases by county and day from USAFacts (2020) and use cumulative cases by May 15, 2020 (the midpoint in the second quarter) per capita. 9 Testing for COVID-19 was often not readily available in the second quarter of 2020, and availability and uptake of testing may have varied across counties. However, decisions of consumers and producers as well as decisions of policymakers about the implementation and enforcement of lockdowns were based on the same testing data, which were widely reported in the media, including the local media. Therefore, our analysis is informative about the effects of the perceived local spread of COVID-19. 9 County population numbers are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Fig. 3 provides a scatter plot relating the growth rate in taxable sales across all business types between the second quarter in 2019 and the second quarter in 2020 to the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per capita by May 15, 2020, in each of the 58 counties in California. The data indicate a clear negative relationship. A bivariate regression line is also shown; the slope coefficient is \u221240.06 with a standard error of 22.48, indicating that an additional known COVID-19 case per 1000 inhabitants in a county was associated with an additional decline in taxable sales by 4 percentage points. 10 From a policy perspective, it is important to understand how much mandatory lockdown restrictions implemented for public health safety were binding. Would consumers have avoided spending or producers shut their businesses due to fear of contagion even without government regulation? A comparison across different business types sheds some light on these questions. Table 3 classifies exemplary business types by whether they were deemed nonessential and therefore subject to strong lockdown restrictions and by the possibility to maintain social distance from other people (workers or customers). For example, garden equipment and clothing shops may have comparable opportunities for maintaining social distance, but the former business type was exempt from stricter lockdown restrictions because it was considered essential. Therefore, if we find a stronger correlation between known COVID-19 cases and sales losses for clothing than gardening shops at the county level, this may be attributable to the imposition and enforcement of lockdown restrictions, which can be expected to be stricter in counties with more COVID-19 cases per capita. In contrast, both clothing shops and restaurants 10 Weighting the regression by the population size of the counties does not change the picture (see Figure B1 in Appendix B), the slope coefficient (std. err.) becomes \u221236.77 (0.0148). (food services and drinking places) were classified as nonessential and therefore subject to similar lockdown restrictions in California in the second quarter of 2020, but social distancing may be easier in clothing shops; therefore, if we find different strengths of correlation between COVID-19 Fig. 3 Taxable sales losses by county for all outlets.

The finding that this negative relationship is not only observed for business types that are subject to strict lockdown restrictions, but also for so-called essential business types such as garden equipment stores and grocery stores, indicates that at least some of the drop in sales is driven by a voluntary change of behavior by consumers and producers out of caution when the local spread of COVID-19 seemed high, and potentially also by larger drops in income in these regions. However, the negative slopes of the relationships are steeper for nonessential businesses that were subject to strict lockdown restrictions, indicating that the imposition and enforcement of lockdown restrictions as safety measures also played an important role.",

Normal year-over-year growth in taxable sales is 3-4%, but losses in sales were 17% in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the second quarter of 2019. Sales losses were largest in businesses affected by mandatory lockdowns such as accommodations at 91%.

            "text": "The large losses in sales in the second quarter of 2020 for so many different types of business but especially those shut down through mandatory restrictions are worrisome for the longer-term survival of small, local businesses throughout the country. Although larger stores and chains with a strong online presence may survive, many small businesses will not have the resources to weather prolonged closures, continued reduced demand from health concerns, and a more comprehensive recession. Just prior to the pandemic when small business owners were asked what actions they would take if faced with a 2-month revenue loss, 17% said they would close or sell the business (Mills et al., 2020) . Estimates from the weekly U.S. Census Small Business Pulse Survey indicate that only 15-20% of businesses have enough cash on hand to cover 3 months of operations (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020; Bohn et al., 2020) . The federal government is considering a future round of funds for the PPP program, and private foundations and companies have promised to help. Can these programs help small businesses survive the shutdowns and other setbacks through the pandemic, or will more assistance be needed in the recovery? Furthermore, will an added shift in consumer behavior away from large online retailers towards small businesses to fight longer-term trends be needed? States have promote d s h o p p i n g l o c a l ( e . g . , C a l i f o r n i a ' s #ShopSafeShopLocal) but can this counteract these trends? In the end, getting the virus in check and the roll out of vaccines to lift restrictions and restore customer, owner and employee confidence in health safety is likely the first real step to a full recovery for small businesses.",
