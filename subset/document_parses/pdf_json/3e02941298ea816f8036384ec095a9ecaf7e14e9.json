            "text": "Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent active in vitr'o against a number of RNA and DNA viruses, has been associated with moderate toxicity in laboratory animals and humans. Clinically, ribavirin has been used effectively in persons primarily to treat life-threatening viral diseases such as acute haernorrhagic fever o r viral pneumonia of infants. I n order to evaluate the feasibility of using this antiviral agent in cats, the effects of oral ( p a ) , intramuscular (i.ni.) and intravenous (i.v.) doses of ribavirin in 27 9-month-old specific-pathogen-free cats were evaluated by haematology , clinical chemistries, bone marrow biopsies and histopathology. Ribavirin was administered once daily for 10 consecutive days at a dose of either 11, 22, or 44 mg/kg after which all cats were euthanatized and necropsied. Most cats receiving 22 or 44 mg of ribavirinlkg became anorectic and suffered some degree of weight loss (0.2 to 0.6 kg), and about one-third of the cats developed diarrhoea and/or niucous membrane pallor. Icterus or haemorrhage was not observed. T h e most profound and consistent haematologic change, particularly among the moderate and high dosage groups regardless of route of administration, was a significant and severe thrombocytopenia (range, 33-78%, reduction in mean platelet counts vs. baseline). Other changes, particularly reductions in total WBC and neutrophils and reductions in RBC and PCV, tended to occur at lower ribavirin dosages, but generally they were not statistically significant. Cats given 44 mg of ribaviridkg i.v. showed significant decreases in leukocyte variables, including total WBC ( P = 0.016), neutrophils ( P = 0.026) and lymphocytes (P = 0.047). Mild-to-moderate increases in serum alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities occurred at doses of 22 and 44 mg/kg. Evaluation of bone marrow biopsies before and after treatment revealed that cats given 11 mg of ribavirin/kg had mild megakaryocytic (MK) hypoplasia, whereas cats receiving 22 or 44 mg/kg had progressively severe degrees of MK hypoplasia and dysplasia, asynchronous MK maturation, arid increased mye1oid:erythroid ratio. Pathologic changes in ribavirin-treated cats generally were mild and included primarily enteritis (seven cats) and hepatocellular vacuolation and/or centrilobular necrosis (seven cats). Results of this study in cats indicated that daily administration of ribavirin at a dose range of 11 to 44 mg/kg induced a dose-related toxic effect on bone marrow, primarily on megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors, and at the higher dosages it suppressed numbers of circulating leukocytes.",

In vitro studies have demonstrated that ribavirin has significant antiviral activities against canine parainfluenza virus, feline calicivirus (FCV) (Povey, l978a) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (Weiss and Oostrom-Ram, 1989) . Ribavirin had significant cytotoxicity (ID5,, = 17 kg/ml) in rapidly proliferating normal feline cells, and the resultant low therapeutic index (6.8) suggested potential toxicity when used at antiviral dosages in cats (Weiss & Oostrom-Ram, 1989) . Experimentally, ribavirin administered orally to cats at a divided total daily dose of 75 mg/kg starting 1 or 4 days after exposure to FCV failed to have any beneficial effect on the clinical course of disease or reduce virus excretion (Povey, l978b) . The ribavirin treatment was associated with severe toxic effects including thrombocytopaenia, decreased red and white blood cell counts, increased alanine arninotransferase activity, haemorrhage, and loss of body weight. In laboratory animal species, various other toxic effects of ribavirin occurred in both acute and chronic toxicity studies, including teratogenicity and embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats, gastrointestinal necrosis and bleeding in beagles, skin scaling and ulceration of the tail base in rats, alopecia in rabbits, and decreased food consumption, body weight and testicular and seminal vesicle weights in rats (Canonico, 1983; Hillyard, 1980; Gillett et al., 1990) .",

Because previous studies on the clinical use of ribavirin in cats had demonstrated toxicity and lack of efficacy at dosages of ribavirin used successfully in other animal species (Povey, 1978b) , w e were interested in evaluating the toxicity of ribavirin at a range of' dosages lower than that used previously in cats. Potentially, this data will be useful in helping define dosages o f ribavirin tolerated clinically in cats infected with various viruses, including feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). These viruses, particularly FIV, may serve as valuable animal models for the study of human AIDS and for evaluation of antiretroviral agents (Pedersen, 1989) . Additionally, we wished to understand the pathogenesis of ribavirin toxicity in cats so that strategies may be designed to combat its adverse effects.",

T h e data indicated that the anaemia seen with lower dosages was likely caused by accelerated red cell destruction, probably within the mononuclear phagocyte system. An additional cause of anaemia observed at higher dosage and confirmed by bone marrow biopsy was inhibition of erythropoiesis (Huggins, 1989) . In humans, relatively low dosages of ribavirin (1 g per day) caused unconjugated bilirubin levels to double and the reticulocyte count to increase (Smith & Charette, 1980) , while much higher dosages (3.9-12.6 g per day) caused decreases in haemoglobin levels (Fernandez, 1980) .

T h e sensitivity of various species to the haematologic effects of the drug is related to the amount of ribavirin sequestered. For example, mice and rats, which accumulate markedly less ribavirin in red cells than d o humans or monkeys, are much more resistant to the drug's haematologic toxicity (Huggins, 1989) ; mice have been given 45-340 mg of ribavirinikg daily without noticeable toxicity (Durr et a/., 1975) .

            "text": "In the present study of cats, the most important toxic effects of ribavirin were progressive anorexia and weight loss, mild pallor of mucous membranes, severe thrombocytopenia, and variable decreases in WBC and neutrophil numbers. Some cats, particularly those receiving 11 or 22 mg of ribavirin/kg/ day, also had decreases in red cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit. Other cats, notably those given the higher dosages of ribavirin, had significant increases in liver-specific enzymes. Other changes in clinical chemistry profiles post-treatment were variable and generally were not exceptional. There was a tendency, however, for blood calcium levels and plasma proteins to decline (particularly in the p.0. groups), and there were mild fluctuations in electrolytes, notably sodium and glucose. Seemingly, decreases in plasma proteins and electrolytes may have been related to persistent anorexia or possibly to binding of these molecules to the drug in the gastrointestinal tract or blood. T h e increase in glucose observed in all groups of cats given the highest dosage of ribavirin was unexpected; possibly, this increase was induced by severe physiological stress and endogenous adrenocorticosteroid release, resulting in increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The reason for the variable fluctuations in the anion gap and the overall influence, if any, of ionic charge contributed by the ribavirin on acid-base balance were not clear. Although the influence of giving multiple doses of ketamine in the i.v. group on clinical chemistries was not specifically evaluated, there were no significant differences between groups in clinical chemistry profiles other than an increase in serum calcium in cats given ribavirin i.v. at 44 mg/kg vs. those given ribavirin p a . or i.m. that would suggest a significant effect.",

Dilatation of the cerebral lateral ventricles was observed in three cats given the medium dose (22 mgikg) of ribavirin p.0. or i.m. It was not apparent whether this was an incidental finding o r was associated instead with ribavirin toxicity; there were no other neuropathologic changes or abnormalities in blood glucose or other e1ectrolyt.e or blood protein concentrations that might help explain this lesion. Curiously, the brain lesion was not observed in cats given higher dosages of the drug. Bone rnarrow biopsies frequently revealed marked decreases in niegakaryocytes, disturbances in niegakaryocyte niaturation and morphology, and erythroid hypoplasia. In contrast to our findings in cats, monkeys given ribavirin in a previous study had a (lose-related increase in platelets, niegakaryocytic hyperplasia, and no significant effects on WBC counts (Canonico el ul., l984a,b; Cosgriff et ul., 1984) . Many of the ribavirintreated cats in our study that had lesions of the bone niarrow, including megakaryocytic and/or erythroid hypoplasia, did not demonstrate significant reductions in red cells or show clinical evidence of haemorrhage or anaemia. The exact reason for this was unclear; however, the absence of anaemia may have been related to the half-life of circulating erythrocytes in cats (76 k 0.9 days; Weiser, 1989) and the length of the study, whereas the absence of haemorrhagic diathesis in the face of severe thrornbocytopenia may have been related t o compensatory platelet mechanisms, e.g. increases in mean platelet size, a morphologic alteration observed in many of the ribavirin-treated cats in this study. Siniilar compensatory mechanisms in thrombocytope-nic cats with viral-induced disseminated intravascular coagulopathy have been described previously (Weiss et al., 1980) .",

Some of the cats in the former study had severe internal haeniorrtiages and depression of red blood (:ells, PCV and haenioglobin, while others had mean increases in ALI' concentrations. Although some of the lesions may have been induced by virus, because cats treated with ribavirin were also infected concurrently, the author in fact concluded that the toxicity of ribavirin had exacerbated FCV clinical disease. Because the dosage o f ribavirin (75 mg/kg) used to treat the FCV-exposed cats of the previous study was between 2-7 times higher than dosages used in this study and because the haematologic effects described in the previous study were largely reversed within 1 week of cessation of therapy, we believed that the druginduced haematotogic toxicity in the cats of this study probably would have subsided had the treatments been discontinued.",

Additional toxicologic studies of ribavirin using even lower dosages than we reported (i.e. < 11 mg of ribaviridkg) should be performed before evaluating this antiviral drug clinically in cats. nounced thrombocytopenia and potentially anaemia. Conceivably, suppression of bone marrow platelet and erythroid precursors may predispose ribavirin-treated cats to anaemia and/or bleeding tendencies. The clinical benefits, if any, of using ribavirin as antiviral therapy for cats suffering from viral diseases (e.g. FeLV infection, feline infectious peritonitis), which may themselves induce bone marrow hypoplasia, thrombocytopenia, or haemorrhagic diathesis, may be outweighed by the drug's toxicity. Indeed, ribavirin toxicity can exacerbate lesions and disease induced by viruses, as reported in mice infected with cytomegalovirus (Dowling et al., 1976) or cats infected with FCV (Povey, 1978b) or feline infectious peritonitis virus (Weiss et al., in press) .",

Ribavirin apparently can suppress cellular DNA synthesis and also inhibit translation of proteins via inhibition of 5' cap formation of mRNA (Reines and Gross, 1988) , and it is cytotoxic to resting cell lines at concentrations zn uitro of 200-1000 pgiml (Nicholson, 1984) . The predominant toxicity in cats that we observed was suppression of precursor cells in bone marrow, particularly megakaryocytes and myeloid and erythroid cells. It seems likely that this effect is dose-related and thus may be controlled somewhat by lowering the dose of ribavirin administered. However, lowering the dose of drug unfortunately may compromise its antiviral efficacy. Another approach to reduce drug toxicity without jeopardizing antiviral efficacy is t o incorporate smaller doses of drug within liposomes that target the drug more specifically to sites of virus replication, thereby substantially lowering the therapeutic dose (Alving, 1983) . Alternatively, concurrent administration of particular recombinant growth factors, e.g. granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (1L)-3, or erythropoietin may be considered along with the ribavirin therapy to enhance bone marrow function and protect cats against the specific toxic effects ofthe ribavirin. For example, IL-3 has been used to decrease chemotherapyinduced myelosuppression, and sequential administration of IL-3 and GM-CSF has been",
