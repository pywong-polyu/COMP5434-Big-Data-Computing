The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model for forecasting the development of the cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries and administrative regions worldwide until the end of May 2020. Methods: The cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases was forecasted in 251 regions with a horizon of two weeks, one month, and two months using a hierarchical logistic model at the end of March 2020. Forecasts were compared to actual observations by using a series of evaluation metrics. Results: On average, predictive accuracy was very high in nearly all regions at the two weeks forecast, high in most regions at the one month forecast, and notable in the majority of the regions at the two months forecast. Higher accuracy was associated with the availability of more data for estimation and with a more pronounced cumulative case growth from the first case to the date of estimation. In some strongly affected regions, cumulative case counts were considerably underestimated. Conclusions: With keeping its limitations in mind, the investigated model may be used for the preparation and distribution of resources during the initial phase of epidemics. Future research should primarily address the model's assumptions and its scope of applicability. In addition, establishing a relationship with known mechanisms and traditional epidemiological models of disease transmission would be desirable.",

With respect to interpretation, this means that the model was based on the hypothesis, that the pandemic runs a similar course in all countries and regions, even though they are expected to differ to a certain degree regarding the number of cases in their first report, the expected final case count, the time point and speed of the accelerating and decelerating phases of the outbreak, as well as the time point, extent, and effects of control measures.",

In spite of the facts that at the time of estimation (29 March 2020) only about one month's data were available on average in each region, and that most regions were at the very beginning of the epidemic, a massive difference between forecast and observation was rather the exception than the rule. Summary metrics of predictive accuracy suggested very strong prognostic validity the model for a horizon of two weeks, substantial accuracy after one month, and still notable, although markedly lower, accuracy after two months. This is in good agreement with studies finding that the horizon for reasonable epidemiological predictions covers a few weeks at most [7, 15] .",

They were most likely to be found in regions with a lower amount of available data at the date of estimation and/or with a more limited growth between the date of the first case and the date of estimation. In general, underestimation seems to be somewhat more pronounced than overestimation, particularly in strongly affected regions (i.e., with cumulative case counts RMSE root mean squared error in logarithmic case counts, MAPE mean absolute percentage error in case counts, R 2 coefficient of determination, ICC intraclass correlation, CI confidence interval above 10,000 at the point of validation). The strongly affected regions for which the model provided too low predictions included several countries in which mitigation strategies might have been less effective than in other regions, as suggested by the only slowly or not at all decelerating cumulative case growth curves at the beginning of June 2020 (e.g., India, Bangladesh, Qatar). On the other hand, the strongly affected regions with a substantial overestimation of cumulative case counts are characterized by an extremely successful mitigation of the initial phase of the epidemic (mainly Austria and Switzerland). Hence, predictive errors are likely to be closely related to one of the central assumptions of the model, i.e., that timing, extent, and effectiveness of control measures are comparable across regions. Obviously, the forecasts based on the presented model are likely to reach their limits in regions that deviate too strongly from the average case. As shifting individual estimates towards the group mean is also a statistical property of hierarchical models [33] , extreme cases are likely to fall outside the scope of validity of the presented approach. As the variation in the course of epidemic trajectories among regions is likely to increase with time, the similarity assumption is expected to become more and more problematic with an ongoing epidemic. In consequence, generalizing the presented findings beyond the initial phase of epidemics is not warranted. A notable feature of the model that it provides predictions without any reference to measures taken to control the epidemic. This \"ignorance\" towards interventions, paired with fairly accurate predictions, may be misinterpreted as evidence of dispensability of the mitigation and containment measures implemented in most countries. However, it is far more likely that the key model assumption suggesting similarity of the course of the epidemic and of the control measures taken across regions in the early phase of the epidemic holds to a substantial extent. In cases when it does not, model performance is very poor, as discussed above. Bringing these issue together, the hierarchical structure of the model appears to have both benefits and risks: Fig. 3 Association of the amount of available data at estimation and predictive accuracy (AEIL) at different forecast horizons. AEIL = absolute difference between logarithmic predicted and observed case counts. Points refer to regions. The grey line corresponds to a linear smoothing curve sufficiently accurate predictions for a large number of regions even at a very early stage of the epidemic come with the price of considerably erroneous predictions for atypical regions. Consequently, if used with the aim of generating locally applicable predictions for a particular region, forecasts may be improved by using data from comparable regions with a higher probability than from rather dissimilar regions [34] .",

As it has been shown in a specific analysis of the development of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in German federal states, standardization has rendered using log-transformation of case counts for homogenization superfluous [35] . Second, in the present study uncertainty of the predictions remained unconsidered, although measures of uncertainty, such as reliability and sharpness, can be just as important for forecasting as bias [7] . Third, predictions only at selected time points were analyzed, and it cannot be excluded that choosing other time points would have led to different results. Nevertheless, the general pattern of findings is unlikely to have changed substantially. The forecasting model itself has some weaknesses as well [24, 35] . Most importantly, it models the reported rather than the true number of cases and therefore can be subject to different forms of testing and reporting bias. Considerable improvement regarding this point can realistically be expected first when regional findings form well-conducted epidemiological studies become available. Second, using cumulative rather than new case counts for modeling can lead to serious errors [36] . Another major limitation of the model is that it works only as long as the conditions of the epidemic remain largely unchanged in each region, i.e., within a single epidemic wave with fairly constant testing and reporting practices and without serious disruptions. This issue could perhaps be addressed by using dynamic (time-dependent) rather than fixed (time-invariant) model parameters [37] .",

However, without rigorous scientific evaluation, they run the risk of becoming one, characterized not by correct predictions but by obscurity. Some state that epidemiological forecasting is \"more challenging than weather forecasting\" [42] , and complexity of modeling and reliance on assumptions make it difficult to assess the trustworthiness of models based solely on their inherent structure. Just like we trust weather forecasts that prove to be accurate by experience, empirical comparison of modeling predictions with actual observations should become an essential step of epidemiological model evaluation. Author's contributions LK designed and performed the study, analyzed the data, interpreted the results, and wrote the manuscript. The author(s) read and approved the final manuscript.",
