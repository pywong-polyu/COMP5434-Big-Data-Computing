            "text": "Sudden death is a major public health concern in the US. The annual incidence in working age adults in the United States is estimated to be 35 per 100,000, or 15% of all deaths in individuals aged 18\u00c064. 1\u00c03 Despite improvements in medical care and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the incidence of sudden death has not decreased in proportion to the observed decline in cardiovascular mortality. 4 Resuscitation outcomes for out-of-hospital sudden death are poor, but identifying precipitating factors and intervening may lower the incidence of sudden death. 5 Previous studies demonstrated that sudden death may be preceded by premonitory symptoms in the days, weeks, or months before the event. 6\u00c08 Less is known about the frequency of medical encounters and symptoms at last medical visits prior to sudden death. Such information may identify high-risk individuals and guide intervention programs to prevent sudden death. Due to increasing health care demand and healthcare service gaps, home-based care teams such as community paramedicine have been utilized to address urgent but low acuity illnesses and injuries and provide chronic care and preventive services. The current COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated challenges in accessing medical care, prompting healthcare systems to turn to novel health care delivery systems. Provision of care through home-based care teams is a nascent model of care that may address gaps in access to care and ameliorate the increased burden on Emergency Medical Services (EMS) during the current pandemic. For these reasons, we assessed the symptoms in last medical encounters, chronic illnesses, and evidence-based medicine prescriptions in victims of sudden death.",

Detailed screening and adjudication methods have been previously described. 9 Sudden death in our study included all types of sudden death not attributed to trauma, suicide, or natural expected death. Accordingly, person with terminal disease, evidence of overdose or other obvious non-natural cause (e.g., trauma, violent death, drowning) were excluded. Additionally, persons not communitydwelling (e.g., primary residence was in a skilled nursing facility or correctional facility) were excluded. Records from EMS reports, outpatient and inpatient medical records, death certificates, and medical examiner and toxicology reports were collected. Adjudication identified cases as sudden death if the circumstances surrounding the event suggested an abrupt pulseless condition in the absence of terminal disease such as cancers, or non-natural death (overdose, suicide, trauma). Demographic and clinical characteristics were abstracted from medical records. Medication prescriptions were assessed from the most current medication list in the medical record. All symptoms from the \"chief complaint\" and \"history of present illness\" sections of medical visits in the month prior to sudden death were abstracted. \"Chest pain\", \"dyspnea\", \"dizziness\", \"palpitation\", \"syncope\" and \"pre-syncope\" and \"edema\" and their synonyms were considered cardiac symptoms.",

Among the 264 subjects with medical records, mean age was 53.3 years, 171 (64.8%) were male, and 92 (34.8%) were African American. Of these 264 subjects, 73 (27.7%) had at least one medical encounter and 26 (35.6%) of those 73 had more than one encounter in the month before death. Most encounters (79%) were outpatient visits. Chronic medical conditions were commonly present. Victims with recent encounters were older, more often prescribed evidence-based cardiovascular medications, and more likely to have many comorbidities including tobacco use disorder, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure ( Table 1) . Of the 73 victims, 30 (41.1%) reported cardiac symptoms, accounting for 59% of all reported symptoms with dyspnea (17.8 %), edema (17.8 %), and chest pain (13.7%) predominating (Table 2) . Less commonly reported were syncope or presyncope (5.5%), dizziness (2.7%), or palpitations (1.4%). More than one cardiac symptom was reported in 9 (12%) victims. Demographic characteristics and comorbidities did not differ between victims with and without cardiac symptoms (Table 3) . Despite a high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary disease, only 25 victims (34.2%) were on aspirin, 36 (49.3%) on beta blockers, 29 (39.7%) on statins, and 26 (35.6%) on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).",

These victims were older and more likely to have comorbidities compared to victims without an encounter in the month preceding death. About half of these victims, representing 11.4% of all sudden death victims with medical records, reported probable cardiac symptoms such as dyspnea, edema, and chest pain. Our results are consistent with previous studies that showed that many victims see a physician in the month before their death and many cardiac arrests are preceded by warning symptoms. 5\u00c08 An important limitation of our study is that 135 (33.8%) of the victims lacked medical records, precluding them from analysis, which may have introduced bias. Victims without medical records may be systematically different to victims with medical records. For example, compared to victims with medical records, victims with medical records were more likely to be male (76.3% versus 64.8%). Even among victims with medical records, those with a medical encounter in the month prior to death were more likely to be African-American (42.5% versus 31.9%). These sociodemographic differences may reflect unmeasured differences in comorbid conditions, access to medical care, or other social determinants. Furthermore, among patients with medical records, we are unable to ascertain whether evidence-based preventive medications were appropriately prescribed or to assess for patient adherence to evidence-based medications.",
