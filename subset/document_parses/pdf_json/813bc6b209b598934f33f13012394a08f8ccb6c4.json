Indeed, wave-based analog processors work directly in the native domain of an analog signal, processing it while the wave propagates through an engineered artificial structure (metamaterials and metasurfaces) 3-12 , as previously established in the cases of simple linear operations such as image differentiation, signal integration and integro-differential equations solving 13-23 . For more complex processing tasks, for example image recognition or speech processing, both non-linearity and a high degree of interconnection between the elements are desired, requirements that have led to various proposals of neuromorphic processors exploiting optical diffraction, coupled waveguide networks, or disordered structures 24-33 . A particularly vexing challenge, however, is the implementation of non-linear processing elements. While power-efficient neuromorphic schemes require a pronounced, particular form of non-linearities, optical non-linearities, such as in Kerr dielectrics, are typically weak at low intensitites, and cannot be much controlled. This leads to sub-optimal systems that must operate with high input powers 31, 34, 35 . As an alternative, non-linearities that are external to the wave-based processor have also been considered, for example by exploiting the intensity dependency of a sensor, that needs an additional electronic interconnection. Unfortunately, exploiting such weak and non-controllable non-linearities drastically confine the performance of most machine learning schemes, and the relevance of wave-base platforms have so far been largely restricted to the implementation of simple linear matrix projections.",

With the addition of linear random scattering disorder, we implement very efficient recurrent neural networks (RNNs) schemes, namely extreme learning machine (ELM) and reservoir computing (RC). We demonstrate the high accuracy of our Floquet extreme learning machine in challenging computing tasks, from the processing of one-dimensional data (learning non-linear functions), to challenging multi-dimensional data (e.g. the abalone dataset classification problem).

RNNs are ideal to process intricate data due to the internal cyclic connections between internal neurons, whose outputs depend on both the current inputs and the previous states of the neurons 42 . This memory effect allows RNNs to detect recursive relations in the data, which is relevant for example to process temporal signals. In digital implementations, however, the heavy internal connectivity matrices that are involved in the training process make RNNs particularly computationally-expensive and complicated [43] [44] [45] [46] . In order to solve these challenges, a number of alternative computing approaches such as long short-term memory (LSTM) 47 , echo state networks (ESNs) 48 , extreme learning machines (ELMs) 49-51 , and reservoir computing (RC) 44-46, 52 have emerged. These schemes are particularly well suited for wave-based implementations, because waves propagation inherently relies on the inertial memory of the medium, which can be enhanced and engineered by leveraging resonant cavities, or multiple scattering. In addition, wave interferences are a particularly efficient way to create a high degree of interconnections between a large set of inputs.",

The final step of the information processing is to perform a simple linear regression in order to minimize the RMSE that adjusts the W out weights. The output can be computed with O(t) = W out h(t).

To obtain chaotic dynamics, here, we set the parameters \u03b2 = 0.2, \u03b3 = 0.1, \u03c4 = 18, n = 10. During the training phase, as soon as the reservoir states are calculated, a simple linear regression is executed to adjust the W out weights such that their linear combination with the calculated reservoir states makes the actual output as close as possible to the next time step of the input. Finally, to automatically predict the future evolution of i(t), we make a feedback-loop from the output to the input by replacing the next input i(t + 1) with the one-step prediction W out o(t), as is done in conventional RC. The ability of the proposed RC system in time-series prediction is tested using a reservoir with 75 nodes. We consider the middle harmonic as a reservoir state and input, \u03b6 in n , to feed our RC system for each interactions (Eq. (9)). All of intensity harmonics, reservoir The network is then used to forecast the time series autonomously. After training for 400 time steps, the output from the readout function, that is, the predicted data for the next time step, is then connected to the reservoir as the new input, and the system autonomously produces the forecasted time series continuously. Fig. 7 show the results for autonomous time-series prediction using the proposed RC system. Afterwards, the autonomously generated output (from the 400th time step onwards) still matches very well the ground truth, showing the ability of the proposed RC system to autonomously forecast the chaotic system. After more than 70 time steps of autonomous prediction, the predicted signal starts to diverge from the correct value, which is unavoidable due to the chaotic nature of the series. Increasing the size of the reservoir further, by using more nodes and using more previous states may reduce the prediction error so that the length of accurate prediction can be increased. Another solution for long-term forecasting without increasing the dimension of the system is utilizing a periodical update procedure as in Ref. 42 .",

The results are based on Eq. (7). The fixed parameters for (a)-(d) are: (a): T(\u03c9 1 + \u03c9 m ) = 0.1 -0.25i and \u211c{T(\u03c9 2\u03c9 m )} = 0.1.

(e) and (f) The numerical demonstration of linear/nonlinear Floquet entanglement for the central harmonic wave for different readout nodes in terms of input intensity, for static (e) and dynamic phase delays (f). This makes such time-Floquet non-linear entanglement highly advantageous in neuromorphic computing schemes. To exemplify the strong nonlinear response of the proposed system, we plot the amplitude of the transmitted central harmonic ( \u03c9 = (\u03c9 1 + \u03c9 2 )/2) as a function of various variables, including the phase delay phi. The results are displayed in Figs. 2(a)-(d). We fix one of the harmonics and plot T \u03c6 versus the modulation phase and the real or imaginary part of the other transmitted harmonics,T(\u03c9 1 + \u03c9 m ) (or T(\u03c9 2\u03c9 m )). As we can see in Figs. 2(a)-(d), we indeed obtain a complex non-linear semi-sinusoidal form for T \u03c6 , upon altering the modulation phase. The dependency on the real or imaginary parts of the other transmitted harmonic is also always non-linear.

(d), (e), and (f) The corresponding values of root-mean-square error (RMSE) upon increasing the numbers of involved Floquet harmonics at the readout nodes.Next, we implement the entanglement with the input vector to demonstrate the complex nonlinear behavior of the Floquet system, using a full-wave finite-difference time-domain simulation of the set-up ofFig. 1(b)(see Methods). We compute the intensity of the central harmonic with respect to the input intensity for two different scenarios: a static phase delay and a dynamic phase delay. In the first scenario, the phase delay is fixed and not dependent on the input (\u03c6 = 0), and as shown inFig. 2(e), the harmonic intensities are linear in term of input intensities. In the second scenario, the delay phase is a simple linear function of the input (i.e., \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03b6 in )).Fig. 2(f)shows the complex nonlinear form of proposed system.",

By recording the intensity of the harmonics in the readout nodes of many input values, a linear regression method is performed on the output data (see Figs. 3(a)-(c)). A remarkable learning performance, with very low root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for all three nonlinear functions, is obtained. Interestingly, in the proposed wave-based neural network with a nonlinear time-Floquet layer, the multiple generated harmonic fields can be used to extend the dimension of the nonlinear mapping, and increasing their number improves the accuracy of classification/regression. This tendency is demonstrated in Figs. 3(d)-(f)), which plots the RMSE versus the number of considered Floquet harmonics. This mechanism is a clear advantage of the Floquet ELM: by involving a higher number of scattered harmonics, we can improve the RMSE and enhance the accuracy of learning with no additional computational cost. Note that, in the last layer, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed on the time-series output data obtained from the readout nodes, in order to compute the intensity of the different harmonic waves (see further details in Methods). However, performing FFT requires only a simple multiplication and does not impose a large computational overhead.",

For simplicity, we used a flattened version of downsampled images as an output vector.The transfer matrix equation relating the amplitudes of the fields on opposite sides of the time-Floquet system (SeeFig. 9) can be expressed in multiplicative form in time-domain for each \u03c9 k , t) is the time-varying transfer matrix. The transfer matrix equation can be taken into angular frequency domain by taking the Fourier transform of both sides as:",
