Exactly as described as a natural disaster, a pandemic is not classically described as a disaster but mimics one in how its disorganized society and promoted distress. It caused an increase in stress and long-term consequences (Cherry et al., 2017) . The societal structure showed all the responses to a disaster, it first had a panic, a rush to the supermarkets, a closure of schools, and an end of world perspective. Since the pandemic stands for longer than imagined for most there are also feelings of tiredness, powerlessness, and exhaustion after something bad. Some increased the psychiatric symptoms and fear of being infected was spread everywhere while the pandemic disseminated and generated more affected and deaths to count. However, months later people started to adjust their behavior and expectancies, and a new routine was established. Everything started to open and the sensations of everything had gone until the next infection wave and a new movement to a home and city closure. The economic burden increases enormously, but no one could see another way to handle the whole situation.",

Family and friends devoted increased support and they shared feelings and caring for family members and others. At this point, a Chinese sample has reported no financial stress, no stress at home or work, but even having only a week of lockdown, they considered the pandemic condition as a mildly stressful situation (Zhang & Ma, 2020) . Besides their quick response, there is all the novelty and expectations about the potential of the dissemination and severity of an infectious disease. It suddenly reached the whole world distributing uncertainty to all and disrupting the perceived individual's ability to live a fulfilling life for both the risk of disease or the social distancing procedures and social isolation. The World Health Organization (WHO) outlines one definition of QOL; \"An individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture in which they live and about their goals, expectations, standards and concerns\" (WHOQOL Group, 1995) . Quality of life includes environmental, individual, and economic features. In the pandemic, there is a rupture in the economic status, social networking, and a reduction in perceived social support that might change the qualityof-life perceptions. For patients with SARS COV-2, the psychological and physical burden result in loss of perceived QOL (Chen et al., 2020) . But the perceived QOL of a health professional is still poorly documented.",

It is important to fully understand how the pandemic impacted them even to still accounting and to prepare to stand the necessary care. One of the conditions already described to promote a better response to any disaster is the sense of preparedness. However, it is widely recognized that individual and community preparedness might mitigate hazards since it improves decision-making through protective actions. There is no way to be prepared for a pandemic on such a scale as COVID-19 has been, however, the sense of preparedness came by the interaction of some features in a complex way: having a previous experience, perceiving the risk, and feeling prepared. In Korea, recognition of emergency code recognition by nurses was positively correlated with self-confidence and disaster-related nursing competencies (Jeong & Lee, 2020) . About infectious diseases, health care professionals are at frequent risk to have contact with infectious diseases. Sometimes a life-threatening disease, such as caused by the Ebola virus and it might have compromised some quality-of-life features increasing the social isolation of health professionals (Lehmann et al., 2016) . In the Ebola outbreak, lack of knowledge about the disease and fatigue were good predictors of the loss of quality of health (Lehmann et al., 2016) .",

Health professionals usually have increased access to health services, and this may lead to an increase in physical QOL. Regarding psychological aspects of QOL, clinical psychologists usually have a more consistent selfmonitoring regarding their mental health, as well the widespread practice of themselves maintain a regular assessment or psychotherapy with other psychologists or psychiatrists, possibly increasing the psychological aspects of QOL. In this sense, we can expect different patterns of QOL regarding different health professions.",

Post hoc comparison revealed an overall similar pattern. Most significant differences were seen in the physical domain, while fewer differences were seen in the social relations.

Changes in social relationships and social support networks are usually related to this aspect of QOL (Wedgeworth, et al., 2017) .
