Due to the large amount of data related to the spread of COVID-19 and the high speed of changes, particularly in modeling and forecasting works, it is required to update the predictions and assess the goodness of performance or the accuracy of the models. In this regard, we aim at evaluating the performance of the model introduced by Jamshidi et al. 1 to describe the first wave of infectious diseases. Since about the propagation of COVID-19 in the UK, until early July 2020, we had encountered the first wave of the disease, and it is possible to examine the performance of the model to describe the trend of the disease up to early July. Therefore, in this letter, we want to evaluate the performance of the model in 2 periods: ",

Accordingly, they yielded 282 K and 31 K as point estimations and 242-316 K and 28-50 K as 80% confidence intervals for the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths on May 30, 2020, respectively. By repeating the simulation, we obtained 273 K and 243-300 K ( Figure 1A) and 36 K and 32-43 K ( Figure 1B) as predictions. Since, there were 250 347 cases and 37 529 deaths reported in the UK by the mentioned date, and in reality, both of the intervals include the real data, and the relative error of the 2 point estimations are 12% and 9% and 16% and 5% for cases and deaths, respectively.",
