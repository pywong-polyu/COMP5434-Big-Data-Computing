As something that our Medical School regularly schedules, we have found that they foster a sense of camaraderie and create a healthy environment for the discussion of our needs and feelings. Such sessions are also protective against imposter syndrome (2) . We also suggest that doctors affected by the pandemic during their university studies should receive increased educational and pastoral support. This could include frequent meetings with educational supervisors (in the UK context) and more scheduled practical skills teaching to compensate for lost time.",
