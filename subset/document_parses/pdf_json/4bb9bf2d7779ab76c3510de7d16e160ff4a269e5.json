A literature search was carried out in order to identify suitable inhibitors of these enzymes, which were confirmed by docking calculations. In total, 10 targets and 12 bioactive molecules have been predicted. Among the most promising molecules we identified Triacsin C, which inhibits ACSL3, and which has been shown to be very effective against different viruses, including positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Similarly, we also identified the drug Celgosivir, which has been successfully tested in cells infected with different types of viruses such as Dengue, Zika, Hepatitis C and Influenza. Finally, other drugs targeting enzymes of lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism or protein palmitoylation (such as Propylthiouracil, 2-Bromopalmitate, Lipofermata, Tunicamycin, Benzyl Isothiocyanate, Tipifarnib and Lonafarnib) are also proposed.",

Some of the ways in which viruses reprogram the host metabolism and support viral replication are, among others, activation of glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation, protein glycosylation and inhibition of mitochondrial function 5 . It is reasonable to expect that drugs targeting key human metabolic enzymes can be used to inhibit viral replication. Indeed, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs such as Tenofovir, Sofosbuvir or Ribavirin are already being used as antiviral drugs [6] [7] [8] . Pharmacological inhibition of either acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) or fatty acid synthase (FASN) has also been shown to result in a strong reduction of viral titers in vaccinia infection 9 .",

            "text": "In many cases, the metabolic resources of the host cell are diverted to the formation of virions via the recruitment of metabolic enzymes and their localization in \"replication and transcription complexes\" (RTCs), which are vesicles formed from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, in which the virus replicates. This recruitment takes place via the interaction of host enzymes with viral proteins, such as NSP3 of rotavirus, which recruits FASN, or NS5A of hepatitis C virus, which recruits phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha (PI4KA) 4 . SARS-CoV-2, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in the same manner as other coronaviruses, also replicates within ER derived vesicles 10 . Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that host enzymes key for viral replication are recruited to RTCs via their interaction with viral proteins. A human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome has been recently published 11 , which contains 332 high-quality human-SARS-CoV-2 protein-protein interactions, of which 90 involve metabolic enzymes. The goal of this work is to identify metabolic enzymes that are suitable drug targets against viral replication. In previous articles 12, 13 we developed the python library pyTARG, with the object of finding metabolic drug targets against cancer cell lines. This method makes use of a generic human Genome Scale Metabolic Model (GSMM), which is constrained using RNA-seq data in order to generate a context-specific model. This allows computing metabolic flux distributions and evaluating the outcomes of restricting enzymatic reaction rates. In order to use this methodology for the evaluation of the metabolic fluxes in lung cells infected by SARS-CoV-2, a literature based stoichiometric equation for the formation of virions has been added to a context-specific GSMM based on RNA-seq data of lung tissue 12, 13 . This approach provides an efficient method to identify putative drug targets against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and could be used by pharmaceutical companies in order to save considerable resources and time when developing new drugs.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 genome is similar to SARS-CoV, each has an Orf1ab encoding 16 predicted non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16) and each has the 4 typical coronavirus structural proteins, including: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N). Thus, the structural information from SARS-CoV, obtained by crio-electron microscopy 14 , has been used to estimate the stoichiometric relations between the main structural proteins. Image analysis revealed a relation of 8 M protein dimers per S protein trimer in the virion surface, with an estimated number of 90 spikes per viral particle. N proteins are found both at the surface and within the virion, with M:N ratios between 1 and 3 depending on the authors 15 . The M:S ratio determined by crio-electron microscopy is equal to 5.3 and corresponds to the inverse of the ratio between the two protein lengths, which could be consistent with viral proteins being translated at the same rate per amino acid. This would lead to a M:N ratio of 1.9, which is within the previously mentioned rank and has been chosen for modeling purposes. No other proteins have been included in the structure of the virion. E protein seems to play a key role in virion assembly, but it is not present in significant quantities in viral particles. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has 16 N-glycosylation residues 14 and one palmitoyl residue, while the M protein has one N-glycosylation residue and one palmitoyl residue. The lipid quantity of phospholipids per virion was estimated by considering an average virion diameter of 125 nm and assuming that the surface proteins are packed as circles touching each other forming a hexagonal pattern 15 . This geometry leaves 10% of the surface for a lipid bilayer, whose composition has been assumed to be equal to that of the human endoplasmic reticulum 16 . In a previous work 17,18 the authors evaluated the conductance of the SARS-CoV viroporin 3a purified protein in planar lipid bilayers with a biologically relevant mix with a composition to that of intracellular organelle membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Thus, this assumption appears to be widely accepted.",

This fact does not result in a drain of amino acids from the cells, but it has energetic costs in form of ATP and GTP. In order to have an approximate estimation of these costs, we assume that all the viral proteins are translated at a rate inversely proportional to its length. Equally, genomic RNA and sub-genomic mRNAs require methylation, which consumes SAM units. This has been modeled by assuming that the genomic and sub-genomic mRNAs are all produced in the same proportions. This choice does not have any impact on the conclusions of the article.

The library pyTARG was previously developed to identify metabolic enzymes whose inhibition would inhibit the growth of cancer cells while having weaker www.nature.com/scientificreports/ effects on healthy cells. Here we follow an analogous approach in which virion production in infected cells is selectively targeted. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been modeled by making use of the interactions between viral proteins and human enzymes 10 , which contains 332 high-quality human-SARS-CoV-2 protein-protein interactions, of which 90 involve metabolic enzymes (see Supplementary File S1). Five of these enzymes (NDUFB9, ETFA, ATP6AP1, ATP6V1A and ATP1B1) are involved in oxidative phosphorylation. These interactions are interpreted as inhibitory or as relocating the involved proteins to RTCs instead of mitochondria, which would suppress their function. This has been modeled by constraining oxidative phosphorylation to have a zero flux in the model of infected cells. This assumption is consistent with the literature, as cells infected by viruses have shown increased lactic fermentation, in an analogous way to the Warburg effect in cancer 4 . For the rest of metabolic enzymes expressed in the lung and interacting with viral proteins, the constraints on their rates have been removed (this is equivalent to assume that their rates could increase as a result of these enzymes being highly concentrated within RTCs). Possible changes in gene expression were modeled by identifying the transcription factors that interact with viral proteins. Only TCF12 was identified. This regulator is known to be a transcriptional repressor. Thus, the genes regulated by TCF12 are assumed to be upregulated and the constraints on their reactions were also removed in the model. The model predicts a maximal rate of virion formation of 0.0084 nmol-virions per hour and gram of dry weight of infected cells. The rate estimated by our model is consistent with data from literature 17 , which reported HIV production rates of 50,000 virions per cell and day. Assuming a cell dry weight of 0.43 ng, both results would be equivalent (i.e. this weight is of the correct size order for human cells).",

The mentioned work relied on a method previously published by Aller and co-workers 20 . This approach is based on the comparison of the metabolic flux distributions under the scenarios of cell biomass and viral biomass optimization, respectively. In this approach no extra constraints are modified in the metabolic model between non-infection and infection conditions. In the approach presented here, high quality interaction data between viral and human proteins have been used to modify the constraints of the model, as it has been previously discussed. Also, our choice of putative targets has been restricted to proteins that have been confirmed to interact with viral proteins, so as to restrict the proposed drug targets to enzymes more likely involved in the infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2.",

This function restricts the rate of reactions catalyzed by the tested enzymes to 0.1 times its original value and computes the ratio by which the objective function (i.e. the rate of virion production or cellular biomass, for infected and for healthy cells, respectively) decreases. This ratio takes values from 1 (indicating no effect) and 0.1 (indicating that the objective function decreases in the same proportion as the flux in the targeted reaction). The model of non-infected lung cells was used as a way of quantifying potential secondary effects. In order to select suitable targets, a difference between both ratios (non-infected and infected) of 0.3 was used as cutoff value. The analysis was restricted to human enzymes interacting with viral proteins. Using this method, 10 human enzymes were identified (see Table 2 ). Predicted relative effects of targeting each enzyme in healthy and infected lung cells are shown in Fig. 1A .",

            "text": "Literature data and docking resources to identify putative inhibitors. A literature search using the PubMed database was carried out in order to identify inhibitors of the selected targets, and to evaluate potential secondary effects. When possible, drugs approved or under clinical trials were selected, but we also considered those in a pre-clinical status or under investigation. The literature survey yielded a total of 10 compounds (see Supplementary File S2). The affinity of these compounds for some of the target enzymes (those for which Table 2 . List of putative targets against SARS-CoV-2 replication. a These compounds have been identified in our docking analyses rather than in literature. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ a reliable 3D structure could be obtained) was further validated using docking (see Supplementary Files S3 and S4). Docking was also used for the identification of putative inhibitors for enzymes without known inhibitors, as it is the case of Tipifarnib and Lonafarnib, predicted to bind FAR2 (Fig. 2) . Some of the 10 putative targets are known oncogenes for which drugs are already in clinical trials (agps, slc27a2 and acsl3). The AGPS protein is inhibited, at least, by Benzyl Isothiocyanate (BITC) 21 , the anti-fungal agent Antimycin A 22 and the investigational new drug, ZINC-69435460 22 . Antimycin A can be discarded due to its cytotoxicity, as it is also an inhibitor of cytochrome C reductase, essential for the viability of eukaryotic cells 23 . The two other inhibitors could be promising alternatives to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. On one hand, BITC inhibits the proliferation of human glioma U87MG and hepatic carcinoma HepG2 cells, as well as aggressive human breast tumors, by interfering with the enzymatic function of AGPS 21 . On the other hand, ZINC-69435460 makes multiple specific interactions with residues in the AGPS active site and inhibits its activity 22 . Therefore, these two compounds could be used to reduce the enzymatic function of the AGPS enzyme in the SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells (in a similar manner as in the cancer cells), which would result in a hamper of the viral replication, while allowing the viability of the non-infected cells. The second enzyme, SLC27A2 (also known as FATP2), is a transmembrane transporter coenzyme that participates in the long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation and peroxidase lipid metabolism 24 . In a recent publication it has been shown that the selective pharmacological inhibition of FATP2 with Lipofermata (5-bromo-5'-phenyl-spiro[3H-indole-3,2'(3'H)- [1, 3, 4] thiadiazol]-2(1H)-one) suppresses the activity of pathologically activated neutrophils and substantially reduces melanoma growth and invasion, while maintaining the viability of healthy cells 25 . Therefore, inhibition of this target with Lipofermata could be also a therapeutic option to treat SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. The third enzyme, ACSL3, is one of the five members of the long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) family 26 . Specifically, ACSL3 has been identified as www.nature.com/scientificreports/ a host factor required for Poliovirus replication, which, as SARS-CoV-2, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that replicates its genome in association with membranes 27 . Inhibition of ACSL3 with inhibitors such as Triacsin C 28 has been shown to reduce virion formation in human cells infected with different viruses, including Cytomegalovirus, Rotavirus and Hepatitis C [29] [30] [31] . For these reasons, and according to our metabolic modelling results, this drug constitutes a very promising therapeutic option to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other of our identified targets, ZDHHC5, is involved in the palmitoylation of proteins and has been found to interact with the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 11 . This post-transcriptional process plays an important role in protein-membrane interactions, protein trafficking and enzyme activity by contributing to their membrane association 32 . Palmitoylation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has been suggested to facilitate its fusion with the host cellular membrane 11 , which clearly suggests ZDHHC5 as potential target for therapeutic inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. The literature survey has revealed some molecules that inhibit cellular processes associated with palmitoylation, with one of the best examples being 2-Bromopalmitate 33 . Other specific inhibitors of ZDHHC5 could also constitute promising drugs to combat the coronavirus infections.",

Docking revealed a binding affinity of \u2212 9.5 kcal/mol for FAR2 and NADPH; one of its natural substrates (C), while the predicted binding affinities of Lonafarnib (D) and Tipifarnib (E) are \u2212 10.9 kcal/ mol and \u2212 9.5 kcal/mol, respectively. This suggests that these two drugs (with a preference for Lonafarnib) could displace NADPH from its binding site and block the activity of FAR2. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The rest of the identified targets are involved in N-glycan biosynthesis and glycosylation (see Table 2 ). Glycosylation is vital in the maturation process of viral proteins. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has 16 glycosylation residues 14 . The importance of protein glycosylation is evidenced by the use of Celgosivir (an inhibitor of N-glycan synthesis) in treating cells that harbor Dengue virus, which prevents proper protein glycosylation, leading to protein misfolding and impaired replicative efficiency 38 . Celgosivir (and also other iminosugars such as Deoxynojirimycin or Castanospermine) has been shown to be a very promising drug, not only for the treatment of Dengue virus or members of the same family (like for example ZIKV), but also for other viruses belonging to different families, such as the Hepatitis C or Influenza viruses [39] [40] [41] . As 3 of our 10 selected enzyme targets are involved in the N-Glycan biosynthesis pathway (i.e. ALG5, ALG8, ALG11), we propose treating SARS-CoV-2 with inhibitors of glycoprotein biosynthesis, such as the previous mentioned iminosugars or the nucleoside antibiotic Tunicamycin, which also inhibits N-linked protein glycosylation 42 . Interestingly, this last compound has been shown to display strong antiviral activity against certain viruses, like for example the Epstein-Barr virus 43 , and has been recently proposed as a promising therapeutic option to treat SARS-CoV-2 44 . Similarly, drugs that disrupt the integrity of the Golgi apparatus (such as Monensin, Brefeldin A, Bafilomycin and Nocodazole) also alter glycoprotein synthesis 45 and, for this reason, could be also effective therapeutic molecules to treat COVID-19 patients.

In order to model infection by SARS-CoV-2, oxidative phosphorylation has been constrained to have a zero rate. Attenuation of respiration is known to be a general feature of viral infection 5 . In our case, this is further supported by the fact that 5 genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (NDUFB9, ETFA, ATP6AP1, ATP6V1A and ATP1B1) are part of the human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome 11 . These interactions are interpreted as inhibitory or as relocating the involved proteins to RTCs instead of mitochondria, which would suppress their function. For the rest of metabolic enzymes expressed in lung and interacting with viral proteins, the constraints on their rates have been removed (this is equivalent to assume that their rates could increase as a result of these enzymes being highly concentrated within RTCs). The list of human transcription factors and the genes regulated by them were obtained from the TRANSFAC database 58 . The metabolic model of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and the model of non-infected lung cells are available at https:// github. com/ Sergi oBord el/ COVID-19.

Cofactor biding sites on PDB structures and templates were used as potential docking locations to set up cubic docking calculations. The calculations were performed in boxes of 20 \u00c5 3 . The conformer models of the ligands were acquired from PubChem 66 or ZINC 67 databases and then converted to pdbqt file format with Open Babel 65 . QuickVina-W was used to carry out docking task with all prepared structural data 68 . Docking results were visualized, analyzed and imaged with UCSF Chimera 64 .",
