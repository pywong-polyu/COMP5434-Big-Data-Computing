They take their name from crown-like morphology with extended, petal-shaped surface projections seen on electron microscopy, corresponding to large surface spike glycoprotein (2) . CoVs are part of the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviri-dae, whose two subfamilies include Orthocoronavirinae and Torovirinae. Based on the difference in protein sequences, the CoV subfamily Orthocoronavirinae is further classified into four genera: alpha (alpha-CoV), beta (beta-CoV), gamma (gamma-CoV), and delta CoVs (delta-Co V) (3) . CoVs are host-specific and are known to infect humans as well as several other vertebrates including mammals and birds, causing diverse clinical syndromes, typically respiratory, enteric, neurologic and hepatic disorders (4) . High mutation and recombination rates may allow cross-species transmission of coronaviruses (5) . Classification of different types of CoVs is shown in Figure 1 .",

            "text": "SARS is an infectious disease caused by a strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The disease first started as an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in the Guangdong Province of southern China in November 2002. Up to December 2003 a worldwide total of 8,098 cases of probable SARS and 774 deaths (9.6%) were recorded (6) . In Hong Kong, 1,755 adult and paediatric patients were infected by the coronavirus. A total of 121 children aged <18 years were registered in the e-SARS database of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, accounting for 7% of all patients notified. The exact number of children affected by SARS worldwide is unknown as the age ranges shown were not available or incomplete for some of the affected countries (7) . It is estimated that children <18 years of age only accounted for about 5% of the total affected. The Stock- review identified 6 case series reporting 135  pediatric SARS patients (80 laboratory-confirmed, 27  probable and 28 suspected) from Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. Despite a high mortality rate in the adult population (9.6-16.7%) there were no fatalities in the paediatric age group. The clinical course of SARS in paediatric patients is different compared with adults. Young children, in particular, appeared to had a milder form of the disease than 12 years of age who was similar to that in adults. Most children reported were previously healthy and there was no sex predominance. The majority of young children and teenage patients had a definitive contact history with adult SARS patients, usually an immediate family member. Transmission among children or from children to adult contacts was uncommon but possible, although there is only one published report of transmission of SARS virus from a pediatric patient to adults (8).",

Nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting, febrile convulsions were less common. The clinical course of SARS in the majority of paediatric patients followed a 'biphasic' rather than the 'triphasic' pattern as described in adult cases (9) . Phase 1 was associated with an increase in viral load and the patient presented fever and other systemic features. This phase usually ended a few days after the onset of fever. Phase 2, the immune-pathological phase was marked by persistent or recurrent fever, hypoxaemia and progression of pneumonia with new infiltrations in chest radiographs. The deterioration in clinical condition corresponds to the period when the body viral load decreases and progression of pulmonary disease is caused by exaggerated host immunological reaction. Progression to ARDS, the third phase as in adults, is only seen in a very small number of children, predominantly adolescents. The outcomes in children 6 months after the onset of the disease have been favourable. Mild abnormalities were detected by high resolution computerized tomography and pulmonary function testing in 34 and 11% of patients, respectively. One report has described osteonecrosis in children who received steroids as part of a treatment regimen for SARS, although osteonecrosis has been a recognized risk of corticosteroid treatment of other pediatric illnesses including lymphoblastic leukaemia (10).",

Other haematological abnormalities were thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy with elevated D-dimer levels. Anaemia was rarely found at presentation and was only detected in <5% of children (12) . The study of Ng et al. suggested that pediatric SARS patients have markedly elevated circulating IL-1 levels, which suggests selective activation of the caspase-1-dependent pathway. Other key pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, showed only mildly elevated levels at the initial phase of the illness. The activation of predominant type 1 T-helper lymphocyte (Th1)-mediated immune response facilitates viral clearance and may explain the rapid recovery of the paediatric cases (13).",

The method was applied to nasopharyngeal aspirates, nose and throat swabs, saliva, sputum, endotracheal aspirates, bronco-alveolar lavage, stool, urine, plasma and serum. In Toronto experience about 25 children with a presumptive diagnosis of suspect or probable SARS, the nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested negative using RT-PCR so the authors suggested that the quantity of virus in the upper airway of young children during the early symptomatic phase of SARS is extremely low (15) . In this report the nasopharyngeal sampling was performed only at the time of admission. The virus was also detected in stool sample of 37% of subject between days 5 and 7 of illness. According to these data, the authors suggested that the sensitivity of RT-PCR could be improved by paying careful attention to type of specimen and timing of collection. One-step real-time quantitative RT-PCR was developed for SARS-CoV RNA quantification to detect SARS-CoV RNA in the plasma of patients.",

IgM seropositivity was lost by about 12 weeks, while IgG titres peaked at 4 weeks and remained elevated until at least 12 weeks. IgG usually remained detectable after resolution of the illness but the duration of persisting protective neutralising antibodies and their boosting response remains unknown. Li et al. suggested that the SARS-specific IgG antibodies persisted for a long time, but the SARS-specific IgM remained measurable for a much shorter period, suggesting that IgG antibody to SARS-CoV may represent the primary humoral immune response protecting patients against SARS (16) .",

In the pediatric setting, a combination of antibiotics for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by usual and by atypical pathogens, corticosteroids and short-term intravenous or oral ribavirin was well-tolerated, without serious adverse events such as haemolytic anemia, although there was no clear evidence of the therapeutic efficacy (18).",

            "text": "MERS-CoV was identified in June 2012, when a patient died from a severe form of respiratory infection in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (19) . According to its latest report ( January 2020), a total of 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide were reported, including 866 fatalities, with an associated mortality rate of 34.3%. Overall, 27 countries were involved globally. Most cases were identified across the Arabian Peninsula and particularly in Saudi Arabia (2,121), which also recorded the majority of deaths (788), but other countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and USA were affected as well (20) . To our knowledge, MERS mainly affected the adult population, with a median age at infection of 50 years (21) . However, along with all the previously identified human CoVs, MERS-CoV could also infect the pediatric population. As of November 2015, 35 cases of MERS-CoV were reported in children (age <18 years), accounting for around 2% of all cases (21, 22) . An epidemiologic investigation involving in-hospital patients, health care providers and their family contacts listed 625 children, of whom only 1.2% tested positive for MERS-CoV (23) . Moreover, although children are well known to be a source of viral respiratory infections, they did not seem to play the role of \"reservoir\" in the diffusion of MERS-CoV. In a large sample of children <2 years old hospitalised in Amman, Jordan, from March 2010 to September 2012, none of the collected specimen tested positive for MERS-CoV, suggesting that this novel coronavirus was not actively circulating in young children in the 30-month-period before and after its outbreak in the country (24) . Conversely, most of the 35 reported pediatric cases were household contacts of adult cases (25).",

She tested positive for MERS-CoV through RT-PCR and underwent treatment with nebulisation therapy along with intravenous diuretics, antibiotics and antivirals (oseltamivir): she recovered and was discharged 7 days after admission. A 2-yearold boy with cystic fibrosis was admitted to the hospital with fever and respiratory distress; no history of travel, contact with animals or confirmed MERS-CoV cases was recorded. He was first treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy for multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum culture, but his clinical conditions rapidly deteriorated and he was transferred to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) where he later developed respiratory insufficiency and multiorgan failure, dying 60 days after his first admission.

When R0 is more than 1, the infection can spread between people and there may be an outbreak or epidemic (48, 49) .

An initial report included 8 children, presenting with high fever (>39\u00b0C) for 4 to 5 days, abdominal pain with vomiting and diarrhoea, rash and conjunctivitis (78) . The majority developed some degree of heart involvement, requiring access to PICU and inotropic support with amines. Overall, 7 out of 8 recovered and are now sub-jects to ongoing follow-up for coronary abnormalities; one developed arrhythmia with refractory shock and died from a major cerebrovascular infarct. All cases initially tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, but 4 out of 8 were likely to have COVID-19 after exposure to close family contacts. Moreover, no other infectious agent was found in 7 out of 8; in one Adenovirus and Enterovirus were isolated. At subsequent analysis, 2 children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (including the one who died, whose test was performed post-mortem). The association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease shock syndrome appears to be promising, but greater evidence is currently missing.",

As of today, Dong et al. collected the largest number of cases at pediatric age: based upon clinical features, laboratory testing and chest X-ray imaging, they defined the severity of Covid-19, thus identifying 5 stages of severity (72) . Out 3 . Distribution in group ages, adapted from Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (69) of 2,134 children, more than 90% were completely asymptomatic or presented with mild or moderate disease. Severe and critical cases accounted for 5.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Moreover, the authors further divided children based upon age and found that severity was highest in younger children (0-5 years old) and especially in those < 1-year-old (10.6%), slowly decreasing with increasing age. In the Chinese experience, access to intensive care units has been required for approximately 2% of pediatric cases, with much higher rates in adult (79) . Similar rates have been reported by the American CDC, which has recorded a 29% rate of hospitalisation and a 0.58% to 2% rate of access to PICU [80) .. As regards mortality, mortality rate in children has been much lower than the one that has been described in adults. The first reported death was a 10-month-old child presenting with intussusception, later complicating with multiorgan failure and dying 4 weeks after admission (73) . A second fatality was reported in China, a 14 year old boy who died on February 7 th 2020 in Hubei (81) . As of March 8 th 2020, these remained the only 2 reported fatality in children in China. Accordingly, the US CDC and the Italian ISS have counted 3 and 4 deaths among the reported pediatric cases, respectively. In particular, all 4 fatalities in the Italian registry occurred in younger children (age range 0-9, 1 male and 3 females), with a lethality rate of 0.2% for such age range ( Table 2 ) (69) .

It is now established that sensitivity of CT scan is even greater than that of RT-PCR on respiratory or blood specimens, enhancing the role of imaging in diagnosing patients with clinical manifestations of COVID-19 but negative samples (83) . As regards pediatric patients, a few studies have examined the use of chest CT scan. Along with CT features in adults, ground glass opacities (GOO) represent the most commonly seen sign. GOO has been detected in a third of 171 children with diagnosed SARS-Cov-2 infection reported by Lu et al (73) . This is consistent with data reported by other authors. Li et al. reviewed a case series of 5 patients and found patchy GOO in 3 (84) . Remarkably, 2 out of 3 patients with positive chest CT scan were asymptomatic, proving that the correlation between clinical and radiological findings remains often unclear. All 3 scans normalised at follow-up, held between 5 and 7 days after initial chest CT. Xia et al. obtained CT scan of 20 pediatric patients (age 0-14 years old) with SARS-Cov-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab (77) . At an early stage, 16 out of 20 patients had positive chest CT scan, with unilateral (6/20, 30%) or bilateral (10/20, 50%) pulmonary lesions. Overall, 4 patients had imaging within range. Accordingly, the most common radiological sign was GOO (12/20, 60%), followed by consolidation with surrounding halo sign (10/20, 50%), fine mesh shadow (4/20, 20%) and tiny nodules (3/20, 15%).

A part of these children present, or presented in the weeks prior to onset, a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2 infection or otherwise had contact with affected patients. It is not yet clear if it is a true Kawasaki disease induced by viral infection or if the forms that are being observed are instead a systemic inflammatory manifestation of the infection, similar but not entirely identical to one classic Kawasaki disease. The cytokine storm typical of COVID-19 actually has a substantial overlap with that of Kawasaki disease, with high levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and the presence of circulating activated macrophages can also characterize both diseases (92, 93) .",
