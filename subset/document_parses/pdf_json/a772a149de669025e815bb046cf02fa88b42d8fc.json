To identify index cases, we monitored students for the entire academic year, for the presence and severity of eight symptoms of respiratory tract infection using a daily web-based survey, with symptoms rated on a scale of 0-4. Index cases were defined as individuals who reported a 6-point increase in cumulative daily symptom score. Suspected index cases were visited by study staff to confirm the presence of reported symptoms of illness and to collect biospecimen samples. We then identified clusters of close contacts of index cases (ie, individuals who lived in close proximity to index cases, close friends, and partners) who were presumed to be at increased risk of developing symptomatic respiratory tract infection while under observation. We monitored each close contact for 5 days for symptoms and viral shedding and measured transcriptomic responses at each timepoint each day using a blood-based 36-gene RT-PCR assay. Findings Between Sept 1, 2009, and April 10, 2015, we enrolled 1465 participants. Of 264 index cases with respiratory tract infection symptoms, 150 (57%) had a viral cause confirmed by RT-PCR. Of their 555 close contacts, 106 (19%) developed symptomatic respiratory tract infection with a proven viral cause during the observation window, of whom 60 (57%) had the same virus as their associated index case. Nine viruses were detected in total. The transcriptomic assay accurately predicted viral infection at the time of maximum symptom severity (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0\u00b794 [95% CI 0\u00b792-0\u00b796]), as well as at 1 day (0\u00b787 [95% CI 0\u00b784-0\u00b790]), 2 days (0\u00b785 [0\u00b782-0\u00b788]), and 3 days (0\u00b774 [0\u00b771-0\u00b777]) before peak illness, when symptoms were minimal or absent and 22 (62%) of 35 individuals, 25 (69%) of 36 individuals, and 24 (82%) of 29 individuals, respectively, had no detectable viral shedding.",

            "text": "Acute viral infections are one of the most common reasons for visits to primary care physicians in highincome countries. 1 Annually, influenza affects 5-20% of the US population, results in more than 400 000 hospital admissions, and causes up to 61 000 deaths. 2, 3 Outbreaks of viral infection continue to affect countries worldwide, including outbreaks of measles, global pandemics such as the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 outbreak, and emergence of novel coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012, and most recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [4] [5] [6] [7] However, available molecular tools that can contribute to outbreak investigation or directing early clinical management are insufficient and scarce. The usefulness of traditional pathogen-focused diagnostic methods for viral infection (eg, culture, serology, antigen detection, and PCR) is limited by the fact they can be slow, costly, and restricted in terms of breadth of pathogens detected; can require a-priori knowledge of the pathogen being tested; might not detect emerging strains (eg, the 2009 influenza A H1N1 and current SARS-CoV-2 pan demics 8 ); and are often incapable of distinguishing between active infection and colonisation. Therefore, there is increasing interest in using hostderived biomarkers to ascertain the presence or type of infection in at-risk hosts, including single-analyte biomarkers such as procalcitonin and composite, multiplex biomarker panels, which have been included in an increasing number of gene expression-based studies. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Previous research on diagnostics for naturally acquired infection has focused on identifying symptomatic individuals at the time of clinical presen tation for medical care, 20 which is often late in the time course of many viral infections. Identification of infectious causes in earlier, presymptomatic phases of illness provides an opportunity to optimise and deliver timely, and thus more effective, therapy, refine prophylaxis decisions, and guide public health inter ventions such as isolation and quarantine. 14, 23 However, identifying individuals who have been exposed to infectious viruses but do not yet have symptoms of clinical illness is logistically challenging, reflected by the paucity of available data and tools to address these problems.",

[26] [27] [28] [29] However, challenge infections are contrived rather than natural, typically use laboratory-adapted viral strains, and result in a clinical illness that does not entirely resemble that seen in naturally acquired infections, all of which can limit the broad applicability of findings from human-challenge studies. 17, 23, [30] [31] [32] [33] To date, the nature of the host response to infection during the presymptomatic phase of naturally occurring disease has not been defined.

After enrol ment, participating students completed a web-based survey once a day for the duration of the academic year (September to May, excluding holidays) to describe the presence and severity of eight symptoms (cough, fever, headache, malaise, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, sneezing, and sore throat) of respiratory tract infection (appendix p 2).",

Study staff then assessed suspected index cases to confirm the presence of reported symptoms of illness and collected biospecimens. On the basis of these sentinel cases of respiratory tract infection with suspected viral cause, we identified a prospective observational cohort of asymptomatic but potentially exposed close contacts (ie, people living in the same dormitory or identified by the index case as a close contact), who were then asked to complete the daily webbased survey to monitor the development of any symptoms and sampled by study staff who collected biospecimen samples at their place of residence or on campus for up to 5 days (defined as the observation window).

Data were normalised as previously described. 9 , 10 We used a regularised (2-norm) logistic regression model to discriminate symptomatic shedders (cases) from asymptomatic nonshedders (controls; appendix pp 2-5). The data were split into training and testing sets 25 times using repeated random subsampling, and each of the 25 models was trained using data from all timepoints. We assessed the performance of the model at each individual timepoint using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculation of area under the ROC curves (AUROCs). All model analyses were implemented in Python (version 3.7.4) and Tensorflow (version 1.14.0). 35 Accuracies were calculated using the point on the ROC curve that maximises the Youden index, 36 while other comparisons of model performance (eg, the true positive rate) were calculated by selecting operating points along the ROC curves that correspond to a threshold or fixed value (eg, fixing a desired false positive rate; appendix p 5). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparison of means and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to describe the association between variables where indicated. Z scores were calculated using normalised, log-transformed relative gene expression values, as previously described. 9 Since the exact time of exposure or transmission during naturally acquired infection is unknown, for the purpose of analysis, close contact days were aligned to the time of maximum symptom severity (ie, day of highest symptom score; time [T]) for each individual in an attempt to place individuals on broadly similar time scales in terms of the host response to infection. For each individual close contact, 1 day after peak symptoms was defined as T1, 1 day before the highest symptom score was defined as T minus 1 (T-1), 2 days before as T minus 2 (T-2), 3 days before as T minus 3 (T-3), and 4 days before as T minus 4 (T-4).",

Overall, the viral signature in the 199 symptomatic non-shedders was significantly higher than in asympto matic non-shedders (p<0\u00b70001) but significantly lower than in symptomatic shedders (p=0\u00b704).",

            "text": "In this study, we have used an innovative index-cluster study design with a focus on serial sampling of real-world, close contacts of infected individuals to enrich for cases of naturally occurring infection during these early, postexposure but presymptomatic time points. This unique design has permitted real-world validation of a transcriptomic signature in peripheral blood that is capable of accurately identifying exposed but apparently healthy individuals who will go on to develop sympto matic viral infection. In the majority of participants (62%), the gene signature was present even before viral shedding was detected. The promise of this approach is highlighted by the discrimi native ability of the genomic signature 2-3 days before maximum illness, when most individuals had minimal or no symp toms (90% and 78% of participants were asymptomatic or had subclinical illness at the T-3 and T-2 timepoints, respectively). Furthermore, mild symptoms at early timepoints were clinically vague and typical of seasonal allergies, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder flares, or even symptoms due to sequelae of chronic smoking. 37 Thus, genomic analysis to classify viral infection among asymptomatic individuals or those with common, non-specific upper respiratory symptoms would be valuable. The accuracy of the transcriptomic signature across nine different respiratory viruses, each with specific incubation times and variable clinical progression and duration, also high lights the potential of this approach. Additionally, the gene signature used represents conserved antiviral response signalling pathways that are active, and thus discriminatory, across the spectrum of illness, not only at early timepoints. This broad applicability is vital because in a real-world setting, the location of an individual along the continuum of infection at the moment of testing would be unknown. Although our transcriptomic signature accurately classified a wide spectrum of viral respiratory tract infections, it had the highest accuracy in a subset of viruses, including influenza and coronavirus. Influenza is one of the most important viruses to identify early because of its contribution to pandemics, in which existing diagnostics might pe rform poorly (especially for emerging strains as observed in 2009 38 ), questions of triage and quarantine are paramount, and effective therapeutic options are readily available and most effective when provided early in disease. Similarly, another global outbreak of a novel, highly virulent coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2-is ongoing, and it is evident that tools that can aid in assessment of individuals with potential exposure, especially tools that can diagnose infection before detectable viral shedding, would be a valuable to existing epidemiological and molecular approaches in outbreak settings. Our experience suggests that the ability to accurately detect exposure to these types of emerging infections will only become increasingly important over time.",

            "text": "A number of other studies have described interferon response-based transcriptomic signatures of acute respiratory infections that vary by target population, pathogens, modelling approaches, and the number of genes required to discriminate disease states. 10, 11, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] 32 Some of these findings have also been validated, combined, or expanded upon by secondary ex-vivo analysis of publicly available data. 12, 13, 39 Although the signature described in this study clearly represents a limited subset of all discriminating genes, some observations regarding simplified, inter ferondriven signatures can be made. Our data confirm that that some genes identified by previous studies (eg, IFI44L and IFI27 11, 40 ) perform well as classifiers to distinguish between individuals with viral illness and those who are healthy (mean AUROC for IFI44L and IFI27 at timepoint T were 0\u00b792 [95% CI 0\u00b790-0\u00b794] and 0\u00b779 [0\u00b776-0\u00b782], respectively [appendix p 12]), with strong upregulation observed in cases of viral infection. Additionally, we show that several other genes also perform well as classifiers, including RSAD2 (AUROC 0\u00b796 [95% CI 0\u00b795-0\u00b797]), IFIT3 (0\u00b796 [0\u00b795-0\u00b797]), and IFI44 (0\u00b793 [0\u00b791-0\u00b795]; appendix p 12). On the basis of our experience and the published literature, it seems that some diagnostic classification tasks, in which the biological responses are highly conserved, unique in character, and of great magnitude, might be reasonably addressed with pauci-analyte biomarker panels. 11, 13, [41] [42] [43] However, as population complexity increases by adding greater interhost variability (such as immuno suppression), discriminating clinically similar groups with more varied underlying patho physiology, or discriminating multiple clinical mimics at once, more intricate biomarker panels will probably be required to maintain high fidelity in real-world settings. 10, 15, 44 Our study has several limitations. First, this study was designed to validate the predictive power of a small set of genes that already had proven discriminatory capability during maximal illness, and thus was not designed to ascertain whether additional, untested gene sets could offer improved discriminatory performance at early timepoints in the course of illness. Studies using RNA sequencing on whole blood, single-cell sequencing, or other methods are needed to more completely define early genomic changes in the naturally infected host. Second, our patient cohort was comprised of otherwise young, healthy individuals with community-acquired viral respiratory tract infection of mild to moderate severity. Therefore, application of our findings to patient populations from other age groups, people with immunological comorbidities, or people with more severe viral infec tions (such as SARS-CoV-2) will need to be assessed. Finally, we did not identify any confirmed infections due to bacterial or other pathogens. As a result, although these transcriptomic markers show great promise for differentiating early infection and presymptomatic viral exposure from non-infectious states, we did not directly validate the ability of these markers to differentiate viral exposure from early forms of other types of infection. 10, 11, 15, 45 As the clinical use of transcrip tomic biomarkers continues to be assessed, consideration of broad applicability and performance across a wide array of clinical settings will continue to be paramount.",

For example, only one individual with influenza infection had presymptomatic samples available for all timepoints, although the signature correctly classified that individual at each timepoint (T-1, T-2, T-3, and T-4).To investigate how signature strength correlates with overall symptom severity, we assessed the correlation between model-derived probabilities of infection and symptom scores at each individual timepoint (appendix p 5). At each timepoint, gene expression levels were similar across symptomatic individuals despite variable symptom severity. Thus, gene signature performance varied by timepoint (figure 3) but was not affected by symptom severity within each timepoint (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient at time T, \u03c1=0\u00b706 [appendix p 13]). When comparing gene signature performance with clinical diagnosis (symptom-based), the model out performed clinical diagnosis at all timepoints with the exception of time point T and for index cases (where symptom-based diagnosis by definition has 100% sensitivity; appendix p 14). 24 (82%) of 29 individuals who developed symptomatic respiratory tract infection had no detectable viral shedding at T-3, and 25 (69%) of 36 individuals were negative for any virus by routine clinical testing at time T-2.",
