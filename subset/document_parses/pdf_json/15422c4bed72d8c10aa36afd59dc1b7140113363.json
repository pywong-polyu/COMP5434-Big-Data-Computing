            "text": "With the world-wide development of 2019 novel coronavirus, although WHO has officially announced the disease as COVID-19, one controversial term -\"Chinese Virus\" is still being used by a great number of people. In the meantime, global online media coverage about COVID-19-related racial attacks increases steadily, most of which are anti-Chinese or anti-Asian. As this pandemic becomes increasingly severe, more people start to talk about it on social media platforms such as Twitter. When they refer to COVID-19, there are mainly two ways: using controversial terms like \"Chinese Virus\" or \"Wuhan Virus\", or using non-controversial terms like \"Coronavirus\". In this study, we attempt to characterize the Twitter users who use controversial terms and those who use non-controversial terms. We use the Tweepy API to retrieve 17 million related tweets and the information of their authors. We find significant differences between these two groups of Twitter users across their demographics, user-level features like the number of followers, political following status, as well as their geo-locations. Moreover, we apply classification models to predict Twitter users who are more likely to use controversial terms. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to characterize users with respect to their usage of controversial terms during a major crisis.",

On April 13, WHO reported that 213 countries, areas and territories were impacted by the virus, totaling 1,773,084 confirmed cases and 111,652 confirmed death worldwide. 1 This disease has undeniably impacted the daily operations of the society. McKibbin and Fernando provided the estimated overall GDP loss caused by COVID-19 in seven scenarios, with the estimated loss range between 283 billion USD to 9,170 billion USD [1] . However, the economy is not the only aspect impacted by COVID-19. When COVID-19 was first spreading in the mainland of China, Lin found that a mutual discrimination was developed within the Asian societies [2] .",

            "text": "With the world-wide development of COVID-19, the global online media coverage of the term \"Chinese Flu\" took off around March 18. 2 Fig. 1 shows the timeline of the density of global online media coverage using the term \"Chinese Flu\" and the global online media coverage of COVID-19related racial attacks. Around February 2, there was a peak of the online media coverage of COVID-19-related racial attacks following the peak of online media coverage using \"Chinese Flu\". Zheng et al. found that some media coverage of COVID-19 has a negative impact on Chinese travellers' mental health by labeling the outbreak as \"Chinese virus pandemonium\" [3] . The online media coverage of COVID-19-related racial attacks is still increasing steadily as of April 2020. 3 Not only the online media coverage but also the usage of the term \"Chinese Virus\" or \"Chinese Flu\" is trending on social media platforms such as Twitter. On March 16, even the president of United States, Donald Trump posted a tweet calling COVID-19 \"Chinese Virus\". 4 Despite the defense by President Donald Trump that calling coronavirus the \"Chinese Virus\" is not racist 5 , racism and discrimination against Asian-Americans has surged in the US. 6 Matamoros-Fernandez proposed the concept \"platformed racism\" as a new form of racism derived from the culture of social media platforms in 2017 and argued that it evoked platforms as amplifiers and manufacturers of racist discourse [4] . It is crucial for governments, social media platforms and individuals to understand such phenomena during this pandemic or similar crisis. In addition, the uses of controversial terms associated with COVID-19 could be associated with hate speeches as they are likely xenophobic [25] . Hate speeches reflect the expressions of conflicts within and across societies or nationalities [26] . On online social media platforms, hate speeches can spread extremely fast, even cross-platform, and can stay online for a rather long time [26] . They are also itinerant, meaning that despite forcefully removed by the platforms, they can find expression elsewhere on the Internet and even offline [26] . The impact of hate speeches is not to be under-estimated in the sense of both developing racism in the population and damaging the relationship between societies and nations. Therefore, it is crucial to detect and contain the spreading of hate speeches in the early stage to prevent exponential growth of such a mindset among Internet users.",

Such findings and insights can be vital for policy-making on the global fight against COVID-19. In addition, we attempt to train classification models for predicting the usage of controversial terms associated with COVID-19, with features crawled and generated from Twitter data.

Sloan et al. derived the characteristics of age, occupation and social class from Twitter user metadata [6] . Corbett et al. and Chang et al. also tried to study the demographics of general Facebook users [7] , [8] . Pennacchiotti and Popescu used a machine learning approach to classify Twitter users according to their user profile, tweeting behavior, content of tweets and network structure [9] . With the connection between social media and people's lives getting increasingly closer, studies have been conducted at a more specific level. Gong et al. studied the silent users in social media communities and found that user generated content can be used for profiling silent users [10] . Paul et al. were the first to utilize network analysis to characterize the Twitter verified user network [11] . Users consciously deleting tweets were observed by Bhattacharya et al. [23] . Cavazos-Rehg et al. studied the followers and tweets of a marijuana-focused Twitter handle [24] . Moreover, attention has also been paid to users with specific activities. Ribeiro et al. focused on detecting and characterizing hateful users in terms of their activity patterns, word usage and the network structure [12] . Olteanu, Weber and Gatica-Perez studied the #BlackLivesMatter movement and hashtag on Twitter to quantify the population biases across user types and dempographics [13] . Badawy et al. analyzed the digital traces of political manipulation related to 2016 Russian interference in terms of Twitter users' geo-location and their political ideology [14] . In addition to analyzing individual users, many studies were conducted on communities in social media platforms [15] , [16] , [17] , user behavior [18] , [19] , [20] , and the content that users publish [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] .",

For example, consider this tweet: I don't think we should use the term \"Chinese Virus.\" However, we believe the percentage of this kind of tweets is relatively low. We assume that if a user uses the controversial terms, it means this user agrees with the intent of the controversial terms. If a user uses non-controversial terms, then it means this user disagrees with or at least avoids the usage of controversial terms. This assumption allows us to separate the users into two groups according to their choices of the terms: one including those who use controversial terms and the other including those who use non-controversial terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to characterize users with respect to their usage of controversial terms during a major crisis.",

Given the domain range of these five attributes is large and to better observe the distribution, we first add 0.001 to all these values to avoid zero probability and take the logarithm of them. Fig. 4 shows the density plots (in log scale) of the normalized numbers of followers, friend, statuses, favourites, and listed. Since the distribution is not close to a normal distribution, we apply the Mann-Whitney rank test on these five attributes. There is strong evidence (p < 0.0001) in all these five attributes to conclude that the respective medians of these features of CD are not equal to the ones of ND. Table III shows the medians of the five normalized features in each group. Users using noncontroversial terms tend to have a larger social capital which means they have relatively more followers, friends and post more tweets. This suggests that users in ND normally have a larger size of audience and are more active in posting tweets. One hypothesis for this is that users with a larger audience and more experienced with using Twitter are more cautious when posting in Twitter, which means they pay more attention to the choice of words. Twitter users are found to be more cautious in publishing and republishing tweets, and also more cautious in sharing among friends [30] . Although the medians of favourites and listed memberships of ND are also higher than those of CD, the differences are not large. In addition, the users using controversial terms tend to have newer accounts. By applying the Mann-Whitney rank test, the number of months since account was created by users in CD is statistically smaller (p < 0.0001). The median number of months of CD is 63 and that of ND is 74. The difference is almost one year, which is significant. This observation is similar to the findings that hateful users have newer accounts [12] . Since using controversial terms does not necessarily correspond to delivering hateful speech, we hypothesize that newer accounts could indicate less experience using Twitter and thus being less cautious when posting tweets.",

The proportion of users in CD only following Donald Trump is 21.6% which is higher than that in ND. This indicates that users only following President Trump are more likely to use controversial terms. This observation resonates with the findings by Gupta, Joshi, and Kumaraguru [15] that during a crisis, the leader represents the topics and opinions of the community. Another noticeable finding is the proportions of users that follow the members of the Democratic Party in ND are all higher than those in CD. This suggests that users following the members of the Democratic Party are more likely to use non-controversial terms.",

The study also showed that variations in voting patterns and political attitudes exist along a continuum, meaning that the Democratic-Republican supporter ratio gradually changes from metropolitan to rural areas [28] . With our finding in the previous section that Republican-politician Twitter followers have a higher tendency to use controversial terms, the difference in usage geographically could be explained. However, Scala et al. also pointed out that suburban areas were still heavily Democratic in the 2016 election [28] . Thus we cannot fully explain the overwhelming controversial usage in suburban regions from a pure political perspective.",

Rockl\u00f6v et al. discovered in a recent research that the contract rate of the virus is proportional to population density, resulting in significantly higher basic reproduction number 15 and thus more infections in urban regions than in rural regions [29] . Therefore, higher reporting of infections cases can be found in urban regions, contributing to the higher use of non-controversial terms associated with COVID-19. On the contrary, rural regions have relatively lower percentage of infected population, thus discussions about the nature and the origin of COVID-19 could be more prevalent, and during such discussions, relatively more users chose to use controversial terms. This could partially explain the higher use of controversial terms in suburban regions.",

For SVM, a linear kernel was used. For SGD, the Huber loss was used to optimize the model. For MLP, three hidden layers were used with sizes of 150, 100 and 50 nodes respectively, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) was used as activation for all layers, and the Adam Optimizer was used for optimization. The models were applied to three datasets as described below. All datasets were split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 90:10.",

We find significant differences between the users using controversial terms and users using non-controversial terms across demographics, userlevel features, political following status, and geo-location. Young people tend to use non-controversial terms to refer to COVID-19. Although in both CD and ND groups, male users constitute a higher proportion, the proportion of female users in the ND group is higher than that in the CD group. In terms of user-level features, users in the ND group have a larger social capital which means they have more followers, friends, and statuses. In addition, the proportion of non-verified users is higher in both CD and ND groups, while the proportion of verified users in the ND group is higher than that of the CD group. There are more users following Donald Trump in the CD group than in the ND groups. The proportion of users in the ND group following the members of the Democratic Party is higher. There is no sufficient evidence to conclude that there is difference in terms of which state the user lives in. However, we find users living in rural or suburban areas are more likely to use the controversial terms than users living in urban areas. Furthermore, we apply several classification algorithms to predict the users with a higher probability of using the controversial terms.
