This review highlights recent findings from studies using point of care ultrasound (POCUS) to improve the care of trauma patients. Recent Findings Major findings include the use of POCUS to assess volume status of trauma patients upon arrival to measure the major vasculature. Additionally, several studies have advanced the use of POCUS to identify pneumothorax in trauma patients. Finally, the ASA POCUS certification and ASRA expert guidelines are examples of international organizations establishing guidelines for utilization and training of anesthesiologists in the field of POCUS, which will be discussed. Summary Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and considerable resources being diverted to fight this global healthcare crisis, advances are being made in utilization of POCUS to aid the care of trauma patients.",

The ultrasound, now with several hand-held models commercially available, has many benefits: it is relatively inexpensive, exams can be rapid and non-invasive, and it does not expose patients to radiation of other imaging modalities. Furthermore, it is the ideal tool in situations where rapid diagnosis and management are necessary. As well, trauma anesthesiology is now an established part of the field of \"Traumatology,\" and anesthesiologists are primary traumatologists. Although this field is expanding rapidly, evidence is still forming on outcome measures, and more well-designed studies are needed to continue to expand the benefits of this modality in early trauma management.",

(2018) showed that IVC diameter correlates with CVP and is effective at assessing changes in volume status in patients presenting to the ED in a hypotensive state. However, only a fraction of patients in this study suffered traumatic injuries. Very few studies have focused on the use of POCUS as an indication of volume status specifically in trauma patients. Doucet et al.

In fact, presence of cardiac motion on ultrasound was recently shown to be the most important predictor of survivability when trauma patients present in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest (odds ratio 33.91) [18] ; however, survivability is exceedingly rare in patients who arrive in traumatic arrest, regardless of presence of cardiac motion detected on ultrasound [19\u2022] .

Ultimately, thoracic POCUS emerged as the fundamental tool to diagnose PTX rapidly and accurately as it is superior to standard supine chest radiograph and is a component of the eFAST. In a multicenter, prospective study of 157 patients with blunt chest trauma, the sensitivity of thoracic POCUS for detecting PTX was 75% and the specificity 100% [22\u2022\u2022] . Most recently, a metaanalysis including 13 studies and 1271 trauma patients demonstrated thoracic POCUS diagnostic superiority to standard supine chest radiograph [23\u2022] . Finally, the sensitivity and specificity for thoracic POCUS were 91% and 99% respectively, compared to supine chest radiograph (47% and 100%, respectively). These results are independent of the mechanism of trauma and type of provider performing scans. These authors suggest that thoracic POCUS should be performed following the FAST exam prior to a supine chest radiograph. If the POCUS exam is indicative of a PTX and the patient is in respiratory distress or shock, a tube thoracostomy could be placed immediately.",

Although trauma patients are typically treated as \"full stomach,\" gastric POCUS is superior to clinical judgment in prediction of full stomach status in urgent preoperative situations [36] . POCUS can be used to assess stomach contents in patients who cannot respond to questions about dietary history (low GCS, intoxication) or patients with significant pain or anxiety, both of which are common situations in polytrauma care [37] . One observational study of 45 polytrauma patients who were scanned in supine and right lateral decubitus positions showed concordance between expected stomach volume and the volume suctioned in the right lateral decubitus (RLD) position. The authors noted no aspiration events occurred in these polytrauma patients, but they did not note if their assessments changed their anesthetic approach, which would be a medical decision-making goal of using this modality [38 \u2022].",

Paramedics can be trained in a short amount of time to use POCUS to identify PTX [52] and confirmation of endotracheal intubation [53] . More than half of the trauma patients transported via helicopter experience hypotension, potentially suggesting hypovolemia, and could potentially benefit from an early estimate of hypovolemia/blood loss while still in transport [54] . It is clear that earlier assessment and diagnosis are a potential benefit; however, improved clinical outcome or survival has not been definitively shown.",

In 2021, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine assembled a group of experts to formulate recommendations regarding the education of POCUS. They identified barriers such as lack of equipment, standardized curricula, and sufficient faculty [65\u2022\u2022] . Their recommendations outline the importance of the I-AIM framework, the minimal number of supervised scans that should be performed to indicate proficiency, and stress that these should be done on live patients and not simulators [65\u2022\u2022, 66\u2022\u2022] . Recently, the ASA has developed a five-part, online formal POCUS certification for physician anesthesiologists and trainees that will hopefully overcome the barriers identified above. It is our opinion that ultimately all residency programs will be required to incorporate POCUS training and milestones into their educational programs in order to train our future anesthesiologists in this rapidly expanding field.",

Moving beyond the well-established FAST exam, anesthesiologists are beginning to explore how POCUS can have a positive impact on the care of patients who suffer trauma. This is a unique subset of patients that requires specialized care that may not allow for a full POCUS exam for several reasons. Although most of the evidence to date suggests that POCUS exams can be taught readily and performed relatively expeditiously, time to immediate definitive care is critical in trauma patients. Furthermore, the extent of a trauma patient's injuries is not always immediately known and therefore, extensive caution is used to minimize the risk of exacerbating occult injuries.

Although there is good evidence that POCUS results in superior imaging for some anatomical studies in acute care patients, this has not been definitively proven to improve outcomes in major trauma cases. We recommend anesthesiologists consider POCUS in their evaluation of the trauma patient, but as such, care must be taken to avoid being distracted by incidental findings that may have no impact on the patient's current traumatic condition. In such a high acuity clinical situation, extreme caution must be used to minimize any wasted time investigating a finding that is irrelevant in a potentially unstable patient. This highlights the need for sophisticated training and standardization of POCUS protocols to minimize delays in resuscitation [69] . Furthermore, skilled sonographers are required to interpret the ultrasound exam and assess the findings. As Kelly et al. (2020) point out in their commentary, one must consider patient-specific, disease-specific, and imaging-specific factors when interpreting the necessity and validity of a POCUS exam in such high acuity, often life-threatening clinical situations [70] .",
