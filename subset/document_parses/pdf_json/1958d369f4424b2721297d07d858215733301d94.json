            "text": "We aimed to evaluate daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake, retention, and adherence and predictors of study non-attendance and low PrEP adherence in a Brazilian trans-specific 48-week study (PrEParadas). Methods: We enrolled transgender women (TGW) engaging in high-risk sexual behaviours between August 2017 and December 2018. PrEP adherence was based on tenofovir diphosphate concentrations in dried blood spots (DBS). We used random effects logistic regression models and ordinal models to estimate the odds of having a missed visit and of low PrEP adherence, respectively. Multivariable models were adjusted for variables with p-value<0.10 in the univariate analysis. Results: From the 271 eligible, 130 participants were enrolled in the study (PrEP uptake: 48%), out of which 111 (85.4%) were retained at 48 weeks. Multivariable model for study non-attendance included study visit, age, main sexual partner and stimulant use. The odds of missing a visit increased after the week 24. Participants aged 18-24 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 8.76, 95% CI: 2.09-36.7) and 25-34 years (aOR = 6.79, 95% CI: 1.72-26.8) compared to TGW aged 35+ years had significantly higher odds of having a missed visit. The odds of a missed visit were higher among participants reporting stimulant use (aOR = 4.99, 95% CI: 1.37-18.1) compared to no stimulant use. DBS levels at week 48 showed that 42 (38.5%), 14 (12.8%) and 53 (48.6%) of 109 participants had low, moderate and high PrEP adherence. Multivariable model for low PrEP adherence included study visit, age, schooling, race/colour, housing, binge drinking, stimulant use, feminizing hormone therapy (FHT) use and received text message. Low PrEP adherence was significantly higher among participants with less years of schooling (aOR = 6.71, 95% CI: 1.30-34.5) and had a borderline association with Black colour/race (aOR = 6.72, 95% CI: 0.94-47.8). Participants using the FHT available at the site had decreased odds of low PrEP adherence (aOR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.16-0.88). No participant seroconverted over the course of the study. Conclusions: Although high PrEP retention can be achieved in a gender-affirming setting, PrEP adherence may be an important challenge faced among TGW due to social disparities. The scale-up of prevention tools like PrEP will have to address systemic social determinants as these stand as important barriers for TGW's access to health services.",

Several authors called attention to how TGW were often aggregated with men who have sex with men (MSM) in intervention trials, which belied their HIV risk and implied that methods to reach and engage TGW were the same [8] . TGW represented only 14% of the iPrEX study sample, and demographics and behavioural factors were significantly different between TGW and MSM [7] . However, iPrEX was not designed to meet the needs of TGW, perhaps explaining the low adherence observed among TGW, yet no data on differences in PrEP retention were reported. Studies increasingly highlight the differences between TGW and MSM populations and the need to conduct trans-specific PrEP research [9] , particularly addressing facilitators and barriers, including transphobia and concomitant use of feminizing hormone therapy (FHT).",

Despite the challenges of reaching and retaining this vulnerable population, our results showed high engagement in biomedical prevention research though adherence to PrEP decreased over time. The high PrEP retention among study participants is comparable to studies with MSM at 48 weeks of follow-up, and higher than observed in studies with cisgender women sex workers and cisgender women who inject drugs [4, 5, [18] [19] [20] . Importantly, we found that social determinants of health significantly impacted study visit attendance and PrEP adherence. There was a significant decrease in study visit attendance and PrEP adherence over time, with youngest TGW having significantly higher odds of missed visits in our study. Adjusted models showed that low PrEP adherence was higher among TGW with less years of schooling and had an upward trend among Black participants, whereas receiving FHT from the study was associated with lower odds of low adherence. These results suggest that Brazilian TGW are interested and just as capable to adhere to oral medication to prevent HIV acquisition, but that social determinants of health must be addressed to improve adherence. Despite the high PrEP retention, the proportion of TGW with protective drug concentrations decreased over the study follow-up period, which is consistent with other studies. Lower drug concentration levels over time may be related to PrEP fatigue as long-term adherence to daily medication is difficult to achieve in many contexts and across populations [21] . TGW enrolled in a qualitative study in the United States reported pill fatigue and frustration to add another medication to their daily regimens as a barrier to PrEP use [22] . Long-acting (LA) PrEP agents are promising strategies to address adherence issues among vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, as many TGW use fillers in the gluteal area [6] , this will limit their ability to use LA injectable cabotegravir as this must be injected into the gluteal muscle [23] . The use of fillers, usually referred to as industrial silicone, is extremely common in Brazil. In PrEParadas, 41.5% of participants had fillers, similar to previous Brazilian studies, which described a 32-49% prevalence among TGW, which is a far larger proportion than found in the United States (16.7%) [24] .",

            "text": "Potential drug-drug interactions may also partially explain the lower TDF levels among TGW. Small pharmacokinetics studies described minor interactions between FHT and PrEP, but TDF and FTC concentrations remained above the threshold needed for protection and thus, clinically meaningful interactions are not expected [25] . Participants on the FHT available at the site had higher odds of PrEP adherence, which indicates that offering both HIV prevention and gender-affirming care, including hormone provision, could facilitate PrEP implementation among TGW [8] . Peruvian TGW reported high interest in the integration of HIV services with FHT provision [26] . Among U.S. young TGW, those who received FHT were more willing to participate in a PrEP adherence study [27] . Even though offering trans-specific care is not mandatory nor feasible in most settings, where possible, providing a gender-affirmative approach may improve HIV care and prevention engagement among trans people [28] . Social determinants also emerged as important predictors of low adherence. TGW with less years of schooling had the lowest adherence. In addition, Black participants tended to have low PrEP adherence, which is consistent with other HIV research [5] . Among people living with HIV, lower schooling was associated with worse HIV care outcomes, such as late presentation to care [29] , not being on antiretroviral treatment and not being virologically suppressed [30] . The combination of transphobic experiences, racism and discrimination poses Black TGW at a higher vulnerability to HIV and negatively impact their HIV care and prevention outcomes, including adherence [31, 32] . Black TGW and those with lower schooling may face considerable threats to their health and wellness, especially when they experience these factors together. The high prevalence and vicious interplay of these social determinants of health highlight the need to identify the specific barriers and evidence-based interventions that will maximize PrEP adherence among TGW.",

Prior discriminatory experiences in the healthcare setting represented an important impediment to accessing PrEP [34] [35] [36] [37] . Since 2015, our team has been building competency at serving TGW, implementing services to meet community needs and fostering connections with the trans community through research and outreach. In efforts to build a research site for trans-specific studies, we developed a diverse group of researchers, including TGW who lent their expertise in planning and implementation of the PrEParadas study. We also provided gender-affirming care as part of the study [38] . Our high PrEP retention is consistent with research stating that staff training on trans-competency, trans-friendly environments and partnerships with trans-organizations could have positive implications for TGW's enrolment, retention and adherence in research studies [39] .

Having a missed visit may be a proxy of individuals who were not using PrEP as prescribed since medications were delivered to cover the period until the next visit. In our study, TGW aged <25 years had higher rates of missed visits. Young age has been associated with worse PrEP outcomes, such as low awareness, uptake, retention and adherence [40] . Chan et al. observed that age <30 years was a significant predictor of not being retained in PrEP after 12 months of follow-up [20] . In the PrEP Brasil study, both having young age and being TGW were associated with decreased odds of PrEP engagement (combining visit attendance and DBS levels) along the study [5] . Our group has previously described alarmingly high HIV prevalence among young Brazilian TGW aged 18-24 years (24.2%), along with lower odds of HIV prevention knowledge and higher odds of condomless sex regardless of HIV status compared to their older peers [41] . Yet, trans youth continue to be under-represented in HIV research, including PrEP studies [27] .

First, as our site is highly experienced in PrEP that also provides gender-affirming care, our successful PrEP uptake and retention rates may not be generalizable to other settings. A proportion of eligible pre-screened participants (141, 52%) did not enrol in this study, which may limit our ability to identify potential associations. Same-day PrEP initiation, currently recommended in many settings, including ours, is an important approach to mitigate losses prior to PrEP engagement. Notwithstanding, PrEP retention remains an important issue. Our findings help to decrease the knowledge gaps related to PrEP retention among TGW. The current analysis does not include an exhaustive list of social determinants and future research addressing more robust explorations of social determinants is needed. In addition, our follow-up time was 1 year, and results may differ in longer periods. Also, we did not perform a power calculation, which may have reduced our ability to detect statistical significance in the evaluation of potential associations. Sample limitations may have hindered to find a significant association between PrEP adherence and race. We only screened CT/NG twice during the follow-up since this screening is not available routinely in Brazil. Finally, our data collection occurred prior to COVID-19 epidemic, which will definitely change the HIV prevention scenario.",
