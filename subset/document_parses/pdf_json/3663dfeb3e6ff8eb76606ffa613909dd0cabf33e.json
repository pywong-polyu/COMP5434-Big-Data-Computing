Many have used mathematical modelling methods to estimate key epidemiological features, such as basic reproductive number (R 0 ), to help inform decision makers so that they can design, evaluate, and adjust control strategies and containment measures [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, persistent gaps in our knowledge of COVID-19 has made mathematical modelling challenging [12] . Although many epidemiological parameters affect the potential risk of infectious disease spread in a country (e.g., characteristics of cases, probability of exposure and infection, demographic features of the population, control measures implemented), the essential element is always the exact number of cases. The impacts of all other relevant factors are embodied in the change of the number of cases over time (assuming there is adequate capability for case detection, reporting, and confirmation), making case reporting data a critical input to public health response development [13] . Furthermore, case reporting data is also the timeliest and most easily obtainable data for all countries. So, in theory, effective use of such data could provide a method for evaluating risk for the purpose of informing country-level strategic and tactical decision making.",

We used this model to conduct a risk assessment on outbreaks in 45 countries/territories in 4 regions that still had between 100 and 500 cases as of 31 March 2020. Our main finding was that 87% (39/ 45) were at high risk for their outbreak taking off and entering a rapidly growing epidemic stage. These countries needed to take immediate action to implement control measures. Although these 45 countries represent less than 10% of the global population, most are low or middle income, and therefore likely do not have the health system infrastructure capable of handling the enormous numbers of infections already being experienced by countries further along in their epidemics. Indeed, full-blown COVID-19 epidemics in these countries have the potential to produce serious humanitarian disasters. Key recommendations to Belarus by WHO included dramatic increase in mandatory social distancing (e.g., cancelling events and gatherings, implementing remote work and school, closing non-essential businesses, restricting non-essential movement), scale up of testing (i.e., expanding testing formats, ensuring quality of test kits, and strengthening entry screening), and strengthening of health system infrastructure [20] . A notable lengthening in DT has since been observed, returning Belarus to moderately low risk in the ST/DT Model The sensitivity analysis we conducted with the ST/ DT Model verified that it could detect changes in two directions-increasing DT thereby lowering risk, and decreasing DT thereby heightening risk. These changes reflect a complex combination of factors related to the epidemic itself (e.g., transmission dynamics) and countries' responses to the epidemic (i.e., containment and mitigation strategies and when and how well they are implemented). To validate that the changes the model detected were meaningful, we compared these changes with COVID-19 reporting from two countries. For Australia, the ST/DT model was able to detect shortening of DT and changing of risk assessment from moderately low to high risk ahead of Australia's implementation of social distancing measures [19] . For Belarus, the ST/DT Model was able to detect shortening of DT and changing of risk assessment from moderately low to high risk when social distancing was only voluntary and partially implemented. However, after consultation with WHO, Belarus implemented more strict measures nationwide [20] . DT has since lengthened. The ST/DT Model indicated that Belarus had returned to moderately low risk. These results validate our ST/DT Model, indicating that it can produce meaningful assessments.",

            "text": "Despite this demonstration that our ST/DT Model for COVID-19 epidemic risk assessment can add value as decision makers across the globe appraise their epidemic response options, our model does have several limitations. Firstly, since we intentionally built the ST/DT Model to only use case reporting data, so that it would be easy, convenient, and intuitive to use for nations lacking sophisticated data collection capacity, this decision does limit the model in the sense that its output is only as good as the case report data input. These data may be biased by the factors that can influence the quality and quantity of case reporting, which will be different in each individual country. This information bias could not only affect individual countries' risk assessments, but could also affect the median SN, mean ST, and mean DT used to structure the model. However, we attempted to mitigate this risk by taking a relatively large sample of countries in similar stages of their epidemics to determine the set point for these model variables. Secondly, the mean early epidemic DT across 20 countries was found to be 5 days, which is consistent with SARS-CoV-2 incubation period estimates, 11 lending confidence to this model parameter. Nevertheless, as more is learned and more cases are reported mean DT, and other model parameters, will need to be updated to improve the ST/DT Model as more and better information becomes available.",

This decision-making process must include some evaluation of the level of risk the nation faces with respect to whether their outbreak will expand rapidly into a large epidemic. Furthermore, many countries, particularly those with weaker public health infrastructure, may only have case report data and may lack the capacity required to develop their own sophisticated modeling. Our simple, intuitive, and pragmatic ST/DT Model meets this urgent need and can serve as a tool monitor the effectiveness of response measures, promoting timely and informed decision making.",

The average of its first 3 DTs (all DTs marked on the curve as black diamonds) was 5.7 days, placing Belarus initially in the moderately low risk (yellow) quadrant of the ST/DT Model. However, as DT began to shorten, Belarus crossed over into the ST/DT Model's high risk (red) quadrant and the Minister of Health requested assistance from WHO. Although Belarus had been testing suspected cases; isolating confirmed cases, first level contacts, and new arrivals from COVID-19 affected countries; and partially implementing voluntary social distancing while scaling up hospital capacity, these measures had clearly not been enough.",
