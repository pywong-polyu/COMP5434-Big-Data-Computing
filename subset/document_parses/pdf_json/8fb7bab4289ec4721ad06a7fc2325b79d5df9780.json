            "text": "10 To prevent the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreading, Chinese 11 government takes a series of corresponding measures to restrict human mobility, 12 including transportation lock-down and industries suspension, which significantly 13 influenced the ambient air quality and provided vary rare time windows to assess the 14 impacts of anthropological activities on air pollution. In this work, we divided the 15 studied timeframe (2019/12/24-2020/2/24) into four periods and selected 88 cities from 16 31 representative urban agglomerations. The indicators of PM2.5/PM10 and NO2/SO2 17 were applied, for the first time, to analyze the changes in stoichiometric characteristics 18 of ambient air pollutants pre-to post-COVID-19 in China. The results indicated that the 19 ratios of NO2/SO2 presented a responding decline, especially in YRD (-5.01), YH (-20 3.87), and MYR (-3.84), with the sharp reduction of traffic in post-COVID-19 periods 21 (P3-P4: 2.34\u00b10.94 m/m) comparing with pre-COVID-19 periods (P1-P2: 4.49\u00b12.03 22 m/m). Whereas the ratios of PM2.5/PM10 increased in P1-P3, then decreased in P4 with 23 relatively higher levels (>0.5) in almost all urban agglomerations. Furthermore, NO2 24 presented a stronger association with PM2.5/PM10 variation than CO; and PM2.5 with 25 NO2/SO2 variation than PM10. In summary, the economic structure, lockdown measures 26 and meteorological conditions could explain the noteworthy variations in different 27 urban agglomerations. These results would be in great help for improving air quality in 28 the post-epidemic periods. 29 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 19 in Shanghai. Chen et al. (2021) reported the effect of the restriction policies on 48 private vehicle reduced the air pollution levels to some extent during COVID-19. He et 49 al. (2017) focused on the impact of COVID-19 epidemic to NOx emissions and put 50 forward different control measures to different industries in reducing the NOx 51 emissions. However, the published work focused on the variation of the levels and the 52 spatio-temporal patterns for air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3) and the 53 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f study sites were almost local area, such as Tian Jin, (Zhang et al., 2020) Hu Bei, (Zhou 54 et al., 2020) and Jiang Xi (Wu et al., 2020) etc. The study on the change of air pollution 55 during this period using the ratios of PM2.5/PM10 and NO2/SO2 nationwide is still absent, 56 although the ratios of PM2.5/PM10 and NO2/SO2 has been widely used as indicators on 57 the source apportionment of PMs and gaseous pollutants, respectively. 58 Considering the difference of air pollution pre-and post-epidemic, 31 59 representative urban agglomerations (13 in northern areas and the rest in the southern 60 part of China, Table S1) including 88 cities nationwide were chosen in this work to 1) 61 understand the regional evolution trends of atmospheric pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 62 and SO2) using the indicators of PM2.5/PM10 and NO2/SO2 during different periods; 2) 63 identify the dominant factors driving the spatio-temporal patterns of air pollutants 64 during different periods. This work would be in great help in government strategy-65 making for air quality elevation in the post-epidemic periods. 66 Materials and Methods 67 Data description The daily air quality data (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO) of 88 cities 68 covering 31 urban agglomerations, from 24 December 2019 to 24 February 2020, were 69 provided by the China Air Quality Online Monitoring Platform 70 (https://www.aqistudy.cn/historydata/). The phenomenon of \"inversion\" between the 71 concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in some cities, the concentration of PM2.5 was higher 72 than that of PM10, which may be due to the fact that the concentrations of the two 73 particles were very close to each other, thus the measurement error causes the 74 \"inversion\", or different monitoring methods used by different instruments for PM2.5 75 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 93 Shenyang, Wuhai, Yinchuan and Shizuishan,1.8-1.12 in Wuhai, Yinchuan, Shizuishan 94 and Wuzhong and 1.26-2.1 in Hohhot, Baotou, Liaocheng, Anshan, Shenyang were 95 deleted. The detailed dates of the implementation of lockdown measures were 96 demonstrated in Figure 1. 97 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 109 Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of China. In terms of the four studied periods, 110 the concentrations of PM2.5 ranked as: P2 (76.02\u00b142.70 \u00b5g/m 3 ) > P1 (63.07\u00b128.60 111 \u00b5g/m 3 ) > P3 (56.83\u00b132.63 \u00b5g/m 3 ) > P4 (39.48\u00b115.71 \u00b5g/m 3 ), similar as PM10 (P2 112 (96.30\u00b149.97 \u00b5g/m 3 ) > P1 (87.49\u00b134.42 \u00b5g/m 3 ) > P3 (66.62\u00b136.38 \u00b5g/m 3 ) > P4 (60.23 113 \u00b125.64 \u00b5g/m 3 ) and CO (P2 (1.21\u00b10.41 mg/m 3 ) > P1 (1.14\u00b10.32 mg/m 3 ) > P3 (0.94\u00b1 114 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contribution of mobile sources for air pollutants was always found higher than 132 stationary sources in Chinese major cities (Song et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2018). 133 Accordingly, the higher NO2/SO2 ratio of 9.07\u00b12.67, 7.40\u00b11.17, 7.14\u00b11.76, 7.09\u00b1 134 1.03 and 6.69\u00b11.52 were observed in YRD, YH, CC, MYR and PRD (Figure 3a) 135 coupling with their GDP of 298.41, 66.24, 194.67, 149.96 and 362.61 billion dollars, 136 respectively (http://www.tjcn.org/). Comparatively, for some resource-dependent urban 137 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f It should also be noted that the role of NO2 decreasing was much more important than 355 CO and SO2 in the increasing PM2.5/PM10. This work would be in great help for 356 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 20 improving air quality in the post-epidemic periods.",

It suggested that gaseous pollutants 162 from anthropogenic emissions, mainly NO2, presented significant declining trend due 163 to the great reduction in the usage of vehicles (mobile sources) (Huang et al., 2012). As 164 the positive relationship between the recorded total passenger volume and the NO2/SO2 165 ratios (Figure 4b), the declined ratio could be partly resulted from the decreasing 166 number of automobiles. Meanwhile, most industries shut down during this period, 167 whereas, to maintain the normal life of the people, the operating livelihood industries 168 (such as electricity, heat, gas and water supply industries) and the innovation of 169 production technology and equipment in coal-chemical-cement-alkali kept the 170 relatively stable SO2 emission during the periods (P3: 2020.1.23-2020.2.9 and P4: 171 2020.2.10-2020.2.24) (Liang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021).

As the more prominent of urban . These urban agglomerations could not only emit PM directly but also influence the 205 atmospheric stability and humidity (53-99%) due to the concentrated industry parks 206 (e.g., developed manufacturing, petroleum refining industries) and intensive vehicle 207 parc (1.07, 0.97, 3.37 million, respectively, http://www.tjcn.org/). In addition, CO is208 regarded as the tracer of primary combustion source and the ratios of PM2.5/CO can be 209 used as the indicator of the secondary formation of PM2.5 across China (Song et al., 210 2017). In our work, higher ratios of PM2.5/CO were also observed in CZT(0.059\u00b1 211 0.012), YH(0.063\u00b10.014) and MYR(0.056\u00b10.010) (Figure 3c), suggesting more 212 contribution of secondary PM2.5 in these regions (Cheng et al., 2015; Le et al., 2020; 213 Liang et al., 2016; Srimuruganandam and Shiva Nagendra, 2011). Relatively, the urban 214 agglomerations of Lhasa (LS) was economic undeveloped regions (GDP: 8.35 billion 215 dollars) with lower pollutant discharge, YYR developing regions (GDP:14.67 billion 216 dollars) characterizing as a comprehensive industrial base with higher PMs emission 217 and unfavorable diffusion conditions (Guan et al., 2017), and PRD the economies-based 218 group (GDP: 363.74 billion dollars) dominated by light industry with lower pollution, 219 respectively (Liang et al., 2016). Thus, lower PM2.5/PM10 ratios of 0.48\u00b10.04, 0.56\u00b1 220 0.11 and 0.63\u00b10.09 were observed in the regions of LS, YYR and PRD, respectively 221 (Figure 3). Compared to P1, the significant influence of NO2 on PM2.5/PM10 was222 observed, followed by CO and SO2 (Figure 5d-5f). In addition, gaseous precursors (SO2, 223 NO2) emitted from coal-burning and vehicle exhausting could easily generate secondary aerosol through heterogeneous reactions under humid conditions, presenting 225 important impacts on regional PM2.5 formation (Tian et al., 2021), while CO was mainly 226 emitted by primary combustion (Zhang and Cao, 2015). Accordingly, secondary 227 generation has unneglectable effect on PM2.5/PM10 with the decreasing primary 228 emission source. 229 As expected, there dramatic increment (P1-P3) and sharp decrement (P3-P4) of 230 PM2.5/PM10 were observed through the campaign (Figure 2). By considering P1 as a 231 reference, most of urban clusters experienced various degrees rise in PM2.5/PM10 during 232 P2 (Figure 2), especially in YRD (0.18), YH (0.18), Surrounding Poyang Lake (SPL, 233 0.13), Hohhot-Baotou-Ordos (HBO, 0.14) and YYR (0.13) (Figure 3) due to the joint 234 effects of the Spring Festival transport season and meteorological conditions. As the 235 acceleration of industrialization and urbanization and the emergence of mega-cities 236 (e.g., YRD, YH, SPL and surroundings, GDP: 295.93, 65.66, 42.33 billion dollars, 237 respectively), high desire on workforce drove an influx of workers to economy or 238 resource-oriented cities, resulting in the frequent population movements and the 239 celebration of the Spring Festival in cities. Both the increase trends of PM2.5/PM10 240 associated with growing number of passenger volume (Figure 4a) and the increase of 241 PM2.5/SO2 in most urban clusters during P2 (Figure 3d) suggested more contribution of 242 traffic-related emission to fine particulate matter concentrations (Abu-Allaban et al., 243 2007; Art\u0131\u00f1ano et al., 2004). Meanwhile, the relative stable ratios of PM2.5/PM10 in 244 urban clusters located in southwestern of China (e. g. QH, PRD, CYN, and LS) were 245 attributed to the favorable weather conditions and low pollutants emission due to their trade-based or agriculture-based economy, which indicated the less effects of 247 transportation control measures on air quality (Liang et al., 2016; Zhang and Cao, 2015). 248 Compared with P1, although the concentrations of PMs decreased significantly, 249 higher ratios of PM2.5/PM10 (>0.7) and PM2.5/CO (0.058\u00b10.021) were observed during 250 the lock-down periods (P3) in almost all studied urban agglomerations (Figure 2). It 251 indicated that the effects of cites lock-down strategies directly decreased the primary 252 sources (vehicle or factory exhaust and road dust) (Abu-Allaban et al., 2007; Liang et 253 al., 2016), while ineffective on alleviation of secondary pollution. According to the 254 National Bureau of Statistics, the added value of 41 industries were significantly 255 decreased during the period of COVID-19. For example, mining industry, 256 manufacturing industry and supply industries (including the electricity, heat, gas, and 257 water production and livelihood industries etc.) fell by 6.5%, 15.7%, 7.1% from January 258 to February 2020, respectively (http://www.stats.gov.cn/). Despite the fact that the air 259 pollutants reduced dramatically in nationwide, the essential industries still kept running 260 to guarantee a good quality of livelihood coupling the inevitability of pollutants 261 emission. Moreover, although highway freight and passenger traffic decreased 262 dramatically in most provinces during the lock-down period, the relative high PMs were 263 also observed in Hubei-Henan (HH), Henan-Anhui (HA) etc. urban clusters (Figure S1), 264 the surrounding provinces of Hu Bei (HB), especially An Hui (AH), Hu Nan (HN), 265 Jiang Xi (JX), He Nan (HE) and Chong Qing (CQ) etc., which might be related to the 266 growing number of transportation activities of \"support Wuhan\" (Figure S3c). It could 267 be concluded that extreme restrictions had significant effects on reducing PMs levels, PRD, CYN and QH which were characterized by less influence of short-term 269 heavy traffic during P2. Besides, the northern urban agglomerations like YYR, Beijing-270 Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and HBO etc. were largely affected by traffic, industries and 271 meteorological factors (Shang et al., 2020). The concentrations of PMs negatively 272 correlated with WS indicating the predominant role in the dispersion of PM2.5 and PM10 273 (Figure S2) (Fan et al., 2021). While RH was one of the necessary conditions for the 274 formations of PM2.5 corresponding to its positive correlation with PMs (Figure S2) 275 (Cheng et al., 2015). 276 During the P4 period, the ratios of PM2.5/PM10 in most southern urban 277 agglomerations (>0.7) were higher than those of the north (<0.7) (Figure 2), reflecting 278 the strict lockdown measures were more effective for the alleviation of fine particles 279 pollution in northern cities. Compared with P3, the ratios of PM2.5/PM10 experienced a 280 continuous decline nationwide, especially in Guan Zhong (GZ) (-0.29), HBO (-0.31), 281 Central Plains (CR) (-0.28), Gansu (GS) (-0.28), YH (-0.24), MYR (-0.23) and HA (-282 0.18) (Figure 3), which associated with the increase of coarse particles in the dust from 283 the near-surface air and long-distance transportation according to the recorded wind 284 speed of 4.79\u00b10.48m/s (Bao and Zhang, 2020; Otmani et al., 2020). To be specific, 285 some cities, such as Shenyang, Qingdao, Shanghai, Changsha, Guangzhou, Beijing, 286 Nanjing and Chengdu etc. characterizing as low risk of the epidemic and large number 287 of small and medium-sized enterprises and private enterprises according to the Analysis 288 Report of Driving Activity Resumption Index released by AutoNavi Map, were in 289 urgent need of resumption of work and production to stabilize employment and 290 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f industrial chain. From 10th February, plenty of express delivery industries except for 291 China Post and Jingdong logistics which kept operating during the epidemic, and the 292 service industries such as the restaurants gradually returned to normal operation in full 293 swing. Accordingly, the increasing anthropogenic activities elevated the emission of 294 primary source from traffic and industrial gradually (Art\u0131\u00f1ano et al., 2004; Liang et al., 295 2016), resulting the decline of PM2.5/PM10. By contrast, Hubei, Hunan, Henan and other 296 high-risk provinces were still in super-strict control, resulting the decline of PM2.5/PM10 297 due to continuous decrease of traffic. Consistent with the trends of PM2.5/PM10, 298 significant decrease of PM2.5/SO2 were also found in HH (-5.65), HA (-5.27), MYR (-299 4.12) and CZT (-3.63) (Figure 3d), since the ratio of PM2.5/SO2 could serve as the 300 indicator to explore the effects of traffic to air pollution (Song et al., 2017). Meanwhile, 301 regional differences of PM2.5/PM10 were observed in P4-P1 (Figure 2). For instance, 302 they decreased strikingly in GZ (-0.18), HBO (-0.17), CR (-0.15), YH (-0.15) and CTZ 303 (-0.15) etc., while increased in CYN (0.22), PRD (0.12) and NN (0.14) etc. (Figure 2).304According the discussion above, it could be concluded that 1) although some certain 305 urban agglomerations were gradually recovering, they still have not returned to normal 306 operation; 2) counter-epidemic measures taken by Chinese government improved the 307 air quality to some extent.308The correlation between ratios309    Compared with different periods, PM2.5/PM10 showed a trend of increasing first and 310 then decreasing with the continuous decrease of NO2/SO2(Figure 5a). In detail, the role 311 of NO2 decreasing was much more important than CO decreasing, followed by SO2, in the increasing PM2.5/PM10(Figure 5d-5f), which may be related to the absence of motor313 vehicle traffic, suspend of some certain industries and continuity of essential industries 314 (Huang et al., 2012; Otmani et al., 2020). Meanwhile, PM2.5 varied more gently than 315 PM10 in decreasing NO2/SO2, which could be associated with extreme restriction policy 316 on transportation (automobile exhaust and road dust) (Bao and Zhang, 2020) and 317 secondary generation of particulate matters (Figure 5b-5c) (Manchanda et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Therefore, the relation between NO2 and PM2.5 was more unneglectable, the sharply319 reduction of NO2 could not only result in the decrease of nitrate generation, but also 320 added more possibility to generate sulfate aerosol in the case of insignificant change in 321 SO2 concentration with low temperature and high humidity (Le et al., 2020; Li et al., 322 2021). In addition, secondary inorganic aerosols contributed more to fine particulate 323 matters. Accordingly, the discussion above could explain the temporal increase in 324 PM2.5/PM10 with decreasing NO2/SO2 in P3. During P4, in general, NO2 and SO2 325 remind relatively constant with decreasing PM2.5/PM10 even if slight increase of NO2 326 concentration was observed in some certain cities, while the concentration of CO was 327 observed decreasing continuously (Figure 5d-5f), which could be resulted by the fact 328 that most cities were still in super-strict control though some cities resumed to normal 329 operation gradually. Furthermore, PM10 was observed no obvious decline but PM2.5 330 showed downward trend with slight increase of PM2.5/PM10 (Figure 5d-5f), which may 331 be attributed to the relatively stable concentrations of precursors like NOx and SO2 332 during this period compared with P3. Accordingly, the short-term restriction strategies 333 during the epidemic presented significant impacts on the levels and their stoichiometric characteristics of ambient air pollutants in China during COVIDwork, the indicators of PM2.5/PM10 and NO2/SO2 were applied, for the first time, 340 to analyze the changes in stoichiometric characteristics of ambient air pollutants pre-to 341 post-COVID-19 in 88 cities from 31 representative urban agglomerations in China. The 342 ratio of NO2/SO2 presented significant decreasing trends during P3-P4 compared with 343 P1-P2, suggesting that gaseous pollutants (mainly NO2) from anthropogenic emissions 344 presented significant declining trend due to the great reduction in the mobile sources. 345 The change of PM2.5/PM10 during the whole study period indicated the direct or indirect 346 effects on particular matters related to the frequency of human activities. Comparatively, 347 the increasing PM2.5/PM10 ratios during P2 was due to the joint effects of the Spring 348 Festival transport season and local meteorological conditions.
