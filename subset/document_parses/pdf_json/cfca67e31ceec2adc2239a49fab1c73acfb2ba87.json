On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization (WHO) designated coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) a global epidemic (6) . According to the WHO, frontline workers (FLWs) account for 10% of all COVID-19 clinically confirmed cases worldwide (7) . FLWs had higher chances of getting COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. This higher infection rate has been ascribed largely to the lack of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (8) . While some evidence suggests that the type of PPE may influence their level of protection against the COVID-19 infection (9, 10) , there is widespread agreement on the importance of using PPE (surgical masks, gloves, eye protection, helmets, and gowns) when caring for COVID-19 patients (11) . PPE is thus a crucial component of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Former research mainly focused on scrutinizing the environmental impacts of COVID-19 (15) . In this context, the first batch of studies concentrated on COVID-19 epidemiology (16, 17) . The second batch of studies recognized the essential factors that impact pandemic control (18, 19) . The third batch of studies evaluated the current state of disease profiles to develop precautionary measures (20, 21) , whereas the fourth batch of studies examined the effect of climatic variables on pandemic transmission (22, 23) . Despite former scholars' deep interest, assessing FLWs' intentions to use PPE is of prime importance. What makes FLWs different from health workers and paramedical staff in this study is the selection of respondents. Our sample of FLWs consist of respondents from Police, Rescue emergency service, non-profit organizations, and disaster management volunteer organizations. The rationale of targeting this specific segment is that there have already been many studies conducted examining the intention of health workers and paramedic staff regarding the acceptance and use of PPE (24) (25) (26) (27) . In this vein, FLWs is the only segment which has never been considered and studied in any context before. According to the authors' best knowledge, no research has been done in the perspective of Pakistan and this study is the first of its kind to examine FLWs' intention to use PPE. Thus, the findings generated based on such a sample provide a fair representation of the FLWs. The country is equipped with fewer infrastructure and healthcare resources than developed economies (28) . The country is the fifth most populous in the world (29) . The WHO reports that Pakistan may become the next COVID-19 hotspot unless adequate measures are taken (30) . Considering this discussion, this study investigates FLWs' intentions to use PPE in relation to the following critical questions: (i) What are the potential factors that might influence FLWs from using PPE during the COVID-19 epidemic? (ii) How do these factors manipulate the intention of FLWs to use PPE? Another reason for doing this research is to advance scholarly analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak, which other researchers have not extensively examined from the Pakistani viewpoint. To do this, three more elements have been added to the conceptual framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB).",

Secondly, the current study has added three novel aspects to the conceptual mechanism of TPB, as these aspects were never explored as potential determinants of FLWs' intention to use PPE in any context before. Finally, though the COVID-19 cases have decreased recently in Pakistan, the country is still facing several challenges to control the outbreak, including inadequate medical equipment, the high price of PPE, and the dependence on foreign countries for importing PPE. Other emerging countries are expected to face similar issues with the COVID-19. In this respect, Pakistan's situation would be seen as a representative framework for the rest of the nations to comprehend this prodigy. Additionally, the research outcomes will help other economies develop effective guidelines for the deployment of PPE in their own territories. To summarize, the current investigation preserves unique research findings in comparison to the existing pool of literature.",

Whenever there is some disaster anywhere in the country, these organizations play their volunteer role to cope with the chaotic situation. The fundamental rationale for selecting the FLWs is their frequent exposure to COVID-19 suspects and patients since FLWs have difficulties with social distancing measures. One of the reasons for the sample selection is that Islamabad is the capital city containing individuals belonging to all provinces, thus providing a heterogeneous population mix. Further, Punjab is the most populous province and involves more law enforcement agents to deal with COVID-19 containment.",

The analysis indicated that the AVE values for all constructs were higher than 0.50, specifying that all constructs retained a minimum of 50% of the variance. The findings are reported in Table 1 . Item's reliability was determined using Cronbach-\u03b1. The outcomes verified reliability as the values of Cronbach-\u03b1 exceeded the minimum acceptable level of 0.70 (49) .

Additionally, various fitness tests were performed to guarantee that the data was correctly fitted to the structural model. The results revealed that the values of all fit indices are according to the recommended criteria (53) . The structural paths of the constructs, such as ATD (H1; \u03b2 = 0.10, p < 0.01), RPP (H4; \u03b2 = 0.09, p < 0.05), and BPPE (H5; \u03b2 = 0.20, p < 0.01) stipulate that ATD, RPP, and BPPE significantly influence FLWs' intention to use PPE. Thus, we accepted hypotheses 1, 4, and 5. The constructs CPPE (H3; \u03b2 = \u22120.05, p < 0.01) and UPPE (H6; \u03b2 = \u22120.01, p < 0.001) negatively affects FLWs' intention to use PPE. Accordingly, we accepted hypotheses 3 and 6. Contrary to the formulated supposition, the structural path failed to support hypothesis 2 (H2; \u03b2 = 0.59), because the construct \"ECO\" does not have a significant influence on FLWs' intention to use PPE and thus rejected (see Table 3 ). (54), as they found that 52% of the nurses in their sample neglected to use PPE. Literature (40) identified that ECO positively influences intentions to use PPE. We predicted a similar pattern among Pakistani FLWs as well. However, the current study's findings have a negligible effect. A possible reason might be linked to the intentions for which FLWs use PPE. Unlike economies that focus on combating climate change and contribute actively to improving the environment (55, 56) , Pakistani people attach low priority to ecological problems during purchase decisions (57) (58) (59) . Another reason for this behavior is the lack of an effective policy structure. The government barely seeks to encourage residents to become conscious of environmental issues, their obligations, and active participation in environmental improvement. On the flip side, Ambigapathy et al. (60) noticed that, as the COVID-19 continues to evolve, the understanding of the pandemic is increasing among the general practitioners in Malaysia. This understanding leads to a positive environmental concern, ultimately shaping their intention to use PPE.",

Former research has established the critical impact of risk perceptions in determining public behavior during epidemics (45, 61) , which is consistent with our findings. Ahmad et al. (32) examined the perception-based elements that influence individuals' intentions to endorse COVID-19 prevention measures. The findings specified that risk perceptions significantly affect individuals' behavior to undertake outbreak control measures. This shows that improving awareness of the infection's seriousness, propensity, and lethality will increase their willingness to pursue epidemic preventive solutions. Hamamura and Park (62) contrasted PPE usage by Chinese, Japanese, and American respondents. The study concluded that Chinese and Japanese individuals utilize PPE more frequently than Americans. The likely reasons that may motivate FLWs to use PPE include a perceived risk of contracting the novel epidemic and preventing viral infections. The more acute FLWs' impressions of the pandemic's fatal elements are, the easier it will be to influence their decision to use PPE. On the contrary, Izhar et al. (63) conducted a survey in Pakistan to examine the risk perceptions of COVID-19 and satisfaction with preventive measures among maternity care providers in Pakistan. The authors obtained some contrasting findings, as the risk perception of the pandemic was low among their sample. These respondents opined that COVID-19 is less contagious than tuberculosis, flu, and food poisoning. One major reason for this behavior might be that Pakistan is a developing country where tuberculosis is rampant and safe drinking water is not readily available.",

These findings support earlier researches in which scholars identified that people make purchases by looking the advantages of the goods they select to buy (64, 65) .

One possible explanation is that, as Pakistani FLWs' understanding of environmental and health issues is growing, they are mounting positive beliefs toward PPE as a means of resolving these issues. On the other hand, certain barriers, including lack of awareness, social norms, self-effectiveness, impede PPE usage intentions. Besides, lack of advertisement form government on the comprehensive benefits of PPE usage during the pandemic also impact public BPPE. The research findings indicate that UPPE has a detrimental effect on FLWs' intention to use PPE, which is consistent with the previous research of (44) . Among the various factors discouraging FLWs from using PPE are the complexity and efforts associated with getting PPE in the specific FLWs' workplace region. In addition, because PPE acceptance and usage are still in their infancy in the country, FLWs are hesitant to adopt them. The convenience and availability of PPE would serve as important dynamics in fostering more trust in PPE usage. The previous understanding of using PPE may affect the FLWs' intentions in a manner that a pleasant experience (in the form of easy access) permits the acceptance of PPE, whereas a bad experience leads to rejection.",

Firstly, the country has a poor economic condition. The import of expensive PPE has placed a substantial burden on the national economy. Besides, there is high uncertainty about the future supply of PPE, especially if a new outbreak happens in the country. Secondly, as evidenced by research results, FLWs in Pakistan give little priority to environmental concerns, making it very difficult to accept and utilize PPE. Thirdly, the country has an integrated social system where all ethnic groups have a shared system of meaning, language, and culture. Consequently, people mostly follow the ideas of peers, celebrities, friends, and social groups. Finally, contrary to countries where people have experienced severe outbreaks like the SARS-CoV epidemic in China, H1N1 swine flu in North America, and the Chikungunya epidemic in Italy, Pakistani people have never faced such critical circumstances before. Therefore, awareness among FLWs regarding the benefits of using PPE is low compared to these countries. The use of print and electronic media to stress COVID-19's deadly characteristics might be handy in this respect. Due to less supply, PPE is costly in the country, and pharmacies demand exorbitant rates. The government should ensure that PPE is available at a fair price, give financial assistance, and conduct frequent price monitoring.",

            "text": "Though the results of this study are generally consistent with the theoretical predictions and have important implications for practitioners, the present work is not without limitations. Firstly, the questionnaire survey has missed a principal fraction of FLWs, i.e., Health workers, Paramedic staff, etc. Potential researchers can make their survey more representative by including this fraction in subsequent studies. Secondly, the data collection is carried out only in the federal capital and two provinces of the country without considering less developed and rural regions. Socio-economic characteristics, such as education, and income, differ considerably between urban and rural regions. This limitation can be overcome by including rural FLWs as participants in future studies. Finally, the linkage between attitude and perceived benefits of PPE was not found in the current study. Scholars can tackle this issue by directing studies to see this vital linkage.",

In the same vein, Johnson and Hariharan (37) uncovered a favorable impact of attitude on the intention to use PPE. The results of these studies comply with our findings. Due to the current COVID-19 outbreak, most FLWs recognize that PPE can assist reduce disease transmission and aid in managing health dilemmas. In Pakistan, knowledge of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus is increasing, which will have a greater impact on FLWs' intention to use PPE in the future. However, in some under-developed countries, people do not have adequate knowledge about the severity and the consequences of the pandemic. Consequently, they are less concerned about the viral infections and possess an unfavorable attitude toward PPE usage. This aspect is in line with the study of",
