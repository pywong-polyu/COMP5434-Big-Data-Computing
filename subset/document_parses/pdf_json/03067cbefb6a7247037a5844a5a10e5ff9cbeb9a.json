            "text": "The COVID-19 disease for Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has turned out to be a global pandemic. The high transmission rate of this pathogenic virus demands an early prediction and proper identification for the subsequent treatment. However, polymorphic nature of this virus allows it to adapt and sustain in different kinds of environment which makes it difficult to predict. On the other hand, there are other pathogens like SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Dengue, and Influenza as well, so that a predictor is highly required to distinguish them with the use of their genomic information. To mitigate this problem, in this work COVID-DeepPredictor is proposed on the framework of deep learning to identify an unknown sequence of these pathogens. COVID-DeepPredictor uses Long Short Term Memory as Recurrent Neural Network for the underlying prediction with an alignment-free technique. In this regard, k-mer technique is applied to create Bag-of-Descriptors (BoDs) in order to generate Bag-of-Unique-Descriptors (BoUDs) as vocabulary and subsequently embedded representation is prepared for the given virus sequences. This predictor is not only validated for the dataset using K-fold cross-validation but also for unseen test datasets of SARS-CoV-2 sequences and sequences from other viruses as well. To verify the efficacy of COVID-DeepPredictor, it has been compared with other state-of-the-art prediction techniques based on Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Method. COVID-DeepPredictor achieves 100% prediction accuracy on validation dataset while on test datasets, the accuracy ranges from 99.51 to 99.94%. It shows superior results over other prediction techniques as well. In addition to this, accuracy and runtime of COVID-DeepPredictor are considered simultaneously to determine the value of k in k-mer, a comparative study among k values in k-mer, Bag-of-Descriptors (BoDs), and Bag-of-Unique-Descriptors (BoUDs) and a comparison between COVID-DeepPredictor and Nucleotide BLAST have also been performed. The code, training, and test datasets used for COVID-DeepPredictor are available at http:// www.nitttrkol.ac.in/indrajit/projects/COVID-DeepPredictor/.",

RNA viruses generally have very high mutation rates (Jenkins et al., 2002; Woo et al., 2009) . Genetic mutation can occur infrequently between viruses of the same species but of divergent lineages. The resulting mutated viruses may sometimes cause an outbreak of infection in humans e.g., the case of SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus results from zoonotic transmission to human and shows symptoms of pneumonia, fever, and breathing difficulties (Guan et al., 2003; Alagaili et al., 2014) . Human to human transmission has also been confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) .

Furthermore, another study (Wan et al., 2020) has shown that spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 binds with host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), just like other Sarbecovirus strains, thus making the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bat very likely (Letko et al., 2020; Liu and Wang, 2020) .",

            "text": "As the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the other viruses of the same family, and it shows similar symptoms like them, the early prediction of SARS-CoV-2 is a very challenging task. Ozturk et al. (2020) have used deep neural networks with X-ray images for automated detection of SARS-CoV-2 cases. The results show that the method has a prediction accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes (COVID vs. No-Findings) and 87.02% for multiple classes (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia) . Another work (Yan Q. et al., 2020) where deep learning has been used to predict agerelated macular degeneration (AMD) which is a leading cause of blindness among the elderly population. The results show an average area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.85. On the other hand, the authors in Koohi-Moghadam et al. (2019) have used deep learning approach to predict disease-associated mutation of metal-binding sites in proteins. The prediction results depict AUC as 0.90 and an accuracy of 0.82. These encouraging results show that deep learning has the potential for highly accurate prediction. This led us to devise a predictor based on deep learning which uses genomic sequences of pathogenic viruses. In this work, a deep learning technique, viz. COVID-DeepPredictor based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Tang et al., 2019) is developed. Though, LSTM has been profusely used in many works for text classification (Jin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019) , to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to use LSTM for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 using genomic sequences of virus considering alignment-free approach. For this purpose, k-mer technique is used to generate Bag-of-Descriptors (BoDs) and consequently Bag-of-Unique-Descriptors (BoUDs) as vocabulary. Subsequently embedded representation is prepared for the given virus sequences using BoDs and BoUDs. It is worth mentioning that, though SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, the genomic information of a virus is captured in the form of DNA sequence. These DNA sequences are used in this work to predict SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic viruses viz. SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Dengue, and Influenza. COVID-DeepPredictor achieves 100% prediction accuracy on validation dataset while on test datasets, the accuracy ranges from 99.51 to 99.94%. COVID-DeepPredictor also shows superior results over the existing prediction techniques based on Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Method. Moreover, apart from prediction accuracy, critical analysis like the choice of k in k-mer by considering the accuracy and runtime of COVID-DeepPredictor simultaneously, a comparative study of Bag-of-Descriptors (BoDs) and Bagof-Unique-Descriptors (BoUDs) for different values of k and a comparison between an alignment-based technique viz. Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN) and COVID-DeepPredictor as alignment-free technique.",

The main components of an LSTM network are sequence input layer and an LSTM layer. A sequence input layer provides text as an input into the LSTM network. An LSTM layer learns long-term association between steps of sequence data. Elaborately speaking, an LSTM network acquires a context vector from previous time step and an input vector from the given data. This is used to calculate the next context and gate vectors to control memory cell state vector (Kim et al., 2018) . With an input data at time t and a context vector h, a raw cell vector and input vectors for each gate are created by one hidden layer. At the input gate, the cell vector is then multiplied by the input vector. The cell input is added to given previous cell vector weighted by the forget vector. Then the resultant vector is controlled by the output vector. The update of the cell is controlled by the control gate. LSTM is mainly trained using Back-propagation Through Time and mitigates the vanishing gradient problem that is quite rampant in RNN. In LSTM, the memory cells and the gates can store time and thus can eliminate old observations overcoming vanishing gradient problem.",

Here, descriptors are patterns of the genomic sequences of length k. Thereafter, Bag-of-Unique-Descriptors (BoUDs) as vocabulary are created using such BoDs. With the use of BoDs and BoUDs, an embedded representation is created of size N \u00d7 M where N is the number of genomic sequences and M is the indices of the descriptors in vocabulary. This embedded representation is then used to train COVID-DeepPredictor. Since we have divided the genomic sequences into descriptors and represented in the form of tokens, they behave like texts, thus boiling down to a text classification problem.

LDA is a very popular machine learning tool for prediction. In LDA, each dependent variable is expressed as a linear combination of other features. RFs are ensemble learning methods which build numerous decision trees during training and as an output produces the class that is the mode of the classes. GBM is also an ensemble learning model which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble weak prediction models, usually decision trees. For conducting the experiments, first and foremost, we need to determine the value of k in k-mer. In order to do this, the experiments have been conducted on five test datasets as mentioned in section 2. The results are shown in Figures 3A-E, where k is varied from 3 to 15 with accuracy and running time of COVID-DeepPredictor. It can be seen from figures that the accuracy is higher at k = 3 for all the five test datasets. Although, the same accuracy can be found for other k values as well, e.g., in Figure 3A k = 9, 11, and 13 show the same accuracy, as we increase the k-mer value, the run time increases. This trend of increasing time with the increasing value of k-mer has also been shown in Solis-Reyes et al. (2018) . Keeping this in context, we have taken the value of k in k-mer to be 3 as with this value, the run time is least. For the compared predictors based on LDA, RF, and GBM, the k values are similarly determined as 13, 4, and 4, respectively. In this work, K-fold cross-validation with K = 10 is used. The average results in terms of accuracy for the test datasets are shown in Figure 4A . Moreover, apart from accuracy, different metrics such as precision, recall and g-mean have also been computed for the test datasets and reported in Table 2 . As can be seen from the results of Figure 4A , for COVID-DeepPredictor the accuracy ranges from 99.51 to 99.94%. Thus, the experiments establish the fact that COVID-DeepPredictor can detect SARS-CoV-2 with a very high accuracy. The confusion matrices as circos plots for Testdata-1 and Testdata-2 (k = 3) are shown in Figures 4B,C. It can be seen from Figures 4B,C that there is only one misprediction, where SARS-CoV-1 has been wrongly predicted as SARS-CoV-2. The confusion matrices for Testdata-3, Testdata-4, and Testdata-5 (k = 3) are shown in Supplementary Figure 2 .",

COVID-DeepPredictor can be used by pathogen laboratories for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 very quickly and as concluded from the results, most accurately.

Similarly, new training and test datasets can be prepared by the users after following the same structures of the training and testing files as provided. This is important so that new training models of COVID-DeepPredictor can be prepared for different set of viruses or similar kind of tasks. It is to be noted that the pre-trained model is provided in Supplementary Material, where the value of k for k-mer is 3. The choice of k has been done experimentally as it takes computationally less amount of time and provides higher accuracy. Sample files for training, testing, pre-trained models for COVID-DeepPredictor and the code of the software are available in Supplementary Material for re-usability 3 . Setting the appropriate value of k in k-mer is very important to achieve the desired results in a text classification problem. As this work is based on the underlying concept of text classification, k-mer has a very important role to play. Thus, to determine the value of k in k-mer, extensive experiments have been performed. It can be observed from Figures 3A-E that with the increasing value of k, the run time of COVID-DeepPredictor is also on the rise. Therefore, to choose the appropriate value of k, apart from the accuracy, the run time of COVID-DeepPredictor also needs to be taken into account. For Testdata-1, at k = 9, 11, and 13, the accuracy is same as at k = 3. Similarly, for Testdata-2, Testdata-3, Testdata-4, and Testdata-5, similar accuracies can be observed at k = 3, 11, 13, k = 3, 4, 5, 13, k = 3, 4, and k = 3, 13, respectively. Although, the accuracies are same at these k-mer values, run time is increasing as can been seen from Figures 3A-E . Thus, the smallest k-mer value has been chosen without compromising on the accuracy. From Table 2 and Figure 4A , it is quite evident that with k = 3, COVID-DeepPredictor shows the best results among all the compared predictors.",

From this table, we can see that the sizes of both BoDs and BoUDs increase with the increase in k-mer for each virus class. In the table, \"All\" represents all the six virus classes taken together. For example, at k = 15 for training dataset of all virus classes, the sizes of BoDs and BoUDs are 30193594 and 518372, respectively for 1,500 sequences while for the same k, for Testdata-1, the sizes of BoDs and BoUDs are 70595908 and 581774 respectively for 3,143 sequences. On the other hand, for k = 3, less number of BoDs and BoUDs are generated. Here, as expected, the BoD values for \"All\" are the summation of the BoDs of the individual virus classes. On the contrary, BoUD is less than the summation of the BoUDs of the six virus classes. This can be attributed to the relatedness between different virus classes. For example, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are more related and thus they may share unique descriptors (BoUDs) resulting in the intersection of the BoUDs when all the virus classes are considered together. Apart from this, BoDs and BoUDs for the varying k have also an impact on the accuracy and run time of COVID-DeepPredictor as well which can be observed by combining Figure 3 and Table 3 .",

Most analysis based works attempted so far have used alignment based techniques. Although, they are highly successful in detecting similarities in sequences of viruses, they take a lot of computational time. Also, alignment based techniques have the underlying constraint of homologous sequences which may not be the case every time. To mitigate these problems of alignment (Kari et al., 2015) can be used. Alignment-free techniques are meant to be fast and can work with a large number of sequences. To prove the advantage of COVID-DeepPredictor over BLASTN 4 , which is an alignment-based technique, Table 4 is reported where different input sequences of size 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 of SARS-CoV-2 are taken. For 50 sequences, BLASTN takes 1 h 15 min to align the sequences and to produce the subsequent results. Thereafter, such results are further required to be analyzed by machine intelligence technique to predict the virus class which takes some additional time as well. On the contrary, COVID-DeepPredictor successfully completes the job of training and testing, which involves prediction, in just 1.26 min. Similar results are also seen for the other varying sequences as well. Thus, we can conclude that an alignment-free technique is significantly faster than an alignment based technique.",

However, polymorphic nature of SARS-CoV-2 allows it to adapt and sustain in different kinds of environment which makes SARS-CoV-2 very hard to predict. In such scenarios, the proposed COVID-DeepPredictor can be very useful for predicting SARS-CoV-2 and other kinds of pathogenic viruses based on their genomic information very quickly as it uses an alignment-free technique. The results for COVID-DeepPredictor are highly encouraging as it shows prediction accuracy in the range of 99.51 to 99.94% for test datasets. Human health being the main concern of this work, the code for COVID-DeepPredictor along with the pre-trained model are also provided so that the scientific community can reap as much benefit as possible from it. Apart from SARS-CoV-2, COVID-DeepPredictor can also be used by pathogen laboratories to recognize the other five pathogenic viruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Dengue, and Influenza) very easily and accurately from a given genomic sequence. To achieve good performance, data preprocessing and the experiments are carried out on real-life datasets. Moreover, comparisons with popular existing prediction methods based on Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Method are also performed to show the superiority of COVID-DeepPredictor. Additionally, accuracy and runtime of COVID-DeepPredictor are taken together to determine the value of k in k-mer, comparison among k values in k-mer, Bag-of-Descriptors (BoDs) and Bag-of-Unique-Descriptors (BoUDs) is considered along with a comparative study between COVID-DeepPredictor and Nucleotide BLAST.",
