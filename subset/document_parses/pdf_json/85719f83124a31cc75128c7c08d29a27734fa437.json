            "text": "Gene therapy is now an effective approach to treat many forms of retinal degeneration. Delivery agents that are cell-specific, allow for multiple dosing regimens, and have low immunogenicity are needed to expand the utility of gene therapy for the retina. We generated eight novel lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) ranging in size from 50 nm to 150 nm by changing the PEG content from 5% to 0.5%, respectively. Subretinal injections of LNP-mRNA encoding luciferase revealed that 0.5% PEG content within nanoparticles elicits the highest expression. Similar injections of LNP delivered cre mRNA into Ai9 mice revealed cell-specific protein expression in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), confirmed by fundus photography and immunohistochemistry of whole globe cross-sections. To investigate mechanisms of LNP delivery to the eye, we injected mCherry mRNA using the subretinal approach in apoE -/and Mertk -/mice. RPE transfection was observed in both mouse models suggesting that LNP intracellular delivery is not solely dependent on apolipoprotein adsorption or phagocytosis. To investigate LNP penetration, particles were delivered to the vitreous chamber via an intravitreal injection. The 0.5% PEG particles mediated the highest luciferase activity and expression was observed in the M\u00fc ller glia, the optic nerve head and the trabecular meshwork, but failed to reach the RPE. Overall, particles containing less PEG (~150 nm in size) mediated the highest expression in the eye. Thus far, these particles successfully transfect RPE, M\u00fc ller cells, the optic nerve head and the trabecular meshwork based on route of administration which can expand the utility of LNP-mediated gene therapies for the eye.",

            "text": "Despite major advancements in restoring vision, there are still an estimated 285 million vision-impaired and 39 million blind people around the world [1] . In part, these large numbers exist because there are still no treatments for some of the most devastating blinding diseases including advanced glaucoma, atrophic macular degeneration, advanced diabetic retinopathy, myopia, and inherited retinal degeneration [1] . These disorders have become the focus of ocular gene therapy and effective treatments are being developed. For and internalization in the retina post-intravitreal injection are needed to rationally design enhanced nanotherapeutics. Upon characterizing many of the intravitreal nanoparticles developed thus far and assessing their effectiveness, four main parameters continuously affect their intraocular distribution and elimination: size, charge, stability and ligands [17] . It has been demonstrated that size affects the half-life of intravitreally injected nanoparticles. Specifically, for polystyrene nanoparticles smaller particles sizes~50 nm had the highest half-life [21] . Furthermore, size impacts the process for internalization. In general, particles <500 nm are internalized via endocytosis, whereas particles >1000 nm utilize phagocytosis [22, 23] . Stability and size are often linked as the particle size varies upon disassembly or aggregation of the particles. If nanoparticles are unstable, they will fall apart upon entry, and the dissociated components can be rapidly eliminated [24] . Thus, particles need to be stable enough to travel to the cell of interest, but then have the ability to disassemble once internalized in the cell of interest. It has been shown that the hydrophilic polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is a commonly used excipient to increase in vivo stability, evade recognition by the reticuloendothelial system, prolong circulation half-life and reduce immunogenicity, can be easily adjusted to impact particle size, stability and intracellular delivery [25] . To evaluate the important parameters of size and stability for intravitreal delivery, we generated 8 novel LNPs that varied in size by changing mol % of PEG. We found that larger particles (~150 nm), containing less PEG-lipid (0.5%), mediated the highest levels of gene expression post-subretinal and intravitreal delivery. Most intriguingly, these particles successfully transfect RPE, M\u00fcller glia, the optic nerve head and the trabecular meshwork based on route of administration which can expand the utility of LNP-mediated gene therapies for the eye.",

For intravitreal injections, 2.5% hypromellose was placed over the eye and a 30-gauge needle was used to make an incision in the limbus. Going through the scleral incision in the limbus, using a hamilton syringe with a 33-gauge 20\u02dabeveled needle, 1.5 \u03bcl of PBS, LNP-Luciferase, LNP-Cre or LNP-mCherry was delivered to the vitreous chamber. A 2% fluorescein solution was added to the PBS or LNPs so injection quality could be observed and documented. For subretinal injections, 200 ng (1 \u03bcl, 200 ng/\u03bcl) of mRNA was delivered. For intravitreal injections, a low dose of 300 ng (1.5 \u03bcl, 200 ng/\u03bcl) of mRNA was evaluated first. To maximize mRNA delivery, particles were concentrated to~1000 ng/\u03bcl and a high dose of 1.5 \u03bcg (1.5 \u03bcl, 1000 ng/\u03bcl) of mRNA was delivered.",

At 24 hours post-injection, 0.5% PEG particles with corresponding cholesterol modifications demonstrated significant 1.9-fold, 5.2-fold and 18.9-fold increases in luciferase activity compared to 1.5%, 3% and 5% PEG particles, respectively (Fig 2B, p<0 .05).

Although 0.5% PEG particles showed at 2.3-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to 3% PEG particles, this difference was not significant due to the variation in activity meditated by the 3% PEG particles (Fig 3B) .

To determine if this mechanism plays a role in LNP uptake in the RPE, the FDA approved LNPs (MC3, DSPC, DMG-PEG2k, and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 50:10:1.5:38.5) containing luciferase mRNA were subretinally injected into apoE -/mice (Fig 4A and 4B ).

Even though there are over 20 gene therapy clinical trials utilizing viral vectors for retinal degenerations [4] , it is well understood that viral vectors are unable to solely treat all of the genetic forms of retinal degeneration due to cost, packaging capacity and immune response [5] . Additionally, generating penetrating particles that can transfect the outer retina post-intravitreal delivery would generate a paradigm shift moving away from detaching fragile degenerating retinas during subretinal surgery. To optimize the existing FDA approved LNPs for the retina, studies are needed that investigate pharmacokinetics and intracellular mechanisms of LNPs post-ocular delivery. Our studies, first evaluating many cationic and ionizable lipids [13] , and now investigating the impacts of size and PEGylation, aim to understand the critical LNP components needed for optimal retina internalization and penetration to the eye. In this paper, we show that particles with less PEG (0.5%) and larger in size (~150 nm) facilitate the highest levels of protein expression post-subretinal and intravitreal delivery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that neither apoE adsorption, nor MERTK dependent phagocytosis are critical for LNP intracellular delivery to the RPE. Finally, we demonstrate that our LNPs can transfect M\u00fcller glia, the ONH and the TM post-intravitreal delivery which could have significant impacts for retinal degeneration and glaucoma.",

Our data suggests that particles with 0.5% PEG and~150 nm in size facilitate the best intracellular delivery in the RPE post-subretinal delivery (Figs 2 and 3) . These data are consistent with previous studies that demonstrate 1) LNPs with 0.5 mol % PEG-DMA mediated the highest FVII gene silencing in hepatocytes [25, 30] and 2) that while increasing the PEG content makes particles smaller it also makes them more stable [31, 32] . We hypothesize that the 3% and 5% particles aren't shedding enough PEG-lipid to allow for sufficient cellular uptake, which is inhibiting the transfection efficiency. In addition, the enhanced efficiency observed with 0.5% PEG particles is most likely due to a combination of particle size and surface composition. Larger particle size allows for more mRNA encapsulation per particle, whereas the mol % of PEG on the particle surface impacts protein adsorption and disassembly for endosomal escape [26, 27] . Interestingly, when comparing DSPC versus cholesterol modifications, increasing DPSC content on the particle surface increased expression by 6-fold. We hypothesize that by decreasing the mol % of PEG and increasing surface DSPC, protein adsorption is enhanced allowing for more efficient internalization [30] . Previous studies established an apoE-LDLR dependent internalization pathway for LNP-mediated expression in the liver after systemic delivery [27] . Successful RPE transfection in apoE -/mice after subretinal delivery of LNP-mCherry suggests that apoE, an essential endogenous targeting ligand for the liver, is not required for LNP internalization in the RPE. Since the subretinal injection delivers the LNPs to the RPE, it's possible that targeting ligands are unnecessary, or alternatively, there are still unknown RPE specific ligands facilitating cellular entry. We also hypothesized that phagocytosis could be playing a role in LNP uptake in the RPE. However, the LNP-mediated expression observed in Mertk -/mice, which lack the main receptor required for phagocytosis [29] , post-subretinal injection did not support this hypothesis.

We hypothesized that smaller particles would allow for penetration from the vitreous chamber to the RPE. However, our data showed that larger particles (~80 nm to 150 nm in size) mediated a higher magnitude of expression than smaller particles (~50 nm to 60 nm in size) and transfection was limited to the inner retina and did not reach the outer retina (more discussion on cellular tropism below) (Figs 5 and 6). As stated above, it's feasible that increasing the PEG content increases stability and decreases cellular uptake, which is inhibiting the transfection efficiency. Future studies can focus on generating smaller particles through microfluidic processing instead of increasing PEG content to separate these confounding factors of size and stability. Interestingly, when comparing surface modifications, increasing the mol % of cholesterol mediated an~3-fold (at 24 hours) and~8-fold (at 48 hours) increase in magnitude of expression compared to DSPC. Although cholesterol has been closely linked to enhancing endosomal escape [33] , our data suggest that in the retina having more cholesterol potentially on the surface could enhance penetration, which could be linked to protein adsorption as the particle moves through the retina. It is well understood that LNP size, stability, surface charge and ligands will all work together to generate penetrating LNPs [17] . We now add that surface composition including mol % of cholesterol is an important determinant and that 1.5 mol % of PEG or less is crucial for penetration in the eye.",

Post-subretinal delivery, all expression was observed in the RPE, which we have previously reported (Figs 2-4) [13] . The OLM, which has an~30 Angstr\u00f6m pore radius (in rabbits), is a junction between the M\u00fcller glia and the outer nuclear layer (ONL) which acts as a barrier to the inner retina post-subretinal delivery [16] . It is possible that our smallest particle (~50 nm in size) was still unable to traverse the OLM to allow for transfection in the ONL. When we transitioned to intravitreal delivery, the M\u00fcller glia, the ONH and the TM were successfully transfected regardless if particles were 150 nm or 50 nm. Although the ILM prevents penetration into the retina, the M\u00fcller glia endfeet sit at the interface of the vitreous humor and the ILM and are susceptible to LNP uptake. M\u00fcller glia are a critical therapeutic target for retinal degeneration. With the recent success of reprogramming M\u00fcller glia into functional rod photoreceptors, M\u00fcller glia remain key targets for regenerating the retina [34, 35] . Although the ONH sits at the back of the eye, the ILM is not part of the ONH composition and it becomes thinner as the retinal interface gets closer to the ONH, which decreases the difficulty of transducing the ONH.

Coincidently, by generating better penetrating LNPs, we will be able to enhance transfection efficiency after other important ocular delivery methods for retinal degeneration including subretinal and suprachoroidal delivery [39] . Decreasing particle size by increasing PEG content failed to improve LNP penetration. Instead, the use of 0.5% or 1.5% PEG is optimal for retinal transfection. In the future, we will generate smaller particles without the addition of PEG. Furthermore, solely adjusting the LNP composition (PEG, cholesterol, DSPC, ionizable lipid) may not be enough to alter the LNP transfection profile. The discovery and addition of RPE and photoreceptor targeted ligands may be required to generate LNPs that can penetrate through the vitreous. Our future studies will focus on the generate of these novel ligands and understanding the critical LNP characteristics required for effective retinal transfection. ",
