We decided not to discontinue lenvatinib treatment and daily monitoring of vital signs was performed, including blood pressure, body temperature, and oxygen saturation. The evaluation of adverse events (AEs) and the patient's clinical condition was carried out by telemedicine. Due to the low severity of symptoms, chest imaging was not performed. The patient performed a new nasopharyngeal swab 21 days after the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and tested negative. Despite our concerns, we observed no severe respiratory, gastrointestinal, or hematopoietic complications, and the patient needed neither specific therapy for COVID-19 nor lenvatinib interruption or discontinuation for the full course of the intercurrent disease.",

Careful monitoring of both COVID-19 symptoms and anti-cancer treatment associated AEs are important for assessing treatment continuation. To date, this is the first reported case of a lenvatinib-treated patient who developed COVID-19, with the patient able to continue treatment without experiencing any additional AEs. As data are limited, this report is an important indicator of the safety of continuing lenvatinib treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be more widely generalized to patients with COVID-19 infections for other cancer types receiving anticancer treatments.",
