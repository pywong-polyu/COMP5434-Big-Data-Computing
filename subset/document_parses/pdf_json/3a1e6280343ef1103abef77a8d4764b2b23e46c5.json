We also gained experience in triaging the needs of patients in a way that would have been inconceivable a few months earlier. Some previously planned procedures and surgeries were put on pause in order to accommodate the surge of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Between the first and second wave, we had the opportunity to realize the effect of the pandemic and to meet the \"hidden victims\" of COVID-19: those patients who were afraid to go to the doctor and would arrive with massive complications or with advanced disease that required urgent management. Furthermore, in 2021, we will encounter an important backlog from 2020 that will mandate us prioritizing services.",

Many more have suffered from the consequences of COVID-19, both physically, with the impact the pandemic had on the health sector and the economy, and the mental impact of isolation, bereavement, and uncertainty.
