Most of the industries within the catchment area of river Damodar have been closed; as a result, significant changes have been reflected throughout the stretch of river Damodar. The main objective of the study is to analyze the impact of lockdown on the water quality of river Damodar. A total of 55 samples was collected from eleven different confluence sites of nallas with the main river channel during and pre-lockdown period. The relevant methods like WQI, TSI, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and \"t\" test have been applied to evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological status of river water. The result of \"t\" test indicated that there are significant differences (\u03b1 = 0.05) of each parameter between pre and during lockdown. Water quality index (WQI) is used for analysis of drinking water quality suitability followed by BIS. The values of WQI showed \"very poor\" (S1, S2, S3, S6, S7, and S11) to \"unfit for drinking\" (S4, S5, S8, S9, and S10) of river water during pre-monsoon season. The nutrient enrichment status of the river was analyzed by Trophic State Index (TSI) method and it shows the \"High\" eutrophic condition with a heavy concentration of algal blooms in almost an entire stretch. During lockdown, nutrient supplies like TN and TP have been reduced and is designated as \"Low\" (S1, S2) to \"Moderate\" (S3 to S11) eutrophic condition of middle stretch of Damodar. This research output of river Damodar will definitely assist to policy makers for sustainable environmental management despite the dilemma between development and conservation.",

This virus mainly transmits through coughing, sneezing, saliva, and spit of the affected person to another person. At the end of March 2020, over one million positive cases and 50,000 deaths have been reported from different corners of the globe (Dutheil et al. 2020; Han et al. 2020; Isaifan 2020) . Simultaneously, eighteen million people were affected by the deadly Coronavirus within the 1st week of August 2020. World Health Organization (WHO) declared this pandemic as an International Emergency of Public Health (Kambalagere 2020; Sohrabi et al. 2020 ). Scientists of all over the world are continuously trying to find out its antidote or vaccine but desirable results are still elusive. Therefore, to reduce the rapid transmission of COVID-19, maintenance of social distance and face mask is the only way during this critical time. Probably the first time in the world's history, many affected countries have declared \"lockdown\" or shutdown of their public, educational, industrial, and business sectors to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. Sudden declaration of lockdown very badly harmed the economic sector while the health of the total environment has been improved due to limited anthropogenic actions (Beine et al. 2020; Ray et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Bera et al. 2020) . Several studies on environmental quality have been conducted in different parts of the world, and it showed that the ecological restoration has been significantly retrieved (Ma et al. 2020; Yongjian et al. 2020; Sharma et al. 2020a ; Gautam and Hens 2020; Bera et al. 2020) .",

Many relevant studies have also been conducted on the quality of surface water bodies in different sites of India, and it demonstrated that the water parameters like pH, DO, BOD, and TC have been notably enhanced (Dhar et al. 2020; Chakraborty et al. 2020b; Mukherjee et al. 2020) . Water quality is the assessment of an individual as well as all the parameters is associated with it. The influence of every individual parameter to the overall quality and the total influence of all parameters collectively determine the state of water quality for its definite use. Water quality index (WQI) is a very effective tool to select adequate treatment techniques (Rana et al. 2018) . Similarly, it determines the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of the water Ganguly 2020a, 2020b) . Here, WQI comprises of sub-indices allotted to each parameter as per its importance and all together of sub-indices expressed in a single value which is indicating water quality (Sharma et al. 2020b) . The WQI method is widely used by many researchers for the assessment of water quality in different parts of the world (Swami and Tyagi 2000; Kanakiya et al. 2015; Dwivedi and Pathak 2007; Mukherjee et al. 2012; Selvam et al. 2014; Hou et al. 2016) . Quality of water is also indicated by the health as well as the growth of plants and aquatic animals in the aquatic ecosystem or environment. Subsequently, Trophic State Index (TSI) is a numerical expression of the tropic status of the water body. It was first developed by Carlson (1977) and further modified by Burns et al. (2005) by adding total nitrogen (TN) parameter along with chlorophyll a (Chl a), depth of Secchi disc (SD), and total phosphorus (TP) parameters. TSI was determined by many researchers for evaluation of aquatic health (Guildford and Hecky 2000; Lathrop 2009; Canfield Jr and Hoyer 2009; Vincent et al. 2010) .",

Naturally, it became an important source of water for the entire industrial belt and townships developed within the catchment area. The upper and middle stretches of river Damodar are the principal sources for disposal of wastes and industrial effluents from the vicinity of industries. These industrial effluents directly pollute the river water, and it can alter the biophysical and chemical nature of the water body. These industrial effluents or wastes include heavy metal ions, oils, greases, acids, dissolved inorganic, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), petrochemicals, phenolic compounds, and microorganisms. The contemporary studies focused that the untreated industrial effluents and urban sewage are being discharged into the main river Damodar and its tributaries, and as a result, the quality of water has been drastically reduced (De et al. 1980; Tiwary and Abhishek 2005; George et al. 2010; Chatterjee et al.2010; Mukherjee et al. 2012; Banerjee and Gupta 2013; Pal and Maiti 2018; Savichev et al. 2020; Chakraborty et al. 2020a) .",

Previously, various studies on water quality and river health have been conducted on river Damodar (Basu and Mitra 2002; Tiwary and Abhishek 2005; Mukherjee et al. 2012) . However, as a researcher, it is highly essential to evaluate the water quality of significant rivers during the COVID-19 lockdown for the huge domestic and industrial demand for water. Thus, the main objective of the present study is to analyze the impact of lockdown on the water quality of river Damodar at the vicinity of industrial sites in terms of physical, chemical, and biological standard. Despite the various limitations (laboratory's use, data collection, and monitoring) during lockdown, the significant results will definitely help administrators and policy makers during the formulation of laws as well as the creation of public health awareness. Meanwhile, we stand at the great dilemma between development and conservation particularly with limited resources and over population. The eco-restoration of river quality during COVID-19 lockdown will bring new horizons for environmental sustainability through the amendment of untreated industrial effluents, urban sewage, and rampant water use.",

The latitudinal and longitudinal extensions of the river Damodar are 22\u00b015\u2032 to 24\u00b032\u2032N and 84\u00b030\u2032 to 88\u00b020\u2032E. The upper and middle catchments of this river are rich in various minerals and high-quality coal deposition of the Gondwana period. Due to the high availability of mineral resources and fresh water at the middle catchment of Damodar River, mining, coal, and other industries have been gradually developed. Many medium and large urban centers have also been emerged depending on these industries. River water is the principal source for drinking, domestic, and industrial purposes in this region. Thus, the entire mineral-rich catchment is highly pressurized by various anthropogenic activities along with multi-storeyed buildings. The large scale discharge of industrial effluents (solid/ liquid), toxic elements, mining activities, and urban runoff deteriorates the health of water day by day. The present study has confined within the middle catchment of about 65.37 km stretch of river Damodar (from Panchet dam 23\u00b040\u203250\u2033N/86\u00b044\u203249\u2033E in the border of Jharkhand and West Bengal to Durgapur barrage 23\u00b040\u203250\u2033N/87\u00b018\u203239\u2033E) ( Fig. 1 ). This zone is highly suitable for industrial activities and coal mining due to landscape morphology, road accessibility, and connectivity. As a result, different iron and steel plant, thermal power plant, sponge iron factory, cement factory, and chemical industries are established in this region. These industrial effluents and coal mining dusts are discharged to the main river directly or through the tributary streams or \"nallas\" (Fig. 2a, c) .",

The stratified random sampling technique was carried out. Here, a stratified sampling technique has been applied due to heterogeneous pollution status throughout the river stretch. All confluence points have been considered due to the high possibility of the commencement of pollutants intermixing with fresh water. Subsequently, water samples of various depths have been collected but not significant results have come out. Therefore, to get authentic and momentous pollution status, the mentioned method has been used. Similarly, a composite sampling technique (5 random samples at confluence point) has been taken to reduce the data error and simultaneously to improve the uniformity among the samples. The sample locations are marked by a portable GPS receiver, and these locations are shown in Fig. 1 . Here, five samples were collected from each sample site at 0.5 m depth within 5 m radius of discharge effluents area and mixed properly in such a way to obtain the representative mix of samples (1 lit) (Sharma et al. 2020a; Vasistha and Ganguly 2020a; Vasistha and Ganguly 2020b) . The samples were collected in pre-cleaned and de-ionized bottles and preserved in a proper way. Different types of physical, chemical, and biological parameters were considered for the assessment of river water quality. The parameters like pH and EC were analyzed in the field using portable devices (Hanna HI9811-5). TDS was measured by the procedure given by Hem (1991) . The concentration of Hco 3 \u2212 So 4 \u2212 , Fe, TN, BOD, and DO was determined by the standard procedures (APHA 2012). TH was estimated by the EDTA titrimetry method (Adimalla and Wu 2019).

During the unlock period, the pH level of all the samples ranges from 6.12 to 7.72 with an average of 6.92 \u00b1 0.48. The lower level of pH in the unlock period is mainly due to less or no mixing of industrial effluents containing high alkaline solutions. TDS or total dissolved solid level in river water is increased by mixing of various soluble minerals, industrial waste effluents etc. The desirable limit of TDS in drinking water is 500 mg/l given by BIS. Electronic conductivity or EC indicates the physical pollutant load of water. The higher value of EC reflects the lower quality of drinking water. According to BIS, the standard limit of EC in drinking water is 300 \u03bcS/cm. Total hardness (TH) is also an important parameter for water quality The BIS has fixed the permissible limit of TA, which is 200 mg/l.

The sample sites S4, S5, S8, S9, and S10 (the confluence zones) were the most deteriorated within the study area. The polluted waste solid, liquid effluents with high quantity of chemicals from iron and steel industries, chemical industries, and thermal power plant were regularly released into the river, and as a result, the river water is severely polluted. It leads to increase the TDS, EC, TH, and BOD levels in comparison with the normal time frame or prelockdown phase. In the lockdown phase, closing of mining activities and cement factory on the river bank improves the water quality of these given sites and the WQI values indicate \"poor\" category of the sample sites 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 11 (WQI = 100-200) while sample sites 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10 show \"very poor\" quality of water. The very poor water quality (sample sites 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10) is due to the location of Durgapur barrage as well as large amount of industrial effluents is being discharged to the main stream through the tributaries, which are connected with the lower stretch (in respect to studied river stretch) of the river Damodar. In case of the non-monsoonal period, pollutants with water are mostly confined behind the Durgapur barrage. In the lockdown phase, the WQI shows clean or transparent water by increasing DO and decreasing other parameters, and it brings comparatively better river health as well as suitable habitat for aquatic species (Fig. 3b) . Thus, it is clearly observed that the closing of industrial activities and no mixing of effluents has significantly helped to improve water quality during the lockdown period.",

Good river health means standard water qualities where aquatic species can comfortably survive and the growth of benthic plants will be limited on the riverbed. The riverbed is gradually accumulated by nutrients from different non-point sources (industrial and modern agricultural systems), and these huge nutrients demand more oxygen during decomposition. But during lockdown, most of the sources are closed; as a result, the eutrophic zone of river stretch has been converted into oligotrophic and meso-eutrophic stage. This is a standard stage for aquatic plants and animals, and it brings superior water condition or high-quality river health for aquatic lives.",

            "text": "From the scientific study, it is concluded that the effluents (solid/liquid) of riverside industries have a major harmful effect on the river Damodar. In the past normal years, the quality of this river water was very poor, and it directly damaged the water quality or health of the aquatic environment. The previous studies on the water quality of river Damodar proved that the river water throughout the catchment area was very much affected by nearby coal dust, iron and steel industries, power plants, chemical industries, etc. (Bhattacharyya et al. 2013; Sundararajan and Mohan 2011; Ghosh and Banerjee 2012; Singh et al. 2014; Chatterjee et al. 2010; George et al. 2010; Mukherjee et al. 2012 ). These previous research works focused that the abundance of TDS, TH, BOD, Fe, and NO 3 \u2212 in the river water is the principal cause of water quality deterioration. The present study also highlighted that all these parameters are found beyond the permissible limit during prelockdown, while lockdown period water quality has significantly improved due to restricted economic activities. Thus, the countrywide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has brought noticeable changes to the overall quality of river water, and it has turned to be a positive condition for nature's restoration. Industrial effluents from nearby chemical factories, thermal power stations, cement factories, and coal mining activities have been deteriorating the water quality of river Damodar in the last three or four decades. High concentration of pH, TDS, TH, TA, Fe, Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , and BOD badly affects the functions of the river ecosystem and human health. The WQI of the pre-lockdown period indicates as \"very poor\" to \"unfit for drinking\" in the study area. Here, during lockdown, no mixing of industrial waste water has improved the water quality within a few months, and it has turned into very good condition. During lockdown, the eutrophic zones (applying TSI) have been significantly modified in different pockets throughout the stretch of river Damodar. The short-term lockdown is blessings for the health of the total environment. So, sustainable development is most important for the ecorestoration of different components of the environment along with further economic progress. Still, the river water is being polluted from various non-point sources such as agricultural run-off, urban wastewater, industrial waste, and garbage dumping. This ground reality or model is vital for sustainable land-use practices and water resource management (Fig. 5) . Riparian vegetation zone influences river water chemistry through diverse processes including direct chemical intake and cycling by vegetation to indirect influences such as by supply of organic contents to shallow soils and channels, modification of water movement activities, and stabilization of soil properties (Malan et al. 2018; Chua et al. 2019) . It is possible if the industries are situated near the river and clearly maintain the environmental guidelines while releasing their polluted solid or liquid waste into the river water (Fig. 5) . So, wastewater and industrial waste should be discharged into the river or riparian wetland. The Government policies and actions are very much helpful for implementing measures such as the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974, Environment Protection Act 1971. However, public awareness about the environment and human health will be the most vital apparatus for the achievement of environmental sustainability. More fundamental and applied research is required to make management policies and laws for sustainable river health restoration from irrational human use. The government should establish a separate department like \"River Research Institute\" to look after the overall health of the river through the changing natural and anthropogenic paradigm. This fieldbased scientific study will definitely assist the development planners, policy makers, and administrators for design sustainability during the modern industrial era.",
