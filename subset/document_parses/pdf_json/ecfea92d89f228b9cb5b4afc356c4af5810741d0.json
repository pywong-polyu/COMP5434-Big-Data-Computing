Individuals are bombarded with an overwhelming volume of information as the line between news creation and consumption blur and more channels and technologies become accessible for news consumption (Peng, 2022) . Furthermore, because of the increased use of mobile devices, news is transmitted more swiftly to a larger number of people than ever before. The problem of news overload has been increased by constant news updates on social media and smartphone applications. The news element of information overload is the subject of this study. Previous research on news overload has largely focused on the levels of news overload as well as the human traits that influence news overload (Bachmann et al., 2021) .",

When humans are exposed to even more information than their knowledge processing capabilities can handle, they experience information overload (Matthes et al., 2020) . Previous research has shown that massive amounts of data are disruptive and have a detrimental influence on productivity and decision making. Because the pace at which information is produced and disseminated has increased dramatically as a result of ICT growth, these negative impacts become exaggerated (Lee et al., 2020) . An excessive amount of information, unintentional expansions of social networking, and quick changes in the technological aspects of social networking services are all examples of new sorts of overload introduced by the growth of social media (Tugtekin et al., 2020) . Information fatigue is linked to the energy consumption needed by these task loads.",

Women were more likely than males to feel overburdened, and older people were more inclined to agree (Hasan and Bao, 2020) . Females have a harder time digesting news material, and older persons may have worse cognitive processing efficiency, making both categories more susceptible to news overload.

The second option is to permanently shut down by rejecting or avoiding information (Kearney and Childs, 2021) . People would eventually experience news overload as the volume of news grows, causing them to shuttered intellectually and reject the importance of news intake in forming a worldview as well as conducting a social debate (Avotra et al., 2021) .

            "text": "The concept of news overload and news avoidance are drawn from cognitive-load theory (Sweller, 1988) . According to cognitive-load theory, people's brains only have so much capacity, that they must control how much information they take in Paas et al. (2003) . When technology is used beyond its optimal level, it can have negative consequences (Karr-Wisniewski and Lu, 2010) . News information overload seems to be a type of cognitive barrier that obstructs or restricts the user's ability to gather information and frustrates them (Savolainen et al., 2018) . Individuals who think that news overload through social networks may use this avoidance method (Song et al., 2016) . Individuals might try to avoid as much as possible the overabundance of news (Savolainen, 2007) . People increasingly sense news overload as the quantity of news exposure grows, which might cause people to shutter cognitively, dismiss the importance of news intake, or put less effort into getting news. Individuals have a propensity to shield themselves against information overload (Savolainen, 2007) . News curation is a cognitive knowledge procedure that provides connotative and/or associative significance to incoming information. The first stage in curation is proper understanding and interpretation of news through cognitive reflection (Park and Kaye, 2018) . News curation, on the other hand, takes extra work in terms of studying, evaluating, and understanding about the topics in order to help others have a better understanding of the political arena. The cognitive tuning theory by Zajonc (1960) proposes that as individuals prepare to transfer knowledge, the content should be organized well, understood, and even sometimes memorized, since they sense a need to completely comprehend what they are providing (Cacciatore et al., 2018) . This theory provided basis for news curation and we utilized in current research as a dependent variable. Similarly relevance of news is drawn from relevance theory (Foster-Cohen, 2000; Chapman, 2005) . Relevance is a difficult concept to define, in least since our job lies at the crossroads of several areas, each of which defines it uniquely. Relevance theory is most likely the most influential within pragmatics. Relevancy is a trade-off between acquiring the most recent information while exerting the least amount of effort. Importantly, in this viewpoint, relevance is always relative rather than absolute: people will consider what is most important at any given time.",

Relevancy is an exchange between getting the most recent information while putting in the least amount of effort. Importantly, in this perspective, relevance is always relative rather than absolute: people will consider what is most essential at any particular time (Barchas-Lichtenstein et al., 2021) . Meanwhile, relevance has been largely overlooked in the language research on news values. Bednarek adds in a review of linguists' handling of news values that those who included relevance often have supplied ambiguous interpretations, and Bednarek primarily encompasses this element under the criterion of impact (Bednarek, 2016; Huan, 2018) . Therefore, based on this relevance theory, we proposed relevance of news as an element of impacting factor toward news curation in this research.",

The argument for integrating two contrasting analytical perspectives in cultural audience research that depend on the framework of practice theory in order to create a better understanding of the role of journalism and news in everyday life. Reporters may structure news to emphasize their relevance to a certain readership, and readers and viewers may develop extra deep ties that aren't explicitly stated in the article or arise just through conversation with each other. Prior study has looked into the language skills used by reporters to express the importance of news and news principles in general. Vidali (2010) , for instance, noted mainstream news viewers' behavior via pronouns, participatory frameworks, and socially constructed ideologies of sincerity, whereas (Molek-Kozakowska, 2016) pointed out that \"events are not always intrinsically newsworthy, but can be crafted as newsworthy with particular application of pictures and linguistic devices.\" There has been little research into how readers and viewers build relevance discursively, but there is reason to suppose they vary from journalism (Armstrong et al., 2015; Cunningham et al., 2016) . Busse and Gray's (2011) report concentrated on news talk, which is defined as \"the unstructured and often highly productive manner that news articles are shared among individuals, and interpretations are constructed that may or may not have any relevance with initial purpose of the reporter who wrote the news\".

Quality perceptions inside the industry of reporting as well as from the perspective of users are not always in sync (Edgerly, 2021) . As a result, studies on broadcast quality differentiates between journalistic excellence and users' perceptions of quality (Bachmann et al., 2021) .

The Circa News app gathers information from a number of sources as well as repackages it into narrative strands (Coddington, 2020) . Flipboard is a visually rich news aggregator for phones and tablets that collects material from a range of sources and organizes it into themed collections. After then, readers can track collections, themes, or publications (Vanden Abeele et al., 2022) . Social media, as well as various news channels, may serve as news curating services. Previously, there has been no study conducted to evaluate the impact of news overload on news curation but there remained a gap to address this relationship so, we developed the following hypothesis in this regard.",

Individuals are confronted with an unprecedented volume of information as the line between news creation and consumption blurs and more channels and technologies become accessible for news consumption. When there is an abundance of news, it acts like noise (Garc\u00eda-de-Frutos and Estrella-Ram\u00f3n, 2021). Anxiety, boredom, excessive redundancy (receiving meaningless information repeatedly), and distraction are common side effects of information overload (Lee and Hong, 2021) . Such exhaustion is common in the workplace, and the name \"information fatigue syndrome\" was developed to describe it (Thomas, 1998) . Extreme stress and emotions of powerlessness, pessimism, and pressure are among the symptoms. We believe that news consumers who experience overload as a result of too much news will suffer from tiredness.",

Conversely, some new research of information dissemination have discovered a large population of individuals who read an watch no or just a little bit of news, referring them as minimalists, news avoiders, intermittent or non-users (Wolfsfeld et al., 2015; Mosca and Quaranta, 2016; Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck et al., 2018) . Considering the increasing interest in the topic, academics are still divided on the breadth of news avoidance. One South Korean research related to national representative samples labeled approximately 73% of participants as news avoiders (Lee and Yang, 2014) , whereas Dutch researchers showed just 11% news avoiders (Trilling and Schoenbach, 2012 ) and a Swedish study found 15% news avoiders (Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck et al., 2013) . Several other research shows percentages that fall somewhere in the middle of these two extremes (Bos et al., 2016) . This significant disparity is most likely due to differences in the conception and operational definitions of news avoidance, at least to some extent. Because of these discrepancies, determining the level of news avoidance overall, let alone comparing news avoidance throughout various media platforms, is challenging (Skovsgaard and Andersen, 2020) . A lot of research has undergone in past to examine different roles of different factors contributing toward news avoidance including quality of news, relevance of news, efficacy of news, and new overload, etc., but no prior research has ever found mediating role of news avoidance in any context. It could lead to news curation as suggested in our research context, so we proposed that direct relationships of perceived news quality, relevance of news, and news overload with news curation could be mediated through news avoidance as well. In this regard we proposed the following.",

For the results of this test to be valid should show the highest value in diagonal at the top in each variable column. The present study meets this criterion of validity as well. The results can be seen in Table 3 . R-square also known as coefficient of determination has been used in this study to measure the fitness of model, i.e., how well the values fit the regression line. For present study, the dependent variable of news curation shows 43.8% regression fit while news avoidance shows 22.1%.",

News curation is a cognitive knowledge procedure that provides incoming information connotative and/or associative significance. Proper understanding of a news and interpreting it by cognitive reflection is the first stage in curation (Park and Kaye, 2018) . News curation, on the other hand, takes extra work in terms of studying, evaluating, and understanding about the topics in order to help others have a better understanding of the current affairs. For evaluating news curation in this regard, impact of news relevance was estimated on news curation. The results revealed that relevance of news had significant contribution among the respondents toward news curation. The reason for such a significant relationship lies in the fact that if social media users get relevant news from any source, they are seeking for; they tend to share it with others immediately through social media.",

The other direct relationship of perceived quality of news toward news curation did not indicate any significant contribution toward news curation. The possible reason behind such results may be drawn from the concept of perceived quality among youngsters. The youngsters go and search for any news which they might think could be the attention seeking for their social network members and friends. They don't bother whether this news is of good quality or not. Although, in different contexts, the perceived quality of news has been studied before. Due to modernization, viewers' perceptions of quality and the objectives for which they obtain news are likely to have shifted. Quality perceptions within the reporting industry as well as from the perspective of users are not always in sync (Edgerly, 2021) .",

Although the direct relationship of news overload with news curation indicated that if there is a burden or overload of news among the readers and viewers, then it affects their behavior of news curation. Because if there is a lot of news available from multiple sources then social media users will have to do enormous news curation. The quantity of information is not always seen negatively because it presents information searchers with more options (Lee and Hong, 2021) . However, the amount of information is enhanced since many news organizations republish the same or slightly modified versions of the very same news (Mour\u00e3o and Robertson, 2019) . People who sense overload but wish to continue viewing news items must control their overload in this case (Tunney et al., 2021) . This study also evaluated the mediating role of news avoidance between news relevance and curation, perceived news quality and news curation, and news overload and news curation. The indirect relationship of news avoidance between news relevance and news curation did not make any significance between these. This result indicated that direct relationship of news relevance with news curation could not be enhanced through news avoidance because news avoidance did not lead to news curation at any level. The effects could not be more enhanced. The other indirect relationship of news avoidance between perceived news quality and news curation indicated that this kind of direct relationship needed the help of news avoidance. This is due to the fact that news perceived quality could not make it to the social media users for news curation. For news curation, the users got help from news avoidance. It helped them for news curation regardless of the perceived quality of news. In a media world in which a wealth of news is available for 24 h a day, it is a contradiction that an increasing number of people are turning their backs on the news, resulting in widening inequities in current affairs awareness and involvement (Van Aelst et al., 2017) .",

Similarly the last indirect relationship referring mediating role of news avoidance between news overload and news curation could not find any significant contribution toward news curation. This analogy suggested that news sharing participants on social media did not bother about news overload and simply shared news regardless of its content, quality, relevance, and hefty amount. News avoidance could not aid this relationship, which was otherwise significant in this research. A plenty of research has undergone in past to examine different roles of different factors contributing toward news avoidance such as quality of news, relevance of news, efficacy of news, and new overload, etc., but no prior research has ever found mediating role of news avoidance in any context.

The target segments should be targeted subjectively rather than objectively. Furthermore, the study implies that the people are more prone to the quality of news rather than quantity; therefore, it is important for the news agencies to make sure that they produce and deliver the quality-based news considering the accuracy to penetrate the market at mass level. Furthermore, news overloading should be avoided because it reduces the ability to reach the people because during this process even the quality news get filtered, and people start avoiding the publishing organization or their online portal. Therefore, the news agencies must consider the relevance and quality of the news in order to avoid mass avoidance and filtration.",

The results of the study showed that news relevance and news overload have a negative significant effect on news curation. This shows that higher the relevance of news less will be the news curation.
