All of which are secondary to their ability to raise intracellular pH, which particularly affects endosome function. 11, 12 CQ/HCQ can interfere with all stages of the viral life cycle. 11 They have the potential to hinder SARS-CoV-2 binding to its cell membrane receptor, ACE2, through their interference with the glycosylation process of the ACE2 protein that results in reducing its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 virus. CQ/HCQ could also prevent fusion of the viral particles to the host cell membrane and prevent their cell entry. Furthermore, CQ/HCQ can also inhibit viral replication, assembly and release of viral particles from the host cells. 11 CQ/HCQ also alter endosomal antigen processing and modulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses. 11, 12 This leads to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFa, IL-1b and IL-6. Additionally, CQ/HCQ improve endothelial function and reduce the prothrombotic state. 13 These properties could have favourable effects in patients with severe COVID-19 disease.",

The enthusiasm for their widespread clinical use in the treatment of COVID-19 disease escalated with the early studies reporting their effective in vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 virus. 14- 16 An early interim analysis of 100 COVID-19 patients was reported by a group from China where they found that CQ therapy was associated with less severe pneumonia, shorter disease course and faster viral clearance. 17 Another small nonrandomized study of 20 patients from France revealed reduced nasopharyngeal viral carrier state at 6 days after the initiation of treatment with HCQ and azithromycin. 18 These limited data along with the political support for CQ/HCQ use led clinicians worldwide to use them indiscriminately and to include them in their institutional protocols and guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 disease as a monotherapy or in combination with azithromycin. This rapid adoption of CQ/HCQ was associated with an astronomical increase in CQ/HCQ prescription of approximately 2000%. 19 While numerous large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were started in different countries worldwide, several observational studies addressing the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 disease got published along with preliminary results from some RCTs. These studies have different methodologies and sample sizes, and produced mixed results, ranging from reduced mortality and improved other clinical outcomes to increased mortality among COVID-19 patients.",

We evaluated heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic, which estimates the variability percentage in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than to chance-the larger the I 2 , the greater the heterogeneity. We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of (i) risk of bias in included studies and (ii) the selection of study population (general populations versus specific populations) on the overall estimate of effect. We constructed funnel plots and performed an Egger precision-weighted linear regression test as a statistical test of funnel plot asymmetry and publication bias.

With regards to comparability, three studies 32,33,44 did not adequately adjust for confounders in their analyses. Given the relatively short course of disease, all studies were considered to have had a satisfactory follow-up duration. Three studies 32, 33, 43 that assessed mortality were considered at high risk of bias and a sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding these studies to assess heterogeneity. The results of the Cochrane RoB 2 assessment for RCTs can be found in Table S12 . Of the five included RCTs, three were considered high risk, [27] [28] [29] one was low risk 25 and one had no available manuscript for quality assessment. 26 Some studies were initially included in our review as eligible studies, but were later excluded for various reasons. Chen et al. 46 only reported time to clinical recovery and changes in radiological parameters and Feng et al. 47 reported disease progression in patients receiving CQ. Four studies were excluded over serious methodology concerns [48] [49] [50] [51] and one study was retracted due to concerns over the validity of the patient information. 52 GRADE was used to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. The findings were then summarized, along with the overall certainty of evidence (Table 3) .",

For instance, CQ was ineffective in preventing or ameliorating influenza following viral challenge in mouse and ferret models 5 and did not prevent influenza infection in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in humans. 53 CQ also resulted in worse outcomes in a guinea pig model of Ebola infection 7 and was shown to enhance Chikungunya viral infections in different animal models, including non-human primates. 54 Moreover, CQ was ineffective in improving the course of Chikungunya viral infection in humans. 54 ,55 CQ was also tested in a randomized controlled trial of 307 patients with dengue virus and failed to reduce duration of viraemia or NS1 antigenaemia. 56 In the case of HIV-1, the use of CQ/HCQ was inconclusive and hence they were not endorsed for routine use in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 57 Possible reasons for lack of efficacy of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 disease",

            "text": "First, most in vitro studies employ pre-treatment protocols, where cells are treated with the drugs before infecting them with the tested virus. In vitro studies that compared pre-treatment and post-infection treatment have shown that CQ/HCQ have less effective antiviral activities if added after infection. 4, 16, 58 For example, Vincent et al. 58 showed that CQ at 0.1, 1.0 and 10 lM added 20-24 h before infection with SARS-CoV decreased infectivity by 28%, 53% and 100%. However, if CQ is added 3-5 h after infecting the cells, higher concentrations of CQ of up to 50 lM were needed to decrease infectivity. 58 This may raise the possibility that chronic or prophylactic use of CQ/HCQ may reduce the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, a recent large population study of 14 250 individuals showed that chronic use of HCQ was not protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. 59 Second, a wide range of EC 50 values were reported for CQ and HCQ and, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the EC 50 for CQ ranges between 1.13 and 7.36 lM and between 0.72 and 17.31 lM for HCQ. 11 It is worth noting that the lowest EC 50 of 0.72 lM for HCQ reported by Yao et al. 16 in their post-infection experiments was different from the lowest EC 50 of 5.85 lM in their pre-treatment experiments. None of the other investigators reported such a low EC 50 for CQ of HCQ with SARS-CoV-2 or any other viruses. Achieving adequate blood and tissue drug concertation is essential for proper antiviral activity. In mice, a high dose of 90 mg/kg twice a day of CQ was necessary to achieve steady-state blood levels of 2.5 lg/mL. 8 High doses of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 patients can be associated with increased adverse events, as shown in a recent RCT, where high-dose CQ was shown to be associated with significant toxicity in COVID-19 patients. 60 In addition, optimal CQ or HCQ blood levels for effective antiviral action are unclear, since the suggested levels were based on widely differing in vitro EC 50 estimates. In a study of 40 HIV-1 patients treated with HCQ 800 mg/ day for 8 weeks, the HCQ blood concentration range was 0.27-1.0 lg/mL. 61 Only those HIV-1 patients who achieved the highest HCQ blood concentrations had a favourable response to HCQ. 61 There are only two small studies that looked at the pharmacokinetics of HCQ in COVID-19 patients. 18, 62 In the first study, Gautret et al. 18 found that the mean HCQ level in 20 patients treated with HCQ 600 mg/day was 0.46 lg/mL. This blood concentration is lower than the lowest effective in vitro concentration of 0.72 lM. Perinel et al. 62 showed that only 61% of 13 patients treated with HCQ 600 mg/day achieved what they considered the minimum therapeutic concentration of 1 lg/mL with a mean time to reach this concentration of 2.7 days. Based on published data and their own, Balevic et al. 63 found that the average serum/plasma HCQ concentration was below the lowest antiviral target level for SARS-CoV-2 of 0.48 lg/mL in all studies. These studies indicate that current HCQ dosing is probably suboptimal to achieve adequate blood levels necessary for effective antiviral activity.",

            "text": "Our meta-analysis not only revealed lack of efficacy of HCQ in improving the outcomes of COVID-19 patients, but also suggested possible increased risk of mortality when used in combination with azithromycin. Several studies have shown increased risk of cardiac toxicity among COVID-19 patients treated with CQ/HCQ. Our group have recently conducted a meta-analysis on CQ/HCQ-induced cardiac toxicity in COVID-19 patients, 64 which revealed increased risk of QTc prolongation and discontinuation of drug due to QT prolongation. In addition, CQ/HCQ were associated with a clinically significant risk of malignant arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. 60 It has also been a common practice to use HCQ in combination with azithromycin for COVID-19 during the current pandemic. Azithromycin has been linked to increased risk of sudden cardiac death. 65, 66 Hence, the concomitant use of CQ/HCQ and azithromycin or other QT-prolonging agents could potentially increase the risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias and death. Increased risk of 30 day cardiac death, angina and heart failure complications associated with the combination therapy of HCQ!azithromycin has also been reported in a recent preprint of a large population study of 323 122 patients. 67 Our findings are consistent with the IDSA recommendations on the use of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 disease 68 and the recent systematic reviews. [69] [70] [71] However, our study has several advantages over the previous reviews (Table S13) . First, it is the only study that included both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Second, it has the largest number of identified studies and therefore patient population because our search is the most up to date. Third, in contrast to all previous studies, we included only studies that reported adjusted-effect estimates and therefore we avoided including studies at high risk of bias due to confounding. Fourth, we provided adequate assessment of the certainty of evidence using the GRADE classification. Finally, we offered a comprehensive discussion regarding the probable mechanisms of lack of efficacy of HCQ in COVID-19, which will inform and stimulate further research in this area.",

We also employed rigorous methodologies, where we excluded studies that did not report adjusted ORs or HRs and those with poor methodology. We analysed and reported monotherapy and combination therapy separately. We also examined mortality and other clinical outcomes separately and performed sensitivity analyses to eliminate sources of between-study heterogeneity. However, our study has several limitations; all of our included studies except one were observational studies, which are prone to bias; including confounding by allocation, survival bias and residual confounding. Our group and others have shown that survivor bias, which occurs because patients who live longer are more likely to receive treatment than those who die early, could change associations from benefit to harm. 72, 73 Moreover, as with all observational studies, residual confounding could weaken any observed association 74 even with appropriate adjustment or propensity score matching. Nevertheless, the direction of these biases is supposed to be in favour of HCQ efficacy. In addition, our pooled estimates are consistent with the results of the interim report from the RECOVERY trial, which lends support to our findings.",
