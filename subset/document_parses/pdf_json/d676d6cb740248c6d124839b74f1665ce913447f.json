The edges have weights corresponding to the similarity score between the connected words (nodes). The second component of the model is the so-called 'Context Embedding', CEmb. The context embedding is conceptualized to be an embedding vector that represents the specific context that we are interested in.

A typical workflow would involve users from the medical/ pharmacovigilance domain inputting a small number of known keywords of interest, detecting the emerging signals (symptoms/ADR) output by the model, and validating them using the corresponding text. This allows for very early detection of symptoms/ADR from social media platforms without the need to manually scavenge large corpora.",

So with 'cough' as the seed word, highly correlated words like 'fever' were detected by these approaches, while words like 'congestion', 'nausea', 'diarrhea' were not.

This is even more true for COVID-19 as the symptoms are evolving and newer symptoms are being observed even after several months from the first case. We, therefore, considered the approach in the more studied context of detecting adverse drug reactions and show that the approach generalizes to this domain. The annotations in ADR vary from very specific entities like 'pain', 'headache' to very broad phrases like 'a tingling sensation' (Nikfarjam et al., 2019) .
