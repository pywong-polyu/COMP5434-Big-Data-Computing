            "text": "Background: From late February 2020, English care homes rapidly adapted their practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to accommodating new guidelines and policies, staff had to adjust to rapid reconfiguration of services external to the home that they would normally depend upon for support. This study examined the complex interdependencies of support as staff responded to COVID-19. The aim was to inform more effective responses to the ongoing pandemic, and to improve understanding of how to work with care home staff and organisations after the pandemic has passed. Methods: Ten managers of registered care homes in the East Midlands of England were interviewed by videoconference or phone about their experiences of the crisis from a structured organisational perspective. Analysis used an adapted organisational framework analysis approach with a focus on social ties and interdependencies between organisations and individuals. Results: Three key groups of interdependencies were identified: care processes and practice; resources; and governance. Care home staff had to deliver care in innovative ways, making high stakes decisions in circumstances defined by: fluid ties to organisations outside the care home; multiple, sometimes conflicting, sources of expertise and information; and a sense of deprioritisation by authorities. Organisational responses to the pandemic by central government resulted in resource constraints and additional work, and sometimes impaired the ability of staff and managers to make decisions. Local communities, including businesses, third-sector organisations and individuals, were key in helping care homes overcome challenges. Care homes, rather than competing, were found to work together to provide mutual support. Resilience in the system was a consequence of dedicated and resourceful staff using existing local networks, or forging new ones, to overcome barriers to care.",

Care home residents are especially at risk of COVID-19 because of their age, co-morbidities, prevalent frailty, cognitive impairment, and functional dependency [2] . Residents are also rendered more vulnerable by virtue of frequent close and personal contact with other residents, and carers who attend to their needs. COVID-19 spread rapidly through care homes and, despite the efforts of staff, many homes were devastated by large numbers of deaths and associated illness in their residents and staff. In the year to 19 June 2020, there had been more than 30, 500 excess deaths among care home residents [3] , and by 26 June 2020, there had 268 deaths involving COVID-19 among social care workers [4] .",

At the same time, as part of infection control, organisations which routinely provide support to care homes, including general practitioners and community based multidisciplinary teams, were asked to minimise contacts with care homes to those deemed essential.

These experiences took place against a background of longer standing challenges affecting long-term care in the UK. Care homes are critical to health and social care provision because they provide care for people who are vulnerable, frail, often approaching the end-oflife and no longer able to receive care in other settings [9] . There are 15,000 care homes in England, providing approximately 430,000 beds. 50% of care homes are run by profit-making business, 47% are not for profit and 3% are state run [10] . Most care home staff are middle-aged or older and come from a black and ethnic minority background [11] . Care home work is often regarded as being of low status and many working in the sector only receive minimum wage. Despite several independent commissions and recommendations for reform [12, 13] , it is widely recognised that the long-term care sector in the UK beset with systemic challenges. These include a lack of funding, fragmentation of supply leading to large variations in the quality and quantity of care, poor integration with the wider health and social care system, and problems in staff recruitment, retention and training [13, 14] . This is now recognised in the Ageing Well components of the NHS England Long-term plan [15] . This includes specific objectives around Enhanced Health in Care Homes, but these are yet to be implemented [16] . The increasing dependency of the care home population has led to role-extension for care home staff, who now attend to aspects of care that would previously have been regarded as the responsibility of the National Health Service (NHS) [17] . This has not been accompanied by commensurate re-allocation of funding and this has led to inequity of resource provision, with expenditure on care homes in the UK well below the (OECD) average [13] .",

In order to understand the challenges and responses of the care home managers in the course of the pandemic we adopted an ethnographic organisational systems approach based on the structures and relations within and between the care homes and other key organisations and stakeholders. Rather than reduce our participants to objects we strived to ensure that their voices as expert witnesses to the pandemic were central to understanding the systems within which they worked. This approach was chosen both in light of the complex systemic factors noted in the literature above, and following initial conversation with participants, which suggested that their experience of the pandemic, and their ability to respond to it, was closely 'tied in' to the relationships and processes of the wider health and social care system. In other words, while care homes are often felt to be left out of mainstream health and social care policy in the UK, in the face of the pandemic, the web of mutually dependent relationships was brought to the fore. Further, we focused particularly on system 'interdependencies', both within homes, and between homes and external organisations. Interdependencies are defined as \"a relationship between two or more elements (e.g. roles, units, work processes) that are linked or mutually reliant on each other\" [18] . Interdependencies within organisations are often seen to be important because they provide insights into where there may be tension, collaboration, or ambivalence within organisational systems.",

We used these as a starting point for a snowballing approach to recruitment, asking members who had previously participated in research to help us identify care home managers who had not been engaged in research before. We supplemented this by asking professional care and research networks to publicise the study using social media and electronic mailing lists. We chose to focus on managers new to research because many care home managers that we had routinely interacted with in the past through our research had engaged with online support forums alongside senior clinicians and academics [19] .

From prior literature, we identified a series of interdependencies, interfaces and points of criticality and uncertainty likely to have a bearing on care home managers' work (Worren [18] ). These inter-dependencies informed both the initial interview topic guide and the initial framework for data coding. The topic guide developed prior to interviewing was developed using the work of Worren and the knowledge of the care home research members [18] . Initially there were five key interdependencies: commitments, activities, resources, governance and social networks. Each of these interdependencies contained aspects to guide the interviews. For example, resources included PPE, staffing, essential other resources (such as food, medications), training and upskilling. Following the commencement of the interviews the data was initially analysed as a dynamic process to refine and capture emergent facets which did not fit the initial topic guide. Through initial readings of transcripts, discussions with the research team, the five interdependencies were narrowed down to three key interdependencies, namely 1) care processes and practices 2) resources and 3) governance. This narrowing was necessary to enable better fit of the data and for logical consistency since there were significant overlaps in some of the data and key interdependencies. Interview transcripts were then thematically coded, with sub-themes identified inductively from the data. We refined and further developed the fit between sub-themes and our overall understanding of the broader interdependencies iteratively as we proceeded through coding (Charmaz, [19] ). As an example, newly formed networks were identified as an important theme for all respondents, with different types of networks identified as fitting with each of the interdependencies. The coding of transcripts was also informed by an awareness of the (changing) official guidance and other sources of information as identified in the individual accounts and official (media and online) sources. These were used to help understand points of tension and place care home managers experience within a knowledge of the wider context. All the accounts by the participants were regarded as equally valuable and did not allow for any outlier relegation as is common in some qualitative analysis [19] .",

This included taking on care previously delivered by trained clinicians within primary and community care. Since many GP practices ceased visiting during the pandemic these regular care duties, such as injections and wound care, fell to the care home staff. Adapting to the restrictions of lockdown required new approaches to care, managing everyday care demands alongside COVID-19 requirements. This included developing approaches that enabled staff to simultaneously care for those without COVID, those who were COVID positive, and those recovering post-COVID who needed rehabilitation. There were additional demands of new COVID-related cleaning and administrative activities, for example, deep cleaning after COVID-infection and completing mandatory online reporting templates for the NHS.",

Centrally organised governmental responses to the pandemic often had counterproductive effects in care homes, resulting in resource constraints and additional work, and impairing the ability of staff and managers to make decisions about care of their residents. Much of the resilience in the system was a consequence of dedicated and resourceful staff using existing local networks, or forging new ones, to work around the challenges brought forward both by the pandemic and the central policy decisions intended to deal with it.",

The latter were insufficiently cognisant of, and insufficiently expert in, how care is delivered in and by care homes. A countervailing narrative comes from the way in which local communities rallied around care homes to help them through. There is evidence, at times, that care homes were inadequately considered and valued by those making and delivering policy. There is also evidence of largely unconcerted support efforts by members of the community, who clearly valued care homes, their staff, and the work that they do. Important lessons emerge, both for the remainder of the pandemic, and how care home staff are supported and facilitated in their role to care for their residents in the longer term.",

This has been shown to be the case for urgent and planned healthcare [21, 22] , in end-of-life care [23] and when working to improve and develop services [24] . This study adds to this by showing the essential leadership and brokering role that managers and staff played in maintaining continuity of care during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the strategies adopted by managers, relying largely on their own experience and intuition in the absence of coherent national guidance, reflected those which were reported to be effective in controlling the pandemic in care homes during the initial COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan Province, China [25] . These included establishing clear leadership hierarchies, regularly reviewing policies in light of emerging evidence, developing organisationspecific infection control policies, working to establish reliable supply chains in the face of shortages, and working with residents to maximise activity and engagement. It was care home managers, working with local communities, that ensured these were in place, not central government policy.",

Our findings show that when central and local government increased the formal reporting requirements placed on care homes, ostensibly to better understand their needs, it resulted in duplication of effort for an already overstretched staff, and risked jeopardising resident care. When PPE supplies were centralised, it robbed those care home managers who were usually very competent managers of their supply chain, of control over their pandemic response. Multiple previous studies have reported the need to engage care home organisations, managers and staff in changes to the design and configuration of care in the sector [17, 26, 27] . The findings presented in this paper show the potentially serious ramifications of the failure to do so. A valuable finding was the way in which are homes are interdependent upon, and embedded within, their local communities. When formal healthcare and social care were slow to provide the necessary support to care homes, third sector organisations, schools, shops, manufacturers and hospices stepped in.",

They also provide useful insights as improvement work with care homes continues beyond the pandemic and as national government proposes reconfiguration of the care home sector. It is important to recognise the ability of care home staff to identify and solve emerging issues in care homes. Care homes are under-represented at all levels of decision makingthis must be rectified. The importance of care homes to their local communities, and the preparedness of communities to support care homes, is an important new finding. This means that stakeholders in decisions about care home provision are potentially wider than previously recognised. This requires that consultation must be broader when changes are implemented, but it also provides potentially novel opportunities for how care home staff can be supported by communities. Finally, the care home sector has the potential to act in a more concerted, and collaborative way, than has been historically recognised by NHS and social care providers. This potential for these networks to provide peer support and logistical solutions is an important future area of enquiry.",
