            "text": "Background: Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (kEDS) is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder characterized by progressive kyphoscoliosis, congenital muscular hypotonia, marked joint hypermobility, and severe skin hyperextensibility and fragility. Deficiency of lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1) due to mutations of PLOD1 (procollagenlysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1) gene has been identified as the pathogenic cause of kEDS (kEDS-PLOD1). Up to now, kEDS-PLOD1 has not been reported among Chinese population. Case presentation: A 17-year-old Chinese male patient presenting with hypotonia, joint hypermobility and scoliosis was referred to our hospital. After birth, he was found to have severe hypotonia leading to delayed motor development. Subsequently, joint hypermobility, kyphoscoliosis and amblyopia were found. Inguinal hernia was found at age 5 years and closed by surgery. At the same time, he presented with hyperextensible and bruisable velvety skin with widened atrophic scarring after minor trauma. Dislocation of elbow joint was noted at age of 6 years. Orthopedic surgery for correction of kyphoscoliosis was performed at age 10 years. His family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed elevated blood pressure. Slight facial dysmorphologies including high palate, epicanthal folds, and down-slanting palpebral fissures were found. He also had blue sclerae with normal hearing. X-rays revealed severe degree of scoliosis and osteopenia. The Echocardiography findings were normal. Laboratory examination revealed a slightly elevated bone turnover. Based on the clinical manifestations presented by our patient, kEDS was suspected. Genetic analysis revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation of PLOD1 (c.1697 G > A, p.C566Y), confirming the diagnosis of kEDS-PLOD1. The patient was treated with alfacalcidol and nifedipine. Improved physical strength and normal blood pressure were reported after 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: This is the first case of kEDS-PLOD1 of Chinese origin. We identified one novel mutation of PLOD1, extending the mutation spectrum of PLOD1. Diagnosis of kEDS-PLOD1 should be considered in patients with congenital hypotonia, progressive kyphoscoliosis, joint hypermobility, and skin hyperextensibility and confirmed by mutation analysis of PLOD1.",

As an enzyme, LH1 plays an important role in hydroxylation of lysyl residuel in Xaa-Lys-Gly. The hydroxylysine residues serve as sites of attachment for carbohydrate units which are essential for the formation of intra-and intermolecular collagen crosslinks [5] . As a result, LH1 deficiency results in underhydroxylation of lysyl residues and underglycosylation of hydroxylysyl residues, leading to impaired collagen crosslinks formation with consequent mechanical instability of the affected tissues [6] . Abnormal urinary excretion pattern of lysylpyridinolines (LP) and hydroxylysyl-pyridinolines (HP) cross-links (LP/HP) is a highly sensitive and specific test for LH1 deficiency [6] . In 2012, mutations of a second gene, FK506 binding protein 14 (FKBP14), was identified as another cause of kEDS (kEDS-FKBP14) [7] . Although patients with kEDS-FKBP14 present a clinically overlapping phenotype with PLOD1-related kEDS (kEDS-PLOD1), they can still be distinguished by normal LP/HP, presence of myopathy, and hearing impairment [7] .",

After birth, he was found to have severe hypotonia and did not open his eyes until he was 20 days old. The severe hypotonia led to delayed motor development. He was not able to walk independently until 2 years of age and joint hypermobility was found at that time. Kyphoscoliosis and amblyopia were found at age 3 years. Inguinal hernia was found at age 5 years and closed by surgery. At the same time, he presented with hyperextensible and bruisable velvety skin with widened atrophic scarring after minor trauma. Dislocation of elbow joint has been noted to happen frequently since age of 6 years. Orthopedic surgery for correction of kyphoscoliosis was performed at age 10 years.

            "text": "Kyphoscoliosisis, mostly accompanied with hypotonia and ligamentous laxity, is usually present at birth or develops in infancy. Although congenital or early onset kyphoscoliosis is obligatory for the diagnosis in the criteria for kEDS, not all of reported patients with kEDS presented with kyphoscoliosis at birth or in infancy [8] . Rohrbach et al. reported that 1 of 12 patients with kEDS did not develop kyphoscoliosis until the age of 27 years. The absence of hypotonia at birth could indicate a more favorable prognosis of not developing spine deformity later in life [6] . Indeed, data from PLOD1 \u2212/\u2212 mice suggested a direct correlation between lack of spine deformity and absence of hypotonia at birth [9] . However, recent study reported two patients who presented to be hypotonic at birth while did not develop congenital or early onset kyphoscoliosis [10]. So, kyphoscoliosis is not necessarily existent in patients with kEDS, and the association between occurrence of kyphoscoliosis and hypotonia at birth is still controversial. It should be noted that the main differences of diagnostic criteria between kEDS and classic EDS (cEDS) are the presence of kyphoscoliosis and hypotonia at birth, while hypotonia could also exist in cEDS [11] . In this condition, patients with kEDS could be easily misdiagnosed as cEDS. In patients who satisfy the main criteria of cEDS without mutataion of COL5A1 and COL5A2, the possibility of PLOD1 mutation should be considered. In our study, the patient presented to be hypotonic at birth, but kyphoscoliosis was not noted until 3 years of age. Although vascular incidents are more common in vascular EDS (vEDS), eight cases with antenatal or neonatal vascular incidents have also been reported in kEDS [2, 6, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition, as a major life-threatening complication in this disorder, vascular incidents such as aortic dilation/dissection and rupture of medium-sized arteries often occurs during transition period from youth to adulthood [14, 15] . Yeowell et al. reported a patient with kEDS who presented with aortic root dilatation and died from arterial rupture [14] . Echocardiography in our patient was normal. Orthostatic intolerance was reported to be prevalent in hypermobile EDS (hEDS) and was most frequently expressed as postural orthostatic tachycardia. Although we did not perform autonomic function testing on our patient, consistent with previous study [18] , relatively high resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were found, suggesting increased resting cardiac sympathetic activity. Although the underlying mechanism of vascular incidents has not been well established, the abnormal collagen structure is a facilitating factor. Control of blood pressure was suggested to reduce the risk of arterial rupture [3] . Although nifedipine used in our patient normalized blood pressure successfully, evaluation of cardiovascular structure and function by echocardiography should be followed up regularly [3] .",

            "text": "At present, 44 different mutations of PLOD1 (Ehlers Danlos Syndrome Variant Database) has been reported, including missense, nonsense, insertion, duplication, deletion, splicing mutations. Among them, the 8.9 kb duplication of 7 exons (exons 10-16; c.1067_1846 dup) is the most common mutation [19] , followed by nonsense mutation (p.Arg319*), while missense mutations are relatively rare. The patient harbored a homozygous missense mutation (c.1697 G > A, p.C566Y) resulting in a cysteine to tyrosine substitution, and his parents were heterozygous carriers of the corresponding mutation. The substituted cysteine was highly conserved in human, rat, mouse, chicken and chimpanzee (Fig. 4) . This variant was not reported in several global human genome databases, including the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) (https://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/), dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP), ClinVar database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), 1000 Genomes (https://www.1000genomes.org), the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) (https://exac.broadinstitute.org). This variant is possibly causative for kEDS because it was predicted to be \"PROBABLY DAMAGING\" with a score 0.999 by Polymorphism Phenotyping version 2 (PolyPhen-2) (https://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), \"AFFECT PROTEIN FUNCTION\" with a score 0.00 by Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) (https://sift.bii. a-star.edu.sg), and \"disease causing\" by Mutation Taster (https://www.mutationtaster.org/). Clinical severity was observed to be variable in individuals with kEDS-PLOD1, even in patients with same mutation [5, 6] . No specific work has been carried out to analyze genotypephenotype correlations to date [5, 15, 19] .",
