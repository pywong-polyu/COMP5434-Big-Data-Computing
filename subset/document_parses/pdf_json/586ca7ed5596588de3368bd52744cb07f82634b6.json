            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic is touching every facet of human lives (e.g., public health, education, economy, transportation, and the environment). This novel pandemic and non-pharmaceutical interventions of lockdown and confinement implemented citywide, regionally or nationally are affecting virus transmission, people's travel patterns, and air quality. Many studies have been conducted to predict the diffusion of the COVID-19 disease, assess the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility and on air quality, and assess the impacts of lockdown measures on viral spread with a range of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This literature review aims to analyze the results from past research to understand the interactions among the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, human mobility, and air quality. The critical review of prior studies indicates that urban form, people's socioeconomic and physical conditions, social cohesion, and social distancing measures significantly affect human mobility and COVID-19 viral transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are inclined to use private transportation for necessary travel to mitigate coronavirus-related health problems. This review study also noticed that COVID-19 related lockdown measures significantly improve air quality by reducing the concentration of air pollutants, which in turn improves the COVID-19 situation by reducing respiratory-related sickness and deaths. It is argued that ML is a powerful, effective, and robust analytic paradigm to handle complex and wicked problems such as a global pandemic. This study also explores the spatio-temporal aspects of lockdown and confinement measures on coronavirus diffusion, human mobility, and air quality. Additionally, we discuss policy implications, which will be helpful for policy makers to take prompt actions to moderate the severity of the pandemic and improve urban environments by adopting data-driven analytic methods.",

            "text": "As of January 20, 2021, more than 97 million people from 218 countries have been infected and 2.08 million people have died; this amounted to critical conditions in 0.4% of active cases and a fatality rate of about 3% of closed cases [16] , [17] . Aggregating the total number of confirmed infection cases and deaths by the World Health Organization (WHO), it is observed that countries in the Americas constitute the most affected region in the world, with about 43.87% of all confirmed cases and 47.61% of the deaths (Fig. 1) . Europe is the second most affected region with 32.18% of confirmed cases and 32.19% of deaths, followed by South-East Asia with 14.31% of confirmed cases and 10.03% of deaths. In contrast, the Western Pacific Region is the least affected with 1.34% of confirmed cases and 1.11% of deaths worldwide. Controlling the outbreak of COVID-19 has become a major concern of governments and public health professionals. Different measures such as stringent travel restrictions and self-quarantine measures (e.g., lockdown, emergency stayat-home orders, closing of public transportation systems, travel ban, restrictions on public gathering, closure of workplaces and educational institutions) and personal protective measures (e.g., face masks, gloves, hand sanitizer stations) have been implemented [2] , [10] [11] [12] , [18] [19] [20] throughout the world to control the COVID-19 outbreak. These various measures undertaken by governments have influenced both essential (e.g., work) and non-essential (e.g., recreation) trips. For example, lockdown measures undertaken in Singapore to mitigate the pandemic caused a 30% reduction in mobility [21] . A 64.6% reduction in private vehicle trips was observed in Rome, Italy, during lockdown periods of March-April 2020 [22] . Similarly, about 80%, 23%, and 2% reduction in public transport, cycling and bike-sharing, respectively, were observed in Budapest, Hungary [23] . In contrast, a 43 to 65% increase in car travel was reported in Budapest, Hungary, due to the voluntary practice of social distancing and avoidance of public transportation. Air transportation has also been devastated by this COVID-19 situation. Researchers have reported that Canadian Civil Aviation and military aviation activities dropped by 71% and 27%, respectively, compared to the business as usual situation [13] . Thus, the widespread diffusion of COVID-19 has adversely affected all modes of transportation.",

As a primary method of slowing down the spread of COVID-19, initially, a lot of countries imposed lockdown or confinement measures to enforce strict social distancing regulations. As a result, businesses and shops were closed, manufacturing activities were either stopped or shrunken while the number of vehicles in cities has declined dramatically [24] [25] [26] . Therefore, lockdown and confinement measures played a critical role in curtailing emissions and in improving overall air quality. Improved air quality refers to the reduction of concentration of criteria pollutants such as NO 2 , SO 2 , PM 10 , PM 2.5 , CO 2 in the air. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy demand decreased by 3.8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 because of the sudden reduction in economic activities and mobility [24] . Many recent studies on urban air quality have estimated the impacts of lockdown and confinement measures on various criteria pollutants. These studies mainly estimate the business as usual concentration of the pollutants for 2020 based on climate variables using ML algorithms. Finally, the impacts of the lockdown and confinement on air quality were assessed by comparing the estimated baseline concentration with actual concentration of pollutants in 2020. Some studies explored the relationship between pre-existing air pollu-VOLUME 9, 2021 tion and COVID-19 mortality rates in different sections of cities.",

With the advent of novel data technologies, methods of ML have been used extensively in disease prediction [27] [28] [29] , transportation modeling [30] , [31] , economic analysis [32] , [33] , environmental modeling [34] , [35] , public sentiment analysis [36] , [37] , etc. due to their remarkable computational ability to extract meaningful relationships between input and output features from large and complex datasets that are semantically diverse and that exhibit heterogeneous spatial and temporal granularity [38] . The problem at hand exhibits multi-scalarity (from the individual, to the family, the community, the region, the nation, and eventually the global humanity), and other properties such as endogeneity, non-linearity, non-independence, ambiguity and contextuality, that legitimately make them so-called ''wicked problems'' [39] , [40] . ML has proved very effective to tackle such problems. Learning-based algorithms can retrieve meaningful features from a large volume of data to predict outcome accurately and are able to reveal the hidden patterns in the data set that were previously unknown [41] [42] [43] . At variance with traditional data processing systems, ML algorithms build models based on existing data with little or no distributional requirements for future predictions or decision making, which increases their performance tremendously [44] .",

This figure depicts that the urban form and structure, people's socioeconomic characteristics, health factors, social networks, civic engagement, and different lockdown and confinement measures significantly influence the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, high population density and public places and spaces are positively associated with COVID-19 because of increased interaction among the people. Elderly people and people with certain health conditions are more vulnerable to COVID-19. Similarly, limited access to health resources (e.g., hospitals, clinics, physicians) increases the risks of the pandemic. On the other hand, strong agency and institutional compliance (i.e., limited social engagement) and lockdown and confinement measures significantly reduce community transmission of COVID-19. These factors also influence human mobility patterns, travel mode choice behaviors, and travel purposes. For example, usually, the people in high-density areas are more likely to use public transportation, active transportation (e.g., walking, bicycling), and less likely to use private cars. But during the COVID-19 situation, the elderly, children, and disabled people are less likely to use public transport and more likely to use private cars to reduce infection risk. The lockdown and confinement measures significantly reduce human mobility in both essential (e.g., work, healthcare facilities) and non-essential (e.g. parks, fitness centers) trips. People adjust their travel schedules and change travel patterns to avoid infection risks. Thus, there is a bidirectional relationship between human mobility and the spread of the virus. The severity of the pandemic also influences governments and decision makers to impose lockdown measures to reduce the infection rate or slow the pace of growth (the so-called ''flattening of the curve'').",

Originally published by MCFM, the figure has been modified and recreated by the authors to compare mode choice behaviors of people before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and the determinants in the selection of a particular mode of transportation during the pandemic. Travel time, cost, and convenience played a significant role in people's travel mode choices for business, commuting, and personal trips before COVID-19 and before similarly disruptive conditions. However, during this pandemic, reducing the risk of infection has become people's primary consideration in deciding on their travel mode. Thus, the use of personal cars, cycling, walking, and shared micro-mobility has outpaced the use of various forms of public transportation.",

Based on the data collected, these authors observed a reduction in subway ridership in May 2020 compared to the 2019 level. An agent-based simulation demonstrates that full reopening could only expect about 73% of the pre-pandemic transit ridership, but on the flip side, an increase in private car ridership by 142%. Similarly, the number of walking trips and bike trips would increase by 101% and 104% of the pre-pandemic levels, respectively. Applying a 50% capacity restriction on public transit to support the practice of social distancing, the study noted a predicted decrease in transit ridership to 64%, whereas car trips would increase by 143% and bike trips by 123%. Using a deep-learning based real-time video processing method of feature recognition, they found an increasing number of pedestrians at multiple locations in New York in May. They also observed a reduction in pedestrians practicing 6-feet social distancing guidelines from 91% on April 2 to 86% on May 27. Although pedestrian density was found low at some other locations, car and pedestrian density began to increase during the peak hour periods due to travel of essential workers, but the density of bicyclists was similar to the pre-pandemic situation. In a similar study context (i.e., Detroit, US), researchers in [58] investigated the impacts of the pandemic and social distancing measures on traffic volume on the transportation network and on safety. Collecting data from 73 signalized intersections, they mentioned that, aside from the continued dominance of car trips, the number of bicycle and motorcycle trips has mushroomed four-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of trucks and vans remains unchanged before and during the confinement and lockdown periods. However, a 40% increase in the number of trucks and vans was observed when restrictions were lifted. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic, reopening strategies, and confinement and lockdown measures have severe impacts on personal mobility and on the state of the urban transportation system more generally.",

Similarly, private car-sharing would increase from 78% to 79% in the post-pandemic scenario. However, despite a dramatic drop during the pandemic, transit ridership would return to its pre-existing conditions at around 40% on average across all surveyed countries. Similarly, shared micro-mobility and car-sharing would be slightly more popular (i.e., 1 to 2%) after returning to normal life. Thus, while travel mode choice behaviors of the people are found to be significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, people's overall travel patterns would be expected to bounce back to their state before the pandemic.",

Using data from the 2003 SARS outbreak, they trained a deep-learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to predict the social and economic impacts of the pandemic on the tourism industry. The trained model is calibrated considering the particulars of current situations (e.g., lockdown, flight bans) to simulate the impacts of a COVID-19-like pandemic on the tourism industry. The results indicate a significant drop in tourist arrivals in the US and Australia from China. Upon cross-validating the findings with backtesting techniques (i.e., the sample is split into smaller training sets and error is used to train the model), the researchers commented that it would require 6 and 12 months for tourist arrival rates to Australia and the US, respectively, to recover to their pre-pandemic levels after the recent collapse of the industry. They also mentioned that the LSTM technique performs better than other artificial neural networks (e.g., hidden Markov, Support Vector Regression) and forecasting models, such as ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average), to predict the impacts of COVID-19.",

The second, the Motor Gasoline Demand Estimation Module, estimates vehicle miles traveled on pandemic days, while considering the dynamic indices of travel mobility, and quantifies motor gasoline demand by coupling the gasoline demands and vehicle miles traveled.

For example, Yao et al. [58] evaluated the role of transportation (e.g., traffic volume, accident), social distancing measures, and weather conditions in the incidence of coronavirus confirmed cases. Calculating correlation coefficients, they found that daily confirmed cases are highly correlated with the transportation volume (e.g., cars), total crashes, social distancing indicators, and average temperature. Using the LSTM approach, they estimated the number of confirmed cases per day. Model results demonstrate that the inclusion of all selected features improved the performance of the model to predict daily confirmed cases with lower RMSE (0.0606), mean absolute error (MAE) (0.0378), and a high R 2 (0.9088). Thus, besides daily confirmed cases and the social distancing indicator in the previous days, the inclusion of traffic volume, crashes, and weather conditions significantly improves the predictive performance of the model. Considering daily inter-state traffic and air traffic data, including the number of transfer passengers, Shirvani et al. [64] predicted new confirmed cases in Iran. Using a supervised ML model consisting of an ensemble of linear regression, LASSO regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) regression, random forests, the model predicted the number of new cases with an accuracy of 85%. The study found a positive correlation between inter-state travel and new confirmed cases.

The final model was developed using a general linear model (GLM) that combines the predictions from all ML algorithms. The study showed that human mobility in the metropolitan areas was substantially reduced after implementing lockdown measures in mid-March. Scenario assessment results show that a 1-week and 2-week lockdown in Phase I reopening could reduce infections by 4-29% and 15-55% in the future week, respectively. However, a 2-week reopening in Phase II could increase infections by 16-80%. Thus, this study suggested a mandatory lockdown order lasting more than one week to control the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing community mobility and transmission. Researchers in [70] investigated the non-linear relationships of COVID-19 death rates with environmental, health, socioeconomic, and demographic risk factors using geographically weighted random forests (GW-RF) non-parametric regression model in the US. Collecting county-level daily death counts in 3,108 counties, the model showed that walking trips to work, concentration of air pollutants, households with a mortgage, unemployment status, and percent of black or African Americans have a strong correlation with the spatial distribution of COVID-19 incidence with an R 2 of 0.78.",

The model was combined with the data assimilation (i.e., Kalman Filter) and ML techniques (i.e., Walktrap network) to reconstruct the COVID-19 trajectories. The Walktrap network partitions the counties into clusters based on the observed human mobility data. A local SEIR model for each region was developed using geographic, socioeconomic, cultural and transportation factors of the people to get a region-specific effective reproduction number. Finally, the combined model helps to investigate the associations of COVID-19 diffusion with mobility patterns, business foottraffic, race, and age groups. The study found a strong association between reproduction number and visits to drinking establishments (alcoholic beverages). It is suggested that policy makers should explicitly consider the local transmission scenario even after restricting intra-regional movement for preventing more health disparities in future pandemics. In another North American country (i.e., Labrador and Newfoundland in Canada), Linka et al. [71] explored the impact of partial and total reopening of airports on COVID-19 outbreaks with SEIR and Bayesian Interference models. Using data on air-traffic mobility incoming and outgoing from/to other Canadian provinces and the US with different measures of quarantine, the study found that relaxing travel restrictions is possible entirely (total reopening). However, strict (100%) quarantine conditions are necessary to control the disease outbreak. Voluntary quarantine, even at an overall rate of 95%, is not enough to entirely prevent future outbreaks. Thus, strict policies on quarantine after entering the city are essential to control the massive outbreak of the pandemic.",

Collecting information on COVID-19 patient's geographic location, travel, health, and demographic features, the study developed the prediction model using a grid search algorithm which provides a set of best-performing parameters. The model results indicate that the proposed fine-tuned model correctly predicts the outcomes with an accuracy of 94% and an F1 score of 0.86.

The results show a higher correlation (0.68) and the least MAE. Thus, these measures have a significant influence on the coronavirus infection rate. Dividing lockdown efficiency into four categories from Group A (highest efficiency) to B, C, and D (lowest efficiency), they found higher efficiency in Australia and South Korea. Efficiency improved significantly from group D to group B, group D to group C, and group C to B in Germany, Spain, and India, respectively. Despite not having strict lockdown measures, South Korea showed high efficiency due to widespread self-quarantine and self-awareness in the population.

With an R 2 value of 0.79 for training and 0.76 for testing, the model showed a robust estimation of the transmission rate as a function of policy instruments. Thus, various policy instruments have a significant influence on future transmission. This study concluded that state agencies could ensemble policy instruments in a structured way for data-driven decision making. Similarly, Badr et al. [73] studies the social distancing index based on population mobility of 25 American counties. Using the mobility data from Teralytics (Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland), they found a 35-63% reduction in mobility compared to normal conditions due to restrictions imposed on mobility. The study also shows a strong correlation between population adherence to strict social distancing directives and COVID-19 cases reduction in the US.",

With data assembled from multiple sources (e.g., WHO, CDC, NY Times, US Census, Google, and Apple), they evaluated COVID-19 situations in different geographic regions. The results demonstrate that the SIRNET model is able to predict coronavirus cases by region using mobility information. They observed that low mobility in a population group has a significant impact on reducing the COVID-19 cases in this population.

To demonstrate this point, we further investigated the impacts of social distancing practices on human mobility and COVID-19 daily confirmed cases using the data collected from [72] for the period of January 1 to December 26, 2020, Fig. 6 . As anticipated, the results indicate a negative correlation of the social distancing index with daily trips per person. Intuitively, there should be a negative correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 cases and the daily trips per person; however, at first blush there is no significant correlation to be found. This emphasizes the criticality of reliable data collected over time across varied communities, but also the importance of a modeling framework suitable for the handling of complex, multiple and possibly non-linear relationships and of the socio-spatial contexts of individual decisions, social group dynamics, and public policy elements [74] .

It also demonstrated that the performance of the prediction model increases substantially when the modeling of disease transmission is integrated with mobility, social distancing measures, and other socio-demographic covariates (e.g., population, median age, number of hospitals and ICU beds, percentage of smokers and diabetic patients, and heart disease mortality). Estimating Poisson regression, the study mentioned that the reproduction number is positively associated with mobility changes in retail/recreation and grocery/pharmacy.

The system is proposed for adoption in the various segments of the public transportation system (buses/trams/trains, railway/subway stations, and bus stops) to (i) monitor and predict crowding events, (ii) adapt public transport system operations in real time (i.e., modifying service frequency, timetables, routes, and so on), and (iii) inform the users by electronic displays installed in correspondence of the bus stops/stations and/or by mobile transport applications. Another study used a ML driven intelligent approach to trace daily train travelers in different age cohorts of 16-59 years and over 60 (i.e., vulnerable age-group) to recommend certain times and routes for safe traveling [78] .

Researchers in [88] mentioned that improved air quality during the quarantine period avoided a total of 8,911 NO 2 -related deaths in China (i.e., about 6% of normal deaths in China). Another study [93] estimated that improved air quality has saved at least 19% of premature deaths because of regular respiratory illness and 11% year of life lost. Moreover, a number of studies also reported an increase in O 3 due to the reduction of other pollutants (i.e., NO 2 , PM 2.5 ) [91] , [92] , [94] . For example, researchers in [92] estimated a 30% increase in ozone concentration in the urban areas of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Despite a significant decrease in the concentration of primary pollutants (i.e., SO 2 5-28%, NO 2 1-33%, CO 5-41%, PM 10 1.4-30%), the concentration of O 3 increased by 0.5-103% in Iran [94] . Thus, improving air quality has associated benefits which points to the need to undertake an integrated policy option to reduce air pollution in the urban areas to protect public health. Fig. 7 illustrates daily mean air quality changes in 2020 compared to 2019 in North America and Europe. The changes in five criteria pollutants in major cities are mapped to understand the overall impacts of lockdown measures, travel cutbacks, and pause in industrial production on air quality. Many recent studies confirmed that air quality improved due to these factors overall. However, as Fig. 7 indicates, quality improvement may vary across pollutants and geographic locations. The concentration of NO 2 decreased significantly in most of the cities in Europe and North America. It is observed that the pandemic seems to have a limited and no impact on SO 2 concentration. An opposite scenario can be observed for O 3 concentration which is increased significantly in most cities. This is probably because of the fact that O 3 formation depends on the availability of other pollutants. The concentration of particulate matters mostly decreased in cities of Europe, whereas it is increased in most of the mid-eastern cities in the USA. Although, there could be many factors associated with air quality, Fig. 7 indicates the impact of the level of various aspects of the pandemic, including lockdown measures. Europe has been under much stricter lockdown measures compared to North America. As a result, most of the criteria pollutants are shown to have decreased in Europe.",

Due to lockdown measures, human mobility is reduced, and the majority of industries are closed; hence, emissions of PM have been reduced substantially. Some researchers have investigated the level of PM in the air during lockdown periods and compared the results to pre-COVID-19 situations to assess the changes in air quality. For example, Mallik et al. [96] estimated the concentration of PM 2.5 in the city of Kanpur, India for three different lockdown phases: pre, during, and post lockdown conditions in relation to the pandemic. They used four different ML approaches to estimate PM 2.5 from remote sensing-based MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data and meteorological parameters, including temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, wind speed, and mixing height. A hybrid ML approach that combines ANN and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) shows the highest performance for the estimation of PM 2.5 . The hybrid approach outperformed (R 2 = 0.96) Linear Regression (LR) (R 2 = 0.016), MLR (R 2 = 0.246) and ANN (R 2 = 0.895) models. The authors compared the estimated PM 2.5 of this year with the previous year and reported 4% and 47% reduction in PM 2.5 during the lockdown and post-lockdown condition, respectively. From the analysis, they concluded that PM 2.5 is reduced because of the reduction in emissions from industries and transport vehicles.",

For that purpose, they built a synthetic counterfactual estimation of air quality based on meteorological variables using the Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor. The model was trained on atmospheric data between 2012 and 2019 from 227 weather stations, where meteorological variables are the predictor variables and air qualities are the predicted variables. Like other studies, they also considered calendar variables such as the day of the year to capture the trend over time. Unlike other studies, they utilized a ratio between PM 2.5 and PM 10 as an additional predictor variable to avoid the impact of the pollutants transported from a long distance, such as mass dust from the Caspian Sea. The correlation value over 0.87 between observed and predicted values before lockdown indicates the strength of the model. The result shows that lockdown reduced the concentration of PM 2.5 and NO 2 by 3.84 \u00b5g/m 3 (16%) and 10.85 \u00b5g/m 3 (33%), respectively. Some other studies also reported the role of lockdown measures in the reduction of PM 2.5 concentration in the atmosphere [111] , [112] . A study estimated a reduction of PM 2.5 by 7% in European countries [109] . Similarly, another study shows an average reduction of 14.2% in PM 10 compared to estimated concentration in 2020 and 11% reduction compared to the historical mean value between 2014 and 2019 [97] . In a developing country context, a study reported a 26% to 54.2% reduction in the level of PM 2.5 concentration during full and partial lockdown scenario in Dhaka, Bangladesh [102] .",

Four different pollutants (NO 2 , O 3 , PM 10 , and O x ) were estimated based on meteorological data series, including air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, wind direction, and air pressure. The Random Forest algorithm was trained by the historical meteorological variables and pollutants data between 2014 and 2019. Based on the relationship between meteorological variables and pollutants level, air quality was estimated for the lockdown period. Finally, the estimated values were compared with observed values at the five monitoring stations to evaluate the impact of lockdown on air quality. The results show an average reduction of 36.9% in NO 2 due to the lockdown effect.

Experts mentioned that the reduction in traffic emission is largely responsible for increasing O 3 concentrations [112] . For instance, researchers in [97] observed that O 3 concentration increased significantly between 11.6% to 33.8% during the lockdown period in Graz, Austria, which can be explained by the reduction of the NO \u2212 O 3 titration cycle when NO x emission was low during the lockdown. Similarly, O 3 concentration increased by up to 50% in some locations of the world where NO 2 was also reduced significantly [98] . However, the response of O 3 is nonlinear to the reduction of NO 2 . Some cities such as Beijing and Madrid show very little difference in O 3 , while having declines in NO 2 comparable with other cities. The study in Dhaka, Bangladesh [102] also observed a 9.7% to 31% reduction in O 3 concentration during full and partial lockdown scenarios, respectively, compared to the pre-COVID situation. Thus, it can be concluded that the overall level of O 3 increased significantly during the lockdown periods in many parts of the world.",

The study used Reduced-spaced Gaussian Process Regression and ANN models. The result indicates that the industrial area shows a higher number of infections compared to other land use zones.

The result shows that COVID-19 fatality is positively correlated with a few air pollutants such as O 3 , SO 2 , and NH 3 . Moreover, results from three different ML algorithms indicate that NH 3 , NO 2 , and PM 10 are the important factors of COVID-19 related fatalities. Similar to other studies around the world, this study also shows that there is a significant increase in ozone and toluene concentration in the air because of the lockdown measures. Thus, an increase in surface ozone may augment the fatality rates. A study in [108] based on the Random Forest algorithm investigated the impact of air pollution, rather than direct person-to-person contamination, on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Interestingly, compared to lifestyle or socio-economic factors, air quality played the most significant role in pandemic diffusion and severity. A 5-10% increase in air pollution in Italy may cause an additional rise of 21-32% in the COVID-19 toll, having 4-14% more deaths. These findings were achieved by analyzing epidemiological data on COVID-19 positivity, mortality, and air quality index of 20 Italian regions and 99 Italian provinces from 2015 to 2019. Furthermore, it is estimated that about 70% of COVID-19 deaths nationwide might be due to emissions from industries, farms, and road traffic.",

In 25 major Indian cities, Mele and Magazzino [110] investigated the relationships between economic growth, pollution emissions, and COVID-19 related deaths using time series analysis and ML based complex causality algorithm (D2C). Time-series econometric analysis indicated that there is a strong unidirectional correlation between economic growth and concentration of PM 2.5 , CO 2 , and NO 2 . The ML algorithm confirmed a causal relationship between the concentration of PM 2.5 , CO 2 , NO 2 , and COVID-19 deaths. Thus, air pollutants have a direct relationship with the COVID-19 pandemic-related death, with the largest influence from PM 2.5 . Prolonged exposure to PM 2.5 causes acute health problems (e.g., asthma, cough, loss of cardiac or lung capacity), which results in fatalities. The results are consistent with other studies conducted in the US [127] , where the researchers found that a 1 \u00b5g/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 concentration causes an increase in the mortality rate by 15%. Thus, exposure to PM 2.5 aggravates the symptoms of COVID-19 with heightened risks of mortality.",

Their IoT-based model could be exploited to get a deeper understanding of the influence of air pollution on the pandemic. It can also be helpful to anticipate the increased susceptibility of individuals due to exposure and eventually to predict new outbreaks. Recently, Cole et al. [107] have developed a meteorological normalization technique based on the random forest algorithm in combination with the augmented synthetic control method to quantify the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on air pollution and public health in Wuhan, China. Investigating the hourly data of four pollutants (SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, PM 10 ) in 30 cities of China between January 2013 and February 2020, the model reported a 63% reduction (a drop of 24 \u00b5g/m 3 ) of NO 2 with respect to pre-lockdown levels. Even though the study found no significant impact of lockdown on SO 2 or CO, it indicated the reduction of NO 2 could have prevented a total of 3,368 deaths in the City of Wuhan and 10,822 deaths in the whole of P.R. China. Mirri et al. (2020) [105] used eight different ML models to predict the possibility of a resurgence (second wave) of the COVID-19 pandemic in all nine provinces of Emilia-Romagna, Italy for the period of September-December 2020; Emilia-Romagna was one of the most severely afflicted regions during the first phase of the pandemic from February to April 2020. They trained the models with data on COVID-19 confirmed cases from February to July 2020, and the daily measurements of PM 2.5 , PM 10 and NO 2 in the periods of September-December 2017/2018/2019. The results from the models demonstrated that the gradient boosting model performs better, with an accuracy of 90%, to predict the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic. Conducting a sensitivity analysis, the study commented that the use of personal protective measures has a significant impact to downgrade the likelihood of a second wave in the nine provinces of Emilia-Romagna.",

One important question arising here is that of the motivation for using ML to predict air quality rather than statistical or econometric models. The answer may lie in the fact that these studies are investigating the effect of lockdown measures on air quality in the current situation instead of the simple comparison between the current value and historical values. Since air quality is significantly influenced by meteorological factors, a simple statistical or econometric model may not capture the true effect of lockdown on the concentration of air pollutants. Thus, machine learning to estimate air quality considering all these factors may provide a better understanding of the lockdown and confinement effects [97] .",

Hass and Jokar Arsanjani [134] explored the spreading of COVID-19 in Europe and associated geographical factors that contribute to virus diffusion using a data-driven method. Applying a spatial autocorrelation approach, this study identified countries in western and central Europe (e.g., Spain, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Czech Republic) as the hot spots of the pandemic, and areas (e.g., Norway, Finland, Iceland, Greece, and Cyprus) that are isolated and less populated as statistical cold spots. The study also conducted emerging hot spot analysis using space-time autocorrelation to locate the hot and cold spots of COVID-19 over space and time (i.e., how many times a region becomes hot or cold spot). Applying 90% and 75% time interval settings, the study observed that most of the countries showed no significant changes. At the 90% time interval, new hot spots are found in parts of Italy, Austria, Croatia, and Poland, which were cold spots at an earlier time. Some parts of Ireland and Scotland are found to be oscillating cold spots (i.e., cold spot but also been hot spot once). In contrast, some parts of Finland are found to be intensifying cold spots due to the low infection rate. This emerging hot spot technique is very helpful for the policymakers to decide which control measures need to make tighter or to relax and where to intervene.",

Many ML researchers have seized the opportunity to make their analytics relevant to the pressing needs of this time due to the convergence of data through cloud storage and data sharing via the interactive platform, and powerful analytic tools [148] . ML is very effective and well suited to handling notoriously wicked problems of epidemiology (i.e., multi-scalarity, non-linearity, feedback effects, and so on), and it has proved itself worthwhile in previous research [149] [150] [151] . ML techniques predict outcomes with a higher rate of accuracy and reveal the hidden patterns in the data compared to traditional data processing systems. ML also allows to integrate multiple modeling approaches to handle complex and large data sets contrary to conventional methods, which are more in line with the ''one size fits all'' principle. So, ML explicitly captures the context, whether spatial, social or environmental, as well as contextual changes; thus, predictions are adjusted accordingly, which is challenging to handle using traditional statistical and econometric approaches. Considering the enormous demand and potentials, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has initiated a series of transdisciplinary conversations in the form of webinars at the intersection of public health, behavioral and social sciences, smart technologies and data analytics to catalyze ideas that can further the research and development at the frontier of predictive intelligence for pandemic prevention [152] .",

            "text": "After critically analyzing the past studies on the emergence and evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study observed the circumstances that amplify or mitigate the pandemic situation. In particular, factors of urban form, socio-economic and physical conditions of people, social cohesion, and social distancing measures significantly influence human mobility and stimulate the diffusion of the virus. Thus, social, physical, and institutional structures and the tendency of people to follow social distancing measures are influential in changing travel patterns and determine the severity of the pandemic in a city or larger national territory. Human mobility and COVID-19 pandemic exhibit bidirectional relationships. During the COVID-19 period, people tend to travel less and are more likely to use private transportation for necessary travel purposes to mitigate coronavirus-related health problems. This review study also found that lockdown measures imposed in the wake of the pandemic significantly reduce the concentration of air pollutants and improve air quality due to reduced energy consumption in transportation and industries. This improved air quality also ameliorates the COVID-19 situation by reducing respiratory disease in the population. As a core approach to predictive analytics, ML is well positioned to bring newly learned inductive knowledge to the practice of pandemic prevention and management, but also to transform theories of pandemics through abductive inference. Moreover, studies investigating spatio-temporal impacts of lockdown measures mentioned that government-sanctioned control measures have significant impact on coronavirus diffusion, human mobility, and air quality spatially and temporally. Thus, data-driven spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 transmission and timely interventions of the policy measures can control the pandemic and reduce associated health risks.",

            "text": "Despite the well-developed models we have on hand, convincing findings, and significant contributions from COVID-19 related mobility and air quality studies, the overall achievements of past studies are somewhat subdued by some recognizable reasons and hence there is scope for future research. We state some areas below. First, some studies used a limited number of variables to predict coronavirus cases and deaths, which may overlook other important factors that could influence disease transmission [54] , [60] , [63] . Thus, future research should combine data from other sources such as social media, mass media, people's contacts with a special call center for COVID-19, mobile contract tracing, environmental and climate factors, and screening registries [54] . Moreover, some researchers predicted COVID-19 cases for a limited period (i.e., only for the next 10-12 days), which seems insufficient to assess the performance of a model as a predictive tool and these models have limited scope to adjust parameters with changing spatial and temporal contexts [83] , [162] . VOLUME 9, 2021 Second, some studies only investigated the impact of mobility patterns on the infection rate [45] , [63] , [64] . However, other factors (e.g., late government action, international travel, social structure, people's socio-economic factors) may influence coronavirus cases and deaths. Thus, for more accurate and more meaningful prediction, these factors should be included in the models. Moreover, these studies mostly used mobility data (i.e., mobile device location based on GPS) from Google, Apple, and SafeGraph [7] , [53] , [55] , [57] , [59] , [61] , [62] . These mobility reports provide inadequate information about people's mobility since many of them may disable location settings in their mobile devices or may not have Android/iOS supported mobile. Moreover, some countries may not have reliable internet access and do not support Google services (e.g., Iran, China), which may affect the quality and completeness of the data infrastructure. Researchers in [52] suggested exploring additional information (e.g., vehicle miles traveled, number of miles traveled per person, trips per person, travel mode share) may explicitly consider those uncertainties to develop a more trusted model. Third, researchers have been unable to determine an association between COVID-19 transmission and population characteristics in some high-incidence areas due to the difficulty to identify whether the cases have a local (i.e., community) or international origin [50] . Moreover, the true magnitude of the viral infection incidence is unknown due to asymptomatic individuals, differences in testing and reporting, and misdiagnosis, which makes the modeling very challenging. Some studies did not report the accuracy level, which calls into question the validity of the model [49] . Thus, studies should incorporate some baselines (e.g., traditional fitting models) and other metrics for model evaluation (e.g., RMSE, summary statistics across bins, confusion matrix, cross-validation, etc.) [55] .",

A number of studies also used satellite imagery to estimate the level of pollutants without considering the seasonal effects [163] , [164] . It is evident that air quality improves gradually from winter to summer. Therefore, there is conventional seasonal air quality. It is difficult to reliably establish the effect of lockdown measures without considering seasonal change. Changes in air pollutants during lockdown periods are not necessarily induced by reduced human mobility and economic activity, but they could also be attributed to weather variability coupled with the ongoing COVID-19 [165] . Thus, it is recommended to include seasonal variables in models to estimate the effects of lockdown measures on air quality to avoid any spurious and misleading relationships.",

However, long duration travel in shared and crowded modes (e.g., air, bus, train, etc.) may transmit the contagious disease easily. Previous studies have demonstrated that airborne diffusion of coronavirus in a closed environment during human expiratory activities (e.g., sneezing, coughing, talking, and breathing) [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] . Thus, coexisting in a closed environment (e.g., public transportation) with other people increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission, where practicing social distancing is difficult. A study investigating the possibility of COVID-19 transmission under different scenarios (i.e., no face mask, 50% of people with face mask, 100% people with face mask) is necessary to provide some guidelines (e.g., cleaning, ventilation) to increase transit ridership in the pandemic situation. Hence, this is an important direction for future research.",
