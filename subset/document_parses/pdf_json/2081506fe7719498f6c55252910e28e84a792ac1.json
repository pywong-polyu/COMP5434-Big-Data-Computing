INTRODUCTION C ases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still on the rise, across the globe. 1 During this ongoing COVID-19 crisis, elective surgeries have been postponed to a large extent to protect health care workers and to preserve hospital resources to manage the increasing number of patients with COVID-19. At present, only emergency cases are being managed in many centers worldwide. 2 However, most of our neurosurgical patients present late in the course of disease, where watchful waiting may be detrimental. Rescheduling the surgeries for an uncertain period of time may be inappropriate. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also has classified neurosurgery as tier 3a (high acuity surgery).",

However, the presence of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in the bone dust generated while operating on patients positive for COVID-19 has not been confirmed, thereby the rationale for avoiding surgeries is based on speculation rather than evidence. We attempted to find the presence of SARS CoV-2 virus in the generated aerosols during neurosurgical procedures on COVID-19epositive cases. The result of this study, therefore, would alleviate or confirm the fears of performing craniotomies on patients positive for COVID-19.

This reduced the risk of direct exposure to aerosols generated due to possible coughing during intubation. The neurosurgical procedure was performed, and the bone dust generated during craniotomy/craniostomy was collected in the specimen vial. Scrapings from paranasal and other air sinuses were obtained in case these were opened during the procedure. The decision to extubate depended on preoperative neurologic status and intraoperative events. Glycopyrrolate (10 mg/kg) and neostigmine (50 mg/kg) were administered to reduce secretions and reverse the neuromuscular blockade.

            "text": "The virus has been detected in blood samples of 10%e40% of patients positive for COVID-19. This includes asymptomatic carriers as well. [6] [7] [8] In human body, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and instigates a potentially harmful inflammatory cascade. Apart from the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and alveolar epithelium, these receptors are also found in bone marrowederived stem cells. 8, 9 Study on the biodistribution did not show viral RNA in brain tissue 8 ; however, in keeping the high magnitude of safety, a biological rationale was adopted to restrict all aerosol-generating procedures during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In neurosurgical practice, the use of high-speed drills especially in the vicinity of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid also was considered potentially hazardous for transmitting the virus in the OR. Several mitigation strategies like use of powered air-purifying respirators and negative suction in the OR also were proposed to conduct surgical procedures in COVID-19epositive/suspected patients. However, such facilities may not be easily available, especially in the resource-restricted nations. In addition, the risk of viral shedding during craniotomies is speculative and hasn't been proved. Unfortunately, the trepidation among neurosurgeons is largely based on this presumption. This has affected neurosurgical procedures alike on patients who test negative and positive for COVID-19. The aerosols generated during drilling of calvarial bone including the mastoid in active patients did not demonstrate any evidence of viral RNA. Having said that the risk of spread of virus during such procedures is probably hypothetical, it is not clear yet if the viral load in the aerosol generated is proportional to the amount of viral RNA in blood of the infected patient. Ninety percent of our patients had moderate viral load in nasopharynx, yet none of them revealed any viral RNA in the bone dust generated. Interestingly, none of the patients had COVID-19erelated symptoms. Although the viral load in nasopharynx was moderate, it is possible that viral load in blood of these patients was low. With low blood viral load, the load in the bone dust would be theoretically negligible. Another fact to be considered is the heat generated during bone drilling. 10 It has been shown that temperatures rise nearly to 150 C. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is heat-labile and such a high temperature is likely to kill the virus. Contrary to the belief it may be safer to use a drill to perform craniotomies. There are several limitations to this study. The study group is very small, and a larger study cohort is required to confirm our findings. Further, the paranasal sinuses weren't opened in any of these cases, as they may probably harbor this virus in patients with active COVID-19.",
