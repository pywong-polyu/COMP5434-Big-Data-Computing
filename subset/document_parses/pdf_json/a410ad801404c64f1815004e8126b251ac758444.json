In this study, we were interested in how social withdrawal was related to well-being in different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another important aim of the present study was to examine whether different subtypes of social withdrawal could be identified in Chinese adults in the context of the pandemic.",

From a different perspective, it is also possible that the deprivation of face-to-face communication due to the confinement policies is a relief for shy people, who may take this opportunity to engage in online social interaction without feeling fearful as they normally would when they engage in in-person social situations (Appel & Gnambs, 2019; Chak & Leung, 2004) .

The original sample was reassessed monthly from mid-February (Time 2; the peak phase of the pandemic in China) to mid-June 2020 (Time 6; the mitigation phase of the pandemic in China). Therefore, the duration of this study covered different phases of the pandemic, during which the infected cases in China surged and then steadily declined.",

The intercorrelations among all 18 items showed that item 15 (\"How concerned or worried about your health have you been?\") generally did not correlate with other items. Further examination illustrated that the translation of this item was not accurate, such that \"concern\" has been translated into \"guanxin (care for)\" in Chinese.

Then, a 4-class k-means cluster analysis was performed to further classify all the cases into four subgroups. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 3 , there were 43 cases (19.4%) in the social avoidance group (high levels of both shyness and unsociability), 57 cases (25.7%) in the shyness group (high levels of shyness and low levels of unsociability), 45 cases (20.3%) in the unsociability group (high levels of unsociability but low levels of shyness), and 77 cases (34.7%) in the non-withdrawal group (low levels of both shyness and unsociability). A follow-up multivariate analysis of variance suggested significant differences in the levels of shyness (F (3, 218) = 268.15, p < .001) and unsociability (F (3, 218) = 251.04, p < .001) across four subgroups.",

Based on previous studies (Cao et al., 2020; Gerhold, 2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) , we controlled for participants' gender, age, and monthly income as confounding variables. In addition, given that the participants came from 26 provinces, which have different distances to Wuhan, we calculated the correlation between distance from the capital of the province to Wuhan and wellbeing. Analyses showed that the distance from Wuhan was not significantly correlated with well-being across six waves (rs = \u2212 0.12 to 0.03, ps > 0.14). Therefore, in our sample, the distance to Wuhan did not influence the assessments of well-being and was not considered as a control variable in formal analyses. The results of the comparisons of trajectory parameters among clusters are presented in Table 2 (for 95% CI of the estimated coefficients of each comparison, see Table S2 ). Specifically, the social avoidance group reported the lowest levels of well-being at both the initial and the mitigation phases (i.e., intercepts at Time 1 and Time 6). Though higher than the social avoidance group, levels of well-being reported by individuals in the shyness and unsociability groups were lower than that reported by the non-withdrawal group at the initial phase (i.e., intercept at Time 1) and the mitigation phase (i.e., intercept at Time 6). In addition, the decrease (i.e., slope) in well-being from the initial phase (Time 1) to the peak phase (Time 2) in both the non-withdrawal and the unsociability group were larger than that in the social avoidance group. The decrease was also more salient in the unsociability group than the shyness group. Furthermore, the recovery (i.e., slope) in well-being after the peak COVID-19 phase was faster in the non-withdrawal and unsociability groups than that in the shyness group. ",

After the peak phase of the pandemic in mid-February, the wellbeing of the overall sample steadily recovered. These results echoed some previous studies finding decreased levels of psychological distress and increased levels of well-being in the general population at follow-up assessments several weeks later, as compared with the point of outbreak (Fried et al., 2020; Stieger et al., 2020) . However, several studies did not find significant changes in well-being or maladaptive responses (Planchuelo-G\u00f3mez et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , perhaps because these studies included only two, or, at most, three-time points, lasting for about one or two months in total, which might be insufficient for detecting the general trend of well-being across various phases of the pandemic. Based on six time points of assessments over a relatively long period, our study suggested that whereas individuals reported dramatically increased problems at the initial outbreak of the pandemic, their well-being recovered as the spread of the virus being controlled.",

First, targeted intervention for people with different social withdrawal subtypes during the pandemic is needed. For example, it is important to help shy people develop social skills to handle challenges in social interactions, which can help them overcome worries and fear in difficult situations. For unsociable people, motivating them to engage in social interactions may be useful. Intervention for socially avoidant individuals may be the most challenging given their characteristics of both shyness and unsociability. It may be necessary to use multiple strategies including social skill training, encouragement for social interactions, and other efforts.",

            "text": "In addition, because socially withdrawn individuals have few interactions with others, positive family relationships may be particularly important and can serve as a resource for them to mitigate psychological distress. Researchers and professionals may incorporate family-based intervention programs in helping withdrawn people in adverse circumstances. It has been found that the characteristics of social withdrawal subtypes among Chinese people today are similar to those in North America and other countries (e.g., Bowker & Raja, 2011; Coplan et al., 2006 Coplan et al., , 2013 . Therefore, the results of the present study may provide valuable information for improving the well-being of social withdrawn individuals in countries that are still in the process of combating the pandemic.",

First, the severity of the pandemic and the enforcement of the confinement measures paralleled each other, making it difficult to differentiate the impact of the pandemic itself from the socially isolating nature of the quarantine on the public's well-being. It is necessary for future studies to collect information about the perceived severity of the pandemic and the quantity and quality of social interaction during the pandemic. Second, the current study concentrated on the levels and trajectories of wellbeing among different social withdrawal subtypes. We did not examine the processes involved in the associations between withdrawal and well-being. It is important for future studies to explore social and cognitive factors that contribute to the links between social withdrawal and well-being. Third, self-reported measures were used in the present study. Future studies will benefit from using multi-method and multiinformant designs to examine the links between social withdrawal and well-being. Despite the limitations, the current study made a significant contribution to our understanding of different social withdrawal subtypes in Chinese adults and their well-being in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
