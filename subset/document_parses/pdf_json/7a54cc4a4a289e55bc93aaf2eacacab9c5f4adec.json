The planned behavior theory presents attitudes, subjective norms, perceived sense of behavioral control, etc., as leading variables that determine behavioral intentions, and explains the decision-making process in which specific actions are performed through influencing relationships between the variables. Intention is the most direct and immediate precursor to predicting behavior [14] . Recently, many studies have attempted to expand the theory by adding new factors to those in the original model (attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls) to enhance the model's ability to elucidate the process of tourism behavior, in order to contribute to a greater understanding of the influential factors [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

We analyzed the tourist decision-making process during the current pandemic using the theory of planned behavior as a framework, adding variables relevant to the pandemic, such as risk perception and risk reduction behavior, to the model. Considering that people continue to visit natural tourist attractions such as national parks, we conducted a survey of visitors to verify the correlations between COVID-19 risk perceptions, risk reduction behaviors, and the theory of planned behavior. Existing studies [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] suggest that the higher the level of risk perceived by tourists, the more likely they are to engage in risk-reducing behaviors, warranting this study's examination of COVID-19 risk perceptions and risk-reduction behaviors as additional variables expanding the theory of planned behavior.",

In particular, visits to national parks affect both the positive correlation and personal abilities of individuals as well as the compliant groups, such as attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls. Perceived behavioral control has the greatest impact on intention to visit, and the trail where the survey was conducted is accessible using a private vehicle.

As this may lead to frequent exploration of national parks, it is also necessary for the government to carry out more active measures that promote social distancing in certain situations.",

A visit to a national park is one of the few methods of relieving social stress caused by the spread of infectious diseases, such as \"corona blue.\" Therefore, the government should consider ways to temporarily open some of the trails that have been closed, in order to meet tourists' needs when reviewing measures to prevent social distancing. In addition, it is necessary to establish a smart technology system, such as developing an app that can provide a congestion index by trail in real time, such as a congestion management system. It is also necessary to improve the maintenance of sanitation and cleanliness of indoor facilities, such as toilets and visiting information centers.",
