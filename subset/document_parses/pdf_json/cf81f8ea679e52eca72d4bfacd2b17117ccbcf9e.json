All the Brazilian states were represented, but most participants were from the southeast (62%). Table 1 presents the sample characterization. Table 1 shows a predominance of women in the three groups, with a partner and/or children, 9 years of work experience on average, with a position in a COVID-19 referral center, working in the frontline, and reporting a concern with being infected or with the risk of infecting a family member. Regarding the physicians' group, a smaller share of women composes this group along with a larger number of people living alone. This group also differs from the remaining because it gathers older and more experienced participants. The percentage of nursing professionals working in public hospitals is larger than that of other professionals, while physicians predominate in tertiary hospitals. More nursing professionals are working in the frontline against the COVID-19 and are also the least satisfied with their employers' physical and mental protective measures. Note that all the groups reported low levels of satisfaction with protective measures. The group composed of nursing workers and workers from other professions presented the highest percentage of individuals concerned with being infected by the Sars-CoV-2 and individuals receiving social and emotional support from co-workers. No differences were found between the groups in relation the variables extra workload (most answered yes), desire to quit the job (most answered no), and positive professional prospects (most answered yes). The initial differences regarding a concern with the possibility of infecting family members and a perception that people avoided contact due to their work did not remain in the post hoc analyses. Table 2 presents the groups' mental health indicators and shows that all the groups presented considerably high indicators of mental health problems (>36%), mainly nursing workers, who present significantly higher indicators of anxiety, depression, and insomnia than the remaining groups. The percentage of problems linked to insomnia was the most expressive among all workers. Comparatively, the physicians presented the lowest percentage of problems linked to insomnia. No differences were found between the groups with regard posttraumatic stress, which presented the lowest percentages. Table 3 presents the final logistic regression models for each of the outcomes and groups. This table shows that occupational factors stood out compared to sociodemographic factors in terms of potential risk and occupational protective measures. Among the protective factors, having positive professional prospects stood out in all the groups for all psychopathological outcomes. The support provided by co-workers also emerged as an important protective variable, especially among the physicians. Being satisfied with the physical protective measures adopted by the employing institution was the most important protective factor for the groups composed of nursing workers and workers from other professions. Being older was the only protective factor linked to sociodemographic variables that remained in the predictive model for the outcomes anxiety/stress in the three groups; the likelihood of not experiencing pathological levels of anxiety/stress increased from 3 to 5% with every additional year of experience. Being a man and having more years of experience in the profession were protective factors for the physicians' group.",

Extra working hours during the pandemic, combined with direct contact with infected patients and social isolation measures, which often involve distancing themselves from their loved ones to avoid contagion, impose additional pressure on these women, especially when they have children and/or elderly relatives at home (16) .

Living alone was associated with less frequent anxiety disorders among these workers (47) . In this study, living alone possibly explains why these workers are less afraid of contaminating family members. Professional experience also contributed to less frequent mental health problems, as reported by an Australian study in which older medical workers reported significantly lower levels of depression than workers from other professions (39) .",

The reason is that the context of a public hospital in Brazil is very different from that of a private hospital in terms of human and material resources. Moreover, few public hospitals are considered centers of excellence, providing low-quality services and dealing with a high demand of patients. These factors, coupled with low salaries and few benefits, directly impact working conditions and occupational safety against many risks (52, 53) . Previous studies report that healthcare providers from private institutions enjoy improved mental health (51) while working in the frontline against COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and distress (11) . Additionally, excess workload, longer hours delivering care (15) , and mainly fear of being infected by Sars-CoV-2 represented risk factors for mood and stress problems in the nursing group. This finding is relevant, considering that this group reported a higher rate of contamination, which seems to reflect peculiarities of the profession that involves close and constant contact with patients (13) ; which is an important contamination risk in the COVID-19 context (1). Magnavita et al. (54) report that nurses are the workers most frequently infected, a factor associated with physical symptoms, anxiety, and depression.",

Personal conditions, such as not having a partner or children, compounded the risks. Excessive workload and burnouts caused by the medical profession have been long reported (55) . One Brazilian study reports that 46% of the participant physicians routinely worked more than 50 h/week, a workload that seems to have become even heavier during the pandemic (55) . Job dissatisfaction is recurrent and linked to other factors such as low remuneration, difficulties in making a living as a private practice physician, lack of professional autonomy, and poor working conditions, which favor uncertainty and pessimistic professional prospects (55) . It is noteworthy that there are few secondary care facilities in Brazil linked to universities of excellence providing health care programs (most are tertiary), which would provide more work opportunities and facilitate discussions with the health staff and supervisors, previously reported as an indicator of quality in healthcare services (53) .",

Hence, health managers in the different governmental and institutional spheres will likely face this challenge. Interestingly, receiving social and emotional support from co-workers was a protective factor for the nursing and medical groups, though they less frequently reported support from co-workers. Social support perception has been reported to have mediating effects on protecting health providers' mental health (57) .

It represents a challenge for managers worldwide but especially for those in low-and-middle-income countries. Healthcare professionals are vital to mitigate the pandemic effects, and the media and society have widely recognized their work. As these workers have long sought to improve working conditions, the current moment seems opportune for demands of this nature to be considered and met, improve labor conditions. Limitations and contributions: to our knowledge, this is the first study addressing Brazilian health workers' mental health conditions and comparing risk and protective factors among different professions in the health field. Such knowledge is relevant for devising preventive measures and care actions at an occupational and institutional level, considering the importance of the current context. The most relevant limitations include the online collection of data and associated bias; the cross-sectional methodological design, which does not allow establishing a cause and effect relationship; the differentiated incidence of the pandemic in the different Brazilian regions, as a more significant number of participants were from the southeast, a region with the highest number of cases. Additionally, the participants' previous mental health conditions were not assessed, so that rates may have been underestimated, considering that those with important symptoms may not have adhered to the study or provided incomplete answers, possibly not reporting symptoms such as apathy or lack of concentration, among others. Future studies with a longitudinal design are needed to monitor these different profiles at different points in time.",
