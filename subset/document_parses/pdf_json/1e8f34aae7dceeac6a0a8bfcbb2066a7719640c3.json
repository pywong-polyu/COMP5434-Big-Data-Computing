Generic antiviral drug remdesivir has been found to reduce time to clinical recovery but with insignificant clinical benefits and the antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine has been red flagged by USFDA for use as a prophylactic measure due to its cardiotoxicity. There is an acute requirement for a drug candidate that has significant clinical benefit with minimal to no side effects. With restricted access to wet laboratory techniques, an alternative approach is to engage in computational screening of lead molecules that could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of its infectious cycle. Several in silico studies on natural derivatives, especially that present in daily refreshments (tea and fruit juices), staple food (black rice, red onions, soy beans etc) and traditional medicines (extracts of herbs, leaves and flowers) have been identified as potential drug candidates that bind efficiently with the key viral proteins. However, oral bioavailability of these nutriments is considerably low due to either poor permeability or loss of structure and function due to digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. Here we discuss few natural secondary metabolites (Delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside, Scutellarein 7-glucoside, Avicularin and 3,5-Di-O-galloylshikimic acid) that showed encouraging binding affinity against coronavirus main protease (M pro ) and human ACE2 receptor with MM-GBSA energies up to \u00c074.0 Kcal/mol and \u00c079.5 Kcal/mol, respectively.

SARS-like CoVs isolated from bats have 95% genome sequence identity with human SARS-CoVs, allowing them to directly infect humans without any requirement for an intermediate host (Hu et al., 2018) . The genome of SARS coronaviruses comprise 5 0 open reading frame ORF (1a and 1b coding region, S region encodes spike glycoprotein, E region encodes enveloped protein, M region encodes membrane protein, N region encodes nucleocapsid protein, six accessory proteins encoded by ORF 3a, ORF 6, ORF 7a, ORF 7b, ORF 8 and 3 0 terminal non-coding region) (Rota et al., 2003) . The trimeric S glycoprotein contains two S1 and S2 subunits for interaction with host cell receptor and for fusion with host cell, respectively .

As the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have sequence homology with SARS and MERS thus the existing antiviral drugs seem effective against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of RdRp and antimalarial drug chloroquine effectively inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (M. .

In this direction, we have selected two target proteins (viral protein, M pro and host receptor protein, ACE2) and performed docking studies to screen potential natural products. Further, in silico ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) analysis has been performed to understand their suitability as a drug candidate.

(Guo et al., 2018) . In another study, avicularin suppressed the intracellular accumulation of lipids by suppressing C/EBPamediated activation of GLUT4 expression in 3T3-L1 cells (Fujimori & Shibano, 2013) . Present computational analysis showed that it has good affinity to M pro with a docking score of \u00c09.6 Kcal/mol and MM-GBSA dG binding energy \u00c066.6 Kcal/mol. Similar to Delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside and scutellarein 7-glucoside, the alpha-L-arabinofuranosy moiety of avicularin is majorly involved in interaction with the main residues (CYS 145 and GLU 166 ) of the catalytic site via hydrogen bonding. To further increase the binding affinity, the benzene ring forms p-p stacking with the HIE 41 of the hydrophobic subsite. Also the hydroxyl group of chromone nucleus and benzene ring were found to interact with the THR 190 and HIS 164 , CYS 145 , respectively through hydrogen bonding, enhancing the fit into the active site (Figure 3(iii) ).

It is also the only lead among top four that lacks a sugar moiety.

From the docked poses inside ACE2 catalytic site, it can be concluded that oxygen of the carboxylate was found to interact with HIE 505 and HIE 345 through hydrogen bonding and with ARG 273 through non-covalent ionic interaction (salt bridge). The hydroxyls of the benzoyl moiety were displaying hydrogen bonding interaction with the TYR 127 and GLU 406 . HIE 345 of the side chain was involved in the p-p stacking interaction with one of the benzoyl ring (Figure 4(iv) ). The docking score of all the screened natural secondary metabolites is shown in Figure 5 . To be eligible for clinical evaluation, pharmacokinetic profile of a drug plays pivotal role. Based on the results of ADME calculations all the investigated leads have low bioavailability score. The bioavailability score (ABS) depends on passing or violating Lipinski's rule of five. At biological pH, a compound is expected to have >10% bioavailability (F) in rat only if it pass Lipinski's rule of five with ABS 0.55 (i.e. 55% chances of F > 10% in rat). However if it fails, ABS is only 0.17 i.e. 17% chance for a molecule to have bioavailability >10% in rat (Martin, 2005) . With ABS-0.17, delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside (an anthocyanin), the bioavailability through gastro intestinal tract (GIT) is reported to be very low. A study reported by McGhie and Walton (2007) concluded that in animals and humans low anthocyanins levels are absorbed in the circulation and excreted in urine, but high levels are found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Another investigation by Paul et al. (2018) suggests that anthocyanins in the form of crude extract have less bioavailability as compared to encapsulated spray dried formulations. Like delphinidin 3,5diglucoside the next two leads (Scutellarein 7-glucoside, Avicularin) which are glycosidic flavonoids also have less bioavailability with acceptable water solubility limit. Glycosidic flavonoids show less permeability through GIT (Arts et al., 2004) . Hollman et al. reported that only aglycone part of flavonoids pass through the intestinal membrane and glycone moiety mostly gets digested in the GIT with time to reach peak concentrations (T max ) between <0.5 and 9 h (Walle, 2004) . The 3,5-Di-O-galloylshikimic acid (gallotanin with quinic acid core) estimated log S value suggest that it has acceptable water solubility due to presence of polar functional groups, yet its bioavailability score is only 0.11.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1277, "end": 1291, "text": "(Martin, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1461, "end": 1485, "text": "McGhie and Walton (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1689, "end": 1707, "text": "Paul et al.

Specifically, EGCG has been reported to be broken down in large intestine by the colonic microflora.

However, their theoretical bioavailability score (ABS) of 0.11 or 0.17 makes them ineffective via oral route. Potential natural leads such as Delphinidin 3, 5-diglucoside, an anthocyanin responsible for the red pigmentation of pomegranate juice, are ingested orally.
