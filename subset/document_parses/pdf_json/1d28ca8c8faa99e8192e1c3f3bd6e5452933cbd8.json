They are critical global nodes that link the world and facilitate economic development. In 2020, the global aviation industry was brought to a near standstill by the COVID-19 pandemic, with devastating global economic and associated impacts. This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the airports' sector. Using archival and secondary data from authoritative sources such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), EUROCONTROL and Flightradar24, it emerged that COVID-19 had a negative impact on airport operations mainly affecting their revenue streams. Travel restrictions and border closures had a debilitating impact on the airports and the aviation component of the tourism industry. With airlines grounded, the airports converted into parking lots and ghost towns. With this, there were drastic declines in receipt in landing, departure fees and non-aeronautical revenue. The remaining limited operations that continued in many airports related to service and facilitate the delivery of medical and other essential supplies, including food and critical raw materials. These could not raise adequate revenues to sustain many airports. Globally, the closure of airports also affected more than 6 million people directly employed in these airport-related services, including shops, car rental companies, airport restaurants and that of air navigation systems. The study recommends that the same support offered to the aviation industry in the form of grants, tax exemptions, preferential loans and so on be extended to airports. Airports play a central role in the global economy, tourism economy and future recovery efforts.",

This showed that there was an increased demand for air travel. Indications were that trend was likely to continue in the foreseeable future as the demand for business and leisure travel increases. Figure 5 .1 shows how traffic at airports grew and evolved over the past decade, with some significant events impacting aviation such as the economic recession and outbreaks of swine flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. Data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) show that the distance between travels is becoming shorter and shorter (IATA 2019) . Hence, people are travelling more frequently today than ever before. As a consequence, there is a higher demand for airport usage, and the demand was expected to grow in the short and long term.",

Chung (2015) argues that the rapid commercialisation of the aircraft industry paved the way for disease proliferation at a faster rate. Given the history of pandemic and infectious diseases, the world has learned over time that the only plausible measures of controlling such diseases are screening, quarantines and isolations (Gensini et al. 2004; Safi and Gumel 2011; Hou et al. 2020) . One of the greatest cities, the New York islands, is famously known for having been a smallpox quarantine site (Chung 2015) . Isolation, social distancing and quarantine were also used in the COVID-19 outbreak, which led to restrictions in people moving across the world (Wilder-Smith and Freedman 2020; Adams et al. 2020) . The travel limitations included ground, water, rail and air travel restrictions. A disruption in air traffic has implications for traffic flow, which affects revenue collection for airports. Airports make the bulk of their money from landing and departure fees, and airport taxes charged to customers. Experience has shown that the aviation and tourism industries are vulnerable to political, economic and natural disasters. A review of the history of aviation revealed that several historical events had an impact on the aviation industry, including the oil crisis in 1973, the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the Gulf War in the early 1990s, the Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the September 2011 (9/11) terrorist attack in the USA, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the avian flu outbreak in 2013 and the MERS outbreak in 2016. The impact of some of the outbreaks is presented in Fig. 5 .1. Looking at the trend, it appears that the number of shocks affecting the travel industry is increasing. Of interest is the increase in the frequency of outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. The threat of epidemics and pandemics on the aviation industry led to the formation of a board tasked with coordinating international aviation's response to public health risks -the Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation (CAPSCA). CAPSCA has since been formalised as a branch of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (CAPSCA 2020). As a consequence, airport authorities have learned some invaluable lessons on how to manage disease pandemics from countries such as Japan (Fujita et al. 2011) , Australia (Eastwood et al. 2010) , Canada (Johanis 2007) and Singapore (Wilder-Smith et al. 2003) .",

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) officially announced in March 2020 that the world had entered a recession (IMF 2020). An economic recession has an adverse impact on economic performance in every sector, including the aviation industry, and indeed traffic at various airports. Harvey and Turnbull (2009) documented the adverse impact of the 2008 global economic recession on aviation labour, which led to significant retrenchments and loss of income. However, Chung (2015) notes that in as much as disease epidemics harm airport economics, there is a lack of literature on the impacts of previous diseases. This is despite the fact that airports are often the last line of defence against exported/imported pandemics and other biosecurity risks (Warren et al. 2010; Melly and Hanrahan 2020; Yadav et al. 2020 ).",

This resulted in diseases spreading faster due to the rapid development of the aviation industry. In a few minutes, hours or overnight, a disease could be spread from one national location to another, one country to another and one continent to another.

While the IMF declared that the COVID-19 pandemic had triggered the worst economic recession in history, projections were that the recovery would assume a \"U recovery shape\" (Nicola et al. 2020 ) -with a decline followed by some flattening at the bottom before upward growth -as opposed to a V-shaped recovery (a sharp drop and a sharp rise).

The downward spiral of The USA market showed some resilience, with serious departure declines being witnessed only after the travel restrictions to the European market in early March 2020. The market has a robust domestic airline industry, hence the resilience that witnessed the market taking a bit longer than other markets to get to the bottom. However, it is important to note that the international and domestic policies adopted by the USA had huge significance for the local and international aviation markets and departures (Figs. 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8) .

            "text": "In as much as the grounding of many airlines presented a huge financial blow from declining departure and related fees overall, there was an unforeseen opportunity for airports to generate revenue from parking fees. With many grounded flights, most airports struggled to find parking space, with some ending up using part of their runways as parking space. This led to the closure of some runways to accommodate the unprecedented number of aircraft piling up in several airports across the world. Figure 5 .11 shows a situation playing out across several airports in the world, with aircraft parked on pavements and runways. Across the world, aircraft were (2020) grounded due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. This led to pavement damage at some airports. Among the most affected airports were those in countries with large fleets of aircraft such as the United Arab Emirates. The next section focuses on the airport situation in Europe (Figs. 5.12, 5.13, 5.14 and 5.15 ). Aircraft were piling up at various airports in Europe since February 2020, with the most significant number of parked aircraft witnessed mid-March 2020 (Fig. 5.12) . Ryanair, Lufthansa and Turkish Airways had the highest number of parked aircraft, with a total of 915 ( Fig. 5.13 ). The airports with the highest number of parked aircraft were in Madrid, Istanbul, London and Vienna (Fig. 5.14) . On 17 April 2020, there were 5472 parked aircraft at 303 airports across Europe. As can be seen in Fig. 5 .15, narrow-bodied aircraft formed the bulk of the parked aircraft, and a significant number were very large and wide-bodied aircraft.",

            "text": "The USA has a huge aircraft fleet and some airlines. Airport resorted to using closed airports or airports not frequently used as parking sites for grounded aircraft. These airports include the Victorville airport, California, and Marana, Arizona. Delta, FedEx and Southwest Airlines were some of the airlines that used this less frequented airport, probably to evade the high cost at other busy airports. The airport is also advantageous in that it has subhumid conditions. The dry conditions ensure that aircraft are rust free, which helps in lowering maintenance cost. Faced with substantial parking costs, probably for a more extended period, some airlines decided to retire their bigger aircraft. Airlines such as Lufthansa retired a sizeable number of wide-bodied aircraft. As already indicated, the piling up of aircraft presented several challenges for airports across the world. In Europe, there was a call to cut airport parking fees, which effectively reduced revenues. As such, the airports were also incapable of cashing in on the troubled airlines. Parking an aircraft at an airport is particularly expensive, especially if no business is going on. In India, for example, parking fees Due to the increased demand for parking, some airports had challenges resulting from damaged airport infrastructure. Istanbul had a capacity of parking space for 500 aircraft and could accommodate the large Turkish fleet. The airport was built at the cost of US$16.65 billion, and a significant portion of this amount was sourced through a build-operate-transfer process and a (US$5bn) loan from several banks, including Ziraat Bank, Halkbank and Vak\u0131fBank (Airport Technology 2019). The 90-million-passengers capacity airport that employs 31,000 employees (iGA 2020) reduced operations, which had a devastating impact on its employees. Thus, the disruptions caused by COVID-19 could hamper the period of the rate of return and the repayment process. Several airports across the world faced similar challenges.",

Observations revealed that in Southern Africa, there were new airports or major airport upgrades at Lanseria International Airport (South Africa), Victoria Falls International Airport (Zimbabwe), Cape Town International Airport (South Africa) and OR Tambo International Airport (South Africa). China reported the completion of facilities worth U$11.7 billion at Beijing Daxing International Airport, with a capacity to handle more than 100 million passengers per annum (Keju 2019) . In the USA, there were 10 airport projects with a budget of over US$1.3 billion, with the highest having a budget of US$2.6 billion (Statista 2020) which were likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) liquidity crunch. The liquidity crunch that affected airports is feared to have reversed the progress of carbon-neutral projects that were on the increase globally. While airports could have modelled their investments in projected traffic figures based on financial gains and observations from trends in recent years, the pandemic upset that scenario and changed airport companies' financial outlook. This had dire consequences for financially insecure airports, particularly private airports, with limited access to government funding. The pandemic led to a wave of disturbances throughout the tourism value chain and had a devastating impact on the airline industry. The placement under administration and/or ultimate collapse of a number of airlines have implications for the viability of airports going forward. No doubt the disturbances at Virgin Australia with its fleet of 120 aircraft (Flightradar24 database) may have a significant impact on the revenue of airports on its routes if it is allowed to fail. The airliner has been put under administration and is battling a credit bill of US$4.4 billion. The development has seen Perth Airport attaching some of the airline's property. There are fears that many airlines that were financially fragile will go under after the pandemic, with implications for airports across the world.",

The pandemic has had an adverse impact on South African Airways, which have been in trouble for years and depends on government bailouts. The pandemic might signal its demise as the government denied the perennial lossmaking airline further bailouts due to a restricted fiscal space (Makinana 2020). With South African Airways one of the leading regional and continental airlines in sub-Saharan Africa, its liquidation and that of SA Airlink which made a loss of R365 million in November 2019 (Ramalepe 2020) and SA Express can cripple some of the airports in South Africa and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region where the two airlines are dominant. These airlines are the only airlines servicing some of the airports in the SADC region, and their demise is likely to have negative implications for jobs and the sustainability of the affected airports. If these airlines eventually close down, major routes to tourist attractions via Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport, Victoria Falls International Airport, Livingstone International Airport (LVI, also known as Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport), Skukuza Airport and Bisho Airport amongst others could be compromised, if not closed down altogether.
