A scarcity of information describing design and performance criteria for PAPRs represents a substantial barrier to mitigating shortages. We sought to apply open-source product development (OSPD) to PAPRs to enable alternative sources of supply and further innovation. We describe the design, prototyping, validation, and user testing of locally manufactured, modular, PAPR components, including filter cartridges and blower units, developed by the Greater Boston Pandemic Fabrication Team (PanFab). Two designs, one with a fully custom-made filter and blower unit housing, and the other with commercially available variants (the \"Custom\" and \"Commercial\" designs, respectively) were developed; the components in the Custom design are interchangeable with those in Commercial design, although the form factor differs. The engineering performance of the prototypes was measured and safety validated using National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-equivalent tests on apparatus available under pandemic conditions at university laboratories. Feedback was obtained from four individuals; two clinicians working in ambulatory clinical care and two research technical staff for whom PAPR use is standard occupational PPE; these individuals were asked to compare PanFab prototypes to commercial PAPRs from the perspective of usability and suggest areas for improvement. Respondents rated the PanFab Custom PAPR a 4 to 5 on a 5 Likert-scale 1) as compared to current PPE options, 2) for the sense of security with use in a clinical setting, and 3) for comfort",

As a consequence, the availability of high-quality respiratory protection has been problematic, causing healthcare institutions to reuse normally disposable filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs; N95-type masks) and turn to nontraditional devices as substitutes (Hack the Pandemic, 2020; Thingiverse.com, 2020; COVID-19 Response, 2020; Get Us PPE, 2021; Open Mask, 2021) . Non-traditional supply chains commonly involve community-based collaborations among independent engineers, scientists, hobbyists, and volunteers in partnership with healthcare and academic institutions (McCue, 2020; Westervelt, 2020; NIH 3D Print Exchange, 2020; Sinha et al., 2020; Clark, 2020) . While multiple non-traditional designs for simple PPE products such as face shields have emerged (Mostaghimi et al., 2020) , and multiple commercial and nontraditional technologies have been developed to decontaminate or reuse N95-type masks (N95 Decon, 2020; McAvoy et al., 2021) , few alternative sources of supply exist for more complex products. This is particularly true of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) which can be worn by individuals unable to fit N95-type masks, are more comfortable in many settings, and also provide a higher level of respiratory protection. Ongoing efforts to increase the supply of PAPRs have largely involved large manufacturing companies with government support (e.g., the 3M Ford Limited-Use Public Health Emergency PAPR) (CDC, 2020a; Limited-Use Public Health Emergency PAPR, 2021) .",

Like N95 masks, PAPRs are used in both healthcare and industrial settings, but under non-pandemic conditions, healthcare use of PAPRs is typically limited to situations in which a healthcare worker (HCW) is unable to wear a disposable N95 mask yet must care for a patient with a suspected or confirmed airborne infection, such as tuberculosis (Institute of Medicine, 2015) . Common reasons for being unable to wear a N95 mask are the presence of facial hair and poor mask fit for individuals with small or narrow faces; the latter is often revealed by qualitative fit tests routinely performed on HCWs (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2021) . It is estimated that \u223c10% of HCWs fail fit testing (Institute of Medicine, 2015) , and for these individuals PAPRs are the best, and in some instances the only, alternative form of respiratory protection. N95 masks are often reused in pandemic conditions due to supply shortages, leading to concerns about further loss of fit after multiple dondoff cycles (Bergman et al., 2012) .",

It has also been observed that many healthcare workers who must wear N95-type masks day after day (e.g., during a sustained pandemic) experience painful abrasions (Gheisari et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020) . Attempts to mitigate discomfort by using creams, tapes, or loosening the straps that hold masks against a user's face can decrease respiratory protection . PAPRs overcome this problem and provide better protection: commercial PAPRs certified by the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) offer higher filtration efficiency as compared to N95 masks (99.97 vs. 95%) (Institute of Medicine, 2015) and have assigned protection factors substantially higher than those of N95-type masks (Tompkins and Kerchberger, 2010) . PAPRs are also better suited to periods of very high demand: whereas N95 masks are designed for one-time use, commercially available PAPRs are designed to be sterilized and reused multiple times (Rebmann and Wagner, 2009) .",

The blower unit pulls room air through one or multiple high-efficiency particulate air/high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filter cartridges, thereby removing aerosols and small particles. The blower then pushes the filtered air into the facepiece (also known as a hood) through the hose, and it is breathed in by the user. In the case of a loose-fitting facepiece, air also escapes through gaps between the facepiece material and the user's body.

Resources describing the design criteria for PAPRs used in healthcare settings are scarce because most designs are proprietary, making it challenging for new or local manufacturers to help address shortages. Additionally, the regulatory approval process for PAPRs via NIOSH is significantly more complex than regulatory approval processes for simpler devices such as face shields (Mostaghimi et al., 2020) that have already been produced in bulk by non-traditional suppliers. In the US, PAPRs are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under the Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134) . This requires that PAPRs be approved by NIOSH but does not require 510(k) premarket notification or clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (eCFR, 2021; CDC, 2014) . One resulting challenge is that NIOSH testing standards are highly prescriptive, but the physical and engineering principles underlying these tests are not always obvious. The prescriptive approach may be appropriate under normal circumstances when it is important to maintain quality standards in the face of cost pressure, but it is problematic in emergency conditions in which approved testing apparatus are in short supply. In the current work we therefore rely on \"NIOSH-equivalent\" testing to assess performance.",

These components are intended to provide alternatives to standard commercially available PAPR Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 690905 components and to be locally manufacturable in times of severe PAPR shortage. For both the filter cartridge and the blower unit components, we describe a \"PanFab Custom Design\" and a \"PanFab Commercial Design\" to accommodate different scenarios with respect to shortages of materials. The Custom design has less reliance on commercial products and supply chains and can be fabricated in large part using additive manufacturing (3D-printing) methods for low volume production or injection molding for high volume needs (Antonini et al., 2021) . The Commercial design relies on commercially available parts made for other products and requires fewer custom fabrication steps, facilitating rapid introduction of new, locally fabricated units. The PanFab PAPR components are modular and interchangeable: any combination of components can be used together and also with traditional PAPR components from leading suppliers. For example, the PanFab Custom Filter can be used with the PanFab Commercial Blower Unit and vice-versa. The PanFab PAPR components are also compatible with the widely used ILC Dover Sentinel XL PAPR facepiece (ILC Dover, 2021) and filters. The blower unit can also be adapted to other commercially available PAPR facepieces by fabricating a slightly modified hose-to-facepiece connector. Under the provisions of a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License, other entities are free to use components of the PanFab PAPRs by themselves, in their own designs, or to innovate these designs further. Initial prototype testing was conducted at academic laboratories using equipment and supplies that were available during the COVID-19 pandemic. User feedback on the functionality and comfort of the designs was then obtained at a major US academic medical center from four participants: two healthcare providers and two research technicians who used PAPRs regularly as part of standard PPE prior to the pandemic. User feedback was elicited to identify possible points of improvement for future PAPR designs and is intended to be part of an iterative process; insufficient testing was performed to achieve statistical significance or meet NIOSH certification standards. We intend for this to happen as part of scale-up prior to large scale manufacturing. Performance testing was conducted using alternative apparatus and methods than those prescribed by NIOSH, which are hard to replicate outside of a conventional certification laboratory. An additional limitation of our approach is that PAPR certification, like certification of most medical products, requires a manufacturing process controlled by a quality management system (e.g., one similar to ISO 9001 standards). Achieving this standard is only possible in a commercial setting, and we are therefore collaborating with an industrial partner to create a design amenable to NIOSH standards. Future users of the PanFab PAPRs must perform their own testing and confirm that fabricated products meet the requirements of FDA Emergency Use Authorizations and similar regulatory guidance. We return to this issue in the discussion section.",

Prototype testing was carried out across several university laboratories at MIT on the filters, blowers, power systems, control and warning systems, and the seals between components. The use of these \"NIOSH-equivalent\" tests allowed us to perform PAPR design and testing in an emergency setting, but does not obviate the need for testing to NIOSH STPs prior to large scale manufacturing.

In the absence of this setup, a conventional impeller type anemometer (Vernier Software and Technology, Beaverton, OR) was connected to the air inlet at the facepiece, with the neck opening sealed with tape ( Figure 3A ). An adapter was 3D-printed to couple the facepiece inlet to the anemometer flow area, such that all the flow into the facepiece passed through the cross-sectional area of the anemometer inlet.

However, given the lack of a dedicated room in which to perform this test we adopted a Bitrex fit testing procedure which is commonly used in hospital settings to evaluate respirators of different types. The Bitrex test is a permissible substitute for corn oil testing according to pre-pandemic NIOSH testing requirements.",

For a full description of the filter and blower unit designs, refer to Table 1 and Supplementary Material S2. A Milwaukee Tool (Brookfield, WI) HEPA-rated vacuum cleaner filter (part number 49-90-1900) was selected as the PanFab Commercial Filter Cartridge. This filter model is readily available in North American home improvement stores and similar types of filters are available in other countries, driven by increasing concern about the health effects of exposure to silica dust in construction (Poinen-Rughooputh et al., 2016) . Widespread innovation is occurring in this area (with many new tools having integrated HEPA filtration) and groups interested in other ways to develop respiratory protection devices for HCWs are encouraged to stay abreast of these developments. A custom 3D-printed Two filters were used in both variants of the PAPR as opposed to one, so as to minimize the pressure drop for a given flow rate and to provide redundancy. A centrifugal blower (Delta Electronics, Neihu, Taiwan, Part Number BFB1012HD-04D4L) generates a 230 lpm flow rate, higher than the required 170 lpm, and a 12-volt (V) NiMH battery pack (Tenergy, Fremont, CA, Amazon Standard Identification Number: B077Y9HNTF) was used to power it; this battery pack was sufficient for \u223c4 h of continuous use. The battery can be charged in various ways, including with solar power, as long as 12 Voltage Direct Current (VDC) < 1.8 A (Amp) can be supplied through an electrical connector compatible with that used in the battery.

Discrete components connected to the shield included a 10 kiloohm potentiometer (Precision Electronics Corporation, North York, ON, Canada, part number RV4NAYSD103A), differential pressure sensor (Sensirion AG, Staefa, Switzerland, part number SDP810-500PA), and piezoelectric buzzer (Mallory Sonalert Products Inc., Indianapolis, IN, part number PS-580Q). These components were used for control and alarm tasks such as regulating the air flow rate, measuring flow rate, and sounding the low-flow buzzer. All of the discrete components are readily substitutable with similar products made by multiple Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 690905 manufacturers. We established that the Sonalert buzzer generated a sound of at least 80 dBA (as per CVB-APR-STP-0085) when the flow rate fell below a NIOSH specified threshold (as per CVB-APR-STP-0088). The shield circuit diagram, fabrication files, and Arduino code are all available in Supplementary Material S4. The housings that enclose the blower, battery, and control components were designed to be airtight when closed, with the filters and hose attached. In the case of the Commercial Design, a Pelican V100 Vault Case (Pelican Products, Torrance, CA) was used with custom made \"inserts\" for connection to filters and hose via NATO 40mm connections. The Custom housing was designed to be smaller and lighter in weight, with integrated connections to the filters and hose. A hood coupler and a locking ring were designed to connect the hose to the facepieces, which use a NATO 40 mm threaded connection. Finally, a hose adapter was designed to form air-tight connections between the ends of the plastic hose, the housing outlet, and the facepiece inlet. While all custom-made parts, including the custom housing, were 3D printed for prototyping, these designs were also optimized for injection molding to facilitate future high volume production (Antonini et al., 2021) .

As mentioned earlier, many traditional NIOSH tests were not readily available from commercial laboratories due to high demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, tests are highly prescriptive and not easily set up in an academic research laboratory. A further compromise we were forced to make is that full NIOSH certification was simply not possible for the PanFab PAPRs, regardless of testing procedures, in the absence of documentation that they would be manufactured according to established quality-control criteria. Compliance with these manufacturing standards is important, but it is secondary to our goal of developing a functional PAPR design. We therefore established alternate test setups and protocols to replicate several NIOSH tests ( Table 2 ). The ability of the final designs to pass these tests should increase the confidence of traditional and nontraditional manufacturers that PanFab designs are very likely to pass full NIOSH certification; we very strongly encourage formal certification testing prior to use of these designs in a healthcare setting.",

Frequent feedback from clinicians who use PAPRs in a hospital setting strongly influenced design decisions, particularly with respect to PAPR comfort and usability. Key design decisions included determining size and orientation of the housing, the number and orientation of the filters, and the method of donning/doffing the blower unit. Feedback from manufacturing experts yielded a design that is amenable to large-scale production by injection molding of the blower housing. PanFab PAPR designs are modular and compatible with several standard commercial PAPR components, including facepieces and filters, allowing for substitution of components in limited supply. The PanFab Custom Design compares favorably to the 3 M Ford Limited-Use Public Health Emergency PAPR (Limited-Use Public Health Emergency PAPR, 2021) with respect to weight and size, although the 3 M Ford unit appears to use higher performance batteries. Both PanFab designs also compare favorably to commercial PAPRs with respect to cost. The safety and functionality of PanFab PAPRs was evaluated using protocols that closely followed NIOSH STPs and aimed to meet or exceed the functional objectives of those tests. Given the limitations imposed by pandemic conditions, it was necessary to use substitute tests in university laboratories rather than use a NIOSH-specific apparatus at a commercial pre-certification laboratory. PanFab PAPRs passed all of the performed tests, in various combinations of Commercial and Custom components. User feedback on the PAPRs was obtained from clinicians inexperienced in using PAPRs and technical research staff who routinely use PAPRs in a major Boston-area hospital. The PanFab Custom Design scored favorably as compared to the traditionally manufactured PAPRs (primarily from ILC Dover) available to hospital staff. This feedback also guided improvements that were made during iterative design of the prototype (e.g., using a different hood with the PAPR design to accommodate a greater diversity of user face shapes).",

We are therefore unable to make claims about the durability of the designs in clinical use or the resistance of the units to damage. We were also unable to assess the efficacy of different methods for sterilizing PanFab PAPRs, but materials used in the designs are compatible with alcohol-based wipes (e.g., acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (Industrial Specialties Mfg and IS MED Specialties, 2019) allowing CDC recommendations for disinfecting PAPRs to be followed (CDC, 2020b) . Previous research also suggests that ionized hydrogen peroxide techniques would be compatible with PAPR sterilization . Additional usability, durability and sterilization testing await the availability of additional PAPR units assembled during production scale-up. However, the tests in this paper achieve the goal of PAPR design validation.",

There also exists very limited information in the public domain on alternate testing equipment. Answers to questions such as the minimum time of continuous device operation required, relevant material characteristics for facepiece fabrics, and appropriate materials for the pathway for inhaled air were not readily available. We therefore sought out experts with relevant expertise. Substantial time and effort would have been saved had a centralized resource of information been available. To streamline the process for future crises, we have consolidated relevant information collected from US regulatory agencies in Supplementary Material S1. We encourage individuals from other countries to contact us with information relevant to products in their markets and will provide this updated information on PANFAB.ORG. When evaluating our designs, we found that it was difficult to use NIOSH standard testing procedures since the necessary equipment was not readily available. Informed substitution was made difficult by prescriptive procedures and opaque objectives in terms of fundamental mechanical or physical principles being assessed. Our use of third-party commercial labs that test to NIOSH standards was also limited by long lead times and a requirement for multiple samples of each prototype, which would require financial resources beyond those available to our group. Thus, testing equipment and protocols, as opposed to design and fabrication, emerged as the primary challenge in developing the PanFab PAPRs.",

To receive NIOSH certification, a product must be manufactured and submitted by a NIOSH-approved manufacturer with a quality management system in place. Under normal circumstances, this requirement guarantees the safety of products made in volume. However, this restricts the development of new products to NIOSH-approved manufacturers, which has had the effect of creating near-monopolies for some types of PPE. To improve resilience in future emergencies, regulators might consider how to optimally balance the risk of non-traditional PPE against the risk of no protection at all. We propose that consideration be given to rules that allow non-NIOSH certified fabricators to respond to declared healthcare emergencies while still complying with the most critical aspects of functional testing. Under this process, critical \"go or no-go\" tests would be defined by clearly described physical principles and corresponding testing protocols that could be performed on generally available laboratory equipment. The modified standards would include an explicit description of the end goal of the test and suggest a range of alternative devices that can be used to measure airflow, filtration efficiency, audibility, user testing etc. Rational substitution of instruments would also be allowed. While we do not advocate for relaxing standards under non-crisis conditions, modifying and streamlining testing procedures for prototype devices would reduce barriers to the entry of new products and promote innovation.",

            "text": "The current COVID-19 crisis has revealed major weaknesses and points of failure in our health care system and its supply chains, particularly for PPE. This does not come as a surprise. Multiple studies over a 15-year period have decried the absence of innovation in the design and provision of respiratory protection for health care and other essential workers (Sinha et al., 2020) . Academies of Sciences echoed the same urgent needs (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019). Despite these repeated calls for action and greater innovation, there has been little response from the commercial sector or from government: in the COVID-19 pandemic, most innovation has come from volunteer groups of scientists and clinicians allied with maker communities with access to rapid prototyping and fabrication equipment, technology that is increasingly inexpensive and available to ordinary citizens (Sinha et al., 2020) . Thus, open source product development (OSPD) (Huizingh, 2011) emerges as perhaps the only avenue to mitigating existing weaknesses while increasing product innovation under both normal and crisis conditions. An OSPD approach is not a panacea and it is not free. As discussed above, it would be helpful for NIOSH and other regulatory agencies to develop less prescriptive testing procedures for products such as PAPRs. Funding is also essential. The work described here benefited from the generosity of many individuals but all attempts to fund it via competitive applications to foundations or universities were turned down because research into respiratory protection is not considered innovative by conventional academic criteria (salary support for grant-funded investigators was, however, temporarily available under relaxed grant guidelines from the US National Cancer Institute under NOT-CA-20-054). This speaks to a larger problem in matching acute healthcare needs to available expertise and necessary resources in academia, not just industry.",
