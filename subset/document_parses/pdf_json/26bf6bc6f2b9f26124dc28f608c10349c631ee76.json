This research focuses on analyzing whether the factors significant in cyberbullying susceptibility changed with the lockdown. The study was conducted by surveying 256 students before the pandemic, in October 2019, and 118 students during the lockdown, in June 2020. This included questions about the respondents' demographics, online presence, experience with offline bullying, perception of other's opinions, and the instances of cyberbullying that apply to them. The results showed factors important in both timespans, namely (i) experience with offline bullying; (ii) individuals' perceptiveness to others' opinions; (iii) frequency of social media posts. Additionally, in the period before lockdown, factors namely (i) tendency to interact with strangers online; (ii) whether they've started a relationship online (iii) hours spent on social media; were found significant. Conversely, during the lockdown, additional distinct factors namely (i) being opinionated on public platforms; (ii) preference of Instagram; (iii) preferred gaming platform; (iv) number of games played; (v) sexual orientation; (vi) age were significant. With the change in variables in the two timespans, we can conclude that the pandemic has affected our susceptibility to cyberbullying.",

            "text": "Cyberbullying can be defined as hostile behavior via the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to harm or cause discomfort to another (Camacho et al., 2014) . With the ubiquity of internet access and social media accounts, cyberbullying has now become a prevalent concern among many young adults around the globe, transcending factors like sex, sexual orientation, age, etc. In a 2006 study of 1,500 adolescents, 33% of the respondents were found to be cyberbullied (Patchin and Hinduja, 2006) . A February 2007 survey including 832 teenagers found that 43% of teens surveyed had been cyberbullied (Moessner, 2007) . In a 2010 study by Tokunaga, about 20-40% of all youths had been cyberbullied (Tokunaga, 2010) . According to Microsoft's 'Global Youth Online Behavior Survey' in 2012, covering more than 7,600 children across 25 countries aged between 8 and 17, India ranked third in the number of cyberbullying cases (53%) (Singh et al., 2015) . The Ipsos report in November 2014 found that India was the highest in the number of child cyberbullying cases (32%) among 24 countries (Venkataraghavan, 2015) . In spite of extensive studies in the past ten years of research, a study focusing on India specifically could not be located. Hence, with such glaring statistics, it became essential to investigate the reasons and factors behind cyberbullying, which is one of the motivations behind this study.",

            "text": "An important aspect of the analysis revolves around the change in factors owing to the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. A nationwide lockdown was implemented in India on 24th March 2020 and in the major metropolitan areas, the lockdown continued for another few months. The lockdown changed the external environment in all major aspects including interactions among social circles, attending school and college lectures online, and working from home. This change caused a dramatic increase in the online activity of most individuals. A study conducted in China during the pandemic revealed that more than 80% of the respondents noticed an increase in their Social Media Exposure (SME). This exposure, coupled with demographic trends, severely affected the mental health of these respondents who faced problems like depression and anxiety fueled by the fear of the uncertainty of the effects of the pandemic (Gao et al., 2020) . Apart from this, owing to the growing digitalization and an increase in the \"work from home\" tradition, many cyber attackers have leveraged peoples' vulnerability to perform various acts of cybercrimes such as impersonation, data leaks, and targeting infrastructures such as healthcare and banking systems (Lallie et al., 2020) . The increase in online banking transactions has left the majority of the population susceptible to phishing activities by perpetrators. Another aspect of cybercrimes that has not been covered in many analyses of the pandemic is cyberbullying.",

Apart from this, individuals have also been actively posting new accomplishments they achieved during the pandemic induced lockdown and expressing their opinions more vocally than before since social media has now become the sole mode of communication for most individuals. When people consume more content online and have the majority of their social and professional interactions on these online mediums, regulating the activity is of utmost importance since people are more susceptible and vulnerable to comments and acts of hate online. In such situations, both the bully and the victim are not aware of the repercussions and endangerment of their actions online (Ozden and Icellioglu, 2014) . Victims of cyberbullying often experience feelings of anger, powerlessness, fear, and sadness which is consistent with the negative effects of traditional bullying and with the added problem of anonymity in cyberbullying, victims tend to feel helpless as they are not aware how to stop such acts (Hoff & Mitchell, 2009) . Keeping in mind such behavior and this growing trend, it was imperative to delve deeper and analyze the subsequent change in the factors affecting cyberbullying susceptibility and reasons for this change. Cyberbullying is a byproduct of both, increasing anxiety of individuals and the malevolence of cyber attackers. The motive behind this research study is to capture the various aspects of an individual which would make them more susceptible to cyberbullying during this pandemic and thus, keep regular checks and spread awareness for tackling the same.",

As children's use of electronic communication technologies is unlikely to wane in the coming years, continued attention to electronic bullying is critical (Kowalski and Limber, 2007) . It was also discovered that students who experienced cyberbullying, both as a victim and an offender, had significantly lower self-esteem than those who had little to no experience with cyberbullying . Research findings suggest that experience with traditional bullying and cyberbullying is associated with an increase in suicidal ideation . Emotional and behavioral problems exist not only among bullies, but also among victims, and bully-victims.

The study further showed that younger students who spent more time playing games on weekdays while being more confident in cyberspace and active in using mobile phones are more likely to be involved in cyberbullying than other students (Shin and Ahn, 2015) . Another study revealed that Facebook and text messaging were the most frequent mediums for cyberbullying and that sexual-minority students and students who texted at least 50 times per day were more likely to report cyberbullying victimization (Rice et al., 2015) . Another factor that was found to have high outcomes of cyberbullying victimization were individuals with disabilities (Kowalski et al., 2016) . Social influence was found to have a significant impact on the cyberbullying behavior and intention of a person (Lee and Wu, 2018) . Further findings also suggested that inherent factors like social media usage and cyber engagement amplify detrimental acts like cyberbullying, cyber harassment, and cyberstalking (Al-Rahmi et al., 2018; Peled, 2019) . Many social media users have observed a spike in the amount of time they spent on social media, owing to the pandemic. This proportion of SME was higher among females than males, and younger people as compared to the elder. This could have possibly led to increased activity in cyberbullying as higher SME was found to be positively associated with the prevalence of mental health problems which was found to be highly associated with cyberbullying activity (Gao et al., 2020; Beckman et al., 2012) .",

Hence, the research conducted is more victim-centric, to get an objective understanding of the victim's perspective. Over the years, studies have looked into different aspects of an individual's persona specific to their demographics (Rao et al., 2018) ; or monitoring their online activity (Camacho et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2015) ; or targeted factors like having a disability (Kowalski et al., 2016) ; or if their mental health is not satisfactory (Beckman et al., 2012) . Through this study, a holistic approach has been used to capture the various factors of an individual like their demographics, social media presence, gaming activity, and other factors to deep dive into their persona and identify what is making them more susceptible to cyberbullying. As there is a major change in the online environment and activity owing to the lockdown, with businesses and schools going completely online, this study aims to analyze the change in the susceptibility of cyberbullying of a person before and during the pandemic, which has not been explored in previous studies.",

The same survey was circulated to the same target audience in two time periods i.e. October 2019 (Period-I), before the pandemic (256 respondents) and June 2020 (Period-II), once the pandemic induced lockdown was initiated (118 respondents). Since the responses were anonymous, despite having circulated the survey among the same target group, it was not possible to ensure that the same set of people responded to it. Fig. 2 illustrates the flow of the survey circulated to the respondents. The first section focuses on the various demographics of an individual which could help us identify demographic trends among victims. The second section focuses on the social media presence of an individual which is a crucial research question for our study. After the second section, the respondent was asked whether or not they game online. If the response to the question was \"Yes\", the respondent was directed towards the third section consisting of additional questions on their gaming activity, and respondents who answered \"No\" were directed towards the two additional questions regarding their perceptiveness to others' opinions and bullying history. The fourth section is aimed at gathering more implicit insights from the respondents regarding particular cyberbullying instances. Various questions about their cyberbullying history were asked along with questions regarding the actions they took against those bullies, whether the perpetrator was known to them and if they were negatively impacted. The variables mentioned in Fig. 2 has been extensively explained in the following subsections.",

According to Camacho et al. (2014) , the medium of communication between the bully and the victim plays a vital role in the susceptibility and this medium also contributes to the severity of cyberbullying. A victim may be more susceptible if their preferred social media platforms lack the technological mechanism to detect and prevent such activities and thus, the top 3 preferred social media platforms were collected by the user. For this, options namely Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Hike, Telegram, Tumblr, Pinterest, Reddit, and a popular online dating app, Tinder were given to the user to choose from.",

This makes it challenging to get relevant data even from a survey, where a situation of the respondent being unaware of getting cyberbullied is extant. Hence, the ambiguity of a question as subjective as \"Have you been cyberbullied?\" has been replaced with a more objective set of questions by asking the respondents if they have experienced a particular activity that could undeniably be construed as an act of cyberbullying. These activities are viz, (i) sexual harassment; (ii) derogatory comments; (iii) stalking, and; (iv) sharing personal information without consent through the internet. Then, for the purpose of the research, the final dependent variable (cyberbullied) was computed by performing the logical 'OR' operation on each of the 4 (boolean) aforementioned forms of cyberbullying to determine if the individual had been cyberbullied or not.",

On the other hand, variables that included the degree with which an individual voices their opinions on social media (sm_opinions), how preferred is Instagram as their top social medium (Instagram), and the frequency with which they post in a month (sm_posts), were found significant in Period-II. Thus, with the change in variables (except sm_posts) that were significant in Period-I and Period-II, we can conclude that there has been a change in the effect of the social medium presence of an individual on cyberbullying as a result of COVID-19. Despite the increase in engagement with strangers online, forums and relationships became insignificant in Period-II. The variable sm_hours is suspected to become insignificant during Period-II as there has been an increase in the amount of time spent on social media for everyone, making it a common trait in Period-II which wasn't necessarily the case in Period-I. sm_posts stayed significant in both the periods and this is suspected to be due to its distribution remaining approximately the same (refer to Table 2 ). The variable sm_opinions emerged as significant only in Period-II and this is suspected to be due to more number of people openly expressing their opinions during this period. The amount of cyberbullying on Instagram reduced from 63.13% to 57% from Period-I to Period-II. This reduction is suspected to be the reason for Instagram to be significant during Period-II. With respect to online gaming activity, from the analysis performed the number of online games an individual plays (num_games) and their most-used platform for interacting with other players (g_platforms) became a significant factor in determining their susceptibility to cyberbullying only during Period-II. A possible reason for this could be that not only did the activity of existing online gamers increase but also new individuals that previously did not partake in online games were now exposed to the environment of toxic gaming where cyberbullying is highly prevalent. Thus, with the emergence of new variables in Period-II, we suspect that there is a change in the effect of Online Gaming Activity on cyberbullying due to COVID-19.",

It is essential that these factors are specifically targeted while conducting cyberbullying awareness workshops or campaigns. There was a noticeable increase in the factors affecting cyberbullying susceptibility during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of an increase in social media and online gaming activity. New factors emerged such as Instagram as a preferred social media platform along with the number of games and gaming chat platforms preferred by respondents.

This also signifies that most individuals have faced more than one type of cyberbullying. Cyberstalking is a predominant aspect of cybercrimes and further studies can be conducted focusing primarily on this form of cyberbullying. The majority of the victims said that they were not negatively impacted by the act (37.88%), whereas 30.30% said they were negatively impacted yet the most severe action taken by the majority of victims was only reporting or blocking the perpetrators on social media platforms (39.39%), followed by ignoring them (29.55%). Merely 4.55% of the victims took legal action against the bully by reporting them to the concerned government authorities. Since in 68.18% of the cases, the perpetrator was known to the victim, this might be the reason for the low rates of reporting the cyberbullying acts. The trends for these statistics of the forms of cyberbullying and the actions against the perpetrator are consistent in both periods i.e. before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Various stakeholders such as students, parents, government authorities, psychology experts, and researchers can leverage these findings to spread more awareness about the impacts of cyberbullying to curtail the number of cases and encourage the victims to report these cases to proper authorities.",

Apart from this, studies can focus on the causal relations between the various significant factors. Statistical post hoc tests can be conducted to delve deeper into these causal relations. Various interaction effects can also be considered to get a better understanding of the matter and create a profile for an individual who is more susceptible to cyberbullying and understand its impact on different demographic groups. Furthermore, studies can be expanded to test on larger datasets to get a more generalized understanding of significant factors. ",
