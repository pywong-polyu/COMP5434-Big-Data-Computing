Many countries closed educational institutions across the country to prevent the virus's spread. It has led to an unprecedented scale of distance education testing. In this sense, the need and use of advanced technology for education quality have significantly increased. Therefore, it has been found essential to utilize and implement the advanced technologies that constitute this new changing environment. Compared with traditional learning, the concept of smart-learning has made more incredible progress due to location flexibility, timely application, cost-saving and many other benefits. We believe that the availability of 5G technology will further strengthen smart learning.",

To maintain normal operations, it is necessary to adapt quickly to this situation. Many technologies and platforms have rushed to offer their support to users. This article adopts a critical perspective to reflect on the factors that may cause the hasty adoption of 5G smart learning technology. To investigate students' intentions toward smart learning, this article provides a theoretical framework premised on the technology acceptance model (TAM) by adding components from the social practise theory (SPT). Based on data analysis through Structural equation Modeling (SEM) of a survey (n = 375) conducted in China, we found that the choice of 5G smart-learning technology depends on the combined effect of Material (MAA), Meanings (MEA), and Competency access (COA) factors. The results illustrate that these are the effective factors for student's intentions to adopt 5G smart-learning technology. These outcomes are intended to aid service providers and decision-makers in developing effective ways to increase smart learning use. These findings can also enable us to identify challenges affecting smart learning adoption and to contribute to the design and proper supply of smart learning programs in other countries.",

As widespread and concrete research for accepting smart-learning through 5G has not been done yet. Therefore, this study will be beneficial for developers and researchers in further developing smart learning research. Further, previous studies haven't yet provided any accurate and comprehensive classification for the factors of adoption in the context of smart learning. This study divided these factors into three categories: Materials, competencies, and Meanings. This classification will help developers to make enhanced decisions when prioritizing and planning smart learning implementation issues.",

            "text": "The Covid-19, a push to smart learning At present, the digital revolution and virtualization have dramatically altered all economic, social, and formal education systems (Lorenzo & Gallon, 2019; Winthrop et al., 2016) . We have also discovered and intensely studied technologies used to help students learning. Today, advanced technology is used as a means or tool to access learning content (Daniel, 2012) , research, construction, communication (Bruce & Levin, 1997) , assessment (Meyer & Latham, 2008) and expression (Goodman, 2003) . With the mobile and advance internet technology, mobile learning has become an essential mode of learning. Compared with traditional static education, mobile learning emphasizes students' mobility. Further, the support of ubiquitous technology has brought about other changes, changing the way of learning from mobile to ubiquitous, emphasizing that learning can be carried out anywhere, regardless of time, location, or environment (Hwang et al., 2008) . Today, Smart learning is a novel model of using IT in educational institutions. The global covid-19 has instigated large-scale behavioral and institutional shock effects in almost all parts of life. The influence of this epidemic on learners is extraordinary (Chang et al., 2021) . It restricted more than 150 million students worldwide to their homes (Ter\u00e4s et al., 2020) . Due to large-scale shutdowns, affected countries have been enforced to seek out speedy solutions and to shift to online learning (Jandri\u0107 2020; Presti et al., 2021) . The prompt change from classroom teaching to online has left behind deeper insights related to national education policy, theoretical basis and premise (Sunarto, 2021) . This new environment enabled students to use advanced technology and techniques of learning (Cheung, 2014; Fayez et al., 2021; Marinova et al., 2017) . Researchers and educators argue that this concept (smart learning) should not be restricted to only smart devices use. This kind of environment is a digital environment or virtual place, through a structured approach or a self-regulated process, fully supervised or semi-supervised to learning and teaching (Cook, 2010) . With the increase in technical complexity, the concept of smart learning is evolving into a contextualized and virtualized ubiquitous environment. The modern concept of smart learning has become so clear that the limits between informal and formal learning have almost disappeared (Annoni & Kozovska, 2010) . Smart institutions are converting into social and personal centers of learning, where teachers, students, and entire communities can take part in activities (Lorenzo & Gallon, 2019) . Hwang (2014) and Scott and Benlamri (2010) believe that smart learning is ubiquitous and context related technique. Gwak (2010) suggested the idea of smart learning as it has more content and learners than device-oriented learners and it is efficient, intelligent, and personalized learning. Kim et al., (2012) believe that this type of learning is service-oriented and learner-centered, rather than using the equipment. Middleton (2015) also illustrates learner-centred smart learning and how they can benefit from smart technology. According to the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Smart Learning is as follows: S: Self Directed: It means that the system of education moves towards a system of self-learning more than ever before. The role of students changes from adopters to creators of knowledge. M: Motivated: It refers that education seeks creative problem solving and personalized assessment while being mindful of the experience. A: Adaptability: Adaptability means increasing the flexibility of the system of education and adapting learning to personal preferences for future careers. R: Resource enriched: Resource enriched says that smart-learning uses rich content for both the public and private sectors. T: Technology embedded: Technology embedded means that students can learn anytime and anywhere through advanced technology in the education environment.",

Some empirical research has discovered how such type of learning affects pedagogical tactics, endorsing that new pedagogical approaches in education could help students learn (Khan et al., 2019) . According to growing studies, internet technology and mobile devices are increasingly being used to assist students all around the world (Churchill et al., 2016) . Several studies (Alharbi et al., 2017; Khan et al., 2019) assert that learning assisted by advanced technology has worked as a significant accelerant in education systems, where the evolution of new learning approaches has profited from a momentous evolution that boosts the learning efficiency of both educators and students. The integration of internet and mobile technologies in education appears to have yielded positive results. Global revenue through E-learning is predicted to reach $65.41 billion by 2023. However, as a result of the covid-19 epidemic and the evolution of the 5G internet technology, education has fundamentally changed its essence. When using the smart learning concept, it is beneficial to undertake a more detailed study to finalize various learning strategies (Putnik, 2016) . Before applying smart learning in education, student's perceptions about the technology should be explored. The majority of past research has concentrated on students' adoption of learning through technology, with intent as a dependent variable. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance of Technology (UTAT), (Abu-Al-Aish & Love, 2013; Venkatesh et al., 2003) discovered that effort and performance expectancy, quality of service and personal innovativeness affect mobile learning acceptance. When Briz-Ponce et al., (2017) evaluated the variables of learning technology acceptance using TAM, they discovered that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness influenced the adoption of such technology. Lin et al., (2020) explored students learning intention using TAM \u222a TPB models. Smart learning, on the other hand, is a brand-new approach to education that has emerged in the previous decade and got importance, particularly after Covid-19. As a result, we anticipate that users will assent or reject smart learning based on their willingness to adopt smart learning technologies. Therefore, our study extended the traditional TAM by incorporating three new factors from social practice theory (SPT). Although there have been several studies in this field, research findings of student's adoption of smart learning in covid-19 are still few. Research on Chinese students' intentions of smart learning is a gap that needs to be filled.",

            "text": "The technology adoption literature offers a variety of models and theories that explain the process of technology adoption. The most obvious of these is the TAM proposed by Davis (1993) . Many researchers have confirmed the reliability and robustness of TAM in predicting and interpreting technology acceptance behavior (Venkatesh et al., 2003; Hasan, 2007; Kim et al., 2016) . TAM is considered to be a universal model used to solve consumer acceptance of innovative technologies (Cheung & Vogel, 2013; Ha & Stoel, 2009; Ullah et al., 2021) . Previous studies have also explored and validated its feasibility and usefulness (Cheng, 2012; Ha & Lee, 2019; Hubert et al., 2017) . However, its basic structure ignores some important aspects, which is one of the reasons for criticism and extra expansion. Davis (1993) also suggested adding other factors to the traditional TAM based on the study's background. Taking into account the innovative characteristics of 5G technology, in this study, we used the TAM as the elementary theoretic model to know the experiences of consumers' willingness to practice 5G technology for smart learning. The factors related to Social practice theory (SPT) have never been addressed before. The SPT can interact with the concepts of social psychology, which may provide useful insights that can theorize and change the practice of social significance meaning (Kurz et al., 2015; Spotswood et al., 2015) . We rely on Kurz et al., (2015) study to examine individual and structural factors of 5G technology. There are several configurations of SPT that exist (Higginson et al., 2015; Southerton, 2003; Warde, 2005) . However, mostly SPT methods use practice as a unit of analysis. The practice is a routine behavior, which is composed of many interrelated elements: the form of psychological and physical activity uses of things, the background, emotional, and motivation knowledge. The practice is a block, which depends on multiple elements and specific interrelation, and cannot be simplified to a single element. The version most suitable for behavior change is the three-element model due to its simplified approach. According to Shove et al., (2012) , the three-factor model consists of Material, competence, and Meanings factors. As a result, this study presented a new model (shown in Fig. 1 ) by combining TAM models with social practise theory elements (SPT). Based on the study background TAM and SPT factors are discussed below:",

Meaning is specific to an act or thing. Shove et al., (2012) explains that this theory stresses tacit and unconscious forms of experience and knowledge, through which a collective form of understanding is established. In the context of 5G technology for smart learning, these are the individual beliefs on learning concerning the classmates, teachers, and parents etc. In general, people may think about how people close to them view their practice of technology. This inspiration may come from academic personnel or people with high social status. Further, people make self-sacrificing purchases for the benefit of others or society. The covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented situation, which has a great significance for understanding consumer moral decision-making during and after a long-term epidemic. These environments provide users with an opportunity to imitate the fundamental meaning of consumption and its effect on themselves, society, and the environment. The covid-19 epidemic surprised consumers that their basic needs might not be completed because they may not have access to food and basic needs. At the same time, it has changed the consumer's view on how to meet social and personal needs. In terms of 5G technology consumers will consciously consider consumption and will make adoption decisions to be responsible to themselves and society. There may be a significant shift towards responsibility and pro-social consumption. Based on this solid empirical support, we assume:",

Practice constitutes a \"block,\" and its existence must depend on reality and existence. The specific interdependence between these elements cannot be condensed to any of these unique elements (Reckwitz, 2002) . The competence part of practice may relate to the social-psychological theories. In the context of 5G technology for smart learning, it means the desire of an individual to accept and use new technology or risktaking and attempts to practice new technologies (Hao et al., 2017) . Highly innovative people are more willing to give a positive response to new technologies (Milo\u0161evi\u0107 et al., 2015) . Besides, those who learn technology, are more likely innovative than others (Joo et al., 2014; Milo\u0161evi\u0107 et al., 2015) . Kim et al., (2017) stated that such people are more concerned with attaining information about using novel technologies. Students with innovative behavior want to assent the risk of using 5G technology and are more inclined to use it. Similarly, some people think that when innovative technology is deemed to be compatible with work practice, they may realize the practicability of technology (Chau & Hu, 2001; Moore, 1991) . In the context of Smart-learning through 5G, increased competencies access will positively impact as new 5G technologies will be compatible with existing technologies.

In addition, people were asked to use the snowball method to share questionnaires with classmates and friends. To maintain anonymity, all respondents were notified that their responses would be kept anonymous and used solely for academic purposes. To represent our proposed model design, the questionnaire was divided into demographic details and measuring parameters. From September 2020 to November 2020, through an online questionnaire website http:// www. sojump. com, a formal survey was conducted online. Finally, 375 valid responses were selected. Table 1 illustrates the demographic details of these respondents. The study results showed that both men (54.9%) and women (45.06%) were involved almost equally, with more than 71% of participants aged 20 to 40. About 29.06% of respondents have higher education and 62.9% have a university degree. In terms of user experience and similarity, both 4G (56.5%) and 5G (43.4%) users were examined.",

Therefore this study also used PLS-SEM to test the model's complete structure. PLS technique is usually divided into two steps: first, to evaluate the model's effectiveness and reliability. Second, to evaluate the path model and determine the model's ability to assess the structural model (Hair Jr et al., 2016; . Also, the bootstrap method through smartpls 3.0 has been used in this study to check the path coefficients and loading factors. The following sections discuss the outcomes of these two stages.",

Reliability is the degree to which an item set designated for a specified construct measure a similar construct, stay reliable in distinct situations. The term validity means how to fit the instrument chosen items of a given construct are realistic. Reliability can be measure through Cronbach's Table 2 and Fig. 2 . Crossloadings were examined to check the items discriminant validity (Hair Jr et al., 2016) . As the cross-loadings amongst constructs were more significant than the determined critical point, it verified the discriminant validity. Construct validity (CR) is another technique to assess the outer model. It determines that these processes are essential tools for expressing and measuring the investigative constructs (Hair Jr et al., 2016; Gefen and Straub, 2005) . Further Convergence validity is the degree that relates or converges measures of a similar construct (Hair Jr et al., 2016) . When the explained AVE's value is equivalent to or exceeds 0.5, convergence's effectiveness is verified (Fornell & Bookstein, 1982) . The AVE scores of all constructs were more than 0.5, which justifies the convergent validity (Table 3) . It can also be inspected through the CR of the constructs (Fornell & Bookstein, 1982) . By surpassing the 0.60 threshold value, all constructs verified the composite reliability (Hair Jr et al., 2016) . When calculating Cronbach's alpha to determine internal consistency, the reliability assessments should be more than 0.70 (Field, 2009) .

            "text": "This study varies from other studies on the adoption of 5G for smart learning in educational institutions. It presents a more inclusive model based on China's current needs and social conditions, which proposes that the choice of 5G for smart learning depends on a combination of certain factors (Materials, Meanings, and competencies). The outcomes of this study were conducted in different universities in China. Regarding the material meaning and competency characteristics as part of the premise of student's beliefs. It was shown that these factors have an important impact on smart learning via 5G adoption. This study provides a priori smart learning acceptance by providing valuable information about key characteristics that support students' perceptions and beliefs of enhancing students' BI to adopt 5G technology for smart learning. The study has some limitations too. Even though we employed marker variables to look for common method bias, our findings are based on cross-sectional data. This study only covers a few Chinese universities, therefore the results can only be generalized to Chinese universities. Thus universities of different regions having different characteristics in terms of psychology, education, and demographics should be considered in future studies. Future studies should be conducted to develop adoption models for smart learning based on the other characteristics identified as prerequisites for smart learning acceptance. Although this study analyses the feasibility and substance of an interdisciplinary approach briefly, it is noted that it would be best conceptualised through the future development of a set of SPT-based tools. As a result, while this article is only the beginning of a new approach to behaviour, it is hoped that it will contribute to a rich new gusset of analysis that will illustrate the issue of smart learning through 5G technology, allowing the development of effective, practical exposure to smart learning behavioural changes.
