Till now, there is no drug molecule that has been convincingly identified as the inhibitor of the function of this protein. The current pandemic situation demands a shortcut to quickly reach to a lead compound or a drug, which may not be the best but might serve as an interim solution at least. Following this notion, the present investigation uses virtual screening to find a molecule which is alraedy approved as a drug for some other disease but could be repurposed to inhibit Mpro. The potential of the present method of work to identify such a molecule, which otherwise would have been missed out, lies in the fact that instead of just using the crystallographically identified conformation of the receptor's ligand binding pocket, molecular dynamics generated ensemble of conformations has been used. It implicitly included the possibilities of \"induced-fit\" and/or \"population shift\" mechanisms of ligand fitting. As a result, the investigation has not only identified antiviral drugs like ribavirin, ritonavir, etc., but it has also captured a wide variety of drugs for various other diseases like amrubicin, cangrelor, desmopressin, diosmin, etc. as the potent possibilities. Some of these ligands are versatile to form stable interactions with various different conformations of the receptor and therefore have been statistically surfaced in the investigation. Overall the investigation offers a wide range of compounds for further testing to confirm their scopes of applications to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "A number of proteins are encoded by the genome of this RNA virus including 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or the main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, etc. [2] . Among these proteins, Mpro becomes a very potential drug target because of a number of reasons [3, 4] . Replication and transcription of the virus are mediated by two overlapping polyproteins pp1ab. A highly complex proteolytic processing event of the polyproteins is catalyzed by two proteases. Among the two proteases, Mpro is the key enzyme which catalyzes the cleavage of the polyproteins at 11 sites conserved in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2. Therefore, Mpro is essential for viral replication and is a lucrative drug target [5] . Another important feature is that though the virus is very much prone to mutations, Mpro, being a conserved protein throughout the Coronavirinae subfamily is much less susceptible to frequent mutation. Therefore, designing inhibitors against Mpro would be worthwhile for the treatment of not only the SARS-CoV-2 but also for the entire subfamily. Also, cleavage specificity of no human protease is known to match with that of Mpro, thereby low or no inhibitor toxicity for human proteases can be expected. The Mpro consists of 3 distinct structural domains made up of 13 \u03b2sheets and 11 \u03b1-helices ( Fig. 1) [6] . Domain1 (residues 8-101 shown in orange) and domain 2 (residues 102-184 shown in green) comprised mostly of antiparallel \u03b2-barrel, with a folding scaffold found in other viral proteases [7, 8] . Domain 3 comprising of \u03b1-helices (residues 201-306 shown in red) is specific for CoVMpro. A loop of~15 residues (185-200 shown in purple) links domains 2 and 3. A H41-C145 catalytic dyad is present at the interface between domains 1 and 2 which hydrolyze the peptide bond at specific cleavage sites in a series of steps. Imidazole group of H41 extracts the side-chain proton of C145 resulting into thiolate nucleophile which then attacks the amide bond of the substrate. As a result of proton extraction, N-terminal portion releases from H41 which in turn releases the C-terminal portion restoring the catalytic dyad. Therefore the inhibitors which perturb the communication between the H41 and C145 would block the catalytic cycle of the protein. N3 is a computationally designed peptido-mimetic irreversible Michael acceptor inhibitor which has the capability to inhibit Mpro of not only SARS-CoV2 but also other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [9] . It acts as a natural target of Mpro that forms a covalent bond with the catalytic site residue like any Michael acceptor inhibitor, blocking the catalytic cycle of the protein [10] . The inhibitor also showed antiviral activity against bronchitis virus in an animal model [11] . The 50% cytotoxicity concentration of the inhibitor is >133 \u03bcM [9] .",

            "text": "Computer-aided drug designing (CADD) offers methods to accelerate the search for possible lead compounds, and the virtual screening of compounds with respect to a receptor is one of such widely used methods [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . The standard practice of such screening is to use a conformation of the receptor as a reference to find suitable ligands that fit in its binding pocket; the model of the conformation may come either from experiment or from computation or their combination. But in a real system, in principle, all possible conformations are present, and therefore a ligand can select the conformation of the receptor that it suits, even if that is not the most probable conformation of the uncomplexed/apo receptor, and then through a population shift, the equilibrium can gradually shift towards the complex state. Therefore, the use of one conformation of the receptor, even if it is experimentally determined, can miss the ligands that would be of higher binding affinity for another conformation of the binding pocket of the receptor. To overcome this limitation, a relatively better approach is to use multiple conformations of the receptors as the references for screening the ligands. In this work, The catalytic site is magnified showing H41-C145 catalytic dyad starting from the experimentally determined structure, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation-based conformational sampling has been used to generate an ensemble of conformations, and from that pool, fourteen different conformations of the receptors along with the experimentally derived receptor were chosen for the screening using the \"DrugBank\" database containing 2115 FDA-approved compounds [34] .",

The energy minimization of the model and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were performed using NAMD 2.12 package [37] , at 300 K, under NPT conditions, using a 2 fs time integration step, and the snapshots were saved at every 4 ps interval. Heating and equilibration were followed by production run. Short-range nonbonded interactions were truncated at 12 \u00c5, whereas the long-range electrostatic interactions were computed using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method [38] . The pressure and the temperature were controlled using Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat/barostat algorithm [39] . A 100 ns trajectory was run. Before continuing with the docking procedure, the trajectory was clustered skipping every alternate frame in UCSF Chimera based on backbone RMSD of the protein with default RMSD cutoff provided by the software [40] . Because of the relatively large population of the first 14 clusters, central frames of these clusters (named as frames 2-15) were selected. The apo crystal structure (named as frame 1) along with frames 2-15 were selected for ensemble docking. (Fig. 2, Fig. S1 ).",

In the crystal structure, N3 has been found to form a covalent bond with C145 [9] . Re-docking of N3 in all the 15 frames using the docking pipeline crossed all of the stages; among them, frame 1, which correspond to the receptor's conformation seen in the crystal stature, showed the best XP g-score (\u22127.5 kcal mol \u22121 ), along with frame 2, as listed in Table 1 . When frames 1 and 2 are further compared in terms of the binding free energy, frame 1 appeared as the best. Therefore, the positive control run successfully selected the best receptor's conformation for itself, being fully in agreement with the experimentally determined conformation. Visually, it was observed that the binding pose of N3 was similar to that of crystal structure in multiple frames, and that serves as the benchmark of the method and the capacity to identify the best pair of receptor's conformation and ligand (Fig. 3a) . The g-score of the 6LU7 was used as a reference to find a ligand-drug with higher affinity. Ligand interaction diagram (Fig. 3b, c) of the re-docked complexes revealed the interaction of N3 with the catalytic dyad H41-C145 of the active site. These are the key residues for a proteolytic process where the thiol group of the C145 acts as nucleophile [45] . N3 was also found to form a hydrogen bond with N142, G143, E166, and Q189 and salt bridge with E166 in different frames (Fig. 3b, c) . The salt bridge formation between N3 and Mpro is very important because E166 is known to have a crucial role in the dimerization of Mpro by associating the binding site with dimer interface, and that is necessary for the catalytic function of the protein [31] .",

The reason of adding those compounds in the list was that they were biochemically and/or functionally close to one or more of those 23 compounds. For example, doxorubicin and valrubicin (Table 1 , Serial no. 13 and 30, respectively) were present in 3 frames each, but three other, rubicins amrubicin, daunorubicin, and idarubicin were left out because of their presence in less number of frames; they were added in Table 2 because of their biochemical and functional similarity with doxorubicin and valrubicin. From this list, the ligands which were present in at least 3 frames were elaborated further in with the details of their interaction pattern with Mpro (Fig. S3) . Interestingly for most of the compounds, the H-bond and salt bridge with E166 were common indicating that they might have the capability to disrupt the dimerization on Mpro which is important for performing the catalytic function [31] . A number of the screened drugs were found to interact with H41. The Hbonds and/or other interactions between H41 and different ligands could be argued to disrupt the interaction of the H41-C145 catalytic dyad rendering Mpro unable to perform its catalytic function.",

            "text": "Complexes from screening The Mpro, which was derived from crystal structure 6LU7 by eliminating N3, identified ritonavir as a promising drug candidate although the g-score was lesser than a number of other hits. The score \u2212 7.6 kcalmol \u22121 however was almost the same as N3; nevertheless, the identification of ritonavir provides a confidence to this computed prediction as the ligand is currently under discussion everywhere. The interaction pattern of ritonavir with residues of Mpro as depicted in Fig. 4 revealed this ligand also interacts with the catalytic site residues especially H41-C145 catalytic dyad forming \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction with H41 which might disrupt the communication between the dyad residues. In addition to ritonavir, a number of antivirals along with antibiotics, vasodilators, antineoplastic drugs like different rubicins, drugs used to treat circulatory diseases, drugs for bone diseases, etc. were found as top-scoring ligands in different frames ( Table 2) . Antivirals like ribavirin, sofosbuvir, zanamivir, penciclovir, saquinavir, ganciclovir, and cidofovir were found, some of them having known protease inhibitor properties. Most of the ligands were found in a single frame or in multiple frames with very low g-score (data not shown). All these drugs though have been found as potent Mpro inhibitors in other studies [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] ; here, only ribavirin, which is presently under phase II clinical trial, was found in 4 frames, the gscores being less than N3 and ritonavir (Table S3 ). The score of ribavirin was the highest in frame 6 (\u22127.179 kcal mol \u22121 ), and plausibly is due to the formation of H-bonds with residues R188 and T190 in this frame but not elsewhere (Fig. S5a) . Further, in the lowest-scoring frame, i.e., in frame 13, the NH 2 group of the ligand was not involved in the formation of Hbond with any residues of the catalytic site (Fig. S5b) . Binding free energy for all the frames ranging between \u221229 and \u221239 kcal mol \u22121 was much lower compared to that of other ligands. The reason of a low g-score and binding free energy could be attributed to a smaller size of the ligand which leads to lesser accessibility to catalytic site residues.",

Azithromycin is being used to treat COVID-19 but possibly to prevent secondary infections and may not be interfering with the components of the virus [53] . The antibiotics screened in this work, enviomycin, lymecycline, novobiocin, kanamycin, tigecycline, cefpiramide, ceftolozane, and cefixime, have been already known to be used as antivirals as well as for lung diseases. Lymecycline, which has been found as an inhibitor for Mpro in different studies, was identified in 4 frames. There was \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between lymecycline and H41only in the highest-scoring frame, i.e., frame 2 (Table S4, Fig. S6a) . Also, H-bond and salt bridge are formed between E166 and NH 3 + and NH 2 + group of the ligand in this frame while in other frames salt bridge was formed with NH 2 + group (Fig. S6b) . The salt bridge between NH 2 + group of the ligand and E166 might be considered as capable of stabilizing the ligand within the catalytic site of Mpro, but it can be stated that the involvement of both NH 2 + and NH 3 + in the formation of salt bridge as well as H-bond with E166 led to better stabilization as well as optimization of the ligand resulting the best g-score as well as binding free energy (Table S4) . Cefpiramide, present in 5 frames, was found to have the best score in frame 7. In this frame, H-bonds were more in number. Additionally two salt bridges were formed with H41 and E47 (Fig. S6c) . Tigecycline was found in 3 frames g-scores varying between \u22126.9 and \u22127.3 kcal mol \u22121 . Salt bridge was present between the NH 2 + group of the ligand and E166 in all frames. Only in the highest-scoring frame, there was a cation-\u03c0 interaction with H163 (Fig. S6d) . The highest score of ceftolozane though is better than N3 (\u22128.9 kcal mol \u22121 ); in other three frames, the scores were much less than N3, the lowest being \u22124.8 kcal mol \u22121 . Only in the highest-scoring frame there was a salt bridge and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between H41 and the Fig. 4 Orientation and interactions of ritonavir in the catalytic site: (a) 2D ligand interaction diagram that shows stacking interaction between ligand and H41 (green), (b) 3D orientation of the ligand in the same conformation. The color scheme followed Fig. 1 ligand (Fig. S6e) . In lowest-scoring frame in addition to H41, salt bridge was formed between the NH 3 + group of the ligand and E166 which might have over-stabilized the ligand resulting in a low g-score (Fig. S6f) . Binding free energies for all the antibiotics were in agreement with the g-scores (Table S4 ). The rest of the antibiotics, though with g-scores better than N3, were found in less number of frames, and therefore they were not discussed here in detail.",

The use of drugs that inhibit intravenous clotting like heparin and tissue plasminogen activator along with other drugs have already been disclosed as more effective [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . In the present investigation, cardiovascular drugs like cangrelor and diosmin were found in more than 50% of the frames and imparted in more rigorous interactions in MD-generated receptor frames suggesting Tables S6 and S6 , respectively. Among the different plant flavonoids reported as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor, diosmin has been reported in several studies [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . In our multi-conformation-based screening study, diosmin, an anticoagulant, was found in 9 frames, the highest and lowest being frames 10 (\u221210.266 kcal mol \u22121 ) and 6 (\u22127.517 kcal mol \u22121 ), respectively (Table S6 ). In the ligand interaction diagram, it was seen that there were cation-\u03c0 and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions among the ligand and H41 of Mpro in the lowest frame (Fig. 5c) .",

            "text": "Binding free energy of lowest-scoring frame was however more or less similar to that of the highest-scoring frame. The ligand orientation within the binding pocket varied in the highest and the lowest-scoring frames. L167 was forming Hbond with the ligand in the lowest-scoring frame. While gscores of diosmin in most of the frames were more than or near the values of N3, scores of cangrelor, another cardiovascular drug, were mostly less than that of N3 (Table S7 ). In 2 out of 11 frames, the value was more than that of N3. H41 was found to form salt bridges with the molecule in all the frames except in the lowest one. The orientation of the ligand was number of H-bonds and the involvement of -OH group in case of highest scoring frame compared to the lowest scoring frame are notable. Color scheme followed Fig. 1 different in the highest and lowest-scoring frames. In the highest-scoring frame, side chains E166 and K137 were oriented towards the outer side of the catalytic side, so they were not involved in the H-bonding (Fig. 6b) . The PO 4 -containing group of the ligand was forming H-bonds with the catalytic site residues. Cl \u2212 of the ligand was also involved in the interaction in the highest-scoring frame. On the contrary, in the lowest-scoring frame, K137 was oriented towards the ligand and was forming salt bridge with the PO 4 group (Fig. 6c, d) . E166 was also involved in forming H-bond with the ligand. Regadenoson was screened in 6 out of 15 frames. Details of catalytic site residues involved in the interaction with this drug as depicted in Table S8 showed the g-scores were less than N3, the lowest and highest being \u22125.156 and -7.678 kcal mol \u22121 , respectively. The number of H-bonds were more in the highestscoring frame (frame 7), and the -OH groups of the ligand were involved in H-bond formation (Fig. 7a) while in the lowestscoring frame (frame 11), the -OH groups were not forming H-bonds (Fig. 7c) . Binding free energies of cangrelor and regadenoson were not consistent with the g-scores. It can be argued that the best pose of a ligand might not result in the lowest binding free energy as the type of interactions could alter the fitting of the ligand. Again, the poses with lowest binding free energy might be associated with over-stabilization of the ligands Three vasodilators desmopressin, felypressin, and terlipressin, were screened as Mpro inhibitors among which desmopressin and felypressin were found in 11 and 10 frames, respectively. Though there was no experimental evidence of antiviral effects of the pressins, felypressin has been found as an inhibitor of the dengue virus in silico [72] . Details of interactions of desmopressin and felypressin are given in Table S9 and S10, respectively. Side-chain orientations of catalytic site residues of Mpro and also the ligand desmopressin in the highest (frame 4) and lowest (frame 11) scoring frames were different (Fig. 8) . In frame 4, N119 and N142 were not involved in H-bonds while T190 and Q192 were forming Hbonds with the ligand (Fig. 8a, b) . In this frame, T190 and Q192 were not oriented towards the ligand in frame 11 and thus were not involved in H-bonds formation. XP g-scores of felypressin were the highest and lowest in frames 4 and 13, respectively (Table S10 ). The number of H-bonds between ligand and Mpro was much higher in frame 4 especially with (Fig. 9a, c) . Also salt bridges were present between E166 of Mpro and one of the NH 3 + of the ligand in frame 4. One of the NH 2 instead of NH 3 + was forming H-bond with E166 in frame 13, and H41 was forming H-bond with the ligand (Fig.  9b, d) . The ligand was nearer to side chain of C44 in frame 13 where there was an H-bond between C44 and ligand, but in frame 4, the ligand was away from C44, and also the orientation of C44 was different. The side chains of T190 and Q192 were oriented towards the ligand in frame 4 but were away from the ligand in frame 13. As a result, H-bonds between the residues were found in frame 4 but not in frame 13 (Fig. 9b, d) . In the case of the highest-scoring frame of terlipressin (frame 1), like previous two pressins, one of the NH 3 + group of the ligand was forming H-bond as well as salt bridge with E166 (Table S11 , Fig. S9a ). In the lowest-scoring frame, there was no salt bridge between the ligand and Mpro (Fig. S9b) . Binding free energies were in correspondence with the g-scores.",

Some of them have been found as Mpro inhibitor in different studies [73] [74] [75] . Out of these drugs, almasilate, though found in 6 frames, is a buffering antacid; thereby, its chance of entering into the bloodstream is very less likely. Therefore, this drug has not been discussed in detail here. Also the binding free energies of the ligand were very low in different frames. Imami et al., with their transcriptome-based approach, have shown that carbetocin, the analogue of oxytocin, has an impact on the induction of immune response in COVID-19 [73] .",

Risedronate and zoledronic acid, drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone diseases, were found in 4 and 6 frames, respectively. Both of the ligands possess O \u2212 groups which were found to be involved in the formation of salt bridge with H41 (Table S12 ). In the case of zoledronic acid, additionally cation-\u03c0 and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with H41 were seen. The binding free energy of these ligands was very low compared to that of others ranging from~\u22122 to \u221221 kcalmol \u22121 . Polydatin, a picecid, used in various diseases like anti-arrhythmia drug and potassium channel modulator, was found as a probable Mpro inhibitor in previous studies [74, 75] . Here the ligand was found to be buried in the catalytic pocket of Mpro in the highest-scoring ligand while in the lowest-scoring one, a smaller number of residues were accessible (Table S12) . Arbutamine and dobutamine, the drugs to treat cardiogenic shock, were found in frames 1 and 3, respectively. Low scoring frames of arbutamine showed covalent interactions with E166 which were not found in the highest-scoring frame. Rather in the highest-scoring frame, there was a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction with H41. The binding free energy was highest in this frame. H41 of Mpro was found to form a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and/or cation-\u03c0 interaction, and E166 was involved in salt bridge formation with droxidopa, a norepinephrine prodrug, in all frames except the highest-scoring one (frame 6). Mitoxantrone, an antineoplastic drug, was obtained in 3 frames among which a number of protein-ligand H-bonds were least in the highest-scoring frame (Table S12 ). The binding free energies of droxidopa and mitoxantrone were in harmony with the g-scores. It can be stated that more proteinligand interaction might sometimes result in over-stabilization of the ligands which might alter the optimal function of the ligand. Some of the drugs discussed in this paragraph were detected as an inhibitor of Mpro in previous studies, most of them being in silico. These drugs could be tested further experimentally. Modification of functional groups of the rest of the drugs might result into new compounds with the capability to inhibit Mpro.",

This was done with the expectation that it would be able to identify the ligand at least having similar interaction pattern with desired biochemical activity and then would carry some additional features that might increase the probability of success rate of the prediction. The present virtual screening and MM-GBSA-based approaches have revealed a number of FDA-approved drugs which have Mpro affinity above the cutoff of N3 scores. Almost all the top-scoring drugs were forming hydrogen bonds with the catalytic site residues H41, M49, F140, L141, G143-C145, H163-164, M165, E166, P168, H172, and D187-N192, the same contact points seen in the N3 complex. Though not all, some of the identified drugs have already proven antiviral effects.",

There have been some exceptions in the trends of the g-scores and the binding free energies, which otherwise reflected the correlation in their trends, i.e., the good gscore did not correspond to promising binding affinity in some cases which indicated the need of some advanced method of refinement. But in this work, shortlisting of ligands by either of the scoring methods was the goal, and as that was achieved, the strict match between g-score and binding free energy was not aspired. Again the consonance of binding free energy with the g-score in most of the ligands has confirmed that the particular pattern of interaction in the best scoring ligands resulted in the lowest binding free energies. Also, it was evident that the usage of multiple conformations for screening resulted in some molecules which might have been rejected if a single conformation would have been used because of relatively lower g-score and binding free energy.",

The N3 molecule is already known to bind to Mpro, which is reported as its co-crystallized ligand. The binding score of N3 has been used as a reference, and the ligands with scores better than this are plausibly expected to bind to Mpro with higher affinity. The scores of the docking and also the computed binding free energies are best interpreted in a relative scale, instead of debating on the absolute values. The use of ensemble representation of the receptor's conformation has implicitly covered the possibilities of \"induced-fit\" and/or \"population shift\" mechanisms that the ligands might adapt to fit in the pocket, and therefore this method has been powerful to identify a wide variety of ligands, and many of which would have been otherwise missed out. It has not only identified antiviral drugs like ribavirin, ritonavir, etc., but it has also identified the drugs used in various other diseases, e.g., amrubicin, cangrelor, desmopressin, diosmin, etc. as the potential candidates to inhibit Mpro. The screened drugs might have a cumulative inhibitory effect on the viral multiplication and pathogenesis. Functional group modification of the drugs might lead to better binding affinity with Mpro. Top-scoring ligands with correlating binding free energies could be considered for persuasion of further tests and designing inhibitors against the viral protein.",
