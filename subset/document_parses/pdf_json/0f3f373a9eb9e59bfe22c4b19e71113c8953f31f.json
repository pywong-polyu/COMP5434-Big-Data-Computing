All patients enrolled in the study were RT-PCR positive for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR positivity was mandatory for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 at the study centre. We included patients in whom complete data were available from admission to discharge or death. The patients still admitted in the hospital at the end of the study period (as of 11 May 2020) were not included. The case files of these patients were reviewed, and information on demographical details (age, gender), comorbidities, types of comorbidities, a requirement for oxygen support, admission to ICU and details of treatment given was obtained. Treatment with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), oseltamivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, steroid or oxygen support was considered to be the treatment of interest with the intention to cure. The patients who were completely asymptomatic were treated with multivitamins and zinc. For the purpose of this analysis, these patients have been considered as having received no treatment. No sample size calculations were performed. The sample size was determined by the time window of the study.",

We measured time to event in days from the date of hospital admission to the date of in-hospital deaths. The event was considered to be censored if individuals were discharged alive. We constructed Cox proportional HR models; one univariate and the other in which all variables were adjusted for age (continuous) and gender (categorical). From the models, HRs with 95% CI were estimated for the included variable to determine their effects on the risk of in-hospital mortality. We considered 12 variables in our Cox proportional hazard model (age, gender, comorbidities, number of comorbidities, presence of symptoms, history of hypertension alone, history of hypertension with any other comorbid conditions, history of hypertension and diabetes only, history of diabetes alone, history of diabetes with other comorbid conditions and treatment of interest).",

Patients discharged alive were much younger (median age 38, IQR 26) compared with those with in-hospital mortality (median age 55, IQR 20) .

Comorbid conditions were reported by 129 cases (18.72%). No respiratory support was required for 520 patients (97.56%) who were discharged alive, while 13 patients required some kind of respiratory support. Sixty-seven patients (83.75%) requiring any kind of oxygen support died. Patients' details stratified by treatment details are provided in table 2. No comorbidity or any kind of respiratory support was reported by 88 patients (12.77%) who did not receive any COVID-19-related treatment. Comorbidities were present in 21.46% of patients who received any kind of treatment of interest. Most of the patients received azithromycin plus HCQ (48.08%), while only azithromycin was received by 39.43% of patients. Azithromycin with oseltamivir was received by 22.79% of patients.

Given the high density of population in residential areas, the strategy in India and particularly in Mumbai should focus on spacious areas and facilities to quarantine positive cases. There seems to be a much lesser need for ventilators and ICU for treating patients with COVID-19 in India compared with western countries.",

Hypertension was observed to be one of the strongest risk factors for mortality. This is consistent with data from in-hospital mortality reported from New York City, China and Italy. 6 9-16 Given the globally high burden of hypertension and a possible understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE-2, it will be important to obtain information related to drugs (beta-blockers or ACE-2 inhibitors) taken by patients with hypertension. 17 We observed statistical significant multiplicative interaction between old age and comorbidity. The joint effect of older age and the presence of comorbid conditions on the risk of dying was higher among women (HR 8.10, 95% CI 4.04 to 16.23) than among men (HR 2.87, 95% CI 1.63 to 5.05).",

All these drugs were administered with an intention to cure and were supposed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. However, we observed no change in the disease course with all of these treatments of interest when compared with a group of individuals who did not receive any treatment. These results should be interpreted with caution as none of the no treatment group of patients had any comorbidity or required any oxygen support. As no treatment group was asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, only three of them died; while almost all of them were discharged with advice to quarantine. Thus, the treatment of interest was given to a more symptomatic group of patients which could be responsible for high risk of death we observed with any of the treatment of interest. We therefore cannot conclude that these treatment combinations increase risk of death. However, our results suggest that these repurpose drugs could not alter the clinical course of the disease among this group. The same has been concluded in many randomised clinical trials which showed no reduction in mortality from these drugs. 18 ",
