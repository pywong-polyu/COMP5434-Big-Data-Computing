The present study attempts to explore the risk on different modes of transportation and GHG emissions (based on change in travel behavior) during peak/non-peak hours in a day by an online/offline survey for commuters in Indian metropolitan cities like MMR, Delhi and Bengaluru. In MMR, the probability of infection in car estimated to be 0.88 and 0.29 during peak and non-peak hour, respectively, considering all windows open. The risk of infection in public transportation system such as in bus (0.307), train (0.521), and metro (0.26) observed to be lower than in private vehicles. Furthermore, impact of COVID-19 on GHG emissions have also been explored considering three scenarios. The GHG emissions have been estimated for base (3.83-16.87 tonne), lockdown (0.22-0.48 tonne) and unlocking (2.13-9.30 tonne) scenarios. It has been observed that emissions are highest during base scenario and lowest during lockdown situation. This study will be a breakthrough in understanding the impact of pandemic on environment and transportation. The study shall help transport planners and decision makers to operate public transport during pandemic like situation such that the modal share of public transportation is always highest. It shall also help in regulating the GHG emissions causing climate change.",

The suburban rail (51% is the highest contributor to the modal share, followed by a bus (14%). Other modes also share 21.3% (car and twowheeler) and 11.7% (auto-rickshaw and taxi) in the total modal share of MMR (CMP, 2016) . Delhi has significant reliance on its public transportation infrastructure. Buses in Delhi carry more passengers than in MMR. The buses in Delhi travel 10% of the total vehicle kilometre; they, however, cater 54% of the total passenger-kilometres (Khanna et al., 2011; Jain and Tiwari, 2016) . With the expansion of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), the public transportation sector of Bengaluru changed drastically with an increase in the share of a public bus in the modal share by double (IIHS, 2015) . Nearly 50% of the population in the city commute through BMTC buses (Badami et al., 2009) . The urban districts in Bengaluru show a modal split with the dominance of bus (28%) followed by a walk (29%). The remaining share in the modal split is shared by twowheeler (23%), four-wheeler (10%), autos-rickshaw + taxi (3%), cycle (5%), and train (1%) (Baindur et al., 2016) .",

Change in the modal shift was observed on the specific route in MMR due to the implementation of the Mumbai metro . In Delhi, modal shift towards the metro was observed due to overcrowding in buses and congestion on roads (Chauhan et al., 2016) . Literatures highlighted the savings in travel time as the main attraction towards shifting from buses to Delhi metro line I apart from other issues like connecting modes, cleanings at stations (bus and train), and other amenities (Kumar et al., 2014) . In addition to travel time, in Bengaluru, a congestion charge was also a factor influencing people's mode choice (Sarkar et al., 2017) . COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a new reason for the modal shift in vehicles since 2020. The perception of higher risk in public, intermediate, and flights, results into switching towards private cars in India (Dandapat et al., 2020) . However, the choice of mode selection was utterly dependent upon the respondent's age, income, and working status in Indian cities (Bhaduri et al., 2020) . It was observed that the shared mobility option in India dropped by 35% due to the unavailability of vehicles during the lockdown. Other modes of transport like walk and bicycle saw a significant increase in the contribution to the total modal share for short trips (Gajendran et al., 2020) . In Istanbul, a substantial reduction in usage of public transportation and simultaneous shifting towards private vehicles have been observed during unlocking period (Shakibaei et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "The major reason behind change in travel behaviour during COVID-19 pandemic may be due to the risk of infection in the transportation modes. In India, Das et al. (2021) estimated risk probability inside the vehicle, air-conditioned (AC) taxi observed to be highly risky (6.10 \u00d7 10 \u22122 ), followed by Non-AC taxi (1.71 \u00d7 10 \u22122 ), whereas risk probability in public buses (1.42 \u00d7 10 \u22122 ) and auto rickshaws (1.99 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) were seemed to be relatively lower and least, respectively. The study concluded that the probability of infection inside a transport vehicle depends on the air change per hour. The probability of getting infection depends on ventilation system (fresh air requirement), the exposure time, and occupancy of the vehicle. Furthermore, a distance of 1.6 to 3.0 m while talking was observed to be safe to reduce the chances of catching the exhaled large droplets (Sun et al., 2020) . In confined spaces as well a sound ventilation system has been considered to lower the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, to have risk probability of 1% in confined space, the ventilation rate to be in the range of 100-350 m 3 /hour (15 min exposure time) and 1200-400 m 3 /hour (3 h exposure time) (Dai et al., 2020) . In addition to, infection risk, migration of people comes out to be another reason for change in mobility pattern (Beria et al., 2021) . In a built environment, if we increase the open space the incident rate decreases and overcrowding results in increase in infection probability (Liu et al., 2021) .",

The CO 2 emissions for India were expected to drop by ~ 15% during March 2020 lockdown and by 20% during April month (Myllavirta & Dahiya, 2020) .

A significant reduction in PM 2.5 and AQI was observed over metro cities, while tropospheric NO 2 concentration showed decreasing trend. The analysis indicated the significant improvement in air quality during lockdown. assessed the diurnal and temporal change at 134 sites across India during lockdown due to COVID-19. A decline in PM2.5, PM 10 and NO was observed. The analysis revealed that PM2.5 and PM 10 reduced significantly to nearly 40-60%, while nearly 30-70% reduction in NO 2 was observed. Furthermore, a significant improvement in air quality with a marginal increase in O3 was observed in Delhi. Sahraei et al.

The gaps identified from the literature review are as follows: the modal shift due to pandemic and probability of infection for all modes of transport is unexplored area, multiple factors for infection probability (speed, occupancy, travel time, peak/non-peak hour) estimation are lacking, rapid transport system are not studied, GHG emission for Indian cities are not quantified. Therefore, the present study aims to fulfil these gaps identified in literature for metropolitan cities of India considering real time scenarios of driving. The present study will be a breakthrough for transport planners and policymakers to regulate the transportation system during a pandemic to carry out essential activities with a minimum spread of the infection.",

Thus risk probability calculation is beyond the scope of work for the entire train/metro (4) The emission rate, which is q, is also considered as minimum ~ 10. However, the value of 'q' for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) varies from ~ 10 to ~ 300 (Dai et al., 2020) (5) Since it is mandatory to wear a mask in MMR, especially in public spaces. Our study has also assumed the effectiveness of the mask. Thus particle penetration rate (R m ) and filtration rate (F m ) both are considered (Fennelly et al., 1998 & Furuya, 2007 (1) Where, P is the infection risk probability, F m is the particle filtration rate, p is the pulmonary ventilation rate per person (m 3 /hour), q is the emission rate, R m is the particle penetration rate, t is travel time in the respective mode of transport (Hour), and Q is the ventilation rate of clean air (m 3 /hour). All the above input parameters for estimation of P are taken from Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5. Thus the infection risk probability was estimated using Wells-Riley Eq. 2 (Wells, 1955; Riley, 1978) .",

In Delhi, from the number of respondents, the emissions before COVID-19 were estimated to be 6.42 tonne which reduced to 2.19 tonne during unlocking and had dropped to 0.24 tonne during the lockdown. The reduction in emission during lockdown has justification of all activities being stopped, however during unlocking only essential activities were open which may be reason for reduction in emissions. Bengaluru and MMR observed a similar highest reduction in CO 2 emission during a lockdown of 16.57 tonne and 3.83 tonne, respectively (Fig. 5b & c) . Emissions were higher in Bengaluru in base scenario because public transport had no share in transportation mode for work. It was dominated by 4 and 2 W, whereas in MMR, emission load was less compared to Bengaluru because MMR has highest mode share of public transport (48%) in base scenario. Amongst all three cities, MMR had the least emission load because of its balanced state of public and private transport. Although public transport in MMR was reduced during unlocking but it had a share of 39% compared to other cities which had 0 (Bengaluru) and 42% (Delhi).",

The probability of infections varies based on the conditions of windows closed/open. When the windows are open, the risk varies from 0.24 (off-peak hour) to 0.84 (peak hour). The chance reaches 1 for both peak and off-peak hours when windows are closed with no ventilation. The reduction in probability from 0.84 to 0.29 is due to the following factors off-peak hours, when the speed increase to 40 km/hour and exposure time also reduces to 30 min ( Fig. 6a & b) . 4 W in our study refers to the private vehicle carrying two passengers (1 infected) for both peak/off-peak hours of the day. Similar findings observed for taxi which includes Ola/Uber/Kaali-peeli in MMR. Similarly, for non-peak hour, the probability was 0.21 (windows open) and 0.95 (windows closed). There is also an observed reduction in the probability of risk between 4 W (private) and taxi which may be due to a reduction in an exposure time of 10-15 min between each.",

The survey revealed that mode share of public transport (bus, train and metro) reduced to 18 to 100% for all three cities. Delhi, however, observed an increase in the share of public buses but in Bengaluru, the share reduced by 100% (bus + metro). The modal share of car and 2 W increased by 10 to 20%. The survey indicated a significant rise in the share of 2 W for all three cities due to COVID-19. The behavioural change in travel patterns shows the subsequent reduction in GHG emissions relative to the base scenario. The reduction of 6 tonne, 17.61 tonne and 5.86 tonne in GHG emission were observed in Delhi, Bengaluru and MMR, respectively, due to COVID-19 restrictions. Further, the analysis propagates with the estimation of risk probability for different travel modes in MMR. The highest risk probability of 0.84 (non-peak hour) and 1 (peak hour) observed to be in four Wheeler (4 W), whereas auto rickshaws are observed to have the lowest risk probability of 0.07 (peak) and 0.05 (off-peak). Occupancy of the vehicle, vehicle speed, and travel time were found to be the major factors that influence the probability of getting an infection. The study provides an impact of COVID-19 on GHG emissions and transport pattern of major cities. Similar study with survey from different economic and social background shall provide further information. There is a room for the further research with the inclusion of factors such as travel time, waiting Funding There is no financial support in this study.",
