Pharmacies were also informed about the Nikshay portal, a web based online notification and patient management system in India. Of the 14,896 pharmacies at the 13 pilot sites, a total of 5,477 (i.e., close to one-third) were engaged. These selected pharmacies were validated by the field staff and were either the in-house pharmacies or the neighbouring ones where TB patients bought the anti-TB drugs prescribed by PPSA-engaged doctors. The endto-end step-wise process followed during the pharmacy engagement pilot intervention is shown in the Figure. To strengthen pharmacy engagement, support was sought from Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) Maharashtra, which issued a circular encouraging the pharmacies to record and share complete details of TB patients.",

            "text": "Between October 2019 and March 2021, JEET collected information on 32,787 patients. Due to incomplete and incorrect details, information collected for 86% of the patients could not be validated and used. Information on the remaining 14% (i.e., 4,505 TB cases) could be validated and was notified in the system. Of the total 4,505 TB cases notified, the majority were from pilot sites of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (MC) (n \u00bc 1,011), followed by Kalyan Dombivili MC (KDMC) (n \u00bc 792). In spite of the high collection rates of patient information from PPSA districts Thane (n \u00bc 6,285), Pune (n \u00bc 3,540), Vasai Virar (n \u00bc 3,368) and Sholapur (n \u00bc 3,216), the post-validation and notification yields were as low as 6%, 11%, 7% and 9%, respectively. This reiterates the importance of collecting complete patient information to close the gap on TB notification rates. The pilot site of Miara Bhaynder MC was able to validate the highest percentage of patient information (52%), which contributed to the notification of 561 TB cases. Furthermore, based on the information provided by the pharmacists, CHRI was able to identify 222 new private providers who were not previously engaged in the programme.",

            "text": "Incomplete and incorrect information was a key challenge during the implementation. Such informa- tion made it difficult to contact patients to ascertain their notification status and to determine whether drugs were for TB or other ailments. Other challenges included limited staff to conduct regular, needs-based in-person visits, difficulty in identifying pharmacies that stock and dispense anti-TB drugs in the dynamic market scenario, and training of pharmacies on how to use the Nikshay portal for case notification. Additionally, pharmacies were unable to collect all the necessary information during busy, peak hours. Between April-September 2020, the control measures introduced in India for COVID-19, drastically affected the TB programme. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] For our pilot, this led to restricted movement of the field team, staff and patients, and they faced resistance from the pharmacies to share information. However, once services resumed, notifications history and past intelligence was used to categorise and prioritise pharmacy visits to collect data for the lockdown period. This patient information was collated daily to check its completeness and validated by the partner NGO by phone. The TB notifications were then restored.",

By engaging with 5,477 pharmacies out of more than 80,000 registered across the 13 PPSA districts in the state of Maharashtra, JEET was able to notify 4,505 missing cases. Further evaluation on yield and cost-effectiveness of the strategies will help demonstrate that pharmacy engagement initiatives can be a game-changer in identifying the missing millions. CHRI and PATH are exploring various strategies to further engage pharmacies. A pilot intervention for an innovative software solution to capture all relevant patient and provider information and the anti-TB drugs being dispensed at pharmacies is currently being designed. This uses an API (application programming interphase), which integrates billing software into Nikshay to generate real-time information.",
