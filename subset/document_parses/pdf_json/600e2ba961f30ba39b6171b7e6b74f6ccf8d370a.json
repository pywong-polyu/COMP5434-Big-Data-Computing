            "text": "To ensure the faithful inheritance of DNA, a macromolecular protein complex called the kinetochore sustains the connection between chromosomes and force-generating dynamic microtubules during cell division. Defects in this process lead to aneuploidy, a common feature of cancer cells and the cause of many developmental diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] . One of the major microtubule-binding activities in the kinetochore is mediated by the conserved Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c) [5] [6] [7] . In budding yeast, the retention of kinetochores on dynamic microtubule tips also depends on the essential heterodecameric Dam1 complex (Dam1c) [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , which binds to the Ndc80c and is proposed to be a functional ortholog of the metazoan Ska complex [16, 17] . The load-bearing activity of the Dam1c depends on its ability to oligomerize, and the purified complex spontaneously self-assembles into microtubule-encircling oligomeric rings, which are proposed to function as collars that allow kinetochores to processively track the plus-end tips of microtubules and harness the forces generated by disassembling microtubules [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, it is unknown whether there are specific regulatory events that promote Dam1c oligomerization to ensure accurate segregation. Here, we used a reconstitution system to discover that Cdk1, the major mitotic kinase that drives the cell cycle, phosphorylates the Ask1 component of the Dam1c to increase its residence time on microtubules and enhance kinetochore-microtubule attachment strength. We propose that Cdk1 activity promotes Dam1c oligomerization to ensure that kinetochore-microtubule attachments are stabilized as kinetochores come under tension in mitosis.",

            "text": "Phosphorylation of the Native Dam1c Strengthens Kinetochore-Microtubule Attachments To measure the contribution of the Dam1 complex (Dam1c) to the strength of tip-bound kinetochore-microtubule attachments, we used an in vitro reconstitution system. Wild-type kinetochore particles were purified from budding yeast cells by immunoprecipitating Dsn1, a conserved kinetochore protein ( Figure S1 ) [23] . To obtain kinetochore particles lacking the Dam1c, we used dad1-1 cells that contain a temperature-sensitive mutant in the Dam1c component Dad1 [24] . We confirmed that kinetochore particles purified from dad1-1 cells (referred to as Dad1-1 kinetochores) grown at the non-permissive temperature lack the Dam1c, but otherwise retain the major core kinetochore components ( Figure S1 ). To test the biophysical coupling strength of the Dad1-1 kinetochores to microtubule tips, we used an optical trap to exert tension on kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Kinetochore particles were linked to polystyrene microbeads that were captured in a laser trap and then placed at the plus ends of dynamic microtubules that were grown from microtubule seeds tethered to a slide ( Figure 1A ). Once a kinetochore-microtubule interaction was established, tensile force was applied and then gradually increased until the kinetochore ruptured from the microtubule tip [19, 23, 25] . To compare Dad1-1 versus wildtype kinetochores, we measured rupture forces for many individual kinetochore particles of each type ( Figure 1B ). For each population, the fraction of attachments that survived up to a given level of force was plotted and the mean rupture force was also calculated. Wild-type kinetochores ruptured over a range of forces, with a mean strength of 9.4 piconewtons (pN) ( Figures  1B and 1D ). Dad1-1 kinetochores were substantially weaker ( Figures 1B-1D ). Their rupture force distribution was shifted to lower values and their mean strength was only 3.4 pN, consistent with previous measurements [19, 23] . To determine whether the reduced strength of the Dad1-1 kinetochores was solely due to the lack of the Dam1c, we purified recombinant Dam1c (rDam1c) from bacteria and performed add-back experiments [19] . When we introduced soluble rDam1c into the optical trapping assay with the kinetochore-bound beads, it rescued the strength of Dad1-1 kinetochores partially, increasing the average rupture force from 3.4 to 5.6 pN ( Figures 1C and 1D ), as observed previously [19] . One possible reason for the lack of a full rescue was that the recombinant complex lacked key post-translational modifications. To test this, we purified native Dam1c (nDam1c) from yeast cells and performed the same experiment. In contrast to rDam1c, the addition of nDam1c to Dad1-1 kinetochores fully restored kinetochore-microtubule attachment strength, increasing the mean rupture force to 9.1 pN (Figures 1C and 1D) . This observation suggests that the native complex carries key modifications that contribute to its ability to hold microtubule tips under force and that are lacking on rDam1c.",

We treated purified nDam1c with phosphatase (l) to remove phosphorylation or with phosphatase plus inhibitors (l + inh) as a control. The migration of the Ask1 protein increased after phosphatase treatment ( Figure 1E , silver-stained SDS-PAGE), indicating successful dephosphorylation. We then tested the activity of the dephosphorylated nDam1c in add-back assays as described above. As expected, the control-treated nDam1c fully rescued the Dad1-1 kinetochore particles, bringing their rupture strength up to 8.8 pN on average (Figures 1E and 1F) . In contrast, the phosphatase-treated nDam1c only partially restored the mean rupture force to 5.7 pN, similar to rDam1c ( Figures 1E and 1F ). Taken together, these data indicate that Dam1c phosphorylation promotes stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments.

            "text": "To further assess the role of Dam1c phosphorylation, we sought to identify the specific phosphorylation sites on nDam1c that contribute to kinetochore-microtubule attachment strength. The predominant migration shift of the purified Dam1c by silver-stained SDS-PAGE occurs on the Ask1 protein ( Figure 1E , right). Ask1 phosphorylation increases as cells proceed into mitosis due to the major mitotic kinase Cdk1 (Cdc28 in S. cerevisiae), although the function of this phosphorylation is not known [34, 37, 38] . We therefore tested whether Cdk1 activity is required for nDam1c activity in the optical trap assay. To do this, we treated wild-type cells or those containing an analog-sensitive allele of Cdk1 (cdc28-as1) with the analog 1-NM-PP1 to specifically inhibit Cdk1 in the cdc28-as1 cells [38, 39] prior to purifying nDam1c. Visualization of Ask1 on silver-stained SDS-PAGE showed that it migrated farther when purified from the analog-sensitive strain compared to wild type, indicating that the inhibitor worked and was specific to cdc28-as1 cells (Figure 2A , right). We assayed the activity of the Dam1c purified from these two strains in add-back assays and found that the control nDam1c fully rescued Dad1-1 kinetochore particles, to an average rupture force of 9.2 pN, but nDam1c purified from cdc28-as1 cells only partially rescued the mean rupture force to 7.1 pN (Figures 2A and 2B ). We obtained similar results when nDam1c was purified from a temperature-sensitive mutant Cdk1 strain, cdc28-13 [40] (Figure S2) . Taken together, these data suggest that Cdk1 phosphorylation is required for the full contribution of the Dam1c to kinetochore-microtubule attachment strength. However, additional phosphorylation on the Dam1c may contribute to the interaction strength because the Dam1 complexes lacking Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation strengthened attachments more than rDam1c.

To test the importance of the Cdk1 sites in Ask1, we mutated both residues to alanine (Ask1-2A) to block Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation. We then purified nDam1c from yeast cells expressing ask1-2A as the sole copy of the gene and tested this mutant complex (nDam1c Ask1-2A ) in our add-back optical trap assay. nDam1c Ask1-2A partially rescued the rupture force of Dad1-1 kinetochores to 6.9 pN ( Figures 2C and 2D ), which is similar to the strength measured with nDam1c purified from cells lacking Cdk1 activity. These results indicate that Cdk1 phosphorylation of one or both Ask1 sites is required for full Dam1c-dependent strengthening, and that additional Cdk1-independent phosphorylation of the Dam1c partially contributes to its function. Consistent with this idea, Ask1 phospho-mutants retained some Ask1 phosphorylation because phosphatase treatment increased their mobility by SDS-PAGE ( Figure S3 ).",

The Dam1c was purified from ask1-2D cells and added back to the optical trap assay. nDam1c Ask1-2D fully rescued the rupture force to the wild-type level of 9.4 pN ( Figures 2C and 2D ). To test whether phosphorylation on the Cdk1 sites is sufficient for full Dam1c activity, we phosphatase treated nDam1c Ask1-2D prior to analysis in the optical trap assay. Remarkably, the phosphatase-treated nDam1c Ask1-2D was fully functional and rescued Dad1-1 kinetochores to 8.8 pN ( Figures 2C and 2D ).

This led to a shift in the migration of Ask1, indicating the kinase reaction worked ( Figure 2E , silverstained SDS-PAGE). We added phosphorylated rDam1c to Dad1-1 kinetochores and performed the optical trap assay. Phosphorylated rDam1c fully rescued the rupture force to 9.3 pN ( Figures 2E and 2F ), suggesting that Cdk1 phosphorylation is sufficient to fully restore rDam1c activity. To test whether Cdk1 phosphorylation of Ask1 was the only relevant substrate, we assayed phospho-mimetic rDam1c (rDam1c Ask1-2D ) and found that it fully rescued the rupture force to 8.6 pN ( Figures  2E and 2E ). To verify there are no additional contributing Cdk1 phosphorylation sites on the Dam1c, we phosphorylated rDam1c Ask1-2D with Cdk1. There were no further migration shifts on the Ask1 protein after the Cdk1 kinase reaction when compared to Ask1-2D ( Figure 2E , silver-stained SDS-PAGE). Consistent with this, the Cdk1-phosphorylated rDam1c Ask1-2D rupture force was 8.8 pN, which is similar to untreated rDam1c Ask1-2D ( Figures  2E and 2F ). Together, these data strongly suggest that even though other phosphorylation on the Dam1c might strengthen kinetochore-microtubule attachments, Cdk1 phosphorylation of the Ask1 protein is sufficient to fully restore the strength of kinetochore-microtubule attachments to Dad1-1 kinetochores.",

Although previous work found that the single-and double-phospho-mutants of Ask1 do not exhibit major growth defects, they were never analyzed for chromosome stability [34] . To assess chromosome segregation, we performed a quantitative chromosome transmission fidelity assay, or sectoring assay [41, 42] . This strategy utilizes a non-essential chromosome fragment III (CFIII) whose loss can be detected and quantified by a change in the color of the yeast cells. Both the ask1-2A and ask1-2D cells exhibited a significant increase in chromosome loss, with the ask1-2A cells exhibiting an eight-fold increase in chromosome missegregation compared to wild type ( Figure 3A ). Because both a lack of phosphorylation as well as a phospho-mimetic mutant of Ask1 lead to chromosome loss, it appears important that Dam1c phosphorylation is dynamically regulated in vivo. To further characterize the role of Ask1 phosphorylation, we asked whether defects in its regulation exhibit genetic interactions with mutations in other Dam1c components. We made double mutants containing the dam1-9 allele that is mildly temperature sensitive in our strain background and assayed serial dilutions for growth at a semipermissive temperature [43] . Whereas all of the single mutants were able to grow at 37 C, the dam1-9 ask1-2A cells were inviable ( Figure 3B ). To determine whether kinetochore function is affected in the double-mutant cells, we examined kinetochore biorientation in metaphase-arrested cells. The centromere of chromosome III was fluorescently marked by the binding of GFP-LacI to Lac operators [44] . When kinetochores biorient and come under tension, two centromere foci can be visualized. However, the practical resolution limit of the light microscope prevents us from visualizing separated foci unless they are at least 0.3 mm apart, so we were only able to resolve 28% of kinetochores as two bioriented foci in wild-type cells at 37 C. However, only 15% of dam1-9 cells had two foci and this further decreased to 2% of the dam1-9 ask1-2A mutants ( Figure 3C ), suggesting these cells have a kinetochore biorientation defect. These data are consistent with phosphorylation of the Dam1c promoting kinetochore function in vivo.",

In addition, Cdk1 phosphorylation of the vertebrate Ska complex directly promotes its interaction with Ndc80c [45, 46] .

To do this, we monitored the binding of single monomers on individual, Taxol-stabilized microtubules using a concentration of purified rDam1c (50 pM) that was low enough to prevent its oligomerization [15] ( Figure 4A ). We measured the residence times of the fluorescently labeled wild-type rDam1c Ask1-GFP and phospho-mimetic rDam1c Ask1-2D-GFP monomers on the microtubules and found that they behaved identically (Figures 4B and 4C) , indicating that phosphorylation does not directly affect the interaction between microtubules and Dam1c monomers. Next, we tested whether Ask1 phosphorylation alters Dam1c oligomerization. To do this, we mixed a higher concentration of non-fluorescent ''dark'' rDam1c (1 nM), which promotes Dam1c oligomerization on the microtubules, together with a small amount of fluorescent ''tracer'' rDam1c (50 pM) , to enable observation of individual monomers under these conditions ( Figure 4D ). It has previously been demonstrated that the residence times for individual, fluorescence-tagged, microtubule-binding subcomplexes are increased when they hetero-oligomerize with other, non-fluorescent microtubule binders [19, 29, 51] . We therefore mixed wildtype dark rDam1c Ask1 with the wild-type tracer rDam1c Ask1-GFP and found that the mean residence time of rDam1c Ask1-GFP was 8 s ( Figures 4E and 4F ), which is an $2-fold increase over the residence time of rDam1c Ask1-GFP alone (Figures 4B and 4C) . This increase in residence time is due to the formation of oligomers that bind more stably to the microtubules than monomers [19] . Strikingly, the residence time was more substantially increased, by 3-fold, when phospho-mimetic rDam1c Ask1-2D was used instead of wild-type rDam1c Ask1 (Figures 4E and 4F ).",

Although it was previously known that Cdk1 phosphorylates the Ask1 component [34] , the underlying function of the modifications was not known. Using biophysical techniques, we found that Cdk1 phosphorylation appears to promote the oligomerization of the Dam1c and does not affect the ability of the Dam1c to bind to microtubules, to the Ndc80c, or to kinetochores. Cdk1 phosphorylation of the Ska complex [45, 46] is also known to promote kinetochore function, consistent with it having functions analogous to the Dam1c [17, 55] . However, the underlying mechanism is different because the Ska complex does not appear to oligomerize around microtubules and Cdk1 phosphorylation enhances its direct interaction with the Ndc80c [45, 46] . Although a high-resolution structure of the Dam1c was recently solved using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) [47], the C-terminal portion of Ask1 that contains the Cdk1 phosphorylation sites was not present in the structure. However, crosslinking data suggest that the C-terminal region of Ask1 that contains the Cdk1 phosphorylation sites can interact with a second Dam1c monomer through Spc34 [29] , bringing up the possibility that phosphorylation promotes this interaction. Future structural work will be required to elucidate the underlying contacts that are enhanced by phosphorylation to determine whether it alters intra-or intercomplex interactions.",

These incorrect kinetochoremicrotubule attachments must be destabilized, and previous work showed that phosphorylation of the Dam1c by the Aurora B protein kinase facilitates this process [10, 15, 25-30, 33, 56] .

            "text": "known that the kinetochore-bound Dam1c oligomerizes around microtubules to stabilize stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments, it has not been established whether Dam1c oligomerization is positively regulated. Our work suggests that Dam1 oligomerization is regulated through the cell cycle by Cdk1 phosphorylation, providing a mechanism to couple oligomerization to cell-cycle progression. We propose that Cdk1 phosphorylates the Dam1c later in mitosis, after Aurora B phosphorylation, to prevent premature stabilization of incorrect attachments. As mitosis proceeds, the global increase in Cdk1 activity will promote oligomerization as cells establish proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments and help maintain them as they come under tension. Oligomerization may also help kinetochores maintain processive attachments as cells subsequently undergo anaphase. However, there is less force on kinetochores during anaphase, so it is unclear whether phosphorylation on Ask1 is required for anaphase. Because Cdk1 phosphorylation is reversed by the Cdc14 phosphatase in budding yeast, it is likely that Cdc14 activity inhibits oligomerization. In this case, the phosphorylation sites may not be accessible to phosphatase activity until anaphase is complete. Because cells containing mutants that abolish Ask1 phosphorylation or mimic constitutive phosphorylation exhibit chromosome missegregation, the dynamics of oligomerization appear to be critical for accurate mitosis. In the future, it will be important to determine when Ask1 dephosphorylation occurs and what additional regulatory events control Dam1c oligomerization as well as what other vital kinetochore functions are mediated by Cdk1 kinase activity.",
