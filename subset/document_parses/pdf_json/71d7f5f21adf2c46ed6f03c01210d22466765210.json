            "text": "Coagulation activation has been reported in several cohorts of patients Coronavirus Disease 2019 . However, the true burden of systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 remains unknown. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database to identify studies that reported the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy using established criteria in patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome was the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC] and/or sepsis-induced coagulopathy [SIC]). Pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were calculated using random-effects model. A total of 5 studies including 1210 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. The pooled prevalence of systemic coagulopathy was 7.1% (95%CI: 3.2%,15.3%, I 2 \u00bc 93%). The pooled prevalence of DIC (N \u00bc 721) and SIC (N \u00bc 639) were 4.3% (95%CI 1.7%, 10.4%, I 2 \u00bc 84%) and 16.2% (95%CI: 9.3%, 26.8%, I 2 \u00bc 74%), respectively. Only 2 studies reported the prevalence of elevated D-dimer levels with the pooled prevalence of 84.6% (95%CI: 52.0%,96.5%, I 2 \u00bc 94%). Average D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were remarkably increased, while platelet counts, PT, and aPTT ratios were minimally affected in COVID-19. The estimated prevalence of systemic coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 was low despite D-dimer elevation in most patients. Relatively low systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 may contribute to the high incidence of thrombosis rather than bleeding in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Since the first cluster of pneumonia was identified in China in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 33 million individuals and caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide. 1 Although SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects the respiratory system, a significant proportion of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 are complicated by systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure mimicking severe bacterial sepsis. 2 In addition, increased coagulation activation has been reported in a majority of patients with COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality. 3, 4 Notably, anticoagulant therapy was shown in one study to be associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy. 5 However, an early report from the largest cohort in China documented very low prevalence (0.1%) of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. 6 Despite markedly elevated D-dimer levels, COVID-19 patients have relatively normal levels of platelets, prothrombin time (PT) and fibrinogen leading to insufficient criteria to support diagnosis of DIC as defined by the DIC score of the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH). [3] [4] [5] [6] Hypothetically, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy may mainly contribute to hemostatic alterations in patients with COVID-19 rather than DIC linked to systemic infections. 7, 8 Recently, the ISTH has proposed the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score to identify patients with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and coagulopathy. 9 A Chinese cohort using the SIC score identified one fifth patients with COVID-19 met the criteria for diagnosis of SIC. 5 Until now, the burden of SARS-CoV-2 induced systemic coagulopathy has yet determined. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the burden of systemic coagulation activation in patients with COVID-19.",

When analyzed separately, the pooled prevalence of DIC and SIC were 4.3% and 16.2%, respectively. D-dimer elevation occurred in the majority of patients (84.6%). The higher prevalence of SIC compared to DIC in COVID-19 may be mainly explained by the higher threshold for thrombocytopenia (<150 \u00c2 10 9 /L in SIC vs <100 \u00c2 10 9 /L in DIC) and the incorporation of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, especially the respiratory SOFA which is the main organ involvement in COVID-19. 5 Therefore, the SIC score may be more sensitive than the DIC score for detecting systemic coagulopathy in patients suffering from infection-associated organ dysfunctions such as acute lung injuries in COVID-19. Further studies for applying SIC score in detecting systemic coagulopathy in non-septic organ dysfunctions are warranted. Systemic coagulation activation leading to DIC or SIC is a disorder characterized by a widespread intravascular activation of coagulation due to the crosstalk between the immune and inflammatory response and the coagulation system. Various infectious agents and non-infectious insults lead to immune stimulation, especially the innate immune system, and release of inflammatory cytokines which subsequently trigger activation of coagulation and extensive microvascular thrombosis as well as multi-organ dysfunction. 18, 19 However, different organs showed variable procoagulant responses toward inflammatory cytokines and various degrees of microthrombus formation in their vasculature following DIC. Vascular bed-specific hemostasis and tissue microenvironment are postulated to explain the marked differences in localized thrombus formation among the involved organs, in which lung is among the organs most commonly affected by infection and sepsis. 20, 21 The first cohort of COVID-19 patients from China included 1099 patients and reported only 1 (0.1%) case diagnosed with DIC. 6 However, the criteria for DIC diagnosis was not specified in this cohort. Subsequent cohorts from China reported the prevalence of DIC and SIC using the ISTH criteria of 8.7% and 21.6%, respectively. 3,5 A recent meta-analysis, which included 22 studies from China with a total of 4889 COVID-19 patients, reported a pooled DIC prevalence of 6.2% (95%CI: 2.6%, 9.9%). 22 However, most studies included in this analysis did not specify the criteria for diagnosis of DIC.",

In addition, alveolar capillary microthrombi were nearly 10 times more prevalent in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with influenza with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 25 Notably, the pooled prevalence of DIC reported in our study (4.3%) is relatively lower than those previously reported in severe sepsis or non-COVID-19 severe pneumonia (30%). 26 These findings suggest localized coagulation dysregulation in pulmonary vasculature leading to pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy rather than systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19. The mechanisms underlying pulmonary vascular disease in COVID-19 were extensively reviewed in recent publications. 7, 8, 23, 27 However, the mechanistic studies investigating hemostatic alterations in COVID-19 are still lacking.",

This strategy strengthens the accuracy of the reported DIC or SIC events in the individual studies as well as the pooled estimate summarized by in our meta-analysis. However, several limitations should be considered in our study. First, all included studies were observational studies, with most being retrospective in design. Thus, there were high heterogeneity, both among and within studies, with respect to patient characteristics, timing and ascertainment of DIC/SIC, and the distribution of potentially relevant confounders such as the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. In addition, due to the lack of primary data and limited number of studies, we were not able to explore the outcomes in specific subgroups, the effects of anticoagulation, or the association of systemic coagulopathy and mortality in COVID-19. Currently, there are several prospective studies as well as clinical trials evaluating efficacies of anticoagulants and other novel agents in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, and their results will be available shortly. An updated meta-analysis may be required when relevant data from prospective cohorts and clinical trials are published.",

Although elevated D-dimer levels were systematically detected in most patients with COVID-19, the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy was much lower. Pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy may play an important role hemostatic alterations in SARS-CoV2 infected patients. Additionally, our data may explain the higher risk of thromboembolism rather than bleeding in COVID-19. Due to limited numbers of studies and heterogeneity of data, a future meta-analysis may be warrant when more relevant evidence becomes available.",
