The impact on transport systems across the world has been something which most countries were unprepared for and there is very little evidence from previous pandemics to guide transport operators and policy makers, certainly in most developed countries. The 2003 SARS epidemic largely affected East Asia. It had a major impact on air travel and on public transport usage in major cities. However, the impact was relatively short lived and transport usage returned to pre-pandemic levels relatively quickly. The International Energy Agency (IEA, 2020) reports that airline traffic stabilised within around six months and although metro usage in Taipei (for example) fell to around 50 per cent at the height of the crisis it returned to normal levels within four months. The 2008 swine flu outbreak also had some impact on international airline traffic and led to an increased use of temperature screening, but had relatively minor and short-term impact on transport use in major cities. Other relevant evidence comes from terrorist attacks on transport in cities such as Tokyo, London and Brussels. Again, an increase in security meant that after a few weeks of initial disruption there was relatively little long-term impact on transport usage. The IEA, however, suggests that domestic air travel in the United States was more than 7% below expected levels in the five years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.",

            "text": "In contrast there has been a virtual collapse of public transport in cities due to lockdowns and social distancing in response to Covid-19 (Zhang and Hayashi. 2020) . Across the world passenger demand typically decreased by between 80% and 95% in the earlier stages of lockdowns, although there is evidence that ridership is creeping up again as restrictions are eased, but typically only to about half of pre-pandemic levels. Evidence gathered by the Transport Strategy Centre at Imperial College, London (TSC, 2020) after the first wave of the pandemic in July 2020 shows that Asian metros, which fell by less, had returned to about 70 percent of normal levels by July, whilst those in Europe were at 50 percent and in the Americas at between 20 and 30 per cent. It is clear that the fall in traffic has created financial problems for operators from lost revenue. Regardless of whether these operators are fully in the public sector, or franchised operators or fully private they have needed financial support to maintain at least a basic level of services to keep urban economies running and particularly for key workers. It has become increasingly clear that in many cases this is not a question of short-term support to tide operators over through a difficult year, but that there will be likely to be long-term changes to commuting patterns and the desire to travel in cities. This need to provide public funds to keep operators afloat raises further questions about the long-term viability of such operators, especially those in the private sector.",

There are some differences between the four countries that make up the United Kingdom with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland able to impose their own restrictions, but in England there have been two period of national lockdown from 23 March with a gradual lifting during June, and again from 3 November to 1 December. During these periods all but essential shops had to close along with bars and restaurants and all leisure facilities and restrictions were imposed on households mixing. Educational establishments were closed during the first period but remained open during the November period. People were encouraged to work from home whenever possible and to avoid public transport unless essential to access workplaces.",

The move to deregulation that started with US airlines led to privatisation that became the preferred policy towards railways and urban public transport in many countries. Whether through total sale of operations to private sector operators or various forms of franchising or public-private partnerships the traditional view of transport as a public service provided directly by a public sector agency changed fundamentally. The need to reduce subsidy levels and a belief that the private sector could operate services more efficiently than the public sector and be more innovative and so reduce costs often lay behind these changes. Whether such moves actually reduced the overall cost to the public sector is not clear (Preston and Robins, 2013) . The increase in competition may have been beneficial where demand is buoyant, but has had negative impacts on more marginal services such as branch railway lines, rural bus services or air links to remote regions where public subsidy to maintain the public service obligations of transport has been stretched to the limit.",

Changing working practices with more home working has reduced the demand for commuter services. The need to maintain social distancing has made traditional commuter trains and buses impractical and this view may last for some time.

One is the increasing inequality in accessibility to transport occasioned by income, age, disability and other individual and social characteristics. The other is the pressing climate and environmental crisis where transport accounts for a significant share of global emissions. Encouraging the use of public transport, but also investing in more environmentally efficient technologies for that public transport, is vital here. But these more efficient technologies are much more expensive at a time when investment funds will be at a premium. Governments may be able to incentivise public transport operators to invest in new technologies but will face the difficulty that lower costs may be seen as feeding through into private operators' profits rather than improved service.",

As we have seen, the UK has suffered one of the highest rates of infection and death from Covid-19. The UK has also experienced some of the most widespread moves to deregulation and privatisation and thus faces a serious problem in restoring a functioning transport system post pandemic. Fig. 1 shows data on transport usage by mode from March 1, 2020 until the end of November 2020 based on comparisons with a typical equivalent day. The data is based on the whole of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), but the detail of policy measures is focussed on England. The devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales have competence for both transport policy and Covid-19 policy. The initial lockdown in England began on 23 March and was lifted in stages from mid-June. As infection rates rose again from August there was a gradual increase in restrictions in the worst affected areas. These were initially mainly large urban areas in the north of England. As the situation continued to worsen, following similar rises in infection rates across Europe, a second total lockdown was initiated for four weeks for the period from 3 November to 1 December. Following this a revised system of tiered restrictions became effective with most of England placed in the highest two tiers. Fig. 1 shows clearly how traffic by all modes fell dramatically at the start of the initial lockdown. Its then recovered at different rates by mode, especially after the easing of restrictions in June, but then fell again, albeit less dramatically, with the second lockdown in November.",

They continued to rise to around 40% by the end of August but then began to fall again with a further sharp fall in November to below 25%.

Bus services outside London fell to about 11-12% and recovered to around 25% in June and almost 60% by September but then again began to fall back to less than 5 0% in November.

The franchise system has changed several times and even before the pandemic was under a review that was likely to make fundamental changes (Department for Transport, 2020a). Two franchises had already collapsed and been brought back into public ownership. At the start of the pandemic the Government changed the nature of all the franchises into management contracts under an Emergency Measures Agreement where the existing operators continued to run the (reduced) services at an agreed cost whilst the Government took the revenue (Department for Transport, 2020b). This was intended for an initial period of six months to September 2020 at an estimated cost of \u00a34.3 billion (UK Parliament Public Accounts Committee, 2020). In the event the Emergency Recovery Measures Agreements were extended for further periods of six months to one year with the Government then proposing to replace existing franchises with new National Rail Contracts (Department for Transport, 2020g) at a further cost estimated to be between \u00a33 billion and \u00a35 billion (UK Parliament Public Accounts Committee, 2020). This effectively implements changes expected following the on-going Williams Review and provides for terms of direct award of up to six years to take operations to a point where normal service levels are expected to be reached post Covid-19.",

Who pays for this will then again become a key question. In the UK the prevailing view has been that the largest burden should fall on the user of a service so rail fares remain high and peak-load pricing (or more usually off-peak discounting) the norm. With fewer passengers but similar levels of capacity then under this system fares would have to rise and the question arises as to who should bear this burden? The current logic is that the major share would fall on the user but there are also arguments that some of this might fall on employers, either through taxation (as is already the case in some countries such as France where there is a levy on employers to support the cost of public transport), or through paying increased wages or direct payments to workers for commuting costs (which has implications for how the tax system treats such payments). There is an argument that this should in fact be a public sector responsibility. The agglomeration factors that make large cities more productive generate tax receipts for the public sector and good public transport is part of the urban public good that attracts investment and workers to the city (Graham et al., 2021) . This has been compounded during the crisis in that public transport has had to be kept running to enable key workers to get to work, especially those in the health care system. These are often amongst the lowest paid workers for whom any rise in fares would be a serious burden.",

This led to a rapid deterioration in Transport for London's financial position and it required financial help from national government to maintain services (Department for Transport, 2020e, f).",

The situation continued to deteriorate and following further investigations into TfL's finances agreement was finally reached on a \u00a31 billion package to maintain services through to March 2021 (Department for Transport, 2020h). This sum is based on the assumption that passenger demand is at 65% of pre-Covoid-19 levels, a figure which is above that reached so far and considerably above demand levels on London Underground.",

Outside London and some other large cities, the use of multi-door buses is much less common, but operators have tried to reduce the use of cash in payment where fare collection machines allow for smartcards or other forms of cashless payment. The debate over free public transport, as has been implemented in some countries, such as Estonia and Luxembourg, will continue. To the extent that a high proportion of offpeak riders on buses already benefit from various forms of social provision that makes use free at the point of use, this may not be a major change.

Public authorities already receive significant income from the operation of congestion and emission charging schemes and parking charges. In many cases these are justified on the basis of controlling congestion and pollution and using the proceeds to promote alternative public transport choices. Although road usage did not fall by as much as public transport usage during the initial lockdown in the pandemic (typically to around 30% of normal traffic), the reduction in pollution in cities during this period was significant. For example, the Centre for Cities (2020) reported a 38% reduction in NO 2 in major cities between March and May 2020 with some having reductions of more than 50%. Carbon dioxide emissions fell dramatically by up to 40% across Europe in the early stages of the pandemic but then rose again and by July were down about 10-15% (Friedlingstein et al., 2020) . The UK was towards the middle of this range at around 13% (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2020) . Fig. 1 shows how public holiday weekends affected road transport much more markedly than public transport. It also shows that the second lockdown in November did have an impact on private car and light goods vehicle traffic but not on heavy goods traffic. As road traffic has grown back faster than public transport usage, pollution levels (and the health hazards that creates) have risen, with NO 2 levels back to prelockdown levels in most cities by July. The UK Government has actively encouraged essential worker commuters to use private transport rather than public transport in the interest of controlling infection rates. Strong emphasis has been placed on the health benefits of cycling and walking and provision has been made to impose restrictions on the use of some roads by motorised vehicles or increased capacity of cycle lanes to assist this. However, in larger cities where commuting distances are often longer there is a limit to how far this can occur.",

The debate continues on the efficacy of international travel restrictions as a means of controlling the pandemic given an announcement in December 2020 that high value business travellers could face fewer restrictions. 2 This places airlines, airports, in the position that they are being subject to government-imposed restrictions on their ability to operate commercially, but are being denied compensation whilst their competitors are often being assisted. A group of airlines led by British Airways started legal action against the UK Government on the grounds that the blanket quarantine restriction is disproportional. The situation is complicated by the use by UK airlines of the UK Government's furlough scheme for workers that guarantees jobs by paying 80% of wages up to a monthly maximum. This scheme was designed to prevent short-term redundancy but airlines such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have used the opportunity to plan revisions to their future networks by, for example, proposing to move flights from London Gatwick to London Heathrow.

Increasing demand, as long as some form of social distancing remains in force, will also present problems for operators. If useable capacity is somewhere between 10% and 20%, frequencies may have to increase to provide sufficient useable capacity and this will lead to increased costs.

If this was combined with a possible extension of the London Congestion charge into a \"boundary charge\" (The Times (2020b) and similar schemes were introduced across other major cities it could lead to a comprehensive coverage of all modes into a national transport plan. Only if all these schemes were rolled into a single comprehensive means of charging for private vehicle use according to distance driven, emissions and congestion would it stand any chance of acceptance. This revenue should then be used to support all forms of transport according to need. It is important not to see this as a tax on road users but an environmentally efficient charge for the use of road space so that users can see the real costs of using each mode of transport and make their decisions accordingly.",

Those choosing not to cycle or walk are more likely to revert to the private car if public transport cannot deliver an acceptable option; that has implications both for the conflicts between different users and for a rise in congestion and pollution. Sustainable mobility will in the future have to pay more attention to sustainability in the widest sense of personal safety as well as community impact than just to facilitating mobility.",

The mobility as a service (MaaS) approach goes some way towards this goal (see Lajas and Macario, 2020 for a recent review and application), but car has to be taken in the way it is implemented to avoid introducing inefficiencies (see H\u00f6rcher and Graham, 2020) . Nevertheless, such an approach could provide a more holistic approach that could start to identify the distinction between the private and social benefits of journeys and achieve a better balance of trip making by journey purpose, time of day and mode.",

Responses to Covid-19 have highlighted the importance of social norms as influences on private behaviour and thus building a sense of ownership of public transport is an essential part of the future organisation (see, for example, Budd and Ison, 2020) . Publicly owned operators are too frequently regarded simply as agencies of government and private operators as profit-rather than service-focussed. Understanding such norms and building trust and a sense of ownership will be a vital aspect of any revised approach to the provision of public transport. This will involve a serious discussion on the appropriate balance between financing through the farebox by users and social funding that reflects both societal need and the economic well-being of a city or region rather than just funding to cover deficits that usually leads to cost cutting and service reduction. This would allow for a better planning of both overall capacity of a transport system to serve the needs of the city or region and its appropriate modal shares.",
