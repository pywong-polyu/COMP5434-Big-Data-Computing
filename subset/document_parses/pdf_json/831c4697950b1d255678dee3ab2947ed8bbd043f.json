[1] [2] [3] [4] Specifically, this population experiences high COVID-19-related mortality rates with older age, frailty, dementia, and multimorbidity being additional risk factors. [5] [6] [7] For these reasons, older adults in LTCFs have been the first group to receive COVID-19 vaccines in many locations. 8 Vaccines against influenza, pneumococcal infection, and herpes zoster have demonstrated persistence of immunity and efficacy for preventing morbidity and mortality among older adults. However, immunogenicity of traditional vaccines is suboptimal in populations aged 70 and older, likely due to a combination of factors most notably immunosenescence. 9 Although functional status and frailty may predispose to both infection risk and vaccine responsiveness and may be more important than resident age, 10 it has been described that older adults seroconvert after influenza vaccination across frailty strata, indicating that frail individuals may also benefit from this vaccine. 11 Currently four SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are available, two nucleic acid-based vaccines-BNT162b2 by Pfizer-BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna-and two adenovirus vector-based vaccines-Ad26.COV2.S from Janssen/Johnson & Johnson and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 from Oxford-AstraZeneca. There have, however, been a lack of individuals with frailty or disability in these and other randomized clinical trials. 12, 13 Recent data from Israel suggest that immunogenicity of BNT162b2 decreases with age, highlighting the importance of monitoring populations not included in clinical trials like very old adults, those in care facilities, with frailty or disability, the most vulnerable to COVID-19. 14 Here, we report immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in older adults in LTCFs with different frailty and disability profiles, thereby providing real-world observational data in this particularly vulnerable and understudied population.",

In acute severe COVID-19 infections, there is impaired cellular immunity, although residents develop positive SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. 23 These findings support the idea that cellular immunity may be more important than humoral immunity in the frailty-associated immunosenescence process, data that require validation in larger studies. 22 ",
