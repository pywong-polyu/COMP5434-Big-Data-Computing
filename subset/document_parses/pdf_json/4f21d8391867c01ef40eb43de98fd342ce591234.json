In its simplest form, the creation of legislation and its passage into law follows a standardized script. As different national priorities arise, an idea for a new law is generated, and pending initial endorsement, a congressperson from either the House of Representatives or Senate may introduce a bill. Once a bill is introduced, the document moves to a specific committee within the originating congressional house where it is debated and revised. If a consensus can be reached, the document is passed and moves to the opposing congressional house where it follows a similar process of committee review, revisions, and approval. If both the House of Representatives and Senate can pass the same version of a bill, the document then transfers to the President of the United States, whom has the authority to veto a bill or pass it into law. A congressional appeal can override the President's decision, pending a two-thirds endorsement from both congressional houses. Typically, 5% (2-7%) of bills written and introduced to a committee will make their way successfully through the legislative process and become enacted into law by Congress and the executive branch (GovTrack 2021). Interestingly, congressional productivity is time dependent, with the majority of bills introduced within the first six months of a new, biennially-elected congressional house (GovTrack 2017).",

One major opportunity to influence policy authorized to protect against VBD threats is balancing short term versus long term goals (i.e.: fixing versus preventing a problem), and this balancing act can be seen by the trend of federal funding ebbing and flowing with emerging VBDs (Fig. 1) . For example, before the emergence of West Nile virus (WNV), no federal funding existed for arbovirus surveillance in the U.S. (Hadler et al. 2015) ; however, in 1999 after the arbovirus was first detected in New York, congress appropriated annual funding through CDC Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) grants for public health departments to perform surveillance (CDC 2006 , Hadler et al. 2015 . Additionally, in 2003, the Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health (MASH) Act was passed into law that authorized 'grants through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for mosquito control programs to prevent mosquito-borne diseases\u2026' (2003) . However, once WNV became endemic, funding for surveillance and control began to wane, and from 2004 to 2012, ELC supported WNV surveillance decreased 61% (Hadler et al. 2014) . Additionally, support for the MASH Act subsided, and the legislation ultimately lapsed (Angus King 2019).

The website www.usaspending.gov houses a searchable database of federally funded grants issued from 2008 to the present. A search of the terms 'mosquito', 'tick', and 'vector-borne' occurred in February 2021 and resulted in 5,003 grants. The titles of the grants were then manually read, and any grants not related to mosquitoes, ticks, or vector-borne disease were deleted from the database. Results were then sorted by the state of primary activity, and any grants provided to international organizations or primarily funding international research were removed. The final results encompass 798 grants issued between 2008 through 2020 from 10 federal agencies. [WNV= West Nile virus; LYME = Lyme disease; ZIKA = Zika virus; POW = Powassan virus].",

The emergency funds acquired during the Zika virus outbreak were used to establish five Regional Centers of Excellence (COEs) in Vector-Borne Diseases with the goal of preventing and responding 'to emerging vector-borne disease across the United States' (CDC 2019). Additionally, the Kay Hagan TICK Act was a step in the right direction because of the legislation's mandate to create a national strategy to combat vector-borne disease, provide continued support to the COEs, and authorize US$20 million in grants to be awarded to health departments, political subdivisions, and Tribes in underserved areas to address vector-borne diseases. This mandate and these centers are critical to preventing future VBD epidemics and responding to endemic VBD threats. However, whereas authorization of these legislations is the first step, sufficient funding must be appropriated to ensure programs and centers can function and be productive. Additionally, funds need to be established to address endemic VBDs impacting hundreds of thousands of Americans right now, not just address future emerging disease threats.",

            "text": "With designated funding, programs can significantly improve efforts to protect the U.S. from VBD threats. In response to the 2016 Zika outbreak and in an effort to strengthen the nation's capacity to prevent and rapidly respond to such VBD threats, some of the emergency funding obtained by the Obama administration went to support the five Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vector-Borne Disease Regional Centers of Excellence (COEs) in 2017 through 2021 (CDC 2019). The COEs represent close collaborations between mosquito and vector control agencies, academic partners, and public health practitioners at state and local levels, and also provide a funding mechanism for research that is disallowed through the ELC grants. These COEs work to train public health entomologists, vector biologists, and medical providers in VBD-related skills and knowledge; develop and validate effective prediction, prevention, and control methods and tools; and strengthen and expand our communities of practice in VDBs (CDC 2019) Success from the COEs stems from their ability to cross-support stakeholders and pool resources, allowing for effective surveillance and response in areas that otherwise may not have the capacity to act alone or within a timely manner. Regarding training public health entomologists and young professionals in VBDs, each COE has multiple training programs, fellowships, workshops, webinars, boot camps, and even advanced degree options specifically created for this goal. Many of these training opportunities are in-person, but plenty are available online to meet the needs of the new normal during a pandemic. All of the COEs stress that these training opportunities are intended to prepare the next generation of public health entomologists, practitioners, or biologists in the field in detecting and responding to the next VBD threats. Specifically, the internship programs offered through collaborations at the COEs train a new generation of public health entomologists while simultaneously supporting goals of host sites (departments of health, universities, or mosquito and vector control agencies) by increasing their seasonal workforce (MCEVBD 2021 , UTMB 2021 . Dedicated funding and training grants for students similarly work to ensure the public health entomology workforce remains strong. Fellowships, scholarships, and free trainings seek to lower the barriers of access to technical training, encourage underfunded programs to build capacity and stay up-to-date on nationally guided best practices. Recent examples of these include hands-on trainings to teach tick surveillance and control techniques, insecticide resistance monitoring, and best practices in communication; all tailored to fill the training gaps of the regions served and often provide continuing education units (CEUs) for attendees to further refresh the available workforce (SECVBD 2020, NEVBD 2021a, UTMB 2021). Further, online materials have allowed participants throughout the U.S. and beyond to access highquality trainings for free or at low cost, while also minimizing time or cost burdens related to travel (PACVEC 2020 , MCEVBD 2021 , NEVBD 2021a , SECVBD 2021 . These resources serve to support local capacity, with a particular effect in supporting partners who may otherwise not receive funding, technical support, or quality training. These opportunities minimize the local effects of otherwise fluctuating or cyclical funding. Additionally, each initially established COE was charged with a goal to expand, improve, and validate VBD prediction, prevention, and control measures. This goal works hand-in-hand with the third of strengthening communities of practice in VBDs: as methods for prediction and control are improved on, partners will be able to execute effective measures in a timely manner (reducing risk of VBD transmission in residents and constituents) while also increasing communication across academic, governmental, and public health professional institutions. Examples and highlights of these efforts include: (1) the Southeastern Center of Excellence in Vector-Borne Disease's (SECVBD) mosquito pool testing during the 2020 West Nile and dengue virus outbreaks in southern Florida, ensuring timely turnaround to enable local mosquito and vector control teams to better tailor their efforts (J.C. Beier et al. 2020, unpublished data).",

Visits such as these have raised awareness for various policies, including the SMASH and Kay Hagan TICK Acts, contributing to the successful passing of these bills. Further, the COEs are dedicated to educating the general public about VBD-related issues, ensuring the dissemination of knowledge from academia to communities served by the COEs. Beyond locally-based outreach, the COEs also worked together with CDC to host webinar series in the spring of 2020 and 2021, which have reached over 2,000 participants, including those at state public health departments, universities, federal agencies, congressional offices, and general citizens (K.

Securing successful community engagement and support for mosquito and vector control programs not only establishes trust but also can help to provide political support (leading to financial resources), citizen scientists for interventions or vector collections, and further dissemination of information regarding the program (Healy et al. 2014 , Bartumeus et al. 2019 . Social media engagement and local media presence are two types of one-way communication processes that can help establish this positive relationship with the community. Examples include local news stories and features, open houses, presence at health fairs, and various social media accounts such as Twitter and Facebook. Although there is little published research on these types of communication, these are recommended initial steps to engage the community. Social media posts have been seen to instill personal responsibility to viewers, which can help in the dissemination of educational information (McLeod-Morin et al. 2020) . Further, communication to the public has been deemed successful when messaging is made personal and provides a level of accountability to the general public . A successful example of this type of engagement are toolkits and educational curricula developed for elementary, middle, and high school aged children and adolescents. Multiple mosquito and vector control organizations and public health departments have developed these types of programs, successfully integrating applied science and community development. This also leads to an opportunity for increased STEM participation in these younger students. Districts or programs that do not have the resources to hire staff strictly for education can also take advantage of free lesson plans and curriculums available online. These lesson plans were developed to meet curriculum needs regarding science education and were approved by teachers and local schools (Parker et al. 2020a) .",

The Zika virus disease outbreak revealed the limited number of medical entomologists and trained individuals in mosquito control available to respond to a large-scale mosquito-borne disease outbreak. The goal of this large AMCA training and certification program was aimed to meet this need for future VBD threats. The program developed includes topics such as insecticide resistance, basic mosquito ecology and behavior, mosquito surveillance, and species specific control following guidelines outlined by AMCA's Integrated Mosquito Management Curriculum and AMCA's Best Practices for Integrated Mosquito Management manual (AMCA 2021b). Additionally, AMCA launched a virtual E-module training program and train-thetrainer program to increase workforce capacity. The E-Modules emphasize Aedes species surveillance and control to help build vector control work force capacity by educating more individuals on managing these vectors, and the train-the-trainer series creates further local capacity by empowering individuals to continue the training within their own organizations. By 2019, these E-Modules had over 1,000 engagements in 43 states and U.S. territories (Walton 2019) . The 'Train the Trainer' Certification workshops were live events offered at various regional training hubs; attendees were required to complete E-Module 1 before participating. Fourteen 'Train the Trainer' workshops were conducted in 10 states from 2017-2018. Proctors of the workshops received Master Training Certifications from the AMCA and CDC. These workshops used the AMCA Best Practices for Integrated Mosquito Management Manual and included a curriculum on surveillance, action thresholds, control, and mapping along with real data and action plans. These workshops resulted in over 400 certifications in 31 states (Walton 2019) . The third track has not been formally announced, however, AMCA's website states that this portion of the program will aid stakeholders with strategic planning and organizational development to help organizations meet long-term goals and needs (AMCA 2021b). This large national-scale training and certification program backed by the CDC most certainly has increased vector control capacity and preparedness in local control programs; this can be investigated in future surveys.",

Organizations within the continental U.S. and its territories are able to request CDC bottle bioassay kits for free which include bottles, insecticides, and a manual for use and safety from CDC's bottle bioassay webpage (https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/mosquito-control/ professionals/cdc-bottle-bioassay.html). Since their development in 1998, bottle bioassays have been refined and streamlined for efficiency (Brogdon and McAllister 1998) . Kits are flexible, as these can be applied to any species of mosquito in the continental U.S. reared from a laboratory colony or from the field (McAllister et al. 2020) . Organizations that request kits can thus test their local mosquito populations for resistance to gain an understanding of developing resistance patterns and potentially stop continued resistance development using a standardized method that is used widely throughout the U.S. Since the kit program's inception, 230 CDC bottle bioassays have been sent to different mosquito and vector control organizations or programs, and 192 of those programs (83.5%) are willing to share insecticide resistance results with CDC (J. McAllister 2021, personal communication). Widespread resistance monitoring is highly encouraged, especially for both Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes aegypti (Linneaus, 1762) (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes (CDC 2016) . With easy-to-use testing kits, mosquito and vector control agencies can relatively effortlessly begin aiding in this national endeavor.",

Advocating and making regulators aware about the issues most important to their voting constituency may help break the reactive cycle of VBD funding. The simplest way to advocate is by reaching out directly to a person's senate and representative staff and informing them about the issues most important to the advocate. However, programs and partnerships exist that provide advocacy training and support as well. Currently, ESA has a two-year science policy fellowship that recruits entomologists at different career stages, teaches them the tools for successful advocacy, and brings them to Capitol Hill to meet with congressional staffers (ESA 2021a). Additionally, partnering with associations provides further avenues to advocate. The AMCA holds an annual Washington Conference where they take vector control professionals to Washington D.C. and gives them the opportunity to inform staffers about the threat of VBD and how sustained, consistent funding would help protect Americans from the next outbreak (AMCA 2021a). Similarly, the National Pest Management Association holds their annual Legislative Day providing pest control professionals all over the country the opportunity to meet with Senate and Representative staff to discuss the issues most important to them (Harbison 2021) . Finally, many of these associations also offer free resources such as infographics, position statements, one-pagers, and more to help individuals advocate most effectively (AMCA 2021a, ESA 2021b).",

Thus, routine needs assessments can be useful tools for identifying contemporary vulnerabilities, areas for improvement, and prioritizing operational activities. To highlight the variance between multi-tiered infrastructure, we present a side-by-side comparison of three contemporary needs assessments ( Table 2 ). As noted in the table and related publications, one critical challenge is the mismatched framework of vector control organizations. Mosquito control organizations are funded through a variety of sources: health departments, city planning, police departments, public works departments, independent mosquito control districts, state funded abatement districts, and other avenues. This decentralization creates considerable challenges for disseminating emergency funding, continuing technical education, and community resource support. AMCA, along with regional and state mosquito control associations, attempts to provide a connecting backbone infrastructure; however, these non-profit organizations do not exist specifically for ticks or other important vectors.",

For example, one might interpret the finding that 'half of southeastern agencies perform insecticide resistance monitoring compared to 14% nationally' as the concern for insecticide resistance is greatest in the northern, central, or western regions, due to their lower insecticide resistance testing. Conversely, one might interpret the statement as the concern for insecticide resistance is greatest in the southeastern region and thus testing had been made a priority effort in that region. Creating state, regional, or even national interdisciplinary scientific advisory boards for the interpretation of routine needs assessments, and making routine needs assessments a priority activity, can begin to address and overcome these challenges and create opportunities for realistic solution implementation of timely needs.",

Tick surveillance was only included in the Johnson et al. (2020) needs assessment (Johnson et al. 2020) , and this surveillance activity was sparse compared to mosquito surveillance. The lack of tick surveillance is a critical issue, as tickborne diseases represent 93% of the 70,567 cases of nationally notifiable vector-borne diseases reported to CDC in 2019 (CDC 2021b). Additionally, the regional and state needs assessments revealed 30-49% of vector control agencies performed mosquito pathogen testing, whereas the national survey did not assess Table 2 .

When considering control of other important vectors, such as ticks, triatomines, fleas, etc., the U.S. performs even worse on these metrics (Petersen et al. 2019) . In fact, tick-borne human disease cases have steadily doubled in the past decade (Rosenberg et al. 2018) , and the recent introduction of the first documented invasive tick species in 80 yr (Beard et al. 2018) highlights the need to expand surveillance and abatement capacities beyond domestic mosquitoes. As only 1 of the 17 nationally reportable vector-borne diseases has a widely available vaccine and 7 of the 17 pathogens have available therapeutics (2021), the emphasis on vector control and prevention is critical. Even with the knowledge of needed structural improvements related to VBD preparedness and surveillance, the simple lack of communication and cooperation among U.S. federal agencies regarding VBD capacity and needs is staggering. Unfortunately, a lack of unified support within the federal government has led to confusing and difficult to manage regulatory processes and a heavily politicized litigation-driven pesticide registration process. But this lack of communication does not only exist on the federal level: even in the state and local government levels fragmentation and jurisdiction issues exist that can result in lack of communication or detract from the common goal of VBD prevention and control. The CDC published the first national guidelines for vectorborne disease prevention and control in 2020 to help initiate communication and collaboration throughout all levels of government (2020) . This framework lists five principal goals centered around increased epidemiologic and transmission knowledge, improved vector control and technical education, enhanced diagnostic tools, generation of novel therapeutics, and public education dissemination. Additionally, various challenges are discussed about the U.S.'s ability to detect and respond to vector-borne disease threats, which if addressed will significantly improve the ability to protect against the next VBD outbreak (CDC 2020c). Some of these challenges include the nation's stressed surveillance systems, limited capacity to respond to outbreaks, and the lack of interconnected, quality data. The aforementioned measures, like the COEs, are steps in the right direction to addressing these challenges.",

Some opportunities for overcoming this financial disparity include additional funding mechanisms such as the National Science Foundation's Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NSF EPSCoR), the National Institute of Health's R-15 Research Enhancement Award, or the 2019 Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act, all of which aim to strengthen research programs at smaller institutions or programs that do not typically receive large grants and expose students and young researchers to rigorous, applied scientific research.",

Insecticide resistance is the 'ability in a strain of insects to tolerate doses of toxicants which would prove lethal to the majority of individuals in a normal population of the same species' (WHO 1957) . In a na\u00efve population of insects-insects never exposed to the insecticidesusceptibility is normally distributed, with equal proportions of the population dying at very low and surviving at very high concentrations of insecticide. During control efforts, those few individuals in the population that survive go on to be the progenitors of the new population, passing on those heritable traits that allowed them to survive. With time, the new population can survive exposure to much higher concentrations of the insecticide than the previous generations and can result in control failures. The underlying mechanisms of insecticide resistance fall within four general categories: reduced target site sensitivity, decreased cuticular penetration, altered enzymatic activity, and/or altered behavior (Martinez-Torres et al. 1999 , Wood et al. 2010 , Gordon and Ottea 2012 , Gatton et al. 2013 . Additionally, resistant populations can exhibit two or more of these mechanisms simultaneously (Awolola et al. 2009) , and life history tradeoffs between fitness costs and mechanisms of resistance exist (Brito et al. 2013) .",

To develop successful IRM strategies, understanding the mode of action of the insecticide, mechanisms of resistance, and life history tradeoffs are important to create strategies that will prolong the usefulness of current control tactics and prevent control failures. Given the relative paucity of new active ingredients available (Bunge and McKay 2017) and the incredibly high price tag to bring a new product/active to market (Whitford et al. 2006) preserving the usefulness of our currently available actives must be a high priority for all mosquito abatement programs. Thus, sustained federal funding must be provided to equip mosquito and vector control programs with the capabilities necessary to quantify levels and characterize mechanisms of resistance to respond to insecticide resistance threats in real-time before an insecticide active ingredient can no longer control a population of mosquitoes. Without proactive, effective tools, mosquito abatement programs cannot protect the public's health from VBD. The free CDC bottle bioassay kits will be moot if federal funding is not appropriated and the insecticide industry is not supportive of mosquito and vector control agencies actually combating resistance development.",

A search of the terms 'mosquito', 'tick', and 'vector-borne' occurred in February 2021 and resulted in 5,003 grants. The titles of the grants were then manually read, and any grants not related to mosquitoes, ticks, or vector-borne disease were deleted from the database. Results were then sorted by the state of primary activity, and any grants provided to international organizations or primarily funding international research were removed. The final results encompass 798 grants issued between 2008 through 2020 from 10 federal agencies. [WNV= West Nile virus; LYME = Lyme disease; ZIKA = Zika virus; POW = Powassan virus].",
