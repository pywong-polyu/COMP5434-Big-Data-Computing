The spread of the pandemic led first to the activation of a conflict between a 'sovereigntist reflex' privileging the expression of national capacities and national selfreliance and a more 'perforated' understanding of sovereignty stressing the interdependence of peoples and states, both geographically and institutionally. As the response to COVID itself became more politicized we see the emergence of a second tension, between a libertarian 'reflex' supporting a residual state protecting liberties and facilitating individual choice and a sovereign-statist 'instinct', calling for an empowered guardian of the public good capable of ensuring collective security. A third tension relates to the seemingly growing opposition between a conception of sovereignty founded (and contingent) upon the will of the people and one in which the sovereign is, simultaneously, the discerner, defender and ultimate guarantor of the public good. After having mapped out these interwoven tensions and their main fault lines in general terms, the paper proceeds comparatively, tracking and tracing their (differential and specific) presence in governmental responses in two advanced capitalist democracies, France and Britain.",

We prepare you for the bad news with a list of some of the effects: the price of oil will turn negative; an almost unprecedented stock market crash will occur, and yet the value of Zoom shares will sky rocket; billions of people in the world will see their domestic parliaments shut; US unemployment will rise by 30 million in 2 months (and by closer to 40 million in 6 months); the free movement of goods and people within the European Union (EU) will be suspended; we will see the lowest per capita global carbon emissions in 20 years; yet the transport minister of a European democracy will declare that it is a 'civic duty' not to use public transport 1 ; at 8 pm on the dot, in the large cities of many western democracies for day after day, week after week, citizens will enthusiastically clap core public sector workers; the Olympics will be postponed; and the Dutch government will publish official advice to those of its citizens regarding themselves as 'single' to restrict themselves to just the one 'sex-buddy' until further notice.",

COVID-19, we will argue, exposed and exacerbated these tensions; though it is not responsible for having created any one of them. Each predates the crisis. Identifying and describing as clearly we can these tensions, exploring the politics that they have served to unleash and illustrating how and to what extent they are present in governmental responses to the spread of the pandemic are the main objectives of this paper. We suggest that the COVID-19 crisis, exceptional and unprecedented though it is, makes clear what we could have seen, but did not. In making this claim, we do not seek to dismiss nor to diminish the exceptional and highly contingent character of the COVID-19 crisis. Instead, we argue, we are better placed to make sense (retrospectively) of this episode, and to draw lessons from it, precisely because the responses it has generated help to reveal as they exacerbate a number of dynamic tensions and paradoxes that are motive forces in the politics of our age. Exceptional times allow us to see more clearly the normality they disrupt and disfigure-as they do the tensions inherent within its seeming stability.",

Each we suggest can usefully be seen as conflict in and around our conception of sovereignty-in the sense that they question the political sources of ultimate authority, challenge the institutional structures vested with the authority to govern, and touch upon the very borders of the political community (as elaborated further in the introduction to this special issue). In Western Europe, the first reactions to the spread of the pandemic led to the activation of an at times overt conflict between a 'sovereigntist reflex' privileging the expression of national capacities and national self-reliance and a more 'perforated' understanding of sovereignty stressing the interdependence of peoples and states (notably, EU member states), both geographically and institutionally-and, above all, the need for coordinated responses capable of averting a series of classic collective action problems (on 'perforated sovereignty' see, especially, Duchacek 1987) . That is well illustrated in both the typically mild (and sometimes rather lame) attempts at reconciling and steering national responses to COVID-19 through multilateral or supranational institutions, and, more significantly still, the fact that such attempts were rapidly undermined by national executives deciding, largely unilaterally, the policies to fight this invisible foe on the home front.",

Neither is the product of a simple ideological conflict generating a stark political cleavage. The trade-offs generated by these conflict-provoking dispositions were also present and (increasingly) prevalent in the more or less politicized reactions generated by, and to, these policies.

To be clear, this is not so much a tension between the state and the individual (as above), so much as between different conceptions of how the public good is to be determined. It is linked, if not ultimately reducible to, different conceptions of representative democracy itself (see Bickerton et al. in this issue)-the liberal and the republican democratic, as it were. As we shall argue in the following pages, a disproportionate reliance on public opinion (or to certain constructions and representations of it) has characterized the form and timing of policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis in Western Europe-and sometimes the very policy stance taken by political elites. Here too, a clear tension can be identified-between a conception of sovereignty founded (and contingent) upon the will of the people and one in which the sovereign is, simultaneously, the discerner, defender and ultimate guarantor of the public good. This is, in effect, the distinction between the 'good of the people' and the 'good for the people'.",

When the first cases started to be reported in the spring of 2020, the UK government was the populist-nationalist yet libertarian administration of Conservative Prime Minister and architect of Brexit, Boris Johnson. Emmanuel Macron, arguably at least as liberalizing and rather more multilateralist than his British counterpart, was the incumbent in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e. And Britain was then in the process of leaving the EU-thus making, as argued below, some of the tensions we identified even more salient in the political arena.

Whilst this perspective is, to our knowledge, quite new in the emerging literature on COVID-19, linking the analysis of crises to the reconfiguration of conflicts of sovereignty has become a more common focus of attention for political economists and political scientists (see Jabko and Luhman 2019 for a discussion).",

The day before, the European Council met (online) to prepare a joint European response to COVID-19.

With constrained budgetary and staffing resources, the main supranational entities in the areas of health security and disease prevention-namely the EU Health Security Committee and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDPC)-were largely unable to provide an effective response to the rapid spread of the virus. On the other side of the Atlantic, the then US President Donald Trump attacked the WHO for being too 'China-centric' and for getting the pandemic 'wrong'. 4 Soon after, he announced the US's withdrawal from the WHO.

In spite of their tentative efforts, neither the WHO nor the EU were able to seize the moment to establish an authoritatively transnational framing of the crisis, far less an enduring transnationally coordinated response. It is true that over the course of the crisis, the EU has gradually demonstrated a better adaptability and improved its management capacities, typically as compared to other recent multidimensional threats of a comparable magnitude (see Wolff and Ladi 2020 for a discussion). Yet the flaws reported by the literature in that respect (see Dinan et al. 2017 ) still largely prevail-as revealed by its overall inability during the more recent period to mitigate 'vaccine nationalism' beyond mere principled stands; and by the latter's difficulties in fashioning a coherent vaccination policy.

The more specific condition of the EU, however, suggests that even if some pre-existing institutional factors partly account for its limited coordinative role, these factors provide only a partial account of the strength of the sovereigntist reflex observed in almost all member states. Granted, there is a treaty article on public health 'that carefully limits EU competencies'; 'a legislation that avoids authorizing forceful EU action'; and 'a budget that puts little money into health and [which contains] no health emergencies line at all' (Greer and de Ruijter 2020: 623) . And it is also true that a national-centric recoil has been a common and widely identified feature of responses to pandemics (see Jones 2020) . But what is still striking is the degree to which most EU member states so quickly and completely came to privilege (their construal of) national self-interest in a context in which there existed clear possibilities and significant institutional resources for a more coordinated (and arguably more effective) response. The nationalization of expertise is a case in point. While often using the same data or evidence furnished by the ECDPC and the WHO, most EU governments seem to have based their policy choices on their own national experts (epidemiologists, virologists or public health scholars) often through hastily convened ad hoc or special committees (see Lavazza and Farina 2020) . Another striking illustration is 'vaccine nationalism'-the resoundingly national approach that was taken to the development and distribution of COVID-19-related health technologies. 5 There have been many examples of this-ranging from the USA, Russia and India's refusal to participate in a global initiative run by a number of European leaders, the Welcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; or European states (including both France and the UK) competing to be the first in the queue for vaccine doses-often with the support of large governmental grants and in collaboration with University-based teams. The situation of the EU is particularly striking in this regard. In spite of an agreement eventually reached by member states in June 2020 around a common EU vaccine strategy, the European Commission repeatedly failed to harmonize national approaches-be it in terms of supply, prioritization of target groups, or use of available doses.",

This attitude is well illustrated by the various governments that claimed sovereignty over the political and policy responses to COVID-19, sometimes embracing a clearly nationalist stance in the process. In Western Europe, this notably includes French President Emmanuel Macron declaring a 'war' against the virus and his insistence that the state would bear the economic costs of the measures taken irrespective of the extent of that commitment. In these and other discourses, leaders have typically invoked the rhetoric of war, conferring in so doing hero status on the medical teams 'on the front line' (Benziman 2020 ).",

In stark contrast with countries where a sovereigntist reflex dominated in the initial framing of COVID-19, here the image of a more residual state initially prevailed. This looks at a range of different forms, certainly the most spectacular of which were offered in countries which had recently witnessed the rise of populist leaders. US President Donald Trump, for instance, explicitly refused to wear a mask, while Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro fired his health minister for advocating social distancing measures (Gonsalves and Yami 2020) . Both tried to frame the public policies presented as necessary to limit the spread of the virus in other countries (and even by their own experts) as an infringement of individual liberties. Both, of course, were ultimately unable to protect themselves from the virus. In their initial rejection of major state intervention or additional regulation to fight the pandemic, Trump and Bolsonaro's stances were in fact clearly aligned to their broader rejection of the 'corrupt elite'-a familiar populist construct here stretched to include transnational elites and 'their' experts and academics and scientists in general (Woods et al. 2020). The position they adopted rejected the capacity of transnational institutions to know best the global interest and their right to substitute the global interest (however construed) for its national counterpart. It was, in short, populist, sovereigntist and profoundly anti-multilateralist. And it was deeply wrapped in the symbolic politics of posture and performance-as the refusal to take personal protective measures became a mark of identity for their 'macho political brands'. 6 Paradoxically, this sovereigntist yet populist libertarianism manifestly ignored a basic requirement of sovereignty, namely security-the capacity of the state to protect its own citizens.",

One should be careful, however, not to draw an overly sharp line between more 'sovereigntist' and more 'libertarian' stances in the context of the pandemic-as most Western countries actually alternated (or at least vacillated) between the two.

Interestingly, one can observe a fair degree of similarity from one country to another between these measures. They have tended to include travel bans or restrictions; quarantine; epidemiological tracking and testing; public guidelines and recommendations; temporary closures of 'non-essential' businesses; prohibition of mass gatherings; school and university closure; curfew; declaration of state of emergency and internal travel restriction (Capano et al. 2020) . Various policy instruments were also used to tackle the adverse economic consequences of the measures taken. These we described in more detail in the next section. Yet, and despite the apparent similarities between these various policies, there has seemingly been rather little lesson diffusion and policy transfer within the EU, and considerable variation both in terms of the mix of measures adopted by governments and, crucially, the timing of their responses (see Hale et al. 2021) . Indeed, when the first cases were reported during the first months of 2020, several European governments were seemingly reluctant to take action, even with their immediate neighbours reporting rising infection levels. This was notably the case, in March 2020, of France, the UK, Sweden and Germany. A few weeks later, Italy (first) and France (subsequently) took stringent measures, including the imposition of strict lockdowns and social distancing policies. These two respective governments then called for national unity and clearly endorsed a more republican and sovereigntist stance. At the same time, UK Prime minister Boris Johnson was adopting a more libertarian attitude, refusing to impose the same restrictions on British citizens-even if he eventually imposed more stringent restrictions as the pandemic spread dramatically throughout the UK.",

They did so, understandably perhaps, to avoid the perceived electoral costs, contributing in a manner largely anticipated in so doing to the existence and severity of a second (and subsequent) wave(s) (Middleton et al. 2020) . This is an additional paradox of our present political context which the COVID-19 crisis has starkly exposed: after decades of governance legitimized on the basis of nominally independent expertise in areas where scientific consensus was far from evident (think of economic governance), it seems that self-imposed ignorance prevailed precisely where international peer-reviewed consensus rapidly formed (see Ortega and Orsini 2020) .

A pandemic of this kind-indeed a pandemic of this specific kind-was quite widely anticipated. But public policymakers responded to it as if it were entirely unexpected. In France, seemingly little consideration was given to existing pandemic plans. Thought they had not been significantly updated since the period following the 2009 H1-N1 pandemic, they could have provided a valuable starting point. 7 In Britain, Chief Advisor to the Prime Minister, Dominic Cummings, even tried to pretend that he had something in the filing cabinet 8 -yet the filing cabinet was bare. The absence of a clear strategy and the reactive management of the pandemic was also prevalent in the rather inconsistent position of both governments towards a variety of public health measures, such as mask wearing and social distancing-with both executives agonizing about, whilst simultaneously trying to anticipate, public reactions to the policies they were still in the process of designing. The sovereignty of public opinion thus reflects broader anxieties in both countries-about lockdowns that could not be ended and would not be respected, or an anticipated crisis in governmental authority as opposed to a crisis of hospital capacity.",

In France, much of Emmanuel Macron's presidency had been dominated by valence politics, an appeal to the centre and a pro-EU agenda. During his first years in office, he tried to push for a more classical understanding of the neoliberal account-a posture he apparently turned to in his mid-March television address, during which he explicitly endorsed a more traditionally republican (and distinctively sovereigntist) posture. A legalistic and 'decree response strategy' followed, very much in line with France's highly centralized and republican tradition (Yan et al. 2020) . Consistent with that tradition, it included highly severe lockdown measures, the adoption of an emergency health law, extended powers for the executive and the closure of public spaces (see Desson et al. 2020) . The army was even mobilized to set up field hospitals. By contrast, Boris Johnson's term in office is well known for its anti-system populism. The Prime Minister sought to maintain this leadership style during the first few months of the pandemic, shaking hands with COVID-19 patients in hospitals and not wearing a mask-before succumbing to the virus himself.",

Here again, France and Britain played different roles but eventually took similar measures. From the beginning of the pandemic, the attitude of the French government was more explicitly multilateralist (in keeping with Macron's selfimage as an integrationist President for Europe as much as for France). In effect, it participated in, and sought consciously to draw attention to, various transnational initiatives under the umbrella of the EU or the WHO and signed the 'Covid-19 Joint declaration of the Alliance for Multilateralism' (April 16), an initiative reuniting United Nations countries committed to enhancing multilateralism, particularly in the management of the present crisis. 9 Such an emphasis on global cooperation was largely absent from British public discourse. But in substantive policy terms, the two administrations were far closer. Indeed, they were pursuing very similar domestic initiatives. Both administrations passed agreements with domestic pharmaceutical companies to ensure that they would be the first to access the vaccines these same companies were currently developing. This led in France to a widely publicized controversy with Sanofi, which ultimately resulted in a pledge by the company to invest more than \u20ac600 million in vaccine research and production in France in response to President's Macron demand. 10 France also took measures to restrict investments by foreign companies during the pandemic, as well as restricting exports of medicines (restrictions reciprocated by the British government). Whilst Britain's anti-multilateralism was at least consistent, France's public discourse was rather more rhetorical than it was substantive.",

In fact, Johnson's slow drift from a more populist and libertarian demeanour to a more sovereigntist posture illustrates well a more profound and long-standing tension clearly manifest in the Brexit vote itself (and arguably before that in Thatcherism's combination of neoliberal and neoconservative emblems). Such a tension comes from an interpretative ambiguity between two broad (and potentially contradictory) meanings of the motives behind the Leave vote (and, indeed, Thatcherism before). While some have seen in Brexit an explicitly sovereigntist and neoconservative objection to multilateralism and supranationalism ('taking back control'), others couch Brexit it more staunchly neoliberal terms, presenting it as a rejection of the EU as an illiberal 'social model' and as the triumph of a supranational 'super-state' (as an impediment to neoliberalization) (Hay 2020) . Crucially, these are the two stances that were, respectively, promoted by the unofficial and official Leave campaigns-with the later (of course) championed by Boris Johnson himself.

Though similar measures have been adopted, there is little sign of conscious policy transfer, and governments have not built on the experience of others to model-and/or modify-their responses. The second wave was still essentially managed through the lens of domestic politics. The libertarian reflex that was manifest during the first wave was clearly not observed during the second.

These two lines of conflict, just as earlier in the year, served to reinforce the tension between public good provision and public opinion-so much so, perhaps, that sovereignty (fundamentally a question of legal responsibility) tended to be prioritized over autonomy (fundamentally a question of options).
