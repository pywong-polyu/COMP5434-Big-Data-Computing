The incidence of unilateral Bell's palsy is not uncommon, but sequential or simultaneous bilateral Bell's palsy is exceedingly rare. While unilateral Bell's palsy is oftentimes idiopathic, bilateral Bell's palsy is almost exclusively explained by an identifiable trigger. In pre-clinical trials, Bell's palsy cases were recorded at higher rates in the vaccine cohort than the placebo cohort. Herein, we present a case of isolated sequential bilateral Bell's palsy that after an extensive workup, proved to be idiopathic. Notably, in the setting of a recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and absence of identifiable etiology, our case highlights a potential correlation of the COVID-19 vaccine and bilateral Bell's palsy.",

It is one of the most common acute mononeuropathies with an incidence of 11.5 to 53.3 per 100,000 persons with a strong predilection for females [1, 2] . It classically presents as unilateral paralysis with facial weakness, oral insufficiency, altered speech, and an inability to close the eyelids [3] . However, simultaneous or sequential bilateral Bell's palsy (BBP) is quite rare. Approximately 0.3%-2% of patients with BP will have bilateral disease [4, 5] . Thus, the incidence of bilateral disease in the general population is approximately 1 in 5,000,000 [5] . In a meta-analysis of patients with bilateral facial palsy, the age of onset was highly variable and ranged from 8-67 years with an average age of onset of 34 years [6] .",

She could not raise her eyebrows or close her eyes bilaterally, and she was unable to frown or smile. Nasolabial fold flattening was noted bilaterally. All other cranial nerve testing was normal.

Additionally, the Moderna pre-clinical trials reported three patients with BP compared with zero cases in the placebo cohort [15] . The link of vaccineinduced BP has been identified with the intranasal and parenteral influenza vaccine, influenza H1N1 vaccine, and meningococcal conjugate vaccine [15] . However, subsequent repeat trials of said associations had varying degrees of reproducibility [15] . Post-market surveillance for adverse events of Moderna and Pfizer vaccine-related facial paralysis events had an incidence of 0.6% with a median time to symptom onset of two days [11] . Therefore, given the significant delay between vaccination and onset of symptoms, we believe that our patient's history of COVID-19 vaccination is less likely to be contributory to the development of her BBP.
