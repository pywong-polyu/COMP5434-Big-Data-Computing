For young people, digital home-schooling and the closing of organized leisure activities were among the measures most immediately affecting their everyday life. In spring 2020, these national measures lasted for 3 months, with a reopening of schools in mid-June. During a brief period before and after summer vacation, schooldays returned to normal, only interrupted by local outbreaks requiring the single schools or classes to be quarantined. In November, however, schools were closed again in the municipality of Bergen after the second wave of outbreak. Overall, from March to December 2020, a repeated combination of national, municipal, and local measures caused interferences in everyday life of youth, with a decrease and unpredictability in social contact, physical school attendance, and access to leisure activities.",

Among these, results have been mixed. A US study showed increased parent-assessed youth mental health problems from before the outbreak, after controlling for changes associated with maturation [9] . This study leaves it unclear what type of symptoms were increasing. Prospective longitudinal studies have demonstrated deterioration in mental health among youths during the pandemic. Among young people in Australia, anxiety, and depression symptoms increased 2 months into the stay-at-home government directive, including online learning for students compared to before the outbreak [2] . In this study, female sex, COVID-19 related worries, online learning difficulties, and increased conflict with parents predicted increase in mental health problems, whereas adherence to stay-athome orders and feeling socially connected during the lockdown protected against poor mental health. In a prospective Norwegian study of [13] [14] [15] [16] year old's [10] , clinical levels of mental health problems increased from 5.3% in 2019 to 6.2% in June 2020. Female sex, pre-pandemic mental health problems, and a single-parent household predicted more mental health problems in June 2020. Somewhat surprisingly, youth from low-income families or a history of maltreatment showed significantly less increase in mental health problems compared with peers who did not report such difficulties. However, this study only measured the change in internalizing problems during the pandemic. The possible impact of the lockdown on externalizing problems and total symptom-load across symptom dimensions is still unknown in a Norwegian context and is scarce internationally.",

However, studies following young people's mental health over a longer period with more than two waves of data yield a somewhat different picture. A US study following youths between March and July 2020 found that symptoms of depression and anxiety peaked around late April/early May and then decreased through May-July [11] . This is in line with another US study of youth, reporting an increase in depression, anxiety, and oppositional/defiant symptoms from pre-COVID-19 to spring 2020; followed by a decrease during summer 2020 [12] . Here, lower family income was related to increases in inattention, whereas higher family income was related to increased oppositional/defiant symptoms.",

            "text": "Taken together, these results show that mental health problems among youths may change in different manners over the course of the pandemic depending on individual and contextual factors, like increasing age, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and social connectedness. Further, recent findings suggest increased mental health problems among adult immigrants compared to non-immigrants during the COVID-19 pandemic [13] . Surprisingly, few studies conducted during the pandemic have included these variables as possible contributors to stability and change in mental health among youth [2] . We argue that these potential risk factors might operate differently during the pandemic as restriction measures impact population groups differently. Also, studies report that youth experience isolation and loneliness because of the restriction measures [14] [15] [16] [17] . Youth' feelings of loneliness over the course of the pandemic, and associated characteristics, warrant more research attention given the implications of loneliness for mental health [1] . To date studies investigating the impact of loneliness on youth mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic seem sparse. Sleep problems are repeatedly shown to be strongly associated with internalizing problems among youth [18] . Furthermore, results from the first wave of data (T1) in the current study, showed that 19% of the participating youth reported increased sleep problems after schools closed in March 2020 [19] . Hence sleep problems is an important factor to control for when studying change in internalizing problems over time during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

Each subscale contains five items rated on a three-point-scale (0-1-2), yielding a subscale-score in the range of 0-10. The scores (excluding the scale for prosocial behaviors) can be combined into a total difficulties score, with scores ranging between 0 and 40. In addition, the emotional problems and peer problems subscales can be combined to comprise the intermediate subscale \"internalizing problems\", while conduct problems and hyperactivity subscales can be combined to comprise \"externalizing problems\". For the purposes of the present study, we present the total scale scores as well as the individual subscales scores and the intermediate subscale scores Internalizing and Externalizing, at the two time points.

The impact of the included covariates was investigated using the SDQ internalizing and the SDQ externalizing subscales only. Separate adjustment for each covariate is presented across the two subscales, as well as the fully adjusted models. Finally, we investigated the potential moderating role of the covariates in a series of interaction models, and statistically significant interactions were presented in stratified analyses. In order to make full use of the available data, pair-wise deletion was employed for handling of missing data. Valid responses on the variables included in the regression models ranged from N = 2678 (100%) in the crude model to 2530 (94.5%) in the fully adjusted model at baseline.

One may speculate that these studies demonstrating a decrease in mental health problems were influenced by summer leave and ease in national and local preventive measures during the summer-months. Our study, with 9 months between the two waves of data collection, demonstrate the need for longer-term follow up of the mental health among young people in the Covid-19 period. With only two observations we do not know when the internalizing symptoms increased among the youth, thus, interpretation should be made with caution.

The results from the interaction analysis, however, somewhat nuanced this overall finding. Both those reporting being lonely \"seldom or less\" and \"pretty often or more\" reported more internalizing problems across time points (Fig. 1) . The increase was, however, larger among those reporting being lonely seldom or less (coefficient 0.82, p < 0.001) compared to those who reported being lonely \"pretty often or more\" (coefficient 0.29, p = 0.038), even though the lonelier group reported overall more internalizing problems at both time-points, compared to the less lonely. A review of the impact of loneliness and disease containment measures on mental health in children and youths, across different pandemic outbreaks from the 1940s and upwards, concluded that social isolation and loneliness increase the risk of depression and anxiety both at the time at which loneliness was measured and as late as 9 years after [1] . The study further suggested that the duration of loneliness correlated more strongly with mental health problems than the intensity of the feeling of loneliness. This may explain our results, in that the experience of loneliness might have increased more for the less lonely group in early spring, during the nine following months, due to the ongoing pandemic suppressive measures imposed on youth between the time points. In line with this understanding, post-hoc analysis showed increased peer problems across time points (coefficient 0.29, p < 0.001) for those who reported being lonely seldom or less. No change was observed among those who reported being lonely pretty often or more at baseline (coefficient \u2212 0.12, p = 0.108; Fig. 4 ).",

The level of internalizing symptoms was higher for those reporting a worsening of their home situation, at both time-points.

As others has pointed out [22] , the reduction in social and school responsibilities might be experienced as alleviating for some youth, contributing to explanaining of the decrease in externalizing behavior. Even so, our results are contradictory compared to previous studies from the US during the COVID-19 lockdown [8] , concluding with an increased risk for elevated externalizing problems among youths with ADHD and poor emotion regulation abilities, during spring and summer 2020. With regards to our findings, future data collection in this ongoing longitudinal study might provide insights into whether the decrease in externalizing problems among youth born in Norway, and youth reporting loneliness is related to youth development, school obligations, family situation, or pandemic-specific issues.",

Still, there was no comparison condition. Because of this, it is not possible to ascribe any changes in youth mental health, specifically to the effects of COVID-19. Likewise, we do not have a pre-pandemic status for this sample. We can therefore not state whether the first wave of data represents a change of mental health from a normal situation. This has implications for our interpretation of the degree of change between T1 and T2. However, findings from studies on the adult population in Norway [23] and the UK [24] indicate an overall stability in mental health among adults during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Similarly, mental health problems and COVID-19 related covariates were assessed at the same time at baseline (t 1 ), so while it is possible to ascertain that these factors were associated with increases in mental health problems, the direction of those associations cannot be concluded. Further, this study relies on self-reported mental health at both time-points, thus might be subject to report bias.",

Also, the sample is recruited from a demographically restricted area, even if it is Norway's second-largest city. On the other hand, given regional variations in suppressive measures, our restricted sampling area allowed studying youth mental health where all participants were under similar conditions. One should note, however, that our sample was predominantly a selected group of youths that either had parents with higher educational level and household income compared to non-consenting parents. Also, all participants from the age range of secondary school were recruited through contact information from the school offices. Hence, we had no access to older youth who are not attending school. However, in Norway, 93% of the youth attends high school.",

Our findings nuance the picture from the Norwegian national lockdown in April 2020 [19] , in that the results show an overall increase in total mental health problems from the first weeks into the pandemic lockdown to 9 months after. It seems that the relative increase in internalizing problems was more marked among the presumably least vulnerable youth. Even though we still identify a high-risk group with comparably high levels of mental health problems, also reporting more loneliness and demanding family relations, the situation for this group seemed more stable and unrelated to the duration of the pandemic. This may imply that in the wake of the pandemic, one should be aware also of emerging mental health problems among presumably resilient youth in addition to the more expected and pronounced mental health needs of vulnerable groups. Efforts to reach out to the general youth population with preventive measures in schools may be important actions to normalize the situation for young people, and to identify those in need of more targeted mental health interventions.",
