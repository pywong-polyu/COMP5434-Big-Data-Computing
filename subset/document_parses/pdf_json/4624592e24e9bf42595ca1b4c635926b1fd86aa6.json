The proposed analysis is based on the comparison of the frequencies of occurrence of keywords-MeSH terms. The purpose of the analysis is to identify MeSH terms that characterize research areas specific to each group of articles, as well as to identify trendstopics on which the number of published works has changed significantly in recent years. The proposed approach was tested by comparing a set of medical publications and a group of articles in the field of personalized medicine. We analyzed about 700 thousand abstracts published in the period 2009-2021 and indexed them with MeSH terms. Topics with increasing research interest have been identified both in the field of medicine in general and specific to personalized medicine. Retrospective analysis of the keywords frequency of occurrence changes has shown the shift of the scientific priorities in this area over the past 10 years. The revealed patterns can be used to predict the relevance and significance of the scientific work direction in the horizon of 3-5 years. The proposed analysis can be scaled in the future for a larger number of groups of publications, as well as adjusted by introducing filters at the stage of sampling (scientific centers, journals, availability of full texts, etc.) or selecting a list of keywords (frequency threshold, use of qualifiers, category of generalizations).",

Each PMID is associated with a set of MeSHterms-keywords, characterizing the paper (PMID to MeSHs). Based on these data, Scanbious generates a list of MeSH terms, that characterize each sample, and also calculates the frequency of occurrence of each MeSH-term normalized to the total number of papers in the sample (MeSH-terms's frequency vectors). Thus, for each sample, a MeSH-terms's frequency vector is formed, which is a set of keywords (MeSH-terms) and its relative frequency of occurrence in a given sample.",

A positive log ratio value for the MeSH terms indicates that its frequency of occurrence is higher in the target sample compared to the control sample, while a negative value is observed for MeSH terms which are comparatively more often associated with papers on general medicine (control sample). The absolute value of the log ratio indicates the magnitude of this difference. For example, if the log ratio for the term \"exercise therapy\" for the period 2016-2017 is \u2212 2.0, then this term is four times more likely to be found in the control sample of papers compared to the target sample.

The Mann-Kendall test is nonparametric (i.e., does not require a normal distribution of data), and analyzes the distribution of the signs of the differences between neighboring values. The determining trend in the dynamics of the term use frequency was considered credible if the p-value of the Mann-Kendall test did not exceed the threshold value of 0.01.

The hierarchy of MeSH terms comprises 16 top-level categories (Mao & Lu, 2017) . We limited our analysis to MeSH terms within the following three categories (and subcategories), namely: \"Diseases\" (C), \"Chemicals and Drugs\" (D), and \"Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment\" (E). At this stage of the analysis, we did not include papers from 2021-2022 in our study due to them being unrepresentative as a result of the lag in the MeSH terms assignment; the annotation of articles takes, on average, from 25 days to a year (Irwin & Rackham, 2017) . About 10% of the articles remain uncharacterized concerning MeSH terms, despite their date of publication. The indexing time of a paper is, on average, 177 \u00b1 100 days, 111 \u00b1 69 days, and 23 \u00b1 40 days for articles published in journals with impact factors of 2.0-2.5, 4.5-6.5, and > 25, respectively (Irwin & Rackham, 2017) .

The relative diversity of terms may be associated with a relatively new field for which the established terminology is not yet characteristic. On the other hand, taking into account the vagueness of the very concept of \"personalized medicine\", this can be considered as a consequence of a lack of clarity regarding which studies may actually belong to this field. Interestingly, while 12 years later, there was an increase in articles on the subject of personalized medicine by 4 times (from 3% in 2009 to 4% in 2021) of the total number of articles on medical topics. This indicates that a gradual translation of genomic and postgenomic scientific research into the field of practical medicine has occurred. A steadily decreasing number of MeSH terms are becoming specific for PM, which leads to the convergence of general and personalized medicine.",

A significant decrease in the relative frequency of use for PM articles was also shown for the terms \"clinical trials as topic\" (\u2212 5.2%), \"treatment outcome\" (\u2212 4.1%), \"drug delivery systems\" (\u2212 3.5%), and \"patient selection\" (\u2212 2.9%) (see Fig. 5 ).

The latter term is also included in the list of upward trends in the field of personalized medicine (see Fig. 4a ), however, in contrast to the relatively monotonous growth of most other trends, this term is characterized by a decrease starting from 2017. This decrease was also noted in the data for 2021, which is probably due to the fact that high-throughput sequencing, in itself, has become relatively routine in clinical practice. Other terms that characterize fields of study with an upward trend are \"cohort studies\" (+ 1.9%), \"case-control studies\" (+ 1.7%), \"immunotherapy\" (+ 1.6%), and \"xenograft model antitumor assays\" (+ 1.5%). These terms characterize the current directions of studies in the field of personalized medicine at the present time.",

Using the example of personalized and general medicine data sets, it is shown that there are keywords that characterize \"persistent hot topics\", that is, Fig. 5 Dynamics of the frequency of use of terms in control and target samples. At the top are terms whose frequency of use is significantly decreasing, while the bottom indicates terms whose frequency of use in personalized medicine is significantly increasing. The reliability of the trend was determined using the Mann-Kendall test. The size of the dots reflects the degree of frequency change areas of stable and strong interest (i.e., \"neoplasms\", \"treatment outcome\", \"antineoplastic agents\"); directions of downward trends (\"oligonucleotide array sequence analysis\", \"drug therapy\", \"Ras proteins\", \"recombinant proteins\"); and those that are characterized by upward trends (\"critical care\", \"hemorrhage\"). All the obtained results were mapped to other papers in the field of medicine in order to separate the trends that are specific rather than characteristic of medicine in general. Thus, among the upward trends in general medicine, studies in the field of \"survey and questionnaires\" can be distinguished.",
