            "text": "Following the first appearance of a novel coronavirus (subsequently named SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, a rapid worldwide spread occurred. The clinical presentation of infected individuals varies considerably, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to fatal multi-organ failure. Fast and reliable laboratory analysis from respiratory specimens is crucial for the placement and management of patients. The Robert Koch Institute in Germany recommends nasopharyngeal swabs for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, USA) recommend nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs. Throat washing (gargling) is discussed as an alternative. Previous studies have reported various results on the diagnostic sensitivity of saliva or sputum [1] [2] [3] [4] . Each sampling method offers advantages and disadvantages in clinical routine. For example, nasopharyngeal swabs are more difficult to obtain and currently affected by global supply shortages. On the other hand, throat washings are easy to perform, but could increase the risk of aerosolization or negatively influence the detection rate. Reliable data on the diagnostic performance of throat washing compared to nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs are scarce. We aimed to compare the diagnostic sensitivity and concentration of SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA as derived by three sampling methods: throat washings (TW), nasopharyngeal swabs (NS) and oropharyngeal swabs (OS). Moreover, saliva samples were analyzed from a subset of the study participants.",

Inclusion criteria were: laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined by a positive RT-qPCR result before inclusion) and age \u2265 18 years. All samples were collected by a single infectious diseases specialist in a defined sequence: (1) saliva (subset of 21 patients between May and December 2020), (2) oropharyngeal swab, (3) nasopharyngeal swab, and (4) throat washing. To obtain TW, patients were instructed to take 10 mL of medical grade saline or water in their mouth, gargle for 5-10 s (oscillating over the posterior pharyngeal wall) and transfer the liquid into a sterile test tube. NS and OS were obtained according to standard procedures. No combined swabs were collected. Only one nostril was probed for collecting NS.",

Nucleic acid was isolated from 200 \u00b5L of sample on an EZ1 Advanced XL workstation using the EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 100 \u00b5L elution buffer. A defined amount of MS2 bacteriophages was added during extraction and served as an internal control for isolation, reverse transcription and amplification. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA was determined by RT-qPCR. Briefly, 5 \u00b5L eluate was used for one-step reverse transcription and amplification in a total reaction volume of 30 \u00b5L using the TaqPath TM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The PCR primers and fluorescent hydrolysis probe targeted the E-region of the viral genome [5] . Thermal cycling and real-time detection were performed on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher). The protocol was extended to allow absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as expressed in genome copies/mL (cp/mL). Therefore, standard curves were obtained by reverse transcription and amplification of a series of defined amounts of pre-characterized, in-vitro-transcribed and assay-specific RNA standards, generated as previously described for a different detection assay [6] . The specific target concentrations in the specimens were obtained by comparing the respective quantification cycles (Ct-values) to the standard curves. The analytical sensitivity (LoD 95 ) of the assay was \u2264300 cp/mL of specimen (corresponding to \u22643 copies per reaction).",

The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normal distribution. Levene's test was used to assess if samples were from populations with equal variances. The log 10 -transformed concentrations of groups were first analyzed by a linear mixed-effects model (LME). The null hypothesis (H 0 ) assumed no difference in mean concentrations between groups. If the LME analysis yielded a non-significant result, H 0 could not be falsified and no further analysis followed. When LME yielded a significant result, at least one of the means of the groups was assumed to be different from the others (H 0 falsified). In this case, post-hoc comparisons based on the LME followed between each group. All statistical analyses were performed using R, version 4.0.4 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The lmer() function implemented in the R-package lme4 was used for calculating the linear mixed-effects model. The emmeans() function from the R-package lmerTest was used for the post-hoc comparisons. P values of < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.",

These authors proposed TW as a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 screening and monitoring due to its noninvasiveness and reliability. However, the limitations of this study were the small sample size (7 patients) and a sampling time long after symptom onset (median 53 days, range 48-57 days), which might have contributed to the low positive detection rate. The results of our study do not confirm that TW is superior to NS. We found the median concentration of NS being 13-times (1.1 log 10 ) higher than in TW. This difference could-at least partially-be due to the higher volume (10 mL) of TW samples and the resulting dilution. In line with this observation, our data also suggest the use of NS samples as preferential material for antigen testing, which requires higher viral loads for detection.",

These authors detected more SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the saliva than in the NS specimens (70 patients; mean 3.8 \u00d7 10 5 vs. 8.5 \u00d7 10 4 cp/mL). They conclude that saliva and NS have at least similar sensitivity in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 during the course of hospitalization. The results of our study do not confirm this observation. In contrast, we found virtually the same median viral load from NS samples compared to SA (4.1 \u00d7 10 3 vs. 3.4 \u00d7 10 3 cp/mL; 1.2-times higher = 0.1 log 10 ) in a subset of 21 patients. Variations in nasopharyngeal sampling may be an explanation for this discrepancy: The study by Wyllie et al. included NS collected by many health professionals while in our study all samples were collected by a single trained infectious disease specialist. In this context, a recently published study by Jamal et al. [3] reported a lower diagnostic sensitivity of SA (72%) as compared to NS (89%).",

Therefore, our results may not be fully transferable to other groups, like children, outpatients or critically ill patients. However, we assume a comparable situation in adult outpatients with early disease stages, because the mean time since symptom-onset was only \u223c6 days in our study. Second, only one nostril was probed for collecting NS, which might have negatively influenced the analytical sensitivity. Third, the collection of specimens took place between April and December 2020 in Southern Germany. The spectrum of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains likely has changed since that time and we cannot exclude potential effects on the results.",

Fur-thermore, TW could allow patient self-sampling, thereby reducing the risk of infection for medical personnel.
