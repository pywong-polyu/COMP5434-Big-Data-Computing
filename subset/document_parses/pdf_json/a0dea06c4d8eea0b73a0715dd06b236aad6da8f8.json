These thermocyclers are often capable of accommodating 96 or 384-well PCR plates, and when used in conjunction with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR reagents have the potential to provide the highest throughput and lowest cost per specimen among laboratory-based NAATs. However, these tests require extraction of nucleic acids from specimens prior to RT-PCR amplification and detection. In addition to hands-on time required to manually set up extraction and RT-PCR plates, the additional reagents and disposables required increase the total cost per result and present increased potential for supply chain gaps. Further, many automated nucleic acid extraction platforms can process only 16 to 24 specimens per batch, which can lead to workflow bottlenecks and extended turnaround time. Given these barriers, adaptation of batch-based tests using a direct or extraction-free protocol would be desirable and provide several potential benefits to cost, hands-on time, turnaround time, throughput, and reduced risk of downtime due to supply chain shortages.",

            "text": "Prior studies have examined an extraction-free approach using either chemical or heat-based lysis steps and noted decreases in analytic limit of detection (LoD) as well as clinical sensitivity. [2] [3] [4] Differences in sensitivity between extracted and nonextracted specimens can be attributed to multiple variables, including (1) volume and type of transport medium put into the direct RT-PCR reaction, (2) genomic target and length of amplicon, (3) lack of specimen concentration in nonextracted specimens, and (4) stability of the polymerase enzyme utilized. These factors resulted in median increases of up to 6.7 cycle threshold (CT), which is equivalent to an approximately 2 log 10 decrease in analytic sensitivity. Importantly, in these studies the clinical sensitivity also fell to 72% to 81% when compared to extracted specimens, with false-negative results weighted toward those specimens with high CT values. [2] [3] [4] While these data involve laboratory-developed protocols, the decreased analytic sensitivity associated with extraction-free protocols is also observed when comparing tests that have received EUA. Specifically, the Lyra SARS-CoV-2 Direct assay (Quidel) demonstrates an approximately 3 log 10 decrease in analytic LoD when compared to the Lyra SARS CoV-2 assay that uses extracted viral RNA as template. 5 The EUA high-definition PCR (HDPCR) SARS-CoV-2 assay (ChromaCode) is a multiplexed molecular test that targets 2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (N1 and N2), as well as the human RNase P gene (RP) as an internal control, in a single well. HDPCR utilizes standard RT-PCR instrumentation and well-established hydrolysis probe chemistry; however, in addition to differentiation of each target based on unique fluorophores, HDPCR employs a limiting probe design. The use of limited probe does not impact detection of a specific target (ie, CT value); however, the maximal fluorescence signal (ie, amplitude) reached during plateau phase of PCR can be modulated based on the amount of probe included in the reaction. This design enables differentiation of multiple unique targets using the same fluorophore based on the endpoint fluorescent signal or plateau associated with each probe. In addition to differentiation of multiple targets in a single fluorescent channel, HDPCR may also increase specificity of target detection. This HDPCR technology has successfully been applied to multiplex molecular tests targeting multiple respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal specimens as well as multiple tickborne pathogens in whole-blood samples with high sensitivity and specificity. [6] [7] [8] The primary aim of our study was to provide an analytic and clinical performance comparison between a traditional RT-PCR assay, TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (ThermoFisher), and the HDPCR SARS-CoV-2 Assay (ChromaCode). Further, we examined the feasibility, performance, and potential impact of a research use only extraction-free protocol using the HDPCR SARS-CoV-2 reagents.",

Detection of the internal control was required for a result of \"negative\" for SARS-CoV-2. The internal control for the TaqPath assay consists of MS2 phage template exogenously added to each specimen prior to extraction, and was detected in all replicates at all dilutions. The internal control for the HDPCR assays is the human RP gene, which is endogenous to the specimen. As expected, this internal control was diluted along with the clinical specimen and became undetectable in 1 of 5 (20%) replicates at the 10 -4 dilution for the extracted HDPCR; as well as 1 of 15 (6.7%) at 10 -2 and 8 of 15 (53.3%) at 10 -3 dilution for extraction-free HDPCR replicates. Differences in internal control detection rate between extracted and extraction-free HDPCR dilutions can be partly attributed to a 4-fold concentration of the specimen during nucleic acid extraction, resulting in 4-fold more target being added to the final PCR reaction for extracted specimens.",

A portion of this decrease is attributable to the 4-fold concentration during nucleic acid extraction, which results in more starting template in RT-PCR and HDPCR reactions using extracted template. Notably, the variance in recorded CT value (determined by standard deviation) was greater for the extraction-free protocol, and increased with increasing dilution of specimens in both standard and extraction-free protocols.

In this instance, the decrease in LoD associated with the extraction-free protocol is consistent with a failure to accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in this specimen. Importantly, the clinical performance of any assay will be impacted by the distribution of viral loads in the population tested and the specimen type chosen, which in our study was combined nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs obtained from symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals.",

            "text": "Our findings are consistent with prior studies indicating that the greatest risk of false-negative result using an extraction-free protocol would be in specimens with high CT values (corresponding to low viral load), and that low viral load is more common in asymptomatic individuals. 2, 3, 18, 19, 21, 22 The clinical and public health significance of patients with high CT results remains elusive. Several groups have associated high CT value with mild symptoms and/or lower risk of viral transmission, 17, 19, 20, 22 while others have failed to demonstrate a correlation. 23 Further complicating correlation of CT value with clinical presentation is the heterogeneity of specimen collection. A specific advantage of the HDPCR SARS-CoV-2 assay over TaqPath COVID-19 is the use of the endogenous RP target as an internal control. This enables a more accurate assessment of specimen quality than the addition of exogenous MS2 template used by TaqPath; in addition to monitoring for the presence of inhibitory substances, an endogenous internal control also monitors for RNA degradation during specimen transport. Controlling for these specimen-specific factors is especially important when using an extraction-free approach. Importantly, as with any test, the positive and negative predictive value will be dependent on pretest probability; therefore, clinical symptoms and risk of exposure should be considered when interpreting individual results.",

            "text": "A notable drawback associated with the extractionfree protocol was a significant increase in the incidence of specimens reported as \"invalid\" (internal control not detected) or \"presumptive\" (single target, N1, or N2 detected). The overall \"invalid\" rate increased from 0.3% when using extracted template to 5.2% when using raw specimen. This is not unexpected because potentially inhibitory substance in the specimen and/or the transport medium are not being removed prior to PCR. Interestingly, the \"invalid\" rate varied significantly among the transport media tested. Approximately 28.6% (8/28) of specimens collected in STM (MedSchenker) yielded \"invalid\" results, which accounted for 44.4% (8/18) of all \"invalid\" results reported using the extraction-free protocol. Exclusion of this medium reduces the overall \"invalid\" rate to 2.9%, with several media (Saline, ESwab, Hardy VTM) reporting no \"invalid results.\" The incidence of \"presumptive\" results also increased from 0% (0/347) when using extracted nucleic acid template to 3.3% (11/331) among all valid specimens when using the extractionfree HDPCR protocol. This translates to 19.6% (11/56) of all nonnegative (ie, \"positive\" plus \"presumptive\") results. Among specimens with a \"presumptive\" call, 54.5% (6/11) were \"positive\" by TaqPath and 45.5% (5/11) were negative, suggesting a similar rate of true and spurious single-target detection. Upon repeat testing of the 11 specimens using the extraction-free protocol, 63.6% (7/11) remained \"presumptive\" (3 true positive specimens, 4 true negative specimens), 1 each converted to \"true\" positive, 1 converted to \"true\" negative, 1 converted to \"false\"-negative, and 1 converted to \"invalid.\" These data suggest that repeat testing of \"presumptive\" results with the extraction-free approach is of limited utility, and these specimens may be better candidates for reanalysis using extracted nucleic acid template in accordance with the EUA HDPCR assay instructions for use. Of note, similar to \"invalid\" results, the incidence of \"presumptive\" result also varied among the different transport media, with 45.5% (5/11) of such results obtained from specimens collected using VTM manufactured by Genteuri. While the specific cause of the increased incidence of \"invalid\" and \"presumptive\" results associated with specific medium is not immediately apparent, these data underscore the importance of conducting a thorough evaluation of all transport media utilized by a laboratory prior to implementation of an extraction-free HDPCR approach.",

            "text": "Finally, an assessment of the potential benefits of an extraction-free protocol on various aspects of laboratory workflow was conducted. Use of extraction-free HDPCR resulted in a 55% reduction in hands-on time and 21% reduction in total turnaround time when compared to the standard HDPCR protocol (based on manual preparation of full 96-well extraction and PCR plates and instrument run times). Based on an average medical technologist total compensation of $45 to $55/hour, this equates to $20.25 to $24.75 savings in labor cost per plate of specimens tested. While these potential savings likely do not equate to real savings unless staffing is reduced, this labor time and associated cost can be redirected to other laboratory tasks to help reduce strain on available staff. More importantly, elimination of the manual preparation of extraction plates has the potential to reduce errors associated with repetitive pipetting and fatigue; however, our limited sample size (n = 351 specimens) did not allow us to assess for potential differences in these human error rates. Elimination of extraction also reduced consumables cost (plastics and reagents) by over $150 per 96 specimens and, more importantly, reduces the number of links in the supply chain necessary to complete the testing process. A drawback to implementation of the extraction-free protocol is the increased rate of \"invalid\" and \"presumptive\" results, which combined comprised 8.2% (29/351) of all specimens tested. These specimens would be candidates for repeat testing using a standard HDPCR protocol with nucleic acid extraction, or an alternative test platform. Of note, the \"invalid\" and \"presumptive\" rate differed by transport medium, which may provide a simple method to reduce these results by restricting the type of medium accepted for extraction-free testing.",

Evaluation of the extraction-free protocol with all transport media used by the clinical laboratory is necessary to avoid increased incidence of \"invalid\" and \"presumptive\" results. Use of the extractionfree protocol results in a measurable reduction in hands on time and material cost, and reduces the potential of testing interruptions due to supply chain shortages associated with consumables required for nucleic acid extraction.",
