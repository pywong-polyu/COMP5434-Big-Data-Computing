The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency are to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by FEMA to different U.S. states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20 000 ventilators (as of March 23, 2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (until May 31, 2020) is about 232 000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17 200 ventilators on April 19, 2020. Results are also reported for a worst-case where the demand is at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval. An important finding of this study is that a central agency (FEMA) can act as a coordinator for sharing critical resources that are in short supply over time to add efficiency in the system. Moreover, through properly managing risk-aversion of different entities (states) additional efficiency can be gained. An additional implication is that ramping up production early in the planning cycle allows to reduce shortfall significantly. An optimal timing of this production ramp-up consideration can be based on a cost-benefit analysis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "While approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, the most severe cases of COVID-19 can result in respiratory failure, with approximately 5% of patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilation (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . Mechanical ventilation is used to save the lives of patients whose lungs are so damaged that they can no longer pump enough oxygen into the blood to sustain organ function. It provides more oxygen than can be delivered through a nasal cannula or face mask, allowing the patient's lungs time to recover and fight off the infection.

This modeling framework can be used to develop master plans that will allocate part of the ventilator inventory here-and-now, while allocating and reallocating the available ventilators in the future. The modeling framework incorporates conditions under which part of the historically available ventilator inventory is used for non-COVID-19 patients, who also present themselves for treatment along with COVID-19 patients. Thus, only a fraction of the historical ventilator inventory is available to treat COVID-19 patients. The remaining demand needs are met by allocation and re-allocation of available ventilators from FEMA and availability of additional ventilators through planned production. FEMA is assumed as the central agency that coordinates state-to-state ventilator sharing. The availability of inventory from a state for re-allocation incorporates a certain risk-aversion parameter.

Each participating state is risk averse to sharing their excess inventory at any given time, and this risk-aversion is captured by using a safety threshold parameter. Specifically, the developed model is applicable to the current COVID-19 pandemic, where many U.S. states are in dire need of mechanical ventilators to provide life-support to severely and critically ill patients. Computations were performed using realistic ventilator need forecasts and availability under a wide combination of parameter settings. Our findings suggest that the fraction of currently available ventilators that are to be used for non-COVID-19 patients strongly impacts state and national ability to meet demand arising from COVID-19 patients. When more than 40% of the existing inventory is available for COVID-19 patients, the national stockpile is nearly sufficient to meet the demand in mild cases. However, if less than 25% of the existing inventory is available for COVID-19 patients, the current national stockpile and the anticipated production may not be sufficient under extreme demand scenarios.
