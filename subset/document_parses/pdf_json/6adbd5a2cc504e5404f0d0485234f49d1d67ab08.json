Participants in other Asian countries were more likely than those in Japan to report they missed ART \u2265 1 time in the past month because they were depressed/ overwhelmed (57.4%[89/155] vs 32.0%[24/75]), had privacy concerns (56.8%[88/155] vs 30.7%[23/75]), were concerned about the potential long-term negative impacts of ART (46.5%[72/155] vs 26.7%[20/75]), or just wanted to forget about HIV (45.8%[71/155] vs 22.7%[17/75]). ART satisfaction however did not differ significantly between surveyed PLHIV in Japan (54.7%[41/75]) vs those in other Asian countries (47.7%[74/155]). The percentage who felt that daily ART dosing limited their lives was 36.0%[27/75] among participants from Japan, 48.4%[75/155] among participants from other Asian countries, and 27.3%[589/2159] among those from non-Asian countries.",

People living with HIV (PLHIV) are now able to live longer, fuller lives, experience better quality care, and expect not just to survive, but to thrive [1] [2] [3] [4] . The important task of improving the person-centeredness of HIV care falls on no one person but rather requires an all-handson-deck approach-PLHIV, healthcare providers (HCPs), regulators, drug manufacturers, and other members of the healthcare ecosystem [5] . The benefits are however enormous not only for the individual patient but the entire health system and the general population. According to the triple aim framework developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement [6] , the performance of health systems can only be optimized by simultaneously improving the patient experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita cost of healthcare.",

For example, patients may have different levels of satisfaction with their main provider, vs other members of the health team, vs their antiretroviral therapy (ART). Within pooled data from the 2019 Positive Perspectives Study, 32.7% of PLHIV felt their main HCP did not prioritize their needs/preferences while 61.2% and 39.1% felt there was room for improving their HIV overall management and HIV medications, respectively [7] . PLHIV may be dissatisfied with their treatment even if they are virally suppressed or report good overall health [8] , underscoring the need for ongoing patient-provider communication. Yet, many PLHIV hold back from such discussions for fear of being labelled a difficult patient [7] . Furthermore, face-to-face patient-provider engagements may have been limited in some areas because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

There is a paucity of data on how subjective experiences with ART are influenced by the characteristics of the medication, the clinical contexts in which it is offered, and the psychographic characteristics of the person taking the medication. To fill this gap in knowledge, this study used a structural equation model (SEM) to examine these multiple, inter-related associations among a pooled sample of 2389 participants in 25 countries. In view of the rising HIV incidence rate in Japan compared to most other countries as well as other unique cultural and contextual factors [10] [11] [12] , we further performed descriptive analyses to contrast ART satisfaction and perceived treatment challenges in Japan vs other Asian countries (China, Taiwan, and South Korea), as well as non-Asian countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Ireland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, UK, and USA). The rationale for these comparisons was to determine whether treatment experiences reported by PLHIV in Japan were unique relative to regional or global patterns. Specific questions explored as part of this study were: (1) What treatment challenges do PLHIV face that might influence perceived ART satisfaction and how do these differ among PLHIV in Japan vs other Asian countries and non-Asian countries? (2) How do various treatment experiences influence ART satisfaction, and what is the impact on indicators of quality of life? (3) What improvements in ART are considered most important to PLHIV, comparing those in Japan, vs other Asian countries and non-Asian countries?",

            "text": "SEM is a robust multivariable technique particularly suited for examining attitudinal and behavioural outcomes such as treatment satisfaction which reflect complex, multiple, interrelated and multidirectional relationships. In our SEM, we first measured out the variables of interest (i.e., the measurement model), then we determined the structure/relationship of one variable to the other (i.e., the structural model). The measurement model involved creating unseen variables (i.e., latent variables, formulated from a theoretical and statistical framework, and represented by oval shapes) from seen variables (i.e., observed variables from the dataset, represented by rectangular shapes). The reason for specifying latent variables is that they capture the construct of interest in greater depth and breadth as they summarize information from several observed variables, each of which may only tell part of the story on their own. In Fig. 1 , there are three latent variables, \"health status\", \"provider engagement\" and \"ART anxiety\", each of which has four explanatory variables; single-headed arrows lead from the latent variable to the observed variables to signify a measurement model. The numbers beside each arrow in the measurement model (factor loadings) tell the proportion of the variation in the individual observed items that is explained by the latent factor (range 0 to 1, the bigger the better). The left-over variation not explained is termed the measurement error, the error variables are represented by small circles. A connecting double-headed arrow between two error variables means there is an expectation that the two change in tandem. For the structural part of our SEM which sought to measure the strength of association between indicated variables, single-headed arrows leading away from a latent or observed variable indicate an outcome variable, while single-headed arrows leading to a latent or observed variable indicate an explanatory variable. The strength of the specified relationships is presented as correlations (\u03b2), which as standardized values, can only range from \u2212 1 to + 1; larger absolute values signal stronger associations. Negative \u03b2 values indicate negative correlations (mean value of the one variable decreases as that of the other increases) and positive values indicate positive correlations (mean value of the one variable increases as that of the other increases too). Accompanying confidence intervals for \u03b2 that go from negative for the lower limit, to positive for the upper limit (i.e., includes 0) indicate statistically nonsignificant results.",

Those italicized are correlations between error terms (double arrows). a ART satisfaction was assessed as follows: \"Overall, how satisfied are you with your current HIV medication?\" Responses were measured on an ordinal scale from 1 to 5. b Info = \"I am given enough information to be involved in making choices about my HIV treatment\"; \"I feel I understand enough about my HIV treatment\"; viewpoint = \"My provider seeks my views about treatment before prescribing an HIV medication\"; options = \"My provider tells me about new HIV treatment options that become available\"; concerns = \"My provider asks me if I have any concerns about the HIV medication I am currently taking\". c shape = \"I worry how taking HIV medicines for many years will impact my body/body shape\"; unknowns = \"I worry that the long-term impact of HIV medicines is unknown\"; wellbeing = \"I worry how my HIV medicines will impact my overall health and wellbeing\"; \"I worry about the long-term side effects of my HIV medication\" (e.g., problems with bones, kidneys, liver).

The second was the controlreward framework, which posited that the extent of ART satisfaction was, on the one hand, a function of the extent PLHIV felt in control of their medication (high control if they felt in control of their dosing schedule in their day-today life; low control if they felt their dosing schedule controlled their day-to-day lives), as well as perceived benefits from the medication on the other hand (e.g., the belief that ART prevents HIV transmission).",

            "text": "This study provides a comprehensive assessment of factors associated with treatment satisfaction among people living with HIV in Japan and other selected countries. positive influences on ART satisfaction were high levels of provider engagement and patient perceived control over their ART dosing schedule, whereas the strongest negative influence on ART satisfaction was medication side effects. Not surprisingly, in ranked choice experiments, the treatment attribute that received the highest share of either the first or second place ranking as the most important improvement to HIV medicines was reducing side effects (53.3% of Japanese participants). Despite better adherence, PLHIV in Japan reported similar, not higher rates of ART satisfaction, compared to those in other Asian countries, reinforcing the idea that the presence of good clinical indicators (e.g., adherence or viral suppression), may not necessarily translate into good treatment experience, or by extension, good health-related quality of life [22] . Providers therefore must look beyond focusing solely on those objectively measured clinical indicators and incorporate the \"voice\" of the patient when planning treatment. It is however not enough to wait for patients to spontaneously share information about their ART challenges as this could lead to under-reporting [7, 9] , especially in cultures like Japan that value stoicism [12] . Good quality communication, including use of viewpoint questions, may be needed to draw out patients during consultations. Providers can use what they learn during such consultations to positively impact ART satisfaction and adherence by tailoring treatment to address specific concerns patients may have about ART, be they emotional, psychosocial, or medical challenges [7, 9, 23] . HCPs can also provide patients with information on new treatment options to help them make well-informed decisions [7, 24] . Besides virologic control, considering patients' preferences in relation to quality of life can accelerate progress towards reaching the targets related to improving adherence and quality of life [5] . According to the HIV treatment guideline of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare [25] , achieving virological suppression alone is not enough in the context of long-term medical treatment; attention should be paid to improving the quality of life by reducing side effects and improving the convenience of oral administration. The guideline further emphasizes that the principle underpinning drug change or switching is to improve quality of life and maintain viral suppression while ensuring that future treatment options are not narrowed. Nonmedical reasons, including travel, were the leading reasons for missing ART among PLHIV in Japan. In a recent international study [24] , PLHIV participants revealed that what they liked the most about long-acting HIV regimens was the ease of travel (i.e., not having to carry along pills). In that same study, 84.2% of healthcare providers indicated willingness to offer long-acting regimens because of convenience and lifestyle reasons [24] . Recognizing that the patient and the person are one and the same, and that disruptions in one aspect of their life would most likely affect all aspects of their life, can motivate providers to seek flexible treatment options that fit into the lives of PLHIV. Results from our structural model showed that side effects had the strongest negative impact on ART satisfaction, whereas provider engagement and perceived control over ART dosing schedule had the strongest positive impacts. Reducing side effects was also the most important treatment improvement in the first or second-place priority ranking by PLHIV in Japan. Taken together, these findings indicate that if HCPs empower PLHIV so they avail themselves of treatments that suit their lifestyle (i.e., increased perceived control) and are highly tolerable, then treatment satisfaction may be achieved, and along with it, greater adherence to ART and improved self-rated health as suggested by our study.",

Concerns about drug tolerability or side effects constitute the single most important treatment consideration among persons living with HIV in Japan; 29.3% missed ART \u2265 1 time in the past month to avoid side effects. Factors positively associated with ART satisfaction included perceived control over ART dosing schedule, perceived benefits of treatment, and high provider engagement. Conversely, factors inversely associated with ART satisfaction were side effects, being on multi-tablet regimens, and high \"ART anxiety\". High level of satisfaction with ART was significantly associated with good self-rated health and treatment adherence. Pre-emptively considering determinants of treatment satisfaction when planning treatment can go a long way in improving the patient's experience. Treatment options tailored to patient concerns, preferences, and lifestyle, including long-acting ART, may help address unmet needs, improve quality of life, and improve long-term outcomes for PLHIV.",
