This study compared the effects of intermittent mask CPAP (ICPAP) and continuous helmet CPAP (HCPAP) on oxygenation and the risk of pulmonary complications following major abdominal surgery. Patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair or pancreaticoduodenectomy were randomized (1:1) to either postoperative ICPAP or HCPAP. Oxygenation was evaluated as the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO 2 /FIO 2 ) at 6 h, 12 h, and 18 h postoperatively. Pulmonary complications were defined as X-ray verified pneumonia/atelectasis, clinical signs of pneumonia, or supplementary oxygen beyond postoperative day 3. Patient-reported comfort during CPAP treatment was also evaluated. In total, 96 patients (ICPAP, n = 48; HCPAP, n = 48) were included, and the type of surgical procedure were evenly distributed between the groups. Oxygenation did not differ between the groups by 6 h, 12 h, or 18 h postoperatively (p = 0.1, 0.08, and 0.67, respectively). Nor was there any difference in X-ray verified pneumonia/atelectasis (p = 0.40) or supplementary oxygen beyond postoperative day 3 (p = 0.53). Clinical signs of pneumonia tended to be more frequent in the ICPAP group (p = 0.06), yet the difference was not statistically significant. Comfort scores were similar in both groups (p = 0.43), although a sensation of claustrophobia during treatment was only experienced in the HCPAP group (11% vs. 0%, p = 0.03). Compared with ICPAP, using HCPAP was associated with similar oxygenation (i.e., PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio) and a similar risk of pulmonary complications. However, HCPAP treatment was associated with a higher sensation of claustrophobia.",

CPAP increases functional residual capacity and vital capacity, enhancing gas exchange and oxygenation while reducing respiratory work [7] . CPAP can be delivered through a nasal airway, face mask, or a helmet interface [8] . A meta-analysis by Ferreyra et al. [4] concluded that for CPAP to decrease the risk of PPCs, a continuous treatment period of at least 6 h is recommended [4] . Although CPAP may be administered via a face mask over an extended period, this modality is poorly tolerated by patients and is time-consuming for staff in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) [9] . Therefore, the standard mask CPAP treatment is commonly applied intermittently in the PACU: for example, for 10-30 min every 2-3 h [5] . Because patients can generally tolerate the helmet better than the mask interface [10] , postoperative treatment durations may be prolonged by using the helmet, perhaps preventing PPCs more effectively after major abdominal surgery. However, to our knowledge, these CPAP delivery modalities have not been compared previously in a randomized trial.",

Interestingly, at 18 h, the helmet treatment had been discontinued for 12 h, and yet the PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio did not differ significantly from that measured in patients treated with ICPAP. In patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), CPAP delivered via the helmet resulted in similar improvements in PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratios to those observed in patients who had received CPAP via the mask interface [17, 18] . However, in one study, by 12 h after the initiation of treatment, only the helmet group had a PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio that was significantly higher than that recorded at baseline [17] . In addition, in infants with bronchiolitis, CPAP delivered via the helmet or mask interface resulted in a similar improvement in PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio [19] . In a physiological study, the helmet was reported as efficient as the mask interface in delivering CPAP to healthy adult volunteers [20] . However, due to CO 2 rebreathing, the helmet interface requires a greater flow of fresh gas to maintain PaCO 2 levels [15, 20, 21] . Although few studies have compared the efficacy of using a helmet or mask interface to deliver CPAP, these have consistently reported similar improvements in PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio for both methods.",

            "text": "In the present study, both groups tolerated the CPAP treatments equally well, and there were no differences in overall patient-reported comfort. Patient tolerance to treatment provided via mask or helmet interfaces has been compared in many studies [17, 18, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Several studies have reported higher tolerance of the helmet interface [17, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , whereas some studies reported no differences [21] [22] [23] [24] . In our study, the helmet treatment was briefly paused in 26 cases; however, all patients completed the full 6 h treatment. All patients given ICPAP tolerated the treatment without breaks. Patients given HCPAP were more likely to report claustrophobia than those given ICPAP; however, no pauses in HCPAP treatment were due to claustrophobia.",

Therefore, international guidelines have recommended using the helmet interface for noninvasive respiratory support during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [31] . Our results indicate that the helmet interface is as tolerated by patients and provides similar pulmonary oxygenation levels to the mask interface without increasing the risk of PPCs. Hence, the helmet interface may represent a safer option for staff without compromising patient care. Although in our experience, the protocol to remove the helmet for hasty intubation can be cumbersome compared to removing the mask.",

            "text": "This study had some limitations. First, patients in the ICPAP group received the standard care regime of CPAP at 10 cm H 2 O for 10 min every 2 h throughout their stay in the PACU, whereas those in the HCPAP group received 7.5 cm H 2 O for 6 h, initiated upon PACU arrival. However, the difference in the total length of CPAP treatment time [mask: median, 70 min (range, 66-80 min); helmet: median, 358 min (range, 350-360 min)] did not translate into improved oxygenation or a reduced risk of pulmonary complications in the HCPAP group. Second, the CPAP level in the HCPAP group (7.5 cm) was lower than in the ICPAP group (10 cm), and this may have offset any benefit of the longer CPAP duration in the HCPAP group. This HCPAP level was chosen based on previous studies [12, 13] , and the lower pressure was also assumed to increase patient compliance. Therefore, this study compared two different CPAP treatment strategies rather than a direct comparison of two different CPAP interfaces using the same pressure level and treatment duration, which should be evaluated in future studies. Third, postoperative pain and management during the PACU visit was not documented. It was assessed using NRS (0-10) and treated with epidural boluses or IV opioids. As postoperative pain has been shown to reduce effort-dependent lung function and could influence the risk of PPC [3] , registration of NRS scores and pain management during PACU admission would have been relevant and strengthened the study In addition, only limited blinding of treatment allocation was possible in this study, increasing the risk of bias. However, the investigator conducting the statistical analysis was blinded to treatment allocation. Furthermore, our results may lack external validity as this was a single-center study.",
