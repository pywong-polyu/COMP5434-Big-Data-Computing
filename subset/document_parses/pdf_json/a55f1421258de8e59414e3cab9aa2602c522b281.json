Violent colonial practices and structures--genocide, land appropriation, resource extraction, environmental devastation, and more--have governed exploration of Earth, and if not actively dismantled, will define the methodologies and mindset we carry forward into space exploration. With sample return missions from Mars underway, resource maps of the Moon being produced, and private industry progressing toward human exploration of Mars, the timeline is urgent to develop a modern, inclusive, robust, and enforceable policy framework to govern humanity's engagement with other worlds. This paper does not recommend specific policies or implementation strategies, and instead focuses on \"the identification of planetary protection considerations,\" in accordance with the scope of this decadal survey. 1 Ethical considerations must be prioritized in the formation of planetary protection policy.",

Here we argue the opposite: that the future of our own species and our ability to explore space depends on pursuing anticolonial practices on Earth and beyond. An anticolonial perspective can push us towards an ethic that acknowledges our interconnected and entangled lives.

Current policy does not adequately address questions related to in-situ resource utilization, environmental preservation, and interactions with potential extraterrestrial life.

All of these perspectives are essential for creating a responsible policy framework that governs how scientists, engineers, and others interact with other worlds. This expertise is necessary to establish just norms for future space societies.

Leaving policy structures as they stand will not allow thoughtful consideration of any of the above questions, and will leave these deeply nuanced and complex decisions to unaccountable governments and private companies. Our own history gives us enough data to assume moral considerations will not be prioritized. Discussions on the ethics of planetary protection must result in robust, enforceable policy that explicitly works to dismantle colonial structures and provide answers or frameworks to address the ethical questions outlined above. We intentionally did not recommend a separate board or committee to address these issues. These considerations should not be sectioned off as secondary aspects of planetary protection policy, but deemed within the scope of any current or future entities that are developing or advocating for such policy.",

This must be done not simply to right past wrongs, or ensure ethical interactions with extraterrestrial environments and potential forms of life, but for an ethical and livable future for humanity. The structures we bring to other worlds will ultimately be those that humans live in as well, and in this sense, we need look no further than the existential threats we face here on Earth to see the future: the destruction of our planet's habitability, the ravaging of its ecosystems with disease, and the persistence of racism and other forms of inequity around the globe. Replicating a violent colonial framework will hurt the humans living off-world, retaining our current social inequities and hierarchies and reinforcing those systems on Earth. Ultimately, we must build a better, moral, and livable future because it is how we will survive on our own planet or any other. Proving that we can interact with other worlds in ways that don't reproduce capitalist extraction, that respect and preserve environmental systems, and that acknowledge the sovereignty and interconnectivity of all life, will illustrate these practices are not only possible, but necessary and liberating.",

We are calling on the decadal committee to engage in that fight, even knowing there will be resistance. Policy is an essential tool in this struggle, but it will require a wider change in philosophy. Space exploration, instead of being the \"final frontier,\" can be a catalyst for a transformative change in how we consider our relationships to other forms of life, to land, and ultimately to each other.",
