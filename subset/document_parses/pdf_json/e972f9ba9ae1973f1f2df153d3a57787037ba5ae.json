This study was done to investigate medium-term cardiovascular outcomes of patients with MIS-C using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). This is a single-center retrospective study of patients aged less than 21 years, diagnosed with MIS-C who received an outpatient CMR, around 6 months after discharge. CMR was done in patients with significant troponin leak or depressed LVEF. CMR performed on a GE Signa HDxt 1.5 Tesla magnet with a myocarditis protocol. Diagnosis of myocarditis was determined by the original Lake Louise Criteria. There were 21 patients with a median age of 11 years, (IQR 8-13 years), who underwent CMR at median follow-up duration of 6 months (IQR 5-7 months). At the peak of illness during admission, there were 95.2% patients with abnormal Troponin I and BNP. By echocardiogram, 76.2% had left ventricular systolic dysfunction and 9.5% had coronary ectasia, which all resolved by 6 months. By CMR, there were five patients (23.8%) with abnormal left atrial volume, one patient (4.8%) with an abnormal indexed left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and three patients (15%) with abnormal LVEF. There was no evidence of myocardial edema in T2-weighted image sequence. There were three patients with persistent late gadolinium enhancement (14.3%). Follow-up CMR is a useful tool in diagnosing subtle myocardial abnormalities and guide necessity for future follow-up.",

There is a growing pool of data on the natural history and response to therapy during hospitalization [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, there is a significant deficiency in our knowledge of medium-and long-term cardiovascular outcomes of this condition. Limited, single-center retrospective studies have demonstrated that although systolic ventricular dysfunction function and coronary artery abnormalities almost always recover within 3-6 months, subtle abnormalities in diastolic function possibly reflective of myocardial injury persist in a subset of patients [13] [14] [15] . In addition, Barris et al. demonstrated persistent abnormal T2-weighted signal ratio in 44% of the patients when cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed around 6 months after diagnosis of MIS-C [16] . Evidence of subtle myocardial injury is significant, considering that majority of these patients have no previous cardiovascular history. This is especially true with re-opening of school and sport events and poses a significant challenge for cardiologists and pediatricians in terms of return to play recommendations. Although, there is no single tool/test which can be used universally to determine presence and degree of myocardial injury, CMR has been used successfully in patients with acute viral myocarditis to detect inflammatory changes. It is unclear when the inflammatory process ends but in general, waiting at least 3-6 months to test before resumption of sports has been the general recommendation. In athletes with myocarditis even when the inflammation has resolved, they are still at risk for arrhythmias due to myocardial scar [17] . We postulate that since there is growing evidence that MIS-C is a type of post-infectious myocarditis, CMR could be an extremely valuable follow-up tool for the evaluation of subtle myocardial damage and scarring. We therefore aimed to investigate medium-term cardiovascular outcomes of MIS-C using CMR.",

Each of these echocardiographic parameters were collected at peak of illness during admission, at 6 weeks and 6 months following discharge. Left ventricular systolic function was graded in this study based on the LVEF as follows: normal function -LVEF > 55%, mild dysfunction LVEF 45-54%, moderate dysfunction LVEF 35-44% and severe dysfunction < 35%. This was measured using the Simpson's bi-plane method [19] . Mitral regurgitation (MR) was classified as none, trivial, mild, moderate, and severe based on qualitative assessment and the width of the vena contracta. Pericardial effusion was similarly graded as none, trace (< 3 mm), mild (3-10 mm), moderate (10-20 mm), and large (> 20 mm). The coronary abnormalities were graded as follows: normal coronaries, prominent without ectasia (borderline Z scores ranging between 1.8 and 2, with prominent echogenic walls), dilation (Z score 2-2.5), mild aneurysm (Z score > 2.5-5), moderate aneurysm (Z score 5-10), and giant aneurysm (Z score > 10) based on AHA/ACC guidelines for management of patients with Kawasaki Disease [20] . A patient was considered to have diastolic dysfunction (yes or no) if at least two parameters (E/A, e', E/e', or left atrial volume) were abnormal. The mitral inflow E/A Doppler profile was considered abnormal if the E and A waves were fused or if the E/A ratio had a Boston Children's Hospital Z score > 2.0 [21] . The e' velocity and E/e' ratio, either septal or lateral, were considered abnormal if had a Boston Children's Hospital Z score > 2.0. Left atrial volume was calculated using area length method. An indexed left atrial volume of > 34 ml/m 2 was considered abnormal.",

Although the details of the CMR technique are not available in this study, the authors report the absence of persistent edema or evidence of fibrosis. Short-term CMR results have also been reported in 19 patients with MIS-C by Bartozsek. et al. with a median follow-up of 3 months [27] . The cohort consisted of patients with either troponin leak or decreased LVEF. No evidence of abnormal T1 or T2 signal values using parametric mapping was reported in this study. However, using T2 signal intensity ratio, one patient was diagnosed with myocardial edema. In addition, no evidence of LGE was seen.",

In contrast to Barries et al. and Bartozsek et al. our study does not report any evidence of ongoing myocardial edema. We postulate that most of the patients are expected to have resolution of acute myocardial injury and edema by the time CMR is performed 6 months after the diagnosis. It is however difficult to derive an inference with a small number of patients in each cohort. In addition, there is variability in the CMR techniques used with some of the studies using parametric mapping and others using T2 signal intensity ratio. Absence of a control, such as in ours, is also a recognizable contributor in differences in the results of abnormal tissue characterization across the studies. Nevertheless, it would not be unreasonable to assume that a vast majority of patients in whom there is no evidence of active myocardial injury by biochemical markers or echocardiogram findings, the presence of myocardial edema would not be very unlikely and false positives should be considered.",

In each one of these patients the LVEF was 54% and might be labeled as low normal or borderline abnormal and this variability across the studies is probably not very clinically significant. It is interesting to note each one of these patients had moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction in acute phase. More importantly, although there is echocardiographic evidence of normalization of LVEF within 6-8 weeks of diagnosis, true volumetric measurements of systolic function may be slower to recover than we think, with subtle abnormalities lasting up to 6 months.",

            "text": "One of the highlights of our study is persistent epicardial LGE in as many as 15% of the patients at 6 months. This did not correlate with the degree of troponin elevation during the illness. We postulate that this represents scarring from previous myocardial injury, analogous to acute viral myocarditis. None of the other studies reporting short-term and mid-term outcomes based on CMR results have reported LGE. Blondiaux et al. report CMR findings in four patients during hospitalization or within 2 weeks of discharge and even in this subgroup, LGE was not observed [28] . The authors of this paper go further to postulate that this is due to the fact that LGE is observed usually in acute viral myocarditis where there is evidence of myocardial necrosis followed by scarring as opposed to MIS-C which is a postinfectious myocarditis, and there is no significant component of cytotoxic myocardial necrosis. Rather inflammation and edema manifest as abnormal tissue characterization on CMR without clear focal fibrosis by LGE. We believe that although this may be true in a subset of patients, this does not completely explain the paradigm of cardiovascular manifestations in MIS-C. There is a significant number of patients with slow recovery of systolic ventricular function and abnormal diastolic function and this group may have direct cytotoxic myocardial injury and present as abnormal LGE findings, as described by Aeschlimann et al. [26] . In addition, whether in this inflammatory milieu, abnormal myocardial perfusion from coronary artery abnormalities/ coronary steal contributes to additional myocardial damage is not clear. And these findings highlight the importance of the 6-months follow-up CMR, in diagnosing subclinical myocardial damage, and provides new insights into the natural history of MIS-C. In addition, we believe that although there is no strong evidence to adequately guide clinician based on CMR findings in MIS-C, patients who have evidence of myocardial fibrosis, and particularly with systolic or diastolic function might benefit from a longer and closer follow-up than patients with normal CMR. Interestingly, level of troponinemia or LV dysfunction in the acute phase had no relationship LGE in the follow-up CMR.",
