The trial lasted 6 months. Its main end-point, reduction of aortic calcifications, was not met. However, the patients receiving sodium thiosulphate displayed a significant reduction in their iliac artery calcifications, according to a validated score, while calcifications increased, in the meantime, in the patients on placebo. The favourable effect was not limited to the iliac arteries, since in treated patients arterial stiffness and carotid intima-media thickness tended to decrease and there was no increase in cardiac valvular calcifications. The latter parameters displayed a significant difference between treated and untreated patients. The data, as the authors state, are widely scattered, and statistical significance is \"just met\", if statisticians allow a layman's definition, for the main result of decrease in iliac calcifications (\u2212 137 \u00b1 641 versus 245 \u00b1 755; P = 0.049). It is therefore quite far from being a perfect trial. However, it is an important study, not because of its superb design, or its outstanding statistics, but because it introduces an important idea, and for the hope it brings.",

In our in-hospital dialysis ward in central France, where the median age is approximately seventy-four, and a high percentage of patients suffer from diabetes and/or obesity (median Charlson Index of 9), over 15% of the patients have experienced a minor or major distal amputation. In the last 4 years, ten patients experienced one episode of calciphylaxis and were treated with sodium thiosulphate. As in the study being discussed here, no severe side effects were found, provided dialysate sodium had been adjusted to avoid overload. In addition to the two studies cited in the paper, in which, respectively, eighty-six patients were treated for 4 months and twenty-two patients for 5 months, both reporting positive results without relevant side effects, we were able to retrieve three further studies that, albeit with different deigns, reported, once more in the absence of relevant side effects, a positive effect on arterial stiffness (in twenty-four patients randomised for receiving treatment for 5 months [4] ), leg pain related with vascular calcifications (18 heavily calcified patients, treated for 6 months [5] ), and coronary artery calcifications (17 patients treated for 3 months [6] ). In one further study, in which sodium thiosulphate was added to the dialysis fluid, a \"positive impression\" was reported in six cases [7] . Significantly, the data are in keeping with the few, albeit convincing, animal and in vitro studies published.",
