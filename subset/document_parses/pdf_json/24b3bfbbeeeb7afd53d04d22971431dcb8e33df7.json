Moreover, if some variants of concern have increased transmissibility or virulence, the importance of efficient public health measures and vaccination programs will increase. The global response must be both timely and science based. I n addition to continuing to track the emergence of new variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are four major priorities for the global response to variants of concern (Table 1). These priorities, which involve scientific approaches for evaluating existing vaccines and developing modified and new vaccines, are to determine whether existing vaccines are losing efficacy against variants, to decide whether modified or new vaccines are warranted to restore efficacy against variants, to reduce the likelihood that variants of concern will emerge, and to coordinate international research and the response to new variants, both in general and in relation to vaccines, through the World Health Organization (WHO).",

Many research groups are sequencing virus isolates and sharing these sequences on public databases such as GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data). 1 This collaboration helps scientists track the ways in which the virus is evolving. In order to help monitor and respond to the evolving pandemic, it is important that all countries increase the collection of virus isolates for sequencing and sharing. A SARS-CoV-2 risk-monitoring and evaluation framework is being developed and continually improved by the WHO to identify and assess variants of concern. This Reduce the risk that additional variants of concern will emerge Promote public health measures (e.g., masking, social distancing, and vaccination) to reduce viral transmission Avoid the use of treatments with uncertain benefit that could drive the evolution of variants framework, which involves enhanced surveillance, research on variants of interest and variants of concern, and evaluation of the effect of variants on diagnostic tests, therapeutic agents, and vaccines, will assist in global decision making regarding changes in vaccines that may be necessary. Variants of concern with increased transmissibility are contributing to the reversal of the decreases in Covid-19 case counts that occurred in many countries earlier this year. 2 The B.1.1.7 (or alpha) variant of concern increases viral transmissibility 3 and is emerging as an increasingly common variant. The P.1 (or gamma) variant may cause severe disease even in persons who have been previously infected, although definitive information is lacking. 4 The B.1.351 (or beta) variant is less easily neutralized by convalescent plasma obtained from patients infected with previous variants and by serum obtained from vaccinees than the prototype virus on which vaccine antigens are based, 5 and preliminary evidence (based on data from post hoc subgroups in placebo-controlled vaccine trials) suggests reduced efficacy of some vaccines against mild or moderate disease caused by this variant. [6] [7] [8] Additional variants that are responsible for many deaths, such as B.1.617.2 (or delta), 9 continue to emerge. So far, there is no good evidence that currently identified variants of concern evade the most important vaccine effect -that of prevention of severe disease. Table 2 describes key properties of and mutations in five selected variants. The fact that a few key amino acids in the spike protein have changed independently in variants identified in various parts of the world indicates that these are convergent changes and suggests that vaccines that incorporate these selected residues could cover several variants.",

While existing vaccines are being deployed, clinical data can be sought not only from carefully planned observational studies, but also from randomized trials of vaccines versus placebo, of one vaccine versus another, or of different vac- cination regimens (e.g., different doses, numbers of doses, and intervals between doses). In areas where the vaccine supply or delivery capacity is limited, instead of letting operational decisions determine the order in which people are vaccinated, making first vaccine doses available to some of the target population on a randomized basis could provide useful information about efficacy against major variants. This is especially true if the numbers of participants who undergo randomization are large enough to allow assessment of \"hard\" end points such as hospitalization or severe disease.",

In some populations, random assignment of the vaccination date or location might be built into public health programs, and persons who become eligible for vaccination (according to vaccine priority groupings) could be randomly assigned to receive appointments to be vaccinated with a longer or a shorter gap between doses or to receive one vaccine or another. This strategy might allow many hundreds of thousands of persons to undergo randomization with little cost to the vaccination program and with little or no disturbance of the existing vaccination capacity ( Fig. 1 ). At the opposite extreme of trial size, if any vaccines were known to have the potential to prevent Covid-19 even when administered after an exposure to SARS-CoV-2, relatively small, randomized studies of postexposure prophylaxis could provide important insights about vaccine efficacy (or relative efficacy) against different strains.",

Nevertheless, in areas where several variants are cocirculating and some but not all of the population has been vaccinated, carefully designed observational studies of the distribution of viral genotypes among cases in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons could yield fairly reliable estimates of relative vaccine efficacy against various variants. Such studies should account for potential confounding if the level of vaccination is correlated with the relative prevalence of variants across sites. Observational stud-ies could also detect loss of protection against variants of concern in previously infected persons.",

Now is the time to plan for the development of modified vaccines that could protect against vaccineresistant variants, because such variants may well emerge. Planning should include the effect of vaccine modification on timelines for vaccine supply and rollout. Studies of modified vaccines (i.e., vaccines in which a new antigen is delivered through a vaccine that has already been shown to be effective against previously circulating viral variants) should address the ability of these vaccines to elicit responses in persons who have not previously had an immunologic response against SARS-CoV-2 and in previously vaccinated persons. Changes in the in vitro neutralization of circulating strains by vaccine-induced antibodies may not imply waning effectiveness. Although neutralizing responses may not be reliably predictive of vaccine efficacy, striking differences may well provide sufficient support for regulatory decisions. For example, the magnitude of the immune response against one or more variants of concern after a person has received a modified vaccine could be compared with that against the prototype virus after a person has received the original vaccine that is known to be effective. Assessment of neutralizing responses against several variants of concern and against the prototype virus may help to determine whether more than one vaccine (or, ultimately, a polyvalent vaccine) is needed.",

Variants of concern with resistance against natural or vaccine-induced immunity would probably supplant previously circulating strains only if this immune evasion capability resulted in increased fitness, including transmissibility. Given the emergence of immunityevading variants even before vaccines were broadly deployed, it is hard to implicate vaccines or vaccine deployment strategies as the major drivers of immune evasion. However, prolonged viral replication in the presence of partial immunity in immunocompromised persons or circumstances in which rapid transmission of high titers of virus occurs (e.g., crowded living conditions 23 ) could have contributed to the development of variants that can at least partially escape human immune responses. The use of antibody-based treatments (e.g., monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma) in circumstances in which they are of limited or undemonstrated efficacy may further contribute to the evolution of variants of concern that could evade not only these but also other antibody responses. 24 Partially effective interventions may therefore encourage viral evolution. In addition, the larger the number of infected persons, the greater the chance that new variants of concern will arise. Hence, effective public health strategies such as social distancing, the use of masks, and the targeted use of effective vaccines that reduce both infection and transmission can help to limit viral evolution.
