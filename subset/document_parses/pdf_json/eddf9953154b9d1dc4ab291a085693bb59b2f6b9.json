In order to improve the level of ideological and political education in universities and accelerate the popularization of ideological and political education, an integrated model of ideological and political education in universities based on multivariate data analysis is proposed. Taking the development of ideological and political education as the basic goal, while analysing the inevitable requirements of the integration model, the main classification criteria of the ideological and political education research objects are clarified, and the research on the education integration model is completed. College education. On this basis, the principle of integration processing is proposed, and various data attributes of ideological and political education in colleges and universities are defined. Then, combined with the mapping conditions under the integration mode, a comprehensive environment of ideological and political education based on multivariate data analysis is established. With the aim of grafting the ideological and political education model, we explore the development methods of ideological and political education in colleges and universities, determine the implementation law of ideological and political education for continuous and harmonious development, and propose constructive methods to develop the integrated model of ideological and political education in colleges and universities.",

To some extent, it is different from traditional colleges and universities' ideological education, but it actively serves all tasks related to students. Summarizing the development of ideological and political education in universities, this application mode has the following development characteristics. First, the development of ideological and political education in colleges and universities has a strong breakthrough. The improvement of integrated technical level breaks through the limitations of traditional ideological and political education and provides more favorable conditions for the in-depth development of ideological and political education in colleges and universities. Compared with the limitations of traditional behavioral education, ideological and political education in colleges and universities has better broken the role restrictions between educators and college students, paid more attention to equality between the two, and thus more respected the subject status of the educated. Make it better for interactive communication. The educating and guiding function of online ideological and political education in colleges and universities has benefited more [6] . Secondly, colleges and universities are the places where the density of students is the greatest. College students can not only learn from vast behavioral data, expand their horizons, and gain insights, but also relax and entertain themselves physically and mentally. Therefore, they are highly sought after by college students. Finally, the guiding role of the development of ideological and political education in universities is obvious. The integrated education information is complex and diverse, the level is uneven, and the negative influence of disseminated negative speech on ideological and political education in colleges and universities must not be underestimated. It is precisely under such a development model that the development of ideological and political education in colleges and universities has always faced severe challenges. Applied issues.",

Compared with other educational organizations, although ideological and political education in universities has been in a relatively rapid development mode, it is still in its infancy, and a relatively complete research system has not yet been established for this type of development mode. Personality is the basis for the stable formation of the outlook on life and values. Only when a person's three outlooks are unified can they have a stable value concept and a stable psychological basis for life values. Human values must be unified and stable, which requires a person's psychological process and personality form to be unified and stable. Otherwise, split personality can only produce the concept of split [7] . Personality is the inner psychological basis for the formation of a specific world outlook and outlook on life. The world view is an understanding of the world. Although the correct world view comes from the correct theoretical guidance and learning, if there is no benign personality form as the internal psychological basis, external instillation will be difficult to play a role. The integrated model is the main driving force for the formation of specific moral qualities. Personality has qualitative characteristics. Therefore, once a personality is formed, a person will have a corresponding internal texture. Different textures will adapt to different moral tendencies, and a benign personality is easy to establish a benign moral quality. Of course, these basic roles of personality are not absolute, but relative. At the same time, they also interact and change with people's values, world outlook, life outlook and moral consciousness [8] . Therefore, personality has both unity and stability, as well as differences and variability. These characteristics also determine the difficulty of developing a benign personality. In short, the personality state can be said to be the subtle, concealed and primitive state of ideology and morality, while the ideology and morality are often the development, shaping, maturity and clear personality expression (Table 1) .

A significant advantage of parallel coordinates is that it has a good model foundation, and its projective geometric interpretation and duality characteristics allow it to express the projection information of high-dimensional data in multiple low-dimensional subspaces simultaneously [10] . But the integration of parallel coordinates mainly focuses on the visualization of the original ideological and political data, not on the specific university data analysis task. Because a point-line transformation is used in parallel coordinates, it is easy to produce view aliasing, that is, over-drawing problems. This problem is especially serious when the number of samples in the ideological data set is large. When the goal of integrated data analysis is pattern recognition, the most concerned thing is not all the information of each sample itself, but the difference between classes. That is to say, it is not necessary to visualize all the integrated data samples, and only the ideological and political samples with a special contribution to the classification can be visualized. For multiple linearly separable cases, the integrated vector set is a subset of the ideological data vector. The integration vector refers to all the ideological and political education samples located on the extreme edge of the training set, that is, the samples located on the convex hull of the training set. In fact, the integration vector is the convex vertex of the sample set. Therefore, using the integrated processing algorithm to crop the ideological and political data training set samples and using the integrated vector of the training set as the representative of the training set to draw parallel coordinates can reduce the view aliasing problem of parallel coordinates and facilitate the observation of ideological and political integration Data structure and feature information to distinguish multiple categories.

This point-to-point physical mapping relationship integrates parallel coordinates and scattered point coordinate systems into the same integrated framework. This multivariate data set is equivalent to integrating dual coordinates and parallel coordinates in the same model environment, so it is called Parallel dual data collection.

According to the needs of college students and the needs of problem solving, purposeful and targeted knowledge grafting is conducive to the knowledge innovation of ideological and political theory courses. By using this concept to cultivate reliable successors and qualified builders for socialism. For ideological and political education in colleges and universities, personalized learning is based on the individual characteristics and development potentials of learners, and adopts a suitable way to fully meet the individual needs of learners. The integrated model brings a huge amount of information resources. Students can obtain different information and knowledge according to their own needs. Although the manifestations of these information are different, this expands, expresses and elaborates the internal diversity of knowledge to a certain extent. Conducive to the individual needs of learners with different learning abilities and styles. At the same time, the multi-education transmission mode brought by multi-data analysis can also teach students according to their aptitude. In this way, students can freely choose a virtual or hybrid multi-learning environment, which greatly improves the learning efficiency (Fig. 2) . ",
