All adverse events during the 12-month period required observation without any intervention.

The clinical manifestation typically starts with night blindness (nyctalopia), followed by the progressive loss of peripheral vision (tunnel vision), until the patients become legally blind [2] , usually during the third or fourth decade of life. To date, RP has been associated with more than 100 genes [3] . Each gene plays an important function in the phototransduction cascade, ciliary transport, or visual cycle. Mutations in one of these genes might result in a lack or defect of functional protein in the cascade, eventually aborting the entire process. The mutation-dependent approach, such as gene therapy, employs viral vectors to deliver the therapeutic gene to the target cells to restore the defective gene function. However, this approach will only be effective if performed in the early stage of the disease, when the target cells are still present [4] .",

            "text": "Recently, advances arise in the use of stem cells as treatment modalities for retinal diseases, including RP. Several stem cell-based treatments are in phase I or I/II clinical trials and registered in clinicaltrials.gov. Considering the low immunogenicity and ease of isolation and expansion, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) become a promising candidate for retinal cell therapy [5, 6] . Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) are among the most prominent sources for retinal cell therapy trials. The primary benefit of MSCs is the paracrine protective effect toward the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors. MSCs spontaneously produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), nerve growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, which act as tissue regeneration factors. MSCs also produce immunomodulatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), which inhibit the inflammatory reaction of the cells during disease progression. Additionally, an interesting treatment alternative involves the stem cell-free approach [7, 8] . An in vitro study evaluating the MSC secretomes found that they possessed neuroprotective properties toward the retinal structure and neuropreservative effects delaying the photoreceptor cell degeneration [9] . These effects are promising for further development of cell-free treatment strategies to minimize the unwanted effects from stem cells. Nevertheless, further studies are required to identify the safety profiles and mechanisms of action of these secretome components.",

At least three clinical trials with published results evaluated the safety of intravitreal injection of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells. Overall, the stem cell products and delivery procedure are considered safe although a complication of fibrosis formation in the vitreous cavity had been reported [12] . Moreover, there were noticeable improvements of visual functions at 3-6 months during patient follow-up [12] [13] [14] . Taken together, safety data from up-coming clinical trials are highly necessary to verify the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapy for RP.

Minimal cystoid macular edema (CME) occurred in one participant in group 1 at month (M) 3 and persisted until the last follow-up at year (Y) 2.5 (Fig.  6c, d) . We noticed a slight displacement of the IOL toward the temporal side of the study eye, with the IOL optic still in the visual axis, in two out of five participants with IOL, from groups 2 and 3, which started at M8 and M6, respectively (photographs not shown). The last mild AE was observed in a participant in group 1 who demonstrated localized flat choroidal detachment at the superotemporal quadrant of the study eye at M9. The ultra-widefield retinal imaging displayed that the choroidal detachment was slightly elevated at Y5 (Fig. 6e) . The ultrasound demonstrated double-peak reflectivity in the A-scan with anechoic suprachoroidal space in the B-scan, indicating fluid accumulation (Fig. 6f) .

We documented two AEs. The first one happened at Y3M4, when a participant from group 2 experienced sudden vision loss in the study eye after waking up in the morning. Upon immediate evaluation, we found diffuse vitreous hemorrhage, which obscured fundus details. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed to remove the vitreous hemorrhage (Fig. 7a) . Intraoperatively, we observed thick fibrous membrane along the vitreous base at the superotemporal quadrant. The fibrous membrane wrapped around the capsular bag; thus, the IOL and the capsular bag had to be removed. This membrane also caused traction to the peripheral retina with retinal dialysis superotemporally. Histopathological evaluation of the membrane demonstrated a membranous sheet of bone surrounded by ciliary tissue. Higher magnification showed calcified matrix sheets with parallel alignment and regularly distributed osteocytes, indicating osseous metaplasia or osseous heterotopia in the ciliary body (Fig. 7b) . After the operation, the retina was attached and the BCVA was restored to the same level as the time of enrollment (logMAR 1.22 and 1.20, at baseline and Y5, respectively).

Specifically, when compared to the baseline, the BCVA in group 1 improved at M2, 5, 7, and 8, reaching statistically significant improvements at M7 (P = 0.04) and M8 (P = 0.02), slowly regressed after M9, and reached the baseline at M12. In group 2, the BCVA improvement started after M5 and persisted up to M9, then slowly declined until it reached the baseline at M12 (Fig. 8c) . Conversely, in group 3, although the BCVA significantly improved immediately at M1 (P = 0.04), it returned to the baseline at M6 (Fig. 8d) . We noted that both the study and fellow eyes showed the similar trends of the BCVA changes, especially in group 1 and group 2, although the study eye showed higher improvements. A pair match with the fellow eye was also tested and we did not observe a statistically significant difference in the BCVA between the study and the fellow eye, although some participants reported subjective improvements of vision on activities of daily living.

In the present study, the autologous BM-MSCs were selected. Since the MSCs exhibit the lower potential of differentiation compared to RPCs, ESCs, and iPSCs, this stem cell type has a lower risk of differentiating into undesired tissues, teratoma formation, immune rejection (even from allogeneic sources), and ethical concerns to its use [20, 21] . More importantly, many studies demonstrated the promising potential of the MSCs for retinal disease therapy. Among other hypotheses, the paracrine effects, including tissue regeneration and immunomodulatory factors, are wellaccepted benefits of the MSCs [7, 8, 22] . Theoretically, these secreted soluble factors could slow the degeneration of the neuroretinal cells with the possibility of restoring their functions [20] . More recently, the stem cell-free approach using the secretory components from MSCs, including the soluble mediators and extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles), are under investigation [9, 23] .",

Among those MSCs, BM-MSC is the most commonly used, with the longest track record, source of human MSCs [24] . In this study, we utilized the autologous BM-MSCs to avert the host-versus-graft rejection which might occur after an allogeneic transplantation. However, recently, remarkable advancements Retinal appearances during the study period. A1 Fundus montages demonstrate generalized pigmentary changes with heavy bone spicules and macular involvement. A2 and A3 images, representing months 6 and 12, respectively, show similar appearances. B1 Fundus autofluorescence images describe the central hyper-autofluorescence surrounding the island of hypo-autofluorescence in the macula, where autofluorescence indicates the presence of normal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). B2 and B3 images represent months 6 and 12, respectively, with no remarkable changes. C1, C2, C3 The optical coherence tomography indicates central subfield thickness at baseline, month 6, and month 12, respectively. The study eye and fellow eye show similar appearances. Images were retrieved from a study participant in group 1 were reported in the use of allogeneic transplantation of Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs, which showed promising safety and efficacy results in clinical trials as a candidate cell therapy for retinitis pigmentosa [25, 26] . There are several administration routes of MSCs that had been validated. Intravenous is among the easiest and the least invasive route. This method is most common for MSC delivery. However, this route requires a large number of MSCs since MSCs could circulate to various organs and be trapped within the small capillaries [27] . Therefore, this route might not be suitable for retinitis pigmentosa. Subretinal transplantation would deliver the cells directly under the retina in an immunoprivileged site, but the procedure is more complex and invasive. Moreover, this route is restricted with the number and volume of MSC product. Intravitreal transplantation of MSCs could overcome the volume restriction and the procedure is less invasive. The MSCs administered via this route hardly pass the internal limiting membrane of the retina [28] , but the secreted paracrine factors from MSCs could [29] . Recently, a phase 3 clinical study reported the superior safety and efficacy profile of subtenon MSC injection since this cavity is hypovascular and the secreted growth factors could pass through the choroid to the subretinal space [25] . 6 Adverse events in the study participants receiving intravitreal injection of BM-MSCs. a Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of a study participant with posterior synechiae (indicated by arrows). b After treatment with the cycloplegic agent, the posterior synechiae were released, leaving some residual pigments adhered on the lens surface (indicated by the arrow). c Optical coherence tomography imaging in a study participant at baseline and d at month 3 with mild cystoid macular edema (indicated by the arrow). e The ultra-widefield retinal imaging shows choroidal detachment (indicated by arrows) at the superotemporal periphery. f Ultrasound imaging demonstrates double-peak reflectivity (indicated by arrows) with anechoic suprachoroidal space",

After the injection, participants experienced an increase in cells and flare in the anterior chamber, indicating the occurrence of inflammation. The mildest inflammation happened in group 1, which received the lowest number of cells. However, this inflammatory reaction was transient and all values returned to the baseline by 14 days in all groups. It is acceptable that the IOP might increase immediately after an intravitreal injection. Although there were no significant differences among the study groups, we observed the largest mean difference of IOP (1 h after the injection vs baseline) in group 3, which received the highest number of BM-MSCs. Nonetheless, the IOP in all groups returned to the baseline within 1 day. Throughout the study period, no participant experienced a rapid decline in the visual acuity or visual field. Fundus evaluation also revealed stable features of the disease. These results indicated the safety of the procedure and nontoxicity of the stem cell products used in our study toward the RPE and photoreceptors. We noticed a statistically significant improvement of the mean BCVA compared to baseline in group 1 at M7-8 and in group 3 at M1. Although there were no significant changes in group 2, we noted the BCVA improvement during M6-8. This effect was transitory and the BCVA returned to the baseline at M12. We managed to follow 12 participants beyond the study period and discovered that the BCVA relatively declined with time (data not shown). These indicated that BM-MSCs might help to slow down the disease progression in a certain period of time. The re-injection of BM-MSCs or an alternative substance, such as exosomes, should be further evaluated.",

Since in all cases the displacement was directed toward the temporal side, it was thought to be caused by the traction force to the zonules and lens capsule near the injection site. However, one of these three participants had IOL displacement in both the study and fellow eyes. Therefore, the findings in this participant might be related to the RP condition itself rather than the BM-MSC injection. Interestingly, we did not observe any lens subluxation in those participants with crystalline lenses. RP is known to increase the risk of IOL subluxation due to zonular insufficiency or weakness [30, 31] . The intravitreal injection procedure might aggravate the weakness of the zonules or cause fibrosis formation, resulting in traction on the zonules and lens capsule [32] . Since the capsule after IOL insertion is more pliable than that of the crystalline lens, this might cause the IOL to be pulled easier. It is important to evaluate the lens position prior to the intervention.",

            "text": "After the 12-month period, we observed severe AE in one participant (8.3%), who developed osseous metaplasia along the vitreous base. However, after surgical treatment, the retina was attached and the BCVA returned to the same level as prior to the injection. A previous study reported intraocular ossification occurring in 4.8 to 18% in the enucleated eye cases [33, 34] . Possible causes include retinal detachment, chronic inflammation, trauma, presence of bone morphogenic proteins, calcification of drusen, and the differentiation or paracrine effects of mesenchymal stem cells [35, 36] . This participant experienced a slight displacement of the IOL to the temporal side at M8 after the BM-MSC injection, which was probably attributed to the fibrous formation near the injection site. Chronic inflammation, which underlies the pathogenesis of RP progression, involves the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), into the vitreous [37] . These proinflammatory cytokines might support the transdifferentiation of fibroblast into osteoblast, thereby causing osseous metaplasia in the vitreous. The MCP1 is also known to be involved in recruiting inflammatory cells and increasing fibroblasts. Another plausible explanation is the paracrine activities of the BM-MSCs, which might stimulate osteogenic differentiation of fibroblasts, rather than the differentiation of the MSCs into osteocytes themselves [38] . Future studies warrant the thorough evaluation of early signs of fibrosis formation following intravitreal injection of MSCs.",

We found no direct correlation between the increased number or severity of AEs and the higher dose of the BM-MSCs. Mild AEs, such as flat choroidal detachment and minimal CME, and posterior synechiae happened in participants in groups 1 and 3, respectively. Slight IOL displacement occurred in one participant in all groups. Osseous metaplasia, which was the only serious AE in this study, arose in a participant in group 2.

Most of the phase I studies enrolled smaller number of participants. We recruited 14 participants in a span of 8 years. In the early phase of the study, we enrolled the participant one by one to ensure that the intervention was safe prior to escalating the doses of the cells. Most participants who completed the 12-month period continued to visit our institute and were continually monitored. We found two AEs after M12, which became our consideration for the next phase of the study, although it was difficult to exactly determine whether these AEs were caused by the intervention, the BM-MSC product, or the RP disease progression. Since our study employed larger numbers of participants with advanced RP and had longer follow-up time, we observed several AEs that were not reported in earlier clinical studies. To minimize the AEs that could appear in future clinical trials, several points need to be carefully considered. First, patient recruitment should be performed with particular assessments of the lens position and the zonular support. Second, the quality control standards of the stem cell products must be maintained. Lastly, participant follow-up should include a thorough examination of the peripheral retina using ultra-widefield OCT to detect early changes in that area. In the future, a cellfree therapy approach could be considered. Nevertheless, we provided the evidence of the feasibility of the intervention as well as the longer-term safety of the intravitreal injection of autologous BM-MSCs for RP.",

One participant with a serious adverse event was successfully managed surgically. We established the short-term efficacy, reflected by stable conditions and slow disease progression. It is noteworthy that some participants reported the improvement in the quality of life after receiving this intervention. Among the three different doses of BM-MSCs, the lowest dose showed the most promising safety and short-term efficacy profiles. Therefore, in future studies, autologous BM-MSC injection with the dose of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per eye will be explored in participants with less advanced RP to provide a clearer efficacy profile of this intervention. Most importantly, to minimize the risk of AEs that could happen in the future, the quality control of the stem cell product, participant follow-up, and comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation will be exclusively performed.",
