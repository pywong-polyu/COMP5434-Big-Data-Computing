Patients and methods: This survey was conducted from August 1 to 31, 2021. The participants were 512 nurses, 198 nurses of whom were from temporary NAT sites in communities/towns in Zhangjiajie city, and the rest were from NAT sites inside hospitals. The psychological status and the job burnout were measured by the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Scale (MBI-GS). Results: The prevalence of the SCL-90 positive result and job burnout were 49.4% and 61.1%, respectively. The factors influencing the psychological status of nurses included the contact with COVID-19 patients or their body fluids and specimens, working seniority and the duration of working in the frontline of the novel coronavirus. The independent risk factors of nurses' job burnout included the following four factors. Firstly, the contact with COVID-19 patients or their body fluids and specimens (OR=150.95, 95% CI=(44.87,507.77), P<0.001). Secondly, five to nine years of working seniority (OR=8.91, 95% CI=(3.59,22.14), P<0.001). Thirdly, 10 to 19 days (OR=2.63, 95% CI=(1.19,5.82), P=0.017), 20 to 29 days (OR=161.31, 95% CI=(49.48,525.9), P<0.001). Lastly, more than 30 days (OR=92.05, 95% CI=(33.88,250.14), P<0.001) of working in the frontline of the novel coronavirus. Conclusion: The prevalence of psychological problems and job burnout were at a high level among nurses working in the frontline of the novel coronavirus in different NAT sites. The nurses from NAT sites inside hospitals and temporary NAT sites in communities/ towns in Zhangjiajie city had an equal risk of developing psychological problems and job burnout. Interventions need to be immediately implemented to promote psychological well-being and decrease job burnout of nurses.",

[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Poor sleep quality and stress are common during the COVID-19 crisis. 13 Approximately, 60% of both frontline healthcare workers and non-frontline healthcare workers have poor sleep quality combined with moderate-severe stress. 13 A multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the depression in healthcare workers was significantly associated with the profession. 14 The anxiety in healthcare workers was significantly associated with their age, profession, and residence. 14 The stress in healthcare workers was significantly associated with their age. 14 The job burnout of this population was also reported. 15 The nurses working in the frontline of the novel coronavirus from NAT sites inside hospitals and temporary NAT sites in communities/towns in Zhangjiajie city during the Delta variant outbreak may also have these problems. Because they faced the high risk of being infected by the Delta variant and the fear of infection and death. These factors might make them suffer from huge psychological stress and even cause a sense of job burnout. In addition, compared with the nurses from NAT sites inside hospitals in Zhangjiajie city, those from temporary NAT sites in communities/towns in Zhangjiajie city were exposed to more stress and their psychological problems might be more serious since they not only bear the high risk of infection but also suffer from the open-air and high-temperature environment. However, little is known about the differences in the psychological state and job burnout between these two groups of nurses.",

The participants were nurses working in the frontline of the novel coronavirus from NAT sites inside hospitals and temporary NAT sites in communities/towns in Zhangjiajie city during the Delta variant outbreak. We went to the hospitals in Zhangjiajie city and selected nurses working in the frontline of the novel coronavirus from August 1, 2021, to August 31, 2021 by the snowball sampling method. There are some eligibility criteria about our participants: firstly, they were nurses working in the frontline of the novel coronavirus from NAT sites inside hospitals and temporary NAT sites in communities/towns in Zhangjiajie city from August 1, 2021, to August 31; secondly, they had all passed the training of NAT of the novel coronavirus and had more than 2 years of working experience; thirdly, they gave full informed consent prior to their participation. There are 105 items in the two questionnaires we used (MBI-GS and SCL-90), so our sample size should be at least 5 times of the number of items, that is, 525 participants. We received 554 questionnaires in total and excluded 42 ineligible responses. The valid response rate of the present study was 94.1% (512 out of 544).",

The sense of uncertainty and out-of-control caused by the COVID-19 might increase the risk of developing psychological problems. Besides, direct contact with COVID-19 patients or their body fluids and specimens was an independent risk factor of job burnout for nurses (OR=150.95, 95% CI=(44.87,507.77), P<0.001). We did not find similar findings in other studies. Job burnout positively correlated with psychological status, thus, the effect of contact with COVID-19 on job burnout is likely mediated through its impact on the psychological status.",

According to the Areas of Worklife (AW) model, 29 which explains job burnout in terms of person-job imbalances, job burnout occurs when the imbalances take place in workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values. In the present study, the continued high workload might be the most relevant factor to explain that the prevalence of job burnout among nurses increased over time.",

The reasons for this hypothesis were as follows: The nurses from temporary NAT sites in communities/ towns in Zhangjiajie city were faced with higher workloads and harsh work environment, which may cause more psychological problems and increase job burnout. But we did not find the difference in the psychological status and job burnout between the two groups. The reasons may be that they had a greater sense of control of the situation and higher personal accomplishment. Besides, the public and social media spoke highly of these heroes who put themselves in harm's way. They were regarded as the most admirable people in the new era.

The nurses from temporary NAT sites in communities/towns in Zhangjiajie city and those from NAT sites inside hospitals in Zhangjiajie city had an equal risk of developing psychological problems and job burnout. The factors associated with nurses' psychological status and job burnout included working seniority, the history of direct contact with COVID-19 patients or their body fluids and specimens, and the duration of working in the frontline of the novel coronavirus. Interventions need to be immediately implemented to promote psychological well-being and decrease job burnout of nurses. Equal attention should be provided to nurses who put themselves in harm's way to support the temporary NAT sites in communities/towns and those who worked in the frontline of the novel coronavirus inside hospitals in Zhangjiajie city. Besides, special attention should be given to nurses with less than 10 years of working seniority, those who have worked in the frontline of the novel coronavirus continuously for more than 30 days, and those who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients or their body fluids and specimens.",
