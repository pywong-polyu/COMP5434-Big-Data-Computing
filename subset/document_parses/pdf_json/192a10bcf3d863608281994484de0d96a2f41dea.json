In the studies included in this review, three estimates from two studies found that 40-60% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are the result of transmission whilst pre-symptomatic, with a smaller contribution from asymptomatic infections. 24 25 The consistency of the findings is reassuring because the studies used different methods. Of note, Ganyani et al. used data about the serial interval to derive their estimate and did not use assumptions about the proportion of asymptomatic infections. 24 Our finding differs from a modelling study that has been interpreted as showing that up to 90% of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is asymptomatic. 30 Li and colleagues found that 86% of infections were defined as undocumented, 30 but it appears that this proportion is a composite of asymptomatic infections, infections that were symptomatic and diagnosed but unreported, and infections that were mild and undiagnosed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 124, "end": 126, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 611, "end": 616, "text": "24 25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 869, "end": 871, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1013, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1093, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": ".
