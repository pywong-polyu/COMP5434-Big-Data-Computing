Firstly, a Granger causal analysis is developed and reveals that past values of the IPTCC contain information that allow for a better prediction of hospitalizations or deaths than that obtained without the IPTCC. Finally, a vector autoregressive model is estimated to evaluate the dynamic response of hospitalizations and deaths after an increase in the IPTCC. It is estimated that a 10-point increase in the IPTCC causes hospitalizations to rise by 2.9% (90% CI 0.7-5.0) one week after the increase, and by 4.1% (90% CI 2.1-6.4) and 4.4% (90% CI 2.5-6.3) in the two following weeks. Over ten weeks, the cumulative effect is estimated to reach 20.1%. Two weeks after the increase in the IPTCC, deaths are estimated to rise by 3.7% (90% CI 1.6-5.8). The cumulative effect from the second to the tenth weeks reaches 15.8%. The results are robust to the inclusion of air pollution indicators.",

Most notably, the peaks in hospitalizations and deaths correspond to periods during which the IPTCC is high on average. Conversely, throughout spring and summer, hospitalizations, deaths, and the IPTCC are low. We also notice that the IPTCC is more volatile than the epidemiological series. Lastly, the evolution of the IPTCC seems to precede those of hospitalizations and deaths, which is probably due to the time between contamination, the incubation period, and a possible worsening of the disease.",

It is worth noting that taking the logarithm of hospitalizations and deaths allows, through regional fixed effects u i , to account for regional heterogeneities such as area, population, or density, which are roughly stable over the considered period. Moreover, including the region-specific time trend \u03b4 i .t with the log specification may capture a potential exponential growth of the disease spreading that could be region specific. Finally, using \u03b7 t allows taking into account the national interdependence (including any seasonal effect) of the disease spreading across regions. Preliminary diagnostics (panel unit root tests) rejected the null hypothesis of unit root for the de-trended variables (with a region-specific linear trend).

The sensitivity and robustness of our findings were assessed by analyzing the dynamics under alternative proxies for climate conditions and by considering the environmental pollution as a possible interfering variable. Firstly, it seems that alternative indicators for climatic conditions are less effective than the IPTCC to capture the effect of climate on the epidemiological dynamics. We exemplified this with two alternative indicators. Initially, we used a 'false' IPTCC index computed using aberrant target values for temperature and humidity. The 'false' IPTCC reaches 100 when the temperature reaches 30 \u00b0C and the relative humidity 20%. We obtained that hospitalizations no longer respond significantly to the indicator (see Fig. A4 in the Supplementary Materials). Then, we replaced the IPTCC by a normalized temperature index computed as T n = 100 \u00b7 e \u2212(T\u22127.5) , and therefore abstracted from the humidity variables. We obtained that, after three weeks, the response of hospitalizations becomes significant, but the effects are less clear and the magnitude is less important (see Fig. A5 in the Supplementary Materials). This confirms that, although partly correlated, temperature and humidity are both useful when combined in a single indicator to evaluate the effects of climate on epidemiological variables.",

In particular, environmental pollution, whose effect on respiratory diseases is well established (see e.g. 22 ) , has been recently shown to be correlated with the prevalence of COVID-19 ( 23-25 ). We have thus estimated extended versions of our models in order to take into account the evolution of the environmental pollution. More specifically, we have collected weekly averages of the concentration of atmospheric particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ), of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and of ozone (O 3 ) for a subsample of the regions we considered. We found that, at the 5% level of significance, we still cannot accept the null hypothesis of no Granger causality from climate conditions to either hospitalizations or deaths (Table A3 in the Supplementary Materials). Moreover, the dynamic responses of hospitalizations and deaths to a 10-point increase in the IPTCC are qualitatively similar to those displayed in Fig. 2 (Fig. A6 in the Supplementary Materials). Our results are thus robust to the inclusion of environmental pollution variables in the models.
