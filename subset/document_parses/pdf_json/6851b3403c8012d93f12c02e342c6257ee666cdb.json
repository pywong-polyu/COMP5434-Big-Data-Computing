Two days later, a colleague of these two cases developed mild respiratory symptoms, including runny nose and loss of sense of smell, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on March 17 th , 2020. Cluster #2 included 11 study participants, including 6 with asymptomatic infection. Patients of this cluster were those came to a local bar on March 14 th , 2020, and individuals with whom they subsequently had contacts (Figure 5). We identified a transmission chain involving an asymptomatic participant (patient #19) who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 on March 23 rd (Ct value of NTS: 24, and saliva: 28). Subsequently, a contact of this case (patient #22) was positive for SARS-CoV-2 on March 25 th (Ct value of NTS: 23, and saliva: 34), although this not develop symptoms. Furthermore, on March 27 th , a contact of both patient #19 and #22 (patient #27) presented with cough and sore throat, with positive NTS for SARS-COV-2. Additionally, patient #26, contact of patient #22, who was also a contact of patient #19, was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 on March 30 th , also without any symptoms.
