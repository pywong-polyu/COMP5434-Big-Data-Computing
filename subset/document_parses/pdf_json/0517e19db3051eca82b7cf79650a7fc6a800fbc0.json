Alterations in deep tissue hemodynamics are the hallmark of a variety of pathological conditions such as cerebral hypoxia, septic shock, peripheral artery disease, and even tumors, to name a few. The authors propose an extension of their previous work on single-wavelength diffuse speckle contrast flowmetry (DSCF) technique to diffuse speckle contrast flow oximetry (DSCFO), by adding a second wavelength sensitive to oxygenated hemoglobin to their system. Their apparatus is low cost and compact, consisting of two laser diodes and a small CMOS camera. The use of the camera improves the sampling rate while reducing the cost and dimension of the probe. The authors utilize optical phantoms to demonstrate their system sensitivity and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as hemodynamic changes during artery cuff occlusion in five individuals.",

(URL: https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.26.1.012706) proposed a low-cost and wearable CMOS-based device for high-resolution spatial diffuse reflectance imaging of skin conditions. This system improves on current spatially resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (srDRS) systems by not requiring expensive instrumentation, and fiber optics. This approach circumvents the limitations of short source-detector separation by utilizing a fiber optic plate. Three light emitting diodes (LEDs) were used at 511, 615, and 660 nm. The system is controlled by a custom circuit board connected to a computer. The novel apparatus performance was compared to off-the-shelf clinical devices: an StO2 sensor and a PtCo2 sensor. Measurements were conducted on 20 volunteers and generally good agreement was found between the low cost and commercial-grade devices (5% to 10% discrepancy in StO2 characterization was found depending on the analysis method), although two separate analysis methods were necessary at this stage. The authors point out the sensitivity of their system to skin tone, which is alleviated by the use of skin-matched (dark, light) reference samples.",

Remote and noncontact estimation of heart rate variability has many applications. These measurements commonly suffer from low SNR, due to the absorption properties of skin as well as unpredictable illumination and movement artifacts. The author's approach improves on current methods by utilizing an automatic adaptive bandwidth filtering and discrete energy separation to estimate the instantaneous frequency of an image photoplethysmography signal.

(URL: https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.25.11.112704) proposed a new application for implantable sensors: the measurement of tissue oxygenation during radiotherapy in combination with Cherenkov-excited luminescence imaging (CELI). Studies have shown that oxygen enhances the radiobiologic damage improving cancer treatment outcome while the opposite has been shown in hypoxic environments. The sensor consists of an agarose matrix with a PtG4, an oxygen quenched dendritic molecule. It was tested both in phantoms and in an in-vivo tumor model undergoing fractionated radiotherapy. Finally, Spink et al. (URL: https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.26.6.062708) demonstrated the design and realization of a high optode-density wearable continuous wave diffuse optical probe for the monitoring of breathing hemodynamics in breast tissue. This work is motivated by the need to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) treatment response for locally advanced breast cancer patients. The probe was fabricated on a flexible 6 cm x 6 cm printed circuit board populated with 32 LED (750 and 850 nm) and 16 optical silicon detectors. Validation was conducted with both optical phantoms and in vivo with a cuff occlusion experiment as well as in a breast study of healthy volunteers.",
