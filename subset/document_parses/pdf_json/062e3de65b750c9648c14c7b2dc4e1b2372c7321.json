To preserve it, cancer centers had to rethink the modality of working and communicating , with telemedicine being as the simplest solution. Suddenly, it became the keynote of our profession, representing an immediate resource to achieve social distancing [4] . Wherever the Art of Medicine is loved, there is also a love of Humanity, Hippocrates once said. How can telemedicine afford that? The model of oncologic care has changed over time towards the current patient-centred approach, where physicians became patients' first allies in the war against cancer. During the current pandemic, such model has regressed to a physician-centred care, which still deserves the credit of ensuring essential oncologic assistance regardless of the circumstances. But how can you trust your ally without shaking hands? This historical moment has taught us the concrete benefits of virtual care, enhancing the speed and efficiency of the clinical activity. However, oncologists should be aware that commitment to care cannot renounce the warmth of human connection, as neither delay nor isolation is allowed in oncology.",

The strength of multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDT) lies in a closeknit group where each member contributes through different backgrounds, vision and professional trajectory. In this historic time, MDT had to turn into virtual e-meetings. Similarly, real-time webinars with in-hospital, national and international colleagues allowed to bridge the gaps in the management of COVID-19 and build roadmaps to fight an unexpected, unknown enemy. Telemedicine also prevented discontinuity of ongoing clinical trials, impulsed scientific cooperation and favoured the massive scientific production we are ultimately witnessing. Even major medical congresses decided to bet on the virtual modality to make their annual flag-events happen[3]. The innovations forced by the pandemic have undoubtedly brought a positive contribution to the Science of Medicine. However, it would be a shameful mistake to forget that empathy and compassion still represent the fundamental values in the Art of Medicine, especially during the cancer journey",
