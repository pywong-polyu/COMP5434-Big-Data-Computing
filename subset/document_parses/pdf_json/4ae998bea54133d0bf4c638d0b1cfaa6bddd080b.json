Arising from the COVID-19 outbreak is the partial restrictions on economic activities and shutdown of national boarders, that resulted in the decline of global output. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised downward, the global output to \u2212 4.9 percent in June 2020, which is 1.9 percentage points below the April 2020 forecast (IMF, 2020a) . The outlook for 2021 and 2022 is projected at 6 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, due to additional fiscal supports and massive rollout of vaccines (IMF, 2021) .

Studies have shown the dominance of jobs that are non-amenable to remote work policy in low-income countries (Hatayama et al., 2020; Hensvik et al., 2020; Dingel & Neiman, 2020; Bartik et al., 2020; and Avdiu and Nayyar, 2020) . For instance, Dingel and Neiman (2020) investigated jobs that cannot be performed from home and documented significant variation across cities, countries, regions and industries. The authors found that 37 percent of jobs in the United States can be performed from home and account for 46 percent of all wages, while variations in jobs that can be done at home ranges from 40 percent in Sweden and United Kingdom, 25 percent in Turkey and Mexico, and below one-third of US level in emerging economies and lower-income countries. The study identifies jobs in retail, hotel and restaurants, agriculture, construction, and production as industries that workers cannot work remotely.

The breakdown of critical global supply chain and the practice of hoarding medical supplies in some countries prompted the re-evaluation of interconnectedness of global economy. COVID-19 revealed the vulnerabilities of extreme specialization or single-source provider. Global supply chain is extremely long and vulnerable to disaster. Sforza & Steininger (2020) also examined the role of global production linkages in the transmission of a pandemic shock across countries and found 14 percent contraction in output in countries that impose restrictions on their labour force and more pronounce output drop for countries with severe restrictions. The authors also found that restriction of trade partners decreases output by 0.2 percent due to global value chain.

The authors attributed their findings to absence of resilience benefit from renationalizing international supply chains. In their view, \"eliminating reliance on foreign inputs increases the reliance on domestic inputs \u2026 since a pandemic-related lockdown also affects domestic sectors\". The findings of Bonadio et al (2020) tend to supports the argument for regionalized value chains. For instance, the authors found that \"to unilaterally allow workers to return to work, while the rest of the world remains in lockdown \u2026 most of the GDP impacts of the lockdown are domestic, and these are reversed by reopening\", and \"even unilateral reopening of large economies like China, US, Germany, or Russia would have a noticeable impact on others\" (p.3). This suggests that global supply chain exacerbates the vulnerability of small economies external shocks, especially during pandemic. Under global supply chain arrangement, severe lockdown or restrictions in large economies contracts the GDP of small economies, irrespective of whether they (the small countries) impose restrictions or not, because of their dependence on the global supply chain. In a case where the rate of spread and health challenges of a virus is uneven, the adverse effect on output contraction becomes high in low-income economies even when they are not affected by the virus. Adopting regionalized value chain such as 'buy it where you build it' eliminates the susceptibility of the supply chain to natural disaster in addition to eliminating shipping cost, time, and additional inventory. We define regionalized supply chain as reorganizing manufacturing into smaller segments to help deliver consumer demand and expectation, improve response rate to market changes, the velocity and agility of supply chains, and increase visibility (Saunders, 2019). Regionalized supply chain also promotes technology and skill transfer. Organizations can assist in building a pandemic-proof global society by eliminating barriers associated with delivery and efficiency, when they mobilise products closer to the consumer and breakdown complex global supply chains into regional or smaller locations.",

While renationalization of international supply chains focuses on the dismantling of the global supply chains in favour of protectionism or isolation of supply chains, regionalized supply chains is a modification or decentralization of the global supply chains to promote efficiency in supply chains through foreign direct investment and the creation of more multinational companies. The challenges of global supply chains manifested in the distribution of vaccines, especially to low-income countries. For instance, Fierce Pharm (2021) reported that \"AstraZeneca set up a globetrotting supply network for its COVID-19 vaccine to deliver doses around the world, but it hasn't tapped regional producers to ease delivery shortfalls elsewhere\". The decision of AstraZeneca to partner with Serum Institute of India to enhance the production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine to the rest of world is a good example of regionalize supply chains.

China deployed suites of innovative technology such as the use of artificial intelligence for checking respiratory blockages and medical screening, big data to identify cluster of infected people, 5G to track movement of people and transportation system, and the heath barcode to identify affected people (Shaw et al., 2020) . Extending the significant progress recorded globally in the use of virtual health care to other sectors of the economy, especially, the education sector is extremely important. This requires urgent investment in financial technology, global solidarity, and partnership to achieve inclusiveness. Currently, most rural communities in middle-and poorincome countries do not have access to information on how to prevent the spread of the virus, because of lack of internet access. In Africa, and other poor countries, most public schools were shut down and the students were at home, because of poor investment in information technology and lack of access to internet. Knowledge driven globalization should codify educative information in electronic gadgets and made available through internet to all social class.

Designing such mutually beneficial and inclusive globalization agenda for the African Union requires multilateral efforts and international cooperative action.",

This involves implementing housing and transport design that prevents the ease of disease spread from human to human. National governments may enact legislation against encroachment into natural habitats, regulate or phase-out the sale of live animals, encourage citizens to implement improved sanitary conditions, promote rodent controls, and vaccinate animals for common zoonotic infections. Promoting a paradigm shift from global supply chain to regionalise supply chain to eliminate vulnerability of low-income countries to the challenges of global supply chains during pandemic, and massive investment in information technology to promote the virtualization of all sectors of the economy. Global solidarity and cooperation are extremely important in order to promote inclusiveness, as experiences have shown that shifting these transformation agenda to national government, especially in middle and poor countries will only exacerbate the increasing level of inequality in the current global order.",

For instance, some of the policy direction identified in this paper have been captured in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Goal 9 which is to \"build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\" could be expanded to addressed virtualization of economic activities, while Goal 11 which is to \"make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\" addresses the redesigning of urban characteristics to slow the spread of infectious diseases. In February 2020, AU adopted the 'Digital Transformation Strategy' to narrow and ease the digital divide in Africa. Already, there is strong advocacy for eco or green accounting that focuses on accounting framework that quantifies the money value of destroying the ecosystem, as well as ensuring that the rights of people, animals and micro-organisms are preserved in a mutually beneficial manner in the ecosystem. Promoting active and global investment in these areas as well as active dialogue will immensely assist in mainstreaming a pandemic-proof globalization programme.",
