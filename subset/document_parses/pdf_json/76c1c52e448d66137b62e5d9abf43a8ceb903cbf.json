This research article helps to determine the impact of climate on the lethality of this disease. Air quality index and average humidity are selected from the family of climate variables, to determine its impact on the daily new cases of COVID-19-related deaths in Wuhan, China. We have used wavelet analysis (wavelet transform coherence (WTC), partial (PWC), and multiple wavelet coherence (MWC), due to its advantages over traditional time series methods, to study the co-movement nexus between our selected data series. Findings suggest a notable coherence between air quality index, humidity, and mortality in Wuhan during a recent outbreak. Humidity is negatively related to the COVID-19-related deaths, and bad air quality leads to an increase in this mortality. These findings are important for policymakers to save precious human lives by better understanding the interaction of the environment with the COVID-19 disease.",

Generally, COVID-19 patients exhibit common symptoms, including sore throat, cough, high fever, myalgia, and fatigue . The transmission and spread of COVID-19 may be affected by numerous factors, including medical care quality, climate condition (humidity, temperature, and air quality, etc.), and population density (Wang et al. 2020b) .

Second, we employed a novel methodology that extracts events localized in time. The Wavelet technique is robust to the abnormalities in data and determines bidirectional (positive and negative) co-movements at the same time in different time-frequency frames. Third, another difference lies in the humidity-related observations; where other studies are using maximum and minimum values to calculate average humidity , we have collected hourly observations and then converted into daily averages. Finally, yet another unique feature is that we have combined air quality index with humidity for studying COVID-19 mortality which is absent in other studies of this kind.",

A large red area on the bottom and a small circle above that, contain arrows pointing right and downwards showing an in phase coherence between AQI and COVID-19 deaths, running from AQI to COVID-19. This implies that an increase in AQI (bad air quality) is leading to more deaths caused by COVID-19 in the long term, remaining within our observation time period. Other circles are showing arrows pointing towards various directions implying a mixed association during those specific time-frequency bands. Figure 6c shows the WTC between average humidity and air quality index in Wuhan. Two significant and large red areas are observable inside the black linings. One island is in the frequency band of 4-8 during second to third weeks of observation while the other lies in the frequency range of 8-16 and onwards during third to seventh weeks in the time domain. The arrows inside these islands are pointing towards left and upwards dominantly, indicating an out phase coherence, running from air quality index to average humidity. This implies a negative relationship between humidity and air quality in Wuhan during our observation period. Figure 7a shows the results of the PWC, involving COVID-19 deaths, average humidity, and air quality index in Wuhan. In simple words, it describes the wavelet coherence between COVID-19 deaths and average humidity after taking out the common effects of air quality index on the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and humidity. Small red areas inside the black linings show the coherence in frequency bands of 0-4 and 4-8 during the fourth week of observation. If we compare Fig. 7a with the WTC results between COVID-19 deaths and humidity from Fig. 6a , we notice some differences between the two figures.

Red-colored islands lie almost at similar time-frequency spots in both of these figures. This implies that COVID-19 deaths have little if any role in the coherence (relationship) between humidity and air quality index in Wuhan. Figure 7e demonstrates the PWC involving AQI, COVID-19 deaths, and humidity is significant because there are visible differences as compared to Fig. 6b showing WTC results between AQI and COVID-19 deaths. This implies that humidity plays a vital role in the coherence (relationship) between AQI and COVID-19 deaths. A few small red-colored islands on the Fig. 6 Wavelet coherence transform of COVID-19, HUM, and AQI upper side, in the frequency band of 0-4 show a significant coherence between AQI and COVID-19 deaths even after controlling for the effects of humidity during the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth weeks of observation. Figure 7b shows the result of the MWC involving COVID-19 deaths in Wuhan as a dependent while humidity and AQI as independent variables. Specifically, it tells us how good the combined effect of humidity and AQI predicts COVID-19related deaths in Wuhan. A thin vertical bar on the right side of the figure shows different levels of association tied up with different colors. As it moves from bottom to top (blue to red), the strength of the relationship keeps on increasing, reaching its maximum level of 1 represented by the dark red color. Large and small islands with red color inside and clear black outlining are scattered within different time-frequency combinations. These red shapes show the combined predictive power of humidity and AQI in determining the number of COVID-19-related deaths. As evident from the figure, humidity and AQI show significant MWC with COVID-19 deaths in all frequency bands during different periods of observation. In the middle of the observation period, during the fourth, fifth, and sixth weeks, a large island is found at the bottom of the figure, indicating a significant coherence. Another two islands are prominent on the top of this island during the fourth and Overall results reveal a significant coherence between humidity-AQI and COVID-19-related deaths in Wuhan. Figure 7d presents MWC results taking humidity as a dependent while AQI and COVID-19 deaths as independent variables. A significant coherence can be observed in frequency bands of 4-8, 8-16, and onwards during the second and fourth, second-third, and third-seventh weeks of observation indicated by large red-colored shapes. Two small islands can also be found in the 0-4 frequency band during the fourth and eighth weeks of observation. Figure 7f of MWC shows AQI as a dependent while humidity and COVID-19 deaths as independent variables.

More red areas are present in 4-8, 8-16, and onwards frequency bands during the second-sixth, third-seventh, and fourthfifth weeks. Overall results present a noticeable coherence between AQI and the combination of humidity and COVID-19 deaths. Dark red color inside these island type shapes can be compared with a level of matching association between 0.80 and 1.00, according to the vertical bar on the right side.",

A rise in average humidity leads to a decrease in COVID-19-related deaths as revealed by the WTC at varying time-frequency spots. Deteriorating air quality resulted in more COVID-19 deaths in the medium run during our observation period. The air quality index further had an important role in the negative coherence between humidity and COVID-19 deaths. Bad environment conditions caused more COVID-19-related deaths, not only directly but also indirectly by exerting a negative influence on the role of average humidity. These results imply that COVID-19 patients should be provided with a clean environment for an early and smooth recovery.",
