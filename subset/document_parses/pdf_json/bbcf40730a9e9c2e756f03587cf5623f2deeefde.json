For others, it is a loose group amounting to little else. Cutting a path through this confusion, this article poses and answers a series of interlinking questions. First, is the Quad purposeful? What do its members expect to achieve through its existence? If it possesses an identifiable purpose-which we claim is a shared need to meet the longterm challenge posed by China-why is the Quad's format highly informal? Does this informality reflect the growing cascade of informal IGOs in international politics? We argue that although informality is a geopolitical necessity, it also provides a workable format for four diverse members to coordinate security activities whilst maintaining equivocal positions vis-\u00e0-vis China.",

Scholars, pundits, and policy analysts frequently predict the development of a formal US-led regional alliance emerging in the region to counterbalance China's power. For those expecting a replay of the rigid alliance systems of the Cold War (Woodward 2017) , a future NATO for the region is all but inevitable. Indeed, for many commentators, the informal quadrilateral consultation, commonly known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (hereon called the Quad), formed of Australia, India, Japan, and the USA, is a proto-alliance of this kind (Bhaskar 2020; Bhatnagar 2021) . 1 Chinese officials have at times denounced the Quad in roughly this way (MOFA, China 2018) .",

Rather than a proto-alliance, the Quad has hitherto displayed the markings of another minilateral-an extension of the bilaterals and trilaterals that have proliferated in the region since the early 2000s (Envall and Hall 2016) . 3 To be sure, the level of attention the Quad is currently receiving in media and policy circles stands in marked contrast to its organizational maturity, which remains largely stillborn. Although there are signs that the Quad's format has become more routinized since it was revived in 2017 (Panda 2020a; He and Feng 2020) , no budgets have been allocated, no agreements signed, and joint statements have only recently been issued. Few obligations or commitments-tacit or otherwise-are placed on its members. Instead, the Quad's purpose is ambiguous, its format highly informal, and its activities largely non-controversial (Zala 2018; Tow 2019) .",

We argue here, in contrast, that the Quad's informality currently suits members because it places minimal obligations on parties and allows avoidance of issues in which the members hold divergent positions. This half-way house-below the threshold of alliance but certainly more than a 'talk-shop'-provides a format for an emergent four-power alignment that facilitates coordination across various areas of common interest, especially in the maritime domain, without curtailing the autonomy of each sovereign member. The Quad emerged from a common security concern, China. As such, its lack of typical alliance behaviour-formal commitments and clear diplomatic statements that reference the threat-is an effort to signal amity among the four nations, outwards and to each other, without stoking tensions with Beijing. We make no policy judgements about the wisdom of this approach; we merely claim that this explains in good part why the Quad currently functions as it does.",

We first summarize key arguments about the growing prevalence of informal intergovernmental organization (IGOs) 4 in international politics and synthesize these with theoretical discussions about International Organizations (IOs), including formal alliances. Against the backdrop of a cascade of informality in IGOs, we then examine the Quad's evolution, the interests of its members in forming a quartet, and thirdly the character of members' interactions. We then assess what the preceding theorygrounded and empirical analysis tells us about the organization's direction of travel, i.e. towards or away from deeper institutionalization and greater formality. The concluding sections discuss what the Quad says about the place of informal IGOs in international politics and, more narrowly, in the Indo-Pacific.",

Indeed, IGOs formed for the 'high politics' of meeting the challenge of a perceived threat have possessed greater informality-that is, lower levels of institutionalization and looser structures-than is commonly supposed (a point recognized by Walt 1987, 1) . The Cold War NATO alliance and Warsaw Pact were highly formal IGOs with their own bureaucracies, command structures, and military forces permanently stationed under them. But as Posen observed (2014, 30) , historically, 'this kind of institutionalization has not occurred until well into a war, if at all'. Indeed, states often prefer informal associations when presenting a united front against an identified threat (Wilkins 2012) . Coordinated diplomacy within 'soft security institutions' such as a strategic partnership (at the bilateral level) or alignment featuring two or more states (Wilkins 2019 ) is taken to convince the target that a formal alliance would or, at least, could form should hostilities break out. The Anglo-French 1904 Entente Cordial is a prime example of this type of soft security institution. 6 If rational functionality is a principal driver in forming IGOs, why would states prefer informality for the high stakes of security? Is greater institutionalization not desirable for IGOs formed to meet a threat? Formality, for instance, ensures unity of 6 The 1904 Entente Cordiale between Britain and France was highly specific and formalized in terms of what the two sides signed up to vis-\u00e0-vis each other, it only went as far as to coordinate diplomatic efforts towards German's rising power. Confusingly, an entente can also mean efforts to reduce conflict between parties aligning. purpose is regularly and systematically pursued. Furthermore, deeper institutionalization in IGOs created for confronting a threat buttresses the reliability of members and hence the credibility of deterrence. Indeed, explicit, formal security agreements, usually in the form of a treaty, 'adds elements of specificity, legal and moral obligations, and reciprocity that are usually lacking in informal alignments' (Snyder 1997, 8) . Formality and deeper institutionalization are also thought to increase the combined military performance of the IGO if an actual conflict occurs (Morrow 1994; Smith 1995; Fearon 1997) .",

In short, states can coordinate in meaningful ways without written provisions. 7 States might see useful functionalities in informality when banding together to confront a common, long-term security threat. First, informality means members can strategically align without having to sacrifice any autonomy to a supranational entity. Second, with decentralized structures, informal IGOs do not demand discipline or a strict hierarchy. This allows for 'trust-based' relations among members who might otherwise be resistant to rule-taking from stronger parties with whom they may have conflicting issues. Informal IGOs provide a flexibility that allows members to coordinate actions without concomitant obligations. To be sure, formal rules and processes are important for organizations to function, but so are extra-legal practices. Third, the inherent ambiguity of informal IGOs' scope means that members can avoid close public scrutiny whilst at the same time sending general signals of members' alignment to the target adversary. The trade-off, however, is that such ambiguity may lead to misperceptions and perhaps suspicions about the IGO's real intentions.",

In this way, the Quad is inseparable from the extant strategic relations between Australia, Japan, and the US: a trilateral within the quadrilateral. Indeed, building on these firm Cold War foundations of ties, Australia, Japan, and the US, pioneered a three-way IGO called the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue (TSD) five years prior to the Quad's inception, in 2002. It was upgraded to the ministerial level in 2005. While largely a counterterrorism coordination forum to facilitate mutual strategies in reaction to the al-Qaeda attacks on 9/11 against the US, the TSD also included discussions about nuclear non-proliferation, with North Korea's missile programme topping the list. Worried that Washington's narrow focus on al-Qaeda would leave the Asia-Pacific theatre ignored, Japan and Australia used the dialogue and related efforts to seek a continuation of US strategic commitment to the region in the face of an increasingly powerful China.",

For example, Abe, attempting to revive the Quad circa 2012, emphasized what he termed a 'democratic security diamond.' 12 Coupled with New Delhi's growing power and complicated relations with Beijing, including numerous, festering border disputes, India is indisputably an attractive strategic partner for the TSD members.",

Yet, informal security coordination continued during what we term the Quad's occultation, often using experiences and templates from member states' previous multilateral actions. During the Quad's occultation, the Australia-Japan-India (AJI) trilateral held its first dialogue in 2015, with discussions about maritime security and freedom of navigation. 13 While each worried about a separate geographical location, the connections from the Bay of Bengal to the Pacific to the East China Sea meant the maritime security interests of all three states converged. But it was Beijing's increasingly assertive behaviour across the region that 'provided the glue' binding this trilateral together (Rajagopalan 2020). Tellingly, the trilateral moved the important Malabar joint naval exercise at this time to locations in China's backyard. 14 If China birthed the AJI trilateral and led to upgraded and increasingly high-profile Malabar exercises, Beijing's actions also rejuvenated the Quad and reified its existence for all four member states. The AJI trilateral and the TSD, with their overlapping memberships and growing experience in security coordination with China in mind, were the engines which drove the resuscitation of Quad 2.0 in 2017 ( 15 ).",

In April, it sent bombers into the Miyako Strait, between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Okinawa. Its navy deployed the Liaoning, its first aircraft carrier, through the Miyako Strait for exercises for the first time. In late Spring and early Summer, Chinese soldiers crossed into Indian territory in Galwan and Sikkim and fought pitched battles, as noted above. In October, two Chinese government vessels stayed in Japan's territorial waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands for over 48 hours, their longest single intrusion, to date. Australia, geographically more distant from China, suffered economic pressure on account of what Beijing termed Australia's 14 grievances; imposing customs taxes on Australian exports, targeting barley, wine, beef, and seafood. 23 By way of explanation, a Chinese government official told an Australian reporter: 'China is angry. If you make China the enemy, China will be the enemy' (Kearsley et al. 2020 ). Beijing's anger was reciprocated in New Delhi, Tokyo, Canberra and, significantly, Washington, which doubled down on its all-out trade war and war of words with Beijing, actions which continued across both the Donald Trump and Joe Biden administrations.",

The October 2020 Tokyo Summit was the Quad's first standalone meeting (previous ministerial and working group meetings occurred on the sidelines of summits). Significantly, three foreign ministers flew from Washington, Canberra, and New Delhi to Tokyo at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic for in-person meetings. This was quickly followed by a virtual summit in March 2021, that brought together the leaders of the quartet, to include Abe's successor, Yoshihide Suga, and the recently elected US president, Joe Biden, as well as another in-person meeting organized by Biden in Washington, D.C. in late September. These point to evidence that events since 2017 have made the Quad the go-to forum for coordinating high-level policy among the four Indo-Pacific partners. Nonetheless, while informality remains the Quad's most pronounced feature, the results of the leaders' summit are telling vis-a-vis shifts from informality to possibly more formality.",

In Tokyo, no formal joint statements were issued, reflecting a club-like informality akin to previous Quad summits, and demonstrating a continued resistance to institutionalization. Instead, all four states released their own statements, or readouts, separately. In contrast, at both subsequent summits, perhaps because of their higher-level and, thus, added significance, joint statements were released. This represented a marked departure from previous summits, but perhaps one more laden with symbolism than substance. The statements, for instance, offered a clearer agenda that touched on regional security issues, ASEAN's centrality, and vaccines. Yet, these ingredients were also found in the separate releases and tweets after the foreign ministers' meeting in Tokyo. What remained missing in all three cases were references to China. Indeed, after Tokyo, only the US mentioned China by name. At first blush, the specificity of then-US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, in naming and criticizing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) struck a note of defiance from Washington that was in stark contrast to the other three club members. Nevertheless, direct mentions of China from the US or the other Quad members did not resurface in either of the joint statements issued in 2021. These statements did include remarkably blunt (and nearly identical) sentences aimed squarely at Beijing: The Quad states will '\u2026 [f]acilitate collaboration, including in maritime security, to meet challenges to the rules-based maritime order in the East and South China Seas' (White House 2021a) and '\u2026 [w]e will continue to champion adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to meet challenges to the maritime rulesbased order, including in the East and South China Seas' (White House 2021b) .",

Instead, the release of four separate readouts in 2020, and two joint leaders' statements in 2021, demonstrated the continuation of the mutually constitutive process of 'virtual understanding' to take the Quad forward. This reciprocally built context will complement all four states' national security interests (Panda 2021b , See footnote 15). 24 At a ministerial meeting held in February 2021, for example, Japanese Foreign Minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, recalled how he had conveyed Japan's serious concerns to the other Quad members about a recent Chinese law that explicitly allows the Chinese coast guard to use weapons against foreign ships that it sees as illegally entering its waters. After the meeting, Motegi also noted that all four members had voiced their strong opposition to any attempts by China to alter the status quo in the Indo-Pacific region by force (Kyodo News 2021).",

First, it defuses opposition within the Quad, particularly from India to more overt forms of security cooperation and military links. Second, it nods at India's emphasis on a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific (Panda 2021b; Hakata and Cannon 2021a, b, 9-10) . Third, and relatedly, it further distances the Quad from the more formal NATO model and provides an accent on multi-faceted functionality. These three modalities point to perhaps the most salient feature of a Quad Plus mechanism: its plural, inclusive nature. For this reason, an expansion of its scope, or a shift in its priorities from pandemicinduced disaster relief to containing China, remains an unlikely scenario for many of the potential partners in the forum. Almost all participating Quad Plus nations have elaborate economic ties with Beijing, even if they are wary of China's coercive, unilateral, and destabilizing actions (Grossman 2020) .",

But this may occur on a bilateral or trilateral level between the various parties rather than through a binding alliance structure or with a third party state as seen in the late 2021 creation of AUKUS, a trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Perhaps irrespective of the levels on which these strategic alignments occur (bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral/formal or informal), China is the glue that binds the Quad. This is the case whether Washington pointedly references the CCP as the problem or Tokyo speaks of upholding a rules-based order. Implicit in the Quad's emphasis and efforts to uphold a rules-based order is their position as both norm beneficiaries and norm upholders (Hatakeyama 2017) and, relatedly, their common agreement that China has no claim to dominate common seas and airspace across the Indo-Pacific. Stopping Chinese regional hegemony, then, smacks of containment in all but name. A danger emerges if either China is too big to contain or the quartet does not possess the wherewithal or will to pursue a joint containment strategy. It would seem that both possibilities are true.",

An overt focus on the Quad as a military organization to counterbalance China would have failed to enable the range of possible coordinated activities undertaken by the core members. It would have also hindered the integration of other states preferring, for the time being at least, to maintain a more equivocal position vis-\u00e0-vis China. There is simply not the will among the quadrilateral members or the felt need to enter into a more explicit and binding IGO for mutual defence. Instead, the Quad members have channelled their attention under the IGO to shared common interests-foremost China, but also pandemic recovery and other non-traditional security areas-in order to work on them, no matter how incremental the progress. They prefer informality as they believe it signals alignment without provocation and, more importantly, it works for everyone, albeit for different reasons. That it sends signals to both Beijing as well as the four club capitals is the point. Ambiguous or not, the Quad possesses political capital even if, as an informal IGO, it cannot yet effectively aggregate the power resources of the units. Rather, what it does is perform the vital function of identifying friends in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad communicates some degree of mutual support but leaves the members a fairly easy 'out' if things get too hot.",

These conclusions, however, do not preclude a more formal alliance arrangement emerging should China's actions become more overtly hostile and aggressive. The historical record reveals to us that balancing coalitions do not take full shape until aggressors have made significant conquests. Even so, parties will have to be reconciled to the idea that consolidating this emerging alignment will depend on toleration and perhaps even support for unshared interests, such as India's or Japan's territorial disputes with China. If the Quad solidifies and matures it will increasingly be viewed as hostile by Beijing, heightening tension in the region, which, in turn, will either spur the four to pull closer together or to seek cover under the shade of greater ambiguity and informality.",
