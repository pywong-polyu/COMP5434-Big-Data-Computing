Proportional allocation of samples was used to the randomly selected colleges, and a systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit the students. The data were checked for completeness, coded, entered into Epi-Data VS 3.1, and then exported into STATA\u2122 Version 14 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors. Factors were selected with the entry method. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the associations between variables and knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP).",

Approximately 71.4% correctly responded that the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Nearly half, 229 (42%) of the students approved that they had no concern of being infected with COVID-19. Moreover, most participants showed poor practices; more than half of the study subjects were not maintaining a physical distance. In multivariable analyses, people older than 25 years (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI; 1.2, 4.6) and those who lived in urban areas (AOR = 4.3, 95% CI; 2. 6, 15.8) were significantly more knowledgeable about COVID-19.

Moreover, as of July 17, 2020, there are a total of 52 cases and 1 death reported in Debre Berhan, which is the study area for this article. The pandemic also puts the whole educational system in to difficult situations; predominantly, undergraduate students represented a special group that was at the ages to get independence and freedom of life but with inadequate experiences. Consequently, their KAP were suggested to be significantly affected by the pandemic as evidenced from a short assessment survey, which needed to be explored. With this gap, little is known about undergraduate students' KAP. Given this fact, we aimed to assess the KAP of Debre Berhan University (DBU) students towards COVID-19.",

The working group regularly reviewed literature to select important characteristics and outcomes for inclusion. The development phase was conducted at Debre berhan University health science Collage and the pilot validation phase was conducted with nursing department students. We have also done a pretest from 5% of the student. The team members formed a working group that met via telephone or video conferences at least biweekly. The questionnaire consisted of four parts: 1) socio-demographics; 2) knowledge; 3) attitudes; and 4) practices of COVID-19. The second part of the survey assessed student knowledge about COVID-19, which included the symptoms of COVID-19-affected patients, transmission routes, precautions, and risk prevention. Participants were given three options per question: \"Yes\", \"No\", and \"I don't know\". Correct responses were given one point, while incorrect responses or \"I do not know\" were given zero points [15] . According to this study, \"adequate knowledge\" regarding COVID-19 means that the participant's score was above the mean score on knowledge questions. Conversely, \"inadequate knowledge\" was assigned to students who scored below the mean score on knowledge questions. In this study, Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the knowledge questionnaire was 0.83, indicating acceptable internal consistency [26] .",

We found that approximately 48% did not cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or tissue while coughing or sneezing, and 56% did not maintain a social distance of at least one meter between themselves and anyone who was coughing or sneezing [27] .

Importantly, nearly half of the study participants did not cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or tissue while coughing and sneezing. Moreover, more than half of the study subjects did not maintain a physical distance of at least one meter between themselves and anyone who was coughing or sneezing. Therefore, an increased effort should be made to improve the knowledge and practices of DBU students regarding COVID-19 prevention. We also recommended that the Ministry of Sciences and Higher Education [MOSHE], a zonal health bureau in collaboration with universities, implement health education programs about corona virus to university students and the wider community to address a gap in KAP towards the preventive measures of COVID-19. Social media should also work by providing timely and reliable data to students about COVID-19 KAP. A large population-based study also needs to be conducted to assess the community KAP level at large. The university in collaboration with the zonal health bureau also needs to prepare a rule a regulation on covering mouth and nose with an elbow or tissue while coughing and sneezing and to maintain a physical distancing.
