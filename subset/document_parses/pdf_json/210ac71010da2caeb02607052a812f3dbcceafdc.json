Formed in 2017 by five high-level isolation units spanning three continents, the experience of the Global Infectious Disease Preparedness Network (GIDPN) early in the course of COVID-19 provides a model for accelerating best practice development and improving decision-making in health emergencies. The network served as a platform for real-time, open and transparent informationsharing during unknowns of an active outbreak by clinicians caring for patients, by researchers conducting clinical trials and transmission and infection prevention studies, and by teams advising local and national policymakers. Shared knowledge led to earlier adoption of some treatment modalities as compared to most peer institutions and to implementation of protocols prior to incorporation into national guidelines.

During the first wave of COVID-19 in the spring of 2020, hospitals' approaches to clinical management and infection prevention and control (IPC) practices varied widely, but as evidence and best practices accumulated, outcomes significantly improved over time [1] . Earlier elucidation of best practices could have markedly reduced the extent and impact of COVID-19 spread in the spring wave, and future preparedness approaches should focus on mechanisms for achieving that goal.

A new infectious disease has emerged, on average, every year for the past 30 years [2] , while others have emerged in new geographic regions. Previous HCID outbreaks have underscored the occupational risks that healthcare workers assume when treating these patients, as they have exhibited significantly higher infection rates than the general population [3] [4] [5] [6] . As a result, special clinical units have been developed to mitigate nosocomial transmission and protect healthcare workers treating patients with these diseases.

The Singapore NCID team was able to provide particularly valuable information on how the government and community were managing the outbreak given the relative control Singapore had achieved when compared to neighboring countries. Even earlier, as multiple GIDPN members were at the forefront of receiving large groups of individuals repatriated from COVID-affected areas (e.g., cruise ships, medical evacuations), one of the first GIDPN calls during the response centered around the logistics of quarantine, isolation, testing, and identification of positive cases in these cohorts.",

Group members also agreed that inclusion of patients into RCTs should come at a high priority. As the pandemic progressed, all of the above agents were proven ineffective, validating the group's approach.

A conversation with the NCID team, which released a position statement on the subject in May 2020 [11] , influenced UNMC's decision to move to a time-based de-isolation strategy in early June 2020, which occurred prior to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. Conversations also provided advice and experience on how changes to this strategy were communicated and rolled out in other member units. Moreover, the group discussed optimal specimen types and yield according to duration of illness as well as presence or absence of pneumonia that informed diagnostic processes [12] .",

The value of such international clinical networking amid a global pandemic of a novel disease to the five GIDPN members cannot be understated. Frank conversations on early clinical and epidemiological characteristics and anecdotal evidence of the success of various therapeutics prior to availability of clinical trials informed clinical teams' decision-making within the local context (e.g., existing resources, surge situation). Member units authored some of the early COVID-19 hallmark studies related to clinical observations of patients, aerosol transmission, and epidemiological investigations, and often the design of these studies was shaped by early discussions within the network [9, 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .

Although many findings The global infrastructure of high-level isolation care has drastically changed in the last decade: the once infrequent, sporadic cases of HCIDs being treated in these specialized units has become an increasingly frequent occurrence, and many HLIUs have been established in the last A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 decade in anticipation of emerging infectious disease events to come. To date, as an international network of HLIUs, GIDPN has been leveraged to enhance treatment and management of patients with HCIDs through best practice and information-sharing and served as an invaluable resource during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the role HLIUs are likely to play in pandemics of novel or reemerging special pathogens that outstrip the national and international capacity of HLIUs. The units have clear value for early stages of such pandemics, but surge capacity must be addressed. We are at an optimal point in time, as the continued vulnerabilities in global health security are once again highlighted through the COVID-19 pandemic, to plan for these types of pandemics and how best to leverage HLIU expertise, experience, and national roles to increase HCID preparedness and capacity for the future. The value of such a network was highlighted during the pandemic; GIDPN and similar networks will become increasingly integral in enhancing local, national, and global preparedness for and response to future epidemics/pandemics.

Each of these units has extensive experience in treating patients with HCIDs, some of which include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), MERS, Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Lassa fever, and each plays a leading role in HCID preparedness and response in their respective countries; during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, all were designated treatment units for initial cases of COVID-19 in their respective countries (see Supplementary Material for a history and roles of HLIUs in their respective COVID-19 country-level response). GIDPN was formed in 2017 to share best practices, explore development of a clinical trials network and clinical response force, and ensure rapid information-and resource-sharing during outbreaks of HCIDs. The original five founding member institutions each have robust training programs, highly trained staff, advanced personal protective equipment (PPE) and PPE procedures, rapid response research platforms, emerging infectious disease clinical treatment protocols, and frequent exercises and drills to test and validate standard operating procedures. The collective experience and expertise of these units has led to significant contributions to national and international guidelines and best practices and improved public health and health systems preparedness. We detail GIDPN activities pre-COVID-19, lessons learned through rapid informationsharing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the value of such global networking during response to an emerging infectious disease event.",

The network initiated with international training initiatives and a series of Grand Rounds, in which each HLIU presented on their experience, challenges, lessons learned, and best practices to other network members. Representatives from member units observed and evaluated large-scale exercises conducted by other units. Training exchanges offered the opportunity for network members to present on their experiences to larger audiences in other members' countries, and representatives from several units conducted joint capacity-building training programs for viral hemorrhagic fevers in West Africa. In addition, network members participated in two global HLIU workshops: one organized by the US National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Center in 2018 on high-level isolation management and care, and the other organized by UNMC in January 2020, specific to transport and mortuary care for HCIDs. Informally, the expertise of the network also allowed GIDPN members that were redesigning their units or constructing new HLIUs to seek insight and recommendations into facility planning and HLIU construction. The expansion of the network in early years from formal networking events to informal engagements during training and exercises set the foundation for the transparent communications now inherent to the network.",

Moreover, the success of national systems of HLIUs in the US, Europe, and Asia serve as examples on which a larger international network could be built. An expanded network, comprised of GIDPN founding members, other highly experienced global HLIUs, and health facilities and systems in all regions of the world could serve as a platform to research and strengthen clinical and health systems preparedness in current and future partner countries and subregions. Such a network could develop and implement technical assistance both before and during outbreaks of HCIDs, develop standardized training for healthcare workers and health systems, provide mentoring and consultation services for expansion of isolation capacities, enhance research infrastructure at member institutions, and facilitate health emergency response research networks for real-time iterative improvement of HCID outbreak management. A wider global network of units and health systems, coupled with mechanisms for integration with national and international organizations for faster dissemination, could create a stronger line of defense against emerging HCIDs and future epidemics/pandemics across its network.",
