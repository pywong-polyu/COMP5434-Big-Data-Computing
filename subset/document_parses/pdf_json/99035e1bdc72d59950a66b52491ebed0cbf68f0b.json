In neonates of 12 domestic animals it is associated with consistent diarrhoea and dehydration. Cryptosporidium 13 infection begins with the ingestion of sporulated oocytes disseminated by carrier animals that 14 consistently contaminate the environment. Many diagnostic tests are available including 15 microscopy, antigen trap ELISA, but none of the diagnostic tests available currently cannot 16 differentiate between active and passive infection in the host. In the current study, to address this 17 challenge an mRNA based duplex TaqMan \u00ae probe PCR (dRT-qPCR) was developed to target 18 the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene and 18ssu rRNA gene in a single tube 19 that can detect metabolically active Cryptosporidial oocysts.

The mRNA transcripts are the 34 direct indicator of any actively replicating cell and especially in intracellular parasites it will help 35 decipher the infective stages of a lifecycle in the host, and hence the test was developed in a 36 reverse transcriptional format in a duplex mode. The currently developed diagnostic assay for 37 cryptosporidiosis was evaluated for sensitivity using Limit of detection (LOD). This diagnostic 38 test will act as a quantitative marker to aid in detecting active stages of Cryptosporidium 39 infection in neonatal goats and will eventually lead to better control strategies for managing 40 cryptosporidial infections in the future.",

Hence, a robust technique is 81 required that can able to differentiate the active oocysts from dead oocyst in passive infection. 82 In detail, the main aim of this study is to develop and standardize an mRNA based 83 Cryptosporidium spp.-specific real-time PCR assay using two important target genes viz. 18 84 small subunit ribosomal RNA (18SSU rRNA) and Cryptosporidium oocyst wall (COWP). The 85 18ssu rRNA gene is highly abundant in terms of genomic copies and it has high transcripts that 86 can increase the sensitivity of the assay, while the COWP is available only in transcriptionally 87 active live cryptosporidial oocysts. (13-23, 28-31). Hence, in the current study we report an mRNA based TaqMan\u00ae probe duplex real time PCR 89 that can able to detect the metabolically active Cryptosporidium oocysts from dead oocysts in 90 passively infected animals 91",

The mRNA transcripts are the 34 direct indicator of any actively replicating cell and especially in intracellular parasites it will help 35 decipher the infective stages of a lifecycle in the host, and hence the test was developed in a 36 reverse transcriptional format in a duplex mode. The currently developed diagnostic assay for 37 cryptosporidiosis was evaluated for sensitivity using Limit of detection (LOD). This diagnostic 38 test will act as a quantitative marker to aid in detecting active stages of Cryptosporidium 39 infection in neonatal goats and will eventually lead to better control strategies for managing 40 cryptosporidial infections in the future. 4 Diagnosis still plays a very important role because in neonatal animals many other diseases like 67 colibacillosis, rotaviral diarrhoea caused by group A rotavirus (GARV) and bovine corona virus 68 (BCoV) occurs commonly and there is a need to differentiate them or identify them collectively 69 in case of mixed infection. While coccidiosis occurs in weaned animals in later stages that might 70 perplex in the proper diagnosis. Microscopy is an excellent tool and can be highly specific but 71 requires expertise and experience in identification of the weak acid fast round oocysts from other 72 artefacts similar to them. Besides conventional microscopy and staining, molecular diagnostic 73 approaches like PCR are also gaining momentum Molecular diagnostic assays are usually 74 regarded as more sensitive compared to microscopy and serological diagnosis in human and 75 animals for the detection of Cryptosporidium in several studies (13-23). The molecular assays 76 are determined by the factors like stage of life cycle/infection as well as method of nucleic acid 77 extraction for targeting the Cryptosporidium spp. ( 24-27).",

However, it is difficult to diagnose 203 cryptosporidiosis alone from other major etiologies of neonatal diarrhoea complex in neonatal 204 animals including E.coli, Group A Rotavirus (GARV) and Bovine corona virus (BCoV). For 205 diagnosing cryptosporidiosis in animals faecal oocyst identification by modified Ziehl-Neelsen 206 staining acid fast staining is a preferred method. Although this method is enough to identify the 207 acid fast oocysts based on colour, shape and size, but it cannot provide details of the active 208 infective stages (33, 34). PCR is another method which is highly sensitive, specific and accurate 209 (if standardized), but cannot fix the aforementioned problem of identification of active live 210 oocysts from the passive or dead ones. Hence in the current study we have developed a reverse 211 transcription based TaqMan probe duplex real time PCR for simultaneous detection of two target 212 genes viz., COWP and 18ssu rRNA that would provide better detail on the active and passive 213 stages of cryptosporidial infections in neonatal goats.",

Therefore, many researchers used mZN 219 technique as gold standard method for the screening of large number of population because it is 220 much easier and non-invasive.

As per the copy number based standard curve, the RFU is higher for 237 18ssu rRNA because of the abundancy of the transcripts, while for the COWP gene the RFU is 238 relatively lower and is present in clinically affected neonates with active cryptosporidial 239 infection. Hence, there is a scope to decipher the active live cryptosporidal oocysts from the dead 240 ones. Transcriptional activity is present only in live and metabolizing oocysts and their 241 subsequent infective or reproductive stages (gametogony) and hence this assay has the ability to 242 identify and at the same time quantify them based on gene targets used in the current study (34).243 The 18ssu rRNA is a constitutively expressing gene which is present in all stages of life cycle of 244 cryptosporidia, but transcripts for COWP gene is present only during specific stages and 245 especially the active ones. There is a dearth of information as far as reverse transcriptional qPCR 246 for cryptosporidiosis is concerned, because many researchers in the past used only DNA based 247 detection method (29, 39) and most of them were used rather as a diagnostic for differentiation 248 of C.parvum from C.hominis and other species (13, 30). Similarly sensitivity of detection is 249 another parameter that decides the efficiency of the diagnostic assay, and previously researchers 250 reported as low as 2 oocysts detected using TaqMan probe real time PCR assay and genus 251 specific tests have better sensitivity compared to species specific assays (40). Recently DNA 252 based commercial qPCR were tested for sensitivity and limit of detection, in which FTD stool 253 parasites kit detected 1 and 10 oocyst for C. parvum and C.hominis respectively (41), while the 254 in-house developed qPCR from the same research team showed up to 10 oocysts and 1000 255 oocysts for C. parvum and C.hominis respectively. Since most of these studies targeted the 256 genomic DNA, we cannot compare them directly with our dRT-qPCR which is reverse 257 transcriptional and targeting the RNA of the same pathogen.

Also there is no logic in comparing the infected and non-infected animals, because here 269 the genes are from the pathogen itself and not actually from the host. 270 Previously, PCR based test has been established for the identification of Cryptosporidium 271 infection with higher sensitivity and specificity as compare to the conventional and other 272 methods which used to identify the cause the infection in gastroenteritis (42-44).
