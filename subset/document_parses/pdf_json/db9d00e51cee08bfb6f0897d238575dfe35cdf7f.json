            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is spreading worldwide with continuously evolving variants, some of which occur in the Spike protein and appear to increase viral transmissibility. However, variants that cause severe COVID-19 or lead to other breakthroughs have not been well characterized. To discover such viral variants, we assembled a cohort of 683 COVID-19 patients; 388 inpatients (\"cases\") and 295 outpatients (\"controls\") from April to August 2020 using electronically captured COVID test request forms and sequenced their viral genomes. To improve the analytical power, we accessed 7137 viral sequences in Washington State to filter out viral single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that did not have significant expansions over the collection period. Applying this filter led to the identification of 53 SNVs that were statistically significant, of which 13 SNVs each had 3 or more variant copies in the discovery cohort. Correlating these selected SNVs with case/control status, eight SNVs were found to significantly associate with inpatient status (q-values < 0.01). Using temporal synchrony, we identified a four SNV-haplotype (t19839-g28881-g28882-g28883) that was significantly associated with case/ control status (Fisher's exact p = 2.84 \u00d7 10 -11 ). This haplotype appeared in April 2020, peaked in June, and persisted into January 2021. The association was replicated (OR = 5.46, p-value = 4.71 \u00d7 10 \u221212 ) in an independent cohort of 964 COVID-19 patients (June 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021). The haplotype included a synonymous change N73N in endoRNase, and three non-synonymous changes coding residues R203K, R203S and G204R in the nucleocapsid protein. This discovery points to the potential functional role of the nucleocapsid protein in triggering \"cytokine storms\" and severe COVID-19 that led to hospitalization. The study further emphasizes a need for tracking and analyzing viral sequences in correlations with clinical status.",

Here our primary interest was to discover viral SNVs that associate with the COVID-19 hospitalization risk. We report results identifying SNVs that associated with COVID-19 hospitalization risk, through a discovery case-control study of COVID-19 patients whose viral genomes were sequenced and whose hospitalization status (inpatient versus outpatient) and demographic data were retrieved from a database of COVID testing request forms. To improve analytical power, we utilized a large collection of viral sequences from 7137 Washington residents deposited in GISAID and selected those SNVs that showed significant and substantial expansions from January 2020 to 2021. By correlating these identified SNVs with hospitalization status in the discovery study, we identified those SNVs that associated with hospitalization risk. The identified SNPs were subsequently replicated in an independent cohort.",

The SARS-COV-2 accumulates mutations during replication, potentially generating new strains, some of which have undergone substantial expansions in the population either because of super-spreader events or due to functional changes resulting in elevated transmissibility. Here we considered an SNV to be of interest if it had a statistically significant expansion in the study period and its average proportion of mutations in the last three months of the study period exceeded 10%. To identify such SNVs, we utilized 7137 viral genomes that had been generated from laboratories in Washington state and deposited to GISAID and that had been aligned and subjected to quality control (see \"Materials and methods\"). Comparing all viral genome sequences to the reference sequence led to counts of mutations at each nucleotide in the genome shown in Fig. 1A . This analysis showed that the Spike protein had two common SNVs with 300 or more copies and the nucleocapsid (N) protein had multiple common SNVs. Since over 90% of positions in the 30 Kb genome had fewer than 3 mutations, we focused on the remaining ~ 10% (2516 nucleotides) for possible significant expansions. A non-linear logistic regression model to regress the binary indicator for mutation at each selected nucleotide on the collection time was then employed. In essence, this model fitted locally averaged proportions of mutants throughout the study period. If an SNV had undergone expansion, its locally averaged proportion would increase over time, as the mutant type became more common in the population.",

Through a discovery case-control design, this study discovered six SNVs associating with increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization, while two SNVs associated with decreased hospitalization risk. Among these six SNVs, four nucleotides (c28854, g28881, g28882, g28883) were non-synonymous and code residues S194L, R203K, R203S and G204R, respectively, in Nucleocapsid, and two nucleotides (t19839, a20268) in endoRNase of orf1ab encoded synonymous changes (N73N and L216L, respectively). Interestingly, t19839 appears to have expanded together with g28881, g28882, g28883, and the combined haplotype had a significant association with COVID-19 hospitalization risk (p = 2.84 \u00d7 10 -11 and 2.21 \u00d7 10 -10 in the discovery and replication studies, respectively). Conversely, the risk association of a20268, c28854 was discovered (p = 4.56 \u00d7 10 -11 ) but only marginally replicated (p = 0.05). The non-synonymous mutations R203K, R203S and G204R in the nucleocapsid protein all occur in the flexible linker region between the N-terminal RNA-binding domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain, and this linker segment is not resolved in any reported cryo-EM or x-ray structures 4 . However, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments revealed that the full-length nucleocapsid protein has a much larger radius www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of gyration than would be expected for a 99 kDa globular protein, indicating that the flexible linker region is relatively extended in solution 4 . Consistent with the low-resolution conformational ensemble results from the SAXS experiments, recent single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments demonstrated that the linker region is highly flexible, with rapid interconversion between two general conformational populations 5 , Together, these two experimental studies show that the linker region undergoes rapid conformational transitions but is generally extended, thus minimizing direct interactions www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of the well-structured RNA binding and dimerization domains. The mutations R203S and G204R are nonconservative and even the R203K mutation is often observed to function as a non-conservative substitution in many cases, due to the different size of the R versus K residues and the notably different chemical features of the side-chain guanidinium group (arginine) versus the primary amine (lysine). Thus, we hypothesize that these mutations may influence disease severity by altering linker region flexibility and dynamics, which would likely alter nucleocapsid function. We also note that the linker region is involved in RNA binding interactions, so at least some of the linker region mutations might impact non-specific RNA binding. The main variant in the endoRNase, N73N, is synonymous which suggests a testable hypotheses concerning potential impact on virus fitness or function. It is well documented that the translation kinetics for synonymous codons are often different, and this can have an impact on co-translational protein folding kinetics, yielding proteins with identical primary sequence but different conformations and properties 5 . For example, Kimchi-Sarfaty et al. demonstrated that P-glycoprotein expression using different synonymous codons yielded product with identical amino acid sequence but different substrate specificities that was attributed to differing P-glycoprotein conformations 6 . More recently, Hu et al. showed that the use of synonymous codons in heterologous expression of anti-IgE single chains in E. coli yielded scFv molecules with identical sequence but altered solubilities and antigen-binding affinities 7 . Thus, these synonymous mutations may lead to an endoRNase with improved function and/or properties due to alternate protein conformations. It is also possible that the synonymous mutations may impart a competitive advantage simply by resulting in enhanced translational kinetics for the endoRNase.",

Furthermore, this exercise also supports a hybrid design that integrates GISAID with the purposedriven study, given that GISAID includes sequences from the State surveillance program and are representative of the Washington study population. Direct access to electronic health records of those COVID-19 patients whose sequences have been deposited to GISAID could significantly enhance analytic rigor and findings. In essence, such a hybrid design can be viewed as a two-stage design, which has been shown to be highly efficient, and multiple statistical methodologies have been developed to extract maximum and unbiased association results 11-16 . There are noteworthy limitations to our study including that the of hospitalization risk as a proxy for disease severity may lead to misclassification, since inpatients may be hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19. Conversely, some patients with elevated COVID-19 hospitalization risk may not be hospitalized or their hospitalization may not be reported at the time of testing because it occurs later. However, misclassification errors tend to dilute association results 17 . Thus, the true magnitude of discovered and replicated association with the haplotype \"caac\" of t19839-g28881-g28882-g28883 may be even greater than estimated here if the severity of COVID-19 could be clinically adjudicated. Another limitation included incomplete matching of our discovery and replication case-control studies with regard to age, sex and collection time, partly due to challenges facing research studies relying on the operational database and biospecimen availability during the pandemic. To address this issue, we applied the logistic regression model to evaluate viral genetic associations, while adjusting for these potential confounding variables.",

After fitting the model, we obtained p-value that quantifies the non-linear dynamics of the mutation proportion and computed the fitted values as locally weight-averaged mutation proportion daily throughout the year. The maximum proportion in the last three month, denoted as Pmax, was computed to indicate if the mutation proportion had expanded and reached a substantial level in the end of the study period. To correct multiple comparisons, the false positive error rates (q-values) were computed from p-values. An SNV was selected if the q-value threshold (< 0.01) indicated statistically significant dynamics and if the Pmax threshold (> 10%) suggested a substantial expansion. Imputing missing nucleotides. Due to the nature of sequencing technologies, a small fraction of nucleotides were untyped, and were coded as \"n\". Given high linkage disequilibrium across all SNVs, we assembled a panel of polymorphic nucleotides that had no missing values and had not been selected into SNVs of interest, and treated them as an \"imputation base\". Fusing one SNV with those in the imputation base, we computed their haplotype frequencies, and used their haplotype frequencies to compute posterior probabilities to impute missing nucleotides, in the same way as imputing single nucleotide polymorphisms 35 .
