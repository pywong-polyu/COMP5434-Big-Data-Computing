More complex is the mechanism at the basis of pandemic events. In these cases, major antigenic variants of influenza A (antigenic shift) may be generated through genetic reassortment between virus strains of human and avian origin (the largest reservoir of influenza A strains) in host mammals susceptible to both infections, such as swine. Viruses circulating in different animal species may also be introduced directly into the human population [2] . Avian influenza viruses of the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes have also been associated with sporadic infections in humans. The level of herd immunity in humans to new reassortant viruses is usually very low, making it possible their rapid spread worldwide ( pandemics) and underlies the increased virulence of pandemic influenza A strains.",

Due to the constant emergence of antigenic drift variants under herd immunity pressure, the Influenza vaccine needs yearly update to include the escape variants detected during each seasonal epidemic which are predicted to circulate during the next winterspring season. This update is organized by the WHO through the network of sentinel practitioners and reference laboratories (INFLUNET). If the viruses in the vaccine are closely matched to those circulating in the community, vaccine effectiveness is greater. However, even when the viruses are not closely related, the vaccine can still be expected to provide some cross-protection against different, but related, strains of influenza viruses. Based on the limited cross-protection between the two influenza B lineages and the inability to accurately predict which influenza B lineage will circulate, a quadrivalent influenza vaccine including both influenza B strains [5] has recently been approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Pharmaceutical companies will likely transition to predominantly producing the quadrivalent vaccine.",

Patients with cancer are considered functionally immunosuppressed, due to their underlying disease and/or cancer therapy. As a consequence, they may have a suboptimal serologic response to influenza vaccination. Although antiviral prophylaxis has been recently used for prevention of influenza virus infection in specific clinical settings such as perivaccine prophylaxis, postexposure prophylaxis, family cluster prophylaxis, as well as seasonal prophylaxis [5] , vaccination is the most effective method for widespread prevention of influenza infection. Indeed, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) in the United States recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for adults without contraindications, who have disease-or medication-related immunosuppression (http:// www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm). However, knowledge of serologic response to seasonal influenza vaccine remains scanty in patients with cancer and is particularly sparse in those with solid tumors [7] . Tumor heterogeneity, timing of influenza vaccination relative to different chemotherapy treatments, and a general lack of data concerning the vaccine efficacy against influenza infection, or its complications, make it difficult to compare the clinical studies so far reported in the literature. The results of eight controlled clinical trials looking at the efficacy of influenza vaccination in pediatric cancer patients were reviewed [8] . Children receiving chemotherapy were able to generate immune responses to the vaccine, albeit more weakly than healthy children, children with asthma or children with cancer who had completed chemotherapy more than 1 month before vaccination. Influenza vaccine was safely administered, and there were no reports of persistent adverse reactions in any of the studies, although patients receiving chemotherapy had a higher incidence of general malaise following vaccination. None of these studies reported on clinical outcome. Seroprotection (antibody titer >40) and seroconversion (at least a fourfold rise in HI titers) were achieved in patients with an established diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders [9, 10] , irrespective of the previous chemotherapy administration.",

Despite the paucity of data in a heterogeneous patient population, it can be suggested that tor patients with solid tumors, if possible, vaccination should be given mid-cycle, preferably 2 weeks after chemotherapy and/or before administration of the subsequent cycle. For patients with hematologic malignancies, the highest serologic response appears to occur following vaccination administered when the leukocyte count is normal and just before initiation of a cycle.

Antiviral resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir among circulating influenza viruses is currently low, but this can emerge during treatment especially when protracted for long periods [32, 33] . In patients with cancer who develop fever or influenzalike illness, early antiviral therapy should be given empirically without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

It should be widely utilized in patients with cancer both untreated and receiving active therapy, including biologic agents for solid tumors. The ideal time to administer the vaccination during a treatment cycle is unclear. Vaccination of household contacts and health care personnel is highly recommended as it bears significant implications in increasing the level of herd immunity in the microenvironment with consequent reduction of influenza virus circulation and likelihood of infection. Strict preventive measures should be adopted in oncology wards in the presence of hospitalized patients who develop influenza-like illness. Trivalent inactivated vaccine should be given. Data suggest an increased seroprotection rate by means of vaccines with adjuvants, an higher doses of antigen, or a second dose of vaccine. A quadrivalent vaccine has been recently approved by the United States and European health authorities. Cancer patients treated with rituximab-containing regimens have persisting perturbations of B-cell compartments and an impaired immune response to influenza vaccine, but also to other common vaccines. Thus, special efforts are needed to improve preventive/ therapeutic strategies for these refractory patients, including prophylactic antivirals. Prospective randomized, controlled trials to better define the serological response and the clinical benefits of influenza vaccination are needed in this patient population.",
