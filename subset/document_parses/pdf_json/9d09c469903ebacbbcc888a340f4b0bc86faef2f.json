In this article, we present a new methodology for network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data.

The methodology is general and can be applied to world-wide data about COVID-19. Experiments was performed on real datasets about Italian regions, and they although the limited size of the Italian COVID-19 dataset, a quite linear speed-up was obtained up to six cores.",

We collected data in the period from February 24th to June 7th, 2020. At first, for each type of data, we evaluate the similarity among pair of regions by using a statistical test, i.e. Wilcoxon Sum Rank Test, and according to this, we built similarity matrices (one for each Italian COVID-19 data measure released by Italian Civil Protection). To improve the computation of the similarity matrices, we implemented a parallel methodology. The parallelization of the similaritymatrices calculation is a problem of allocating independent tasks to parallel processors.",

In fact, each network related to different Italian COVID-19 data presents different detected communities. Furthermore, the regions that form the communities vary according to the diverse data. For example, Lombardia forms a single community in Hospitalised with Symptoms Network (Fig. 3) , Total Hospitalised Network (Fig. 5) , Total Currently Positive Network (Fig. 7) , New Currently Positive Network (Fig. 8) , Discharged/Healed Network (Fig. 9) . Otherwise, in Intensive Care Network (Fig. 4) and Swabs Network (Fig. 12) , Lombardia forms a community together with Veneto. In Home Isolation Network (Fig. 6) , a community is composed by Lombardia, Emilia, Marche. In Total Cases Network (Fig. 10) and Deceased Network (Fig. 11 ), Lombardia forms a community with Lombardia, Emilia, Marche and Veneto. This means that the Italian regions behaved differently with respect to ten different data provided by civil protection. Further analysis about communities in Italian COVID-19 data and their temporal evolution can be found in [9] , where a sequential version of this methodology has been used.",

Finally, we performed a network-based analysis to discover communities of regions that show similar behaviour. The experiments performed on real datasets show good speed-up.
