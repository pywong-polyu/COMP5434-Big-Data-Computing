The patient was diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), intrauterine death of the foetus (IUD), multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and septicaemia at the 18 th week of gestation. She was tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) by RT-PCR in a private nursing home. Her laboratory test showed hemoglobin 9.3 gm/dL (reference range [RR] ; 12.0-15.0 gm/dL), total leukocyte count 22.8x10 9 /L (RR; 4.0-11.0 x10 9 /L), the platelet count was 108.9 x10 9 /L (RR; 150.0-400.0 x10 9 /L). Prothrombin time (test/control) was 24. She was immediately managed symptomatically. However, the patient's condition deteriorated despite all efforts, and she died on the second day of admission. With informed consent, the patient's autopsy was performed under strict biosafety rules, and histopathological examination was performed ( Figure 1 ).",

[1] [2] [3] Until recently, it was known that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to viral infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 were prone to secondary complications, especially in immunocompromised patients. Detection of aspergillosis in COVID-19 cases has been a new development wherein virusinduced severe immune dysfunction and damage to airway epithelium have been postulated to be the etiopathology for homing the fungi. 4 In fact, concerns are being raised that the fungal superinfection could predispose patients with COVID-19 to a clinically worse disease contributing to the disease-associated fatality. 1, 3 We here report a case of CAPA in a young pregnant woman diagnosed with COVID-19 with no prior history of chronic immunosuppression.",

            "text": "Although the patient in our case had multiple contributing factors causing her mortality, it is possible that aspergillosis played a significant role in worsening the clinical scenario. The patient died despite active management with vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and antimicrobials. A possible reason for this could be a lack of antifungal support, which would have hampered the disease progression. Furthermore, a history of IUD leading to DIC and subsequent MODS, in this case, masked the symptoms of pulmonary aspergillosis. This was compounded by normal chest X-ray findings. The possibility of nosocomial infection was excluded as the patient died the very next day of her hospitalization. Therefore, the present case emphasizes the role of autopsies for post-mortem surveillance in such a severe disease. Also, increasing availability of reports explaining the association of aspergillosis with COVID-19 mandates screening for the fungi through non-invasive procedures such as a fungal culture or molecular studies to facilitate early detection of the fatal organism and prompt management of the disease with antifungal drugs, thereby avoiding a fatality 1,2,5 . Further research is necessary to evaluate the incidence of CAPA in SARS-CoV-2 infection and determine the population at risk, prophylaxis, and precise therapy. ",
