Fourteen (66.7%) of the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients had parenchymal abnormalities on CXR, and most common abnormalities were airspace opacities (61.9%) and prominent bronchovascular shadows (28.6%). Seventeen (85.0%) of the patients had parenchymal abnormalities consistent with COVID-19 on their chest CT. Chest CT most commonly showed bilateral (88.2%), multilobe (100%) involvement; peripheral and central distribution (70.6%); patchy-shape (94.1%) and ground-glass opacity (94.1%). The sensitivity of CXR and chest CT was calculated as 66.7% and 83.3%, respectively. Preterm birth rate was 41.2% (n=7/17). Five (9.1%) of the 55 pregnant women admitted to the intensive care unit, three of those developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and one died.",

In addition, the modulation of the immune system during pregnancy leaves pregnant women vulnerable to viral infections, which may lead to even more severe symptoms (2) . Previous studies have also shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome infections were associated with serious maternal disease, maternal deaths, and spontaneous abortions (3) (4) (5) . Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness from Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID- 19) compared to non-pregnant people (6, 7) . Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant women with COVID-19 (8, 9) . Moreover, the high refusal rate of imaging modalities involving ionizing radiation during pregnancy and the risks to fetuses present as a limiting factor in the diagnosis and treatment of pregnant women, making the diagnostic process more difficult when compared to the non-pregnant population (10) . Therefore, pregnant women constitute a vulnerable group that requires special attention in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.",

To the best of our knowledge, this finding was not previously reported. Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines state that maternal health is more important than fetal health in pregnant patients (2) . Therefore, radiological examination can be performed in pregnant women while exposure to ionizing radiation should be as low as reasonably achievable. In routine chest CT, the radiation dose is approximately 4-7 mGy, and the radiation dose of a CXR or low-dose chest CT is far below the accepted limit for a fetus (22) . Radiation exposure of less than 100 mGy in utero after implantation has no proven deterministic effect on the fetus. However, stochastic effects of cancer induction are known to exist, albeit slightly, and increase in proportion to dose (23) . The use of radiological examinations in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant patients requires special attention due to the risk of fetal teratogenicity caused by radiation exposure. Lung ultrasound may provide a good solution for patients who refuse chest CT or CRX (14, 24) .",

Similarly, the sensitivity of CXR in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia was found to be 66.7% in this study, whereas chest CT sensitivity was 86.6%. The authors postulate that CXR can be used as the initial radiological examination for symptomatic pregnant patients with COVID-19 considering its relatively lower radiation dose and moderate sensitivity. However, a normal CXR cannot rule out COVID-19. In this study, ARDS development was detected in the CXR in one case and in the chest CT in two cases and, one of these cases involved concomitant pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum ( Figure 3 ). This severe patient was treated in the ICU and required mechanical ventilation. Although spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a rare complication of COVID-19, the mechanism of pneumomediastinum is not clear (27) . These individual cases have highlighted the importance of radiologic imaging, not only in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia, but also in detecting accompanying complications of the disease.",

Although the RT-PCR test is accepted as a reference in the diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity of the test is low. The positivity rate of the first test is 60-71%, and the positivity rate increases with subsequent tests (30) . Thus, a diagnosis of COVID-19 should not be ruled out in pregnant patients with a single negative RT-PCR test result. Considering the method used to obtain the sample, and low sensitivity due to technical reasons, repetition of the test should not be avoided in cases where the first test is negative if clinical, laboratory, or radiological findings are consistent.",

In addition, 9.1% of the pregnant patients included in the study were admitted to the ICU, three of whom developed ARDS and one of them died. Some of the studies conducted at the beginning of the pandemic claim that the course of COVID-19 during pregnancy is not different to non-pregnant cases (31, 32) . Contrary to these studies, our preliminary results suggest that clinical course of the COVID-19 in pregnancy seems more severe, similar to more recent studies (7, 33) .
