The polioviruses (serotypes 1, 2 and 3) are the best studied members of the genus Enterovirus and are members of species Enterovirus C alongside 22 other serotypes, including coxsackievirus (CV)A1, CVA11, CVA13, CVA19 and CVA24. As a result of establishing a correlation between EV serotypes and their VP1 gene sequence [2] , EV typing by serological assays has been replaced by VP1 gene, complete capsid, or whole-genome sequence analysis [3] .",

These samples are from municipalities that have a total population of over 700,000 people [18] and were collected on days 0, 28, 70 and 105 from each of the 13 sites. Four WW samples were collected from each site except in four cases where one sample was not collected for logistical reasons. This included site 13-day 0, sites 3 and 11-day 28, and site 7-day 70. We transported the samples on ice to our laboratory at Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA, where they were processed. Precisely, 175 mL of WW was first clarified by filtration through a 450 nm polyethersulfone filter using a Nalgene Rapid-Flow single-use, disposable membrane vacuum filtration unit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).",

            "text": "We used two workflows in this study-the Sanger sequencing workflow (SSW) and the long-read Illumina sequencing workflow (LRISW) ( Figure 1A) . Particularly, the SSW was used to cost effectively streamline samples that went into the LRISW. Furthermore, both workflows also served as controls for each other as all nucleic acid sequencing reported in this study were done in two independent commercial sequencing facilities. For each of the 48 samples, 280 \u00b5L (140 \u00b5L \u00d7 2) was used for RNA extraction using the QiaAmp RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) following manufacturer's recommendations. The resulting RNA (final volume 80 \u00b5L) was then used in the one-step RT-PCR assays described by Majumdar and Martin [12] . We added 5 \u00b5L of RNA to a 20 \u00b5L mix containing 12.5 \u00b5L of Superscript III RT-PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 1 \u00b5L (10 \u00b5M) each of both forward and reverse primers [12] , 0.5 \u00b5L of RT/HiFi enzyme and 5 uL of PCR-grade water. The mixture was amplified in a thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) with the following cycling conditions: 50 \u2022 C for 30 min followed by 94 \u2022 C for 2 min and 42 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 15 s, 55 \u2022 C for 30 s, and 68 \u2022 C for 8 min. This was followed by 68 \u2022 C for 5 min and 4 \u2022 C until stopped. We pooled the product of the assays (per sample) and used them as template for assays 2 (SSW), 3a and 3b (LRISW) (Table 1, Figure 1A ). We used GoTaq green (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) and Phusion High-Fidelity (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) PCR kits for the SSW and LRISW, respectively ( Figure 1A ). For both workflows, we added 2 \u00b5L of the pooled product (from assays 1a and 1b) to a 23 \u00b5L mix containing 12.5 \u00b5L of PCR master mix, 0.25 \u00b5L (100 \u00b5M) of each of forward and reverse primers and 10 \u00b5L of PCR-grade water. Amplification was performed in a thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) (see Table 1 for cycling conditions). We specified an initial denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 2 min followed by 94 \u2022 C for 30 s per cycle. All three assays also included a final stage of extension temperature for 10 min followed by 4 \u2022 C until stopped. We resolved amplicons <1000 bp and those >1000 bp ( Figure 1B ) on 2% and 1% agarose gels, respectively. All gels were stained with GelRed (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA) and viewed using a GelDoc imager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Table 1 . Variation in assay conditions for the PCR assays used in this study. All primers listed have the same sequence as those listed in the references cited in the table. Please see Figure S6 for primer sequences. The LG prefix in primers for assays 3a and 3b implies the Loop Genomics adapter was added to the 5 -end of these primers. We purified the~350 bp amplicons (assay 2) generated in the SSW using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). The amplicons were Sanger sequenced at the Genomics Core, Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA, using both primers AN89 and AN88. The amplicons generated in the LRISW (assay 3a~2400 bp and 3b~1900 bp), were pooled per sample and purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Afterwards, the amplicons were indexed, purified, normalized, and pooled using the Loop Genomics (San Jose, CA, USA) kit as recommended by the manufacturer. The pooled sample was shipped to Loop Genomics where intra-molecular tagging, library preparation, paired-end (2 \u00d7 150) Illumina sequencing (on the HiSeq 4000 Illumina sequencer) and long-read assembly were done using SPAdes [21] . We typed all contigs using the enterovirus genotyping tool [22] .",

Our findings show that despite the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and non-pharmaceutical interventions, EVs were circulating as expected during the season. Particularly, in this study, we showed that at least nine (9) different EV types belonging to three different species (EVA (CVA4, EVA76, EVA90), EVB (E14) and EVC (CVA1, CVA11, CVA13, CVA19 and CVA24)) were present and circulating (Figures 2-4 and S1-S3) in the population over the 105 days (15 weeks) sampled in this study and in many cases, more than one lineage was circulating ( Table 2 ; Figures 4 and S1-S3).",

Hence, the reduction in EV detection by case-based surveillance (CBS) could be accounted for in either of three ways. It is possible, that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic resulted in testing bias towards SARS-CoV-2 and consequently resulted in other viruses being missed especially in cases of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 [29, 30] . Secondly, the pandemic could have resulted in changes in clinic visits by patients resulting in cases not logged at hospitals [31] . Thirdly, non-pharmaceutical interventions might have prevented the proper mingling of EVs and the immunologically na\u00efve to cause outbreaks of the expected size. If either of the first two scenarios are true, then cases might have existed but were missed by CBS. However, if the third scenario is true, the reduced EV detection by CBS in 2020 might be an indication that removing non-pharmaceutical interventions might restore circulation of EVs to pre-intervention levels. Coupled with a now larger (than in 2020) population of the immunologically na\u00efve, it is possible that this will result in (subsequent years) a future EV outbreak that is larger than expected.",

Like all other cell culture independent Pan-EV molecular assays that have been used to investigate EV diversity in wastewater [10] [11] [12] [13] , the assays coupled together in the SSW have been independently shown to detect members of Enterovirus A-D [11, 12, 32] . In fact, we recently showed that the same assay detected (in wastewater) a C1-like EV-A71 (a member of Enterovirus A species) that had been circulating silently for over two years [33] . Hence, we are confident the Enterovirus C species members detected using the SSW is not a consequence of bias from the RT-nested PCR assay ( Figure 1B) . Furthermore, it is important to note that while the SSW might not have resolved EV mixtures when present (Table 2) , it was able to signal the possible presence of EVs (~350 bp amplicon in gels), and more importantly, the possibility that multiple EV types might be present in a single sample (multiple peaks, Table 2 ). In settings where access to highthroughput sequencing capacity might be scarce or unavailable, the SSW can be quite valuable. In such instances (depending on the capacity of the facility), suspected cases of EV mixtures can be resolved by cloning of amplicons prior to Sanger sequencing. Alternatively, amplicons from assay 1 ( Figure 1A) can be serially diluted to the minimum concentration at which amplicons can be recovered using the SSW. Multiple aliquots of this minimum dilution (or the penultimate) can then be subjected to the SSW and all amplicons sequenced by the Sanger sequencing method.",

The LRISW unambiguously detected members of three (A-C) different EV species suggesting that although the primers were paired differently (Table 1) than previously described [11, 12, 19, 20] , they retained the capacity to detect EVs across varying species. While it is impossible to say categorically that no EV genome present in the samples could have been missed, we were careful to ensure that our choice of primers and assay conditions for assay 3 were promiscuous enough to ensure that any amplicon generated in assay 1 should be further amplified in assay 3. Specifically, we selected outer primers MM-EV-F2 and CRE-R for assay 3 because we noted (as shown in Figure S6a ) that binding sites for MM-EV-F2 should be present in any amplicon generated using 5-UTR and binding sites for CRE-R should be present in any amplicon generated using MM-EV-R1. To accommodate the internal variation between CRE-R and MM-EV-R1, we used a low annealing temperature (45 \u2022 C) for the first five cycles of assay 3 (Table 1) . To explore the possibility that our internal primers (AN89 and AN88) might have missed some EV types, we checked the primer binding sites for AN89 and AN88 in the 3a and 3b contigs (respectively) recovered in this study (Figure S6b,c) . Our findings show congruence between the specificity domain of the primer sequence [20] and their respective binding sites in the contigs (Figure S6b,c) . Hence, considering the above stated and congruence between EV detection by the SSW and LRISW approaches ( Table 2) , we are confident the preponderance of Enterovirus C species members detected in the LRI workflow (and overall, in this study) is not a consequence of bias from the way the primers were paired (Figure 1 and Table 1 ). Rather, our findings show that the LRISW increased the resolution of the Pan-EV assays detecting two (A and B) more EV species and four (CVA4, EV-A76, EV-A90 and E14) more EV types than the SSW (Table 2 ). On the other hand, the Enterovirus C preponderance detected in this study might be a true reflection of EV dynamics in the region sampled during the 2020 EV season. Though Enterovirus C presence has been documented in USA [10] , it has been suggested that this species is not as common in temperate climates as they are in the tropics [34, 35] . Little attention has, however, been paid to their dynamics in Southwest US which includes desert climates (such as the region sampled in this study) and it seems, according to our findings, that Enterovirus Cs might circulate well in such.",

This suggests that the complete or near complete capsid sequence of most of the EV types circulating in the USA and detected in this study might not have been documented (or documented but not yet publicly available) for over a decade. This is not surprising as most EV surveillance studies (besides recent studies focused on EVD68 and EVA71) have leaned heavily on assays that amplify only a very small portion of EV capsid genomic region [20, 37] . For example, while a GenBank search using the query 'coxsackievirus A1 , 'coxsackievirus A1 VP1 and 'coxsackievirus A1 complete genome' yielded 82, 59 and 3 entries, respectively, a BLASTN search of the database using LRISW assay 3a ( Figure 1A ) contigs yielded only 10 (nine CVA1 and one CVA19) entries with >50% 'query cover'. This dearth of complete genome or at least complete capsid sequence can be detrimental to the development of broadly acting countermeasures (BACMs) against EV capsids as it limits the amount of sequence data available for analysis and by extension both our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of EV capsids and the identification of potential targets in EV capsids for the development of BACMs.",

While there are very robust bioinformatic pipelines that might enable us to predict, the likelihood that two variants detected using high-throughput sequencing strategies are linked, long-read sequencing strategies, such as LRISW, helps us detect linked muta-tions without the need for probabilistic predictions and consequently enables us to not only better understand co-evolution of sites along EV genomes but also the co-evolution of amino acid residues in EV capsids and beyond. This can help us better understand quasi-species dynamics in EVs which can guide us in the design, development and use of countermeasures such as vaccines and chemotherapeutic agents in the control of EVs [38] .",

Particularly, preponderance of Enterovirus C was detected and our data suggest that recombination (which is as a result of co-infection of hosts with multiple EV types) between multiple Enterovirus C types might be occurring in the population (Figures 5, 6 and S5 ). It is important to mention that some Enterovirus C members detected in this study (CVA11 and CVA13) are known for their ability to function as recombination partners for vaccine strains of the polioviruses, resulting in the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) in which both transmissibility and pathogenicity have been restored to wild-type poliovirus levels [39] [40] [41] . Though wild poliovirus seems to be currently restricted to some parts of southeast Asia [42] , cVDPVs have a larger international footprint [42, 43] . The fact that inactivated polio vaccine (which elicits great humoral immunity but poor gut immunity) forms the mainstay of polio vaccination in USA means introduction of live vaccine poliovirus strains by a vaccinee or its contact into the population might not cause clinical manifestation. However, the population might lack the mucosal immunity to interrupt transmission of the virus should transmission be established as documented in Israel [9, 44] . With circulation in the population of multiple types and intra-type lineages of Enterovirus C members that can function as recombination partners for vaccine strains of the polioviruses, cVDPVs can emerge (as was documented in Minnesota [45] ), circulate silently, and serve as a reservoir to seed other parts of the world with lower population humoral immunity to the virus. It is therefore important we monitor the types, dynamics, and distribution of Enterovirus C species members in the population.",

While the EV types detected and described here are a subset of those present in the samples screened, it is not clear how representative they are of the diversity in the samples.

Conversely, if sampling <10% of EV diversity in wastewater in this population is this informative, questions remain about how much virus diversity (especially with regard to variants of interest, concern or high consequence) is lost by performing the clarification step in the WW concentration protocol for SARS-CoV-2. It might therefore be necessary to account for the amount of SARS-CoV-2 (and other enveloped viruses) genetic material we might be losing to this filtration step.
