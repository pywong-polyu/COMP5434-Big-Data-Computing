            "text": "The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented major challenges to those looking after people with noncommunicable diseases. At the time of writing, there have been .1.5 million cases in the U.S. and .240,000 in the U.K., with .125,000 deaths between the two countries. The outpatient management of people with diabetes and its complications is facing a huge challenge as routine face-to-face clinics have been canceled in many countries and the ability to order even basic tests has been severely restricted. This has produced many challenges but also opportunities for the delivery of diabetes care.",

            "text": "Of all the chronic complications of diabetes, foot problems are the most common cause of hospital admissions (1, 2) in Western countries. Such admissions are usually precipitated by serious infections in neuropathic or neuroischemic feet. Moreover, such patients frequently have multiple comorbidities, especially cardiovascular and renal disease (2, 3) , which affect the risk of lowerextremity amputation and mortality (2) (3) (4) . Thus, the cancellation of most outpatient clinical services has posed a potential threat to those with diabetic foot problems including active diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), significant ischemia, and Charcot neuroarthropathy. Many reviews on the impact and management of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes have been published (e.g., Hussain et al. [5] and Bornstein et al. [6] ), but none has focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with diabetes with foot problems. A special communication from the American Podiatric Medical Association (7) recently emphasized the importance of appropriate management of DFUs and other complications and speculated how these might be managed at several different settings, including home, during this pandemic. Subsequently, multiple stakeholders with an interest in wound care have proposed a new strategy for wound management during the COVID-19 pandemic (8) .",

These are now described in detail with initial results of the patients seen in the 6 weeks prior to the pandemic lockdown compared with those in the 6 weeks after this was established. Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county in the North West of the U.K. with a population of just under 3 million. According to the 2011 Census, 84% of the population was white, 10% Asian (predominantly Indian subcontinent Asia), 3% black, and 3% other. One of the main university teaching hospitals in Manchester is the Royal Infirmary; the multidisciplinary diabetic foot clinic has been operational for more than 30 years (9) and includes a number of different specialties: diabetologists, vascular surgeon, podiatric surgeon, podiatrists, diabetes specialist nurses, and an orthotist.",

When the \"shelter in place\" (lockdown) orders began in mid-March, all nonemergency patient encounters were rescheduled or switched to telemedicine encounters. All surgical cases were canceled unless they were emergent, and all imaging and noninvasive vascular testing, radiography, and even laboratory work were placed on hold. All nonemergent or noncritically ill patients were directed away from the hospital to conserve resources and personal protective equipment. The first weeks were spent reaching out to patients to coordinate care remotely. This included establishing dressing change instructions and education and distributing materials to the families, caretakers, and home care nursing agencies. Patients with wounds that required further surveillance and monitoring were sent to our physical therapy wound care center. Serial debridement and offloading were some of the challenges that we immediately faced from the lockdown. Less than 10% of patients with foot ulcers were able to be seen in the clinic after the lockdown began. Patient visits were spread out so that no more than one patient would be in the waiting room at one time. Telemedicine or virtual visits were implemented immediately using photographs and video connection-enabled conferencing to evaluate wounds and to direct care to the patient. Virtual education was also provided to home-visiting nurses for clinical management including dressing changes, monitoring for signs of infection, and light local debridement. It was also possible, by guiding health nurses via telehealth, to practice less commonly used therapies safely and effectively in the community such as larval (maggot) therapy (case 3) (Fig. 3) . Most patients had undergone vascular studies prior to lockdown, but new patients were evaluated with handheld Doppler probes and clinical examination. Any patients with critical limb-threatening ischemia or severe rest pain were directed to our vascular counterparts for admission to get vascular testing and intervention. Our data set includes all patient encounters in the 6 weeks prior to and the 6 weeks after the lockdown orders were placed. We have included hospitalizations and the number of telemedicine visits, which did not exist prior to our lockdown (Table 1) . Table 1 presents patient contacts with foot lesions in the 6 weeks prior to lockdown and the 6 weeks post-lockdown in both Manchester and Los Angeles. It also identifies the number of telecare visits (either telephone or \"virtual\" with audio and video connection), actual visits, and, in Manchester, home visits by podiatrists. As can be seen from Table  1 , there has been a marked reduction in the number of hospital admissions postlockdown in both Manchester and Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, 57% of clinical encounters were converted to telemedicine visits, whereas in Manchester, the figure was 18%.",

In Manchester, these cases are of patients with presumed osteomyelitis due to clinical signs who might normally have been admitted for local surgery but have been successfully managed on oral antibiotics. Clinical photographs of the lesions before and after treatment are presented. Similarly, from Los Angeles, case vignettes are presented particularly regarding how telemedicine has been successful in enabling patients who would normally have been seen in the hospital to be managed at home or at a clinic away from a hospital. After lockdown, localized infections were treated with in-office procedures and antibiotics in efforts to offload burden on the emergency rooms (ERs).

A plain radiograph was possible at this juncture and demonstrated extensive osteomyelitis involving the proximal end of the distal phalanx, the distal end of the proximal phalanx, and the interphalangeal joint (Fig. 1B) . Clinical examination confirmed a dense peripheral neuropathy in both feet with normal peripheral pulses and Doppler arterial signals in the pedal arteries. There was a positive \"probe-to-bone\" test, and after the positive X-ray, he was started on ciprofloxacin 750 mg b.i.d. and clindamycin 450 mg q.i.d. This would normally have been managed by a local surgical procedure as an inpatient, but with the rising COVID-19 problem, we elected to continue with oral antibiotic therapy.

An open partial amputation of digits 1-3 of the right foot was therefore performed in clinic using local anesthesia. The infection resolved within days, and his amputation sites began to heal and the wound was closed within three 3 weeks (Fig. 4B ). In this case, hospitalization was avoided and his care was managed by both aggressive clinic-based procedures together with telehealth guidance.",

He had attempted to see his primary care physician but was advised to stay home, was directed away from the hospital and clinic, and was placed on oral antibiotics. He contacted the operator at our university and made an appointment for our limb salvage unit. He was seen by our vascular surgery counterparts who saw that he had sufficient arterial perfusion for healing. Upon evaluation, the patient had significant tenderness, purulent drainage, and putrid odor with exposed bone. He was hypertensive and febrile. He was admitted immediately and was found to have gas gangrene infection of his heel that had spread into every compartment of his foot and extended into his leg. He went on to a below-knee amputation and suffered a myocardial infarction in the hospital. Even with technology and close monitoring, our patients with active ulceration need access to inpatient care.",

            "text": "At the time of any pandemic, it is understandable that priorities for inpatient care should focus on those with severe cases of the infection. However, as recently pointed out by the editor in chief of The BMJ, this has led to the neglect of many conditions, particularly noncommunicable diseases (11). Although early plans to restart regular services have been announced by the U.K. National Health Service (12), those prioritized services did not include diabetes. Appropriate care for those with diabetic foot disease during and after the lockdown precipitated by the pandemic is therefore critical, as they frequently require face-to-face appointments for wound care. It is very worrisome therefore that the U.K. Government recently reported that the number of ER attendances for non-COVID-19 emergencies were .50% lower in April 2020 than in April 2019, suggesting that people with serious medical conditions are, for whatever reason, failing to attend hospital for treatment. Data from China confirmed not only that diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and progress of COVID-19 infections (13) but also that among inpatients with diabetes and COVID-19 infection, nonsurvivors were older, mostly male, and more likely to have hypertension and cardiovascular disease (14) . Similarly, those at risk for diabetic foot disease are older, 1.5 times more likely to be male, and typically have other comorbidities, especially cardiovascular and renal disease (1, 2, 4, 15) . Thus, the purpose of this review is to describe the steps that have been taken in two centers with expertise in diabetic foot disease to manage diabetic foot problems and, most importantly, to prevent the need for hospital admission if at all possible. The most common reason for those with DFUs to attend the ER is foot infection, often with underlying osteomyelitis (1, 16) . However, as those with diabetic neuropathy have lost \"the gift of pain\" (2, 15) , they may attend the ER with a high fever (pyrexia) and fail to mention a foot ulcer, and a careful foot exam may not occur. Indeed, a previous report described one such patient who was investigated for a fever of unknown origin for several days before the correct diagnosis was made (17) . At present, all patients with a fever attending the ER are likely to undergo screening for COVID-19, including those with possible osteomyelitis, with the risk of them being exposed to others with COVID-19. Thus, the aim of both centers has been to manage DFU patients as outpatients if possible. The two case reports from Manchester demonstrate that even those with extensive osteomyelitis who would previously have been managed in hospital with intravenous antibiotics and likely local surgery can successfully be managed with oral antibiotics. Fortunately, some recent randomized controlled trials support this approach. First, a randomized controlled trial from Spain confirmed that antibiotics alone are as efficacious as local surgery for foot osteomyelitis in diabetes (18), and second, the OVIVA (Oral Versus IntraVenous Antibiotics for bone and joint infection) study showed no difference in outcomes between intravenous and oral antibiotics in the treatment of osteomyelitis (19) . In addition to long courses of oral antibiotics, in Manchester we have also used calcium sulfate pellets impregnated with tobramycin (OSTEOSET-T; Wright Medical, Memphis, TN) for the local treatment of osteomyelitis: the pellets are inserted into bony osteomyeltic cavities (20) . In view of our observations that osteomyelitis, even with cellulitis, may be successfully treated by oral antibiotics alone, this may necessitate further changes to international guidelines (21) , should future studies confirm the efficacy of this approach. The institution of home visits by podiatrists for DFU treatment and the adoption of telephone consultations for some DFU patients are both new developments in DFU management. Similarly, in Los Angeles, the adoption and widespread use of telemedicine virtual consultations have proved to be successful, and many hospital admissions and treatments have been avoided. Larval therapy is used widely for wound cleansing and slough removal (22) , and this can be applied successfully in the patient's home with expert tuition to home-visiting nurses via a virtual link However, the worrying nature of case 5 reminds us of the possibility that there is the potential for a tsunami of problems, resulting in major surgery, amputation, and mortality, to occur in the months and even years after the full lockdown finishes.",

In the absence of any imaging or blood tests such as C-reactive protein, the likelihood of osteomyelitis can be increased by a positive probe-to-bone test (16). Local minor procedures have been performed in community clinics such as the removal of bony sequestrae. With such an approach, we have observed clinical resolution of presumed osteomyelitis in several cases; it is also likely that signs of radiologic healing will have occurred (24) . Most importantly, we have managed to see a significant reduction in the need to hospitalize patients in both centers. This clinical experience during the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need to maintain the art of clinical medicine in terms of history taking and careful examination. The removal of tests that many doctors rely upon these days has shown that the art of clinical medicine has survived and is thriving. We have yet to discover the secondary effects of this pandemic and the lives and limbs lost due to delayed care. We must continue to be vigilant with our patients and work quickly to prevent serious complications.",
