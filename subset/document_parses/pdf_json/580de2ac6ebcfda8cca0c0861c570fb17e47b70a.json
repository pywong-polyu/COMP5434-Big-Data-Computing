Compare baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, treatments, and clinical outcomes of patients admitted during the second peak to those admitted during the first peak. Retrospective analysis of 258 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center, of which, 131 during the first peak (March 21-May 30, 2020) and 127 during the second peak (May 31-July 16, 2020). First and second peak patients did not differ in baseline characteristics and clinical presentation at admission. Treatment with dexamethasone, full-dose anticoagulation, tocilizumab, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma transfusion were significantly more frequent during the second peak, as well as regimens combining 3-4 COVID-19-directed drugs. Compared to the first peak, 30-day mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation rates as well as adjusted risk were significantly lower during the second peak (10.2%, vs 19.8% vs p = 0.028, adjusted HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.79, p = 0.009 and 8.8% vs 19.3%, p = 0.002, adjusted HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.64, p = 0.002; respectively). Rates of 30-day mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation, as well as adjusted risks, were lower in the second peak of the COVID-19 pandemic among hospitalized patients. The change in treatment strategy and the experienced gained during the first peak may have contributed to the improved outcomes.",

The start of the second peak was defined by the first increase in the rolling 7-day average daily admissions rate, which was followed by further increase. All patients had a positive reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 obtained from respiratory tract sample and were admitted to designated Internal Medicine wards or Intensive Care Units. Demographic status, comorbidities, chronic medical therapy, vital signs, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and chest X-ray findings were recorded from all patients. Upon admission, risk of clinical deterioration was evaluated using the COVID-19 modified early warning score (COVID-19 MEWS) [5] and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [6] . Disease severity was determined in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines [7] . Components of the COVID-19 MEWS and the NIH criteria of disease severity are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 , and S3.

All patients underwent comprehensive lung ultrasound combined with bedside echocardiography within 24 h of admission. Echocardiographic and lung ultrasound examinations were performed by cardiologists with expertise in echocardiographic and lung ultrasound recording and interpretation. Necessary precautions were taken to minimize the risk of infection and disease transmission, in accordance with current guidelines [8] . Measurements of left-ventricular diameters, volumes, and ejection fraction (LVEF) were taken as recommended [9] . Left atrial (LA) volume was calculated using the biplane area length method at end systole. Forward stroke volume was calculated from the LV outflow tract followed by calculation of cardiac output (CO) and CO index. Right ventricular evaluation consisted of end-systolic and end-diastolic areas. Additionally, right-ventricular function was assessed by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), systolic tricuspid lateral annular velocity (RV S'), and fractional area change [9, 10] . Lung ultrasound examination included visualization of 6 \"windows\" on each side: superior and inferior anterior, superior and inferior antero-lateral, and superior and inferior postero-lateral. We used the following scoring system to rate the degree of lung aeration: A-lines, (normal repetitive reverberation of the pleura accompanied by lung sliding) received a score of 0. B-lines (long bands of hyperechoic artifacts representing edematous interlobular septa and/or alveoli) received one or two points, depending on weather the B-lines were separated or coalescent, respectively. Lung consolidation received three points. Ultimately, the lung ultrasound score ranged from 0 (indicating normal lung) to 36 (indicating diffused bilateral lung consolidations) [11] .",

Clinical outcomes of the two peaks were illustrated using the Kaplan-Meier model and compared using the logrank test. Adjustment for potential undetected confounders was performed using a multivariate Cox regression model that included age, gender, disease severity, and presence of three or more comorbidities. For all calculations, a p value lower than 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v25.",

            "text": "Between March 21 and July 16, 2020, 324 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center. Thirty patients were excluded as they were asymptomatic carriers admitted for either unrelated medical reasons or social arrangements (were unable to self-quarantine). Twenty-seven patients were excluded as they were discharged within less than 24 h from admission. Nine patients were excluded, since they were designated to palliative care only. Hence, the final study cohort included 258 patients, of which 131 admitted during the first peak and 127 during the second. Mean age was 63 \u00b1 18 years and 60.6% were males. Forty-seven percent of patients had at least three comorbidities, hypertension being the most frequent (50%), followed by diabetes mellitus (27%) and obesity (20%). Mean LVEF was 58 \u00b1 7% and 94% had LVEF \u2265 50%. Right ventricle was dilated in approximately 40% of patients. Echocardiographic characteristics and reference values are summarized in Table S4 . The median lung ultrasound score was 14 (7-19). The median SOFA score was similar in both peaks. Compared to patients that survived, patients that died had a higher median SOFA score in both the first and second peaks (first peak: 1 [0-2] vs 3.5 [2-8.25] , p < 0.001; second peak: 1 [0-2] vs 5 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , p < 0.001), whereas no between-peaks difference was found in the median SOFA score of patients that died (first peak: 3.5 [2-8.25 ], second peak: 5 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ; p = 0.4) and in those who survived (first peak: 1 [0-2], second peak: 1 [0-2], p = 0.66). Median COVID-19 MEWS was 3 (1-6). According to the NIH definition of disease severity, 47% presented with a mild disease, 19% with a moderate disease, 17% with a severe disease, and 17% with a critical disease. Overall, no major differences were noted between patients of the first and second peaks. Patients' baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1 .",

            "text": "The reduced 30-day mortality rate of second peak patients seen in our cohort could be attributed to several factors. It could be argued that patients of the second peak are younger or have a milder clinical course of illness. However, this seems unlikely as we show that the two groups did not differ in baseline characteristics, laboratory tests results, as well as cardiac and pulmonary imaging. Additionally, disease severity was evaluated using three different well-standardized scores, none of which showed significant difference between patients of the two peaks. Moreover, multivariate analysis adjusting for possible undetected confounding effects of disease severity, age, gender, and multiple comorbidities showed a 60.2% risk reduction for 30-day mortality. Similar observations of reduced mortality rate and reduced adjusted mortality risk of hospitalized COVID-19 over time have been reported by Horwitz et al. [12] and Dennis et al. [13] . The findings presented here are novel as they include treatment regimens of all patients. Importantly, as we further corroborate prior findings that survival of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is improving over time, our observations suggest that COVID-19-directed therapies and therapy combination may play a role. The reduced rate and adjusted risk reduction for invasive mechanical ventilation during the second peak should be interpreted cautiously, as it is a \"softer\" endpoint that was subjected to physician's discretion. Importantly, during the first peak, experts recommended early invasive ventilation [14] , whereas, toward the second peak, as local and global experience was gained, the benefits of early intubation were questioned [15, 16] , shifting the pendulum toward a practice favoring late intubation and prolonging non-invasive ventilation. Considering that the adjusted risk for non-invasive ventilation was significantly higher during the second peak, it is reasonable that the decrease in invasive mechanical ventilation was, to certain extent, due to physicians' predilection to prolong non-invasive ventilation and avoid early invasive mechanical ventilation. While it is likely that the reduction in both invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality observed in the second peak is a result of changes in medical treatment, we cannot exclude the possibility that avoiding mechanical ventilation, as a clinical approach, is at least partially accountable for the decrease in mortality during the second peak. The lack of randomization as well as the confounding by the difference in therapy regimens do not allow us to determine a causal relationship between these observations. Inspecting the SOFA score within each peak reveals that, in both peaks, not surprisingly, the patients who died were sicker (i.e., had higher SOFA score) compared to those who survived. There was no significant difference in the SOFA score of survivors between the two peaks. There was a non-significant trend toward higher SOFA score of patients who died in the second peak compared to those who died in the first peak. Taken together, these results strengthen the possibility that the change in treatment was the key for the favorable outcomes during the second peak. ",

However, pulmonary [19, 20] , as well as the characteristic laboratory coagulation abnormalities of COVID-19 patients [21] , suggest that coagulopathy plays a key role in the pathomechanism of the disease and in the respiratory failure associated with severe illness. In our previous study [22] that included the first 100 hospitalized patients of the first peak, we reported that all patients that developed popliteal and femoral deep vein thrombosis, did so while receiving prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin. Consequently, a more liberal approach favoring treatment with full-dose anticoagulation was adopted during the second peak. Notably, this change in anticoagulation strategy was not associated with increased major bleeding, suggesting that patient selection for full-dose anticoagulation was well balanced. Whether anticoagulation contributed to the decreased mortality and invasive ventilation rates observed during the second peak could not be determined from our study, and randomized-controlled trials evaluating its direct effect are ongoing.",
