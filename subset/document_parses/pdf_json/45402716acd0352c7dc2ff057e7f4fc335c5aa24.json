            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial and lasting impact on care provision, particularly in the field of cancer care. National steering has helped monitor the health situation and adapt the provision and organisation of care. Based on data from the French administrative healthcare database (SNDS) on the entire French population (67 million people), screening, diagnostic and therapeutic activity was monitored and compared 2019 on a monthly basis. A noteworthy decline in all activities (with the exception of chemotherapy) was observed during the first lockdown in France. Over the months that followed, this activity returned to normal but did not make up for the shortfall from the first lockdown. Finally, during the lockdown in late 2020, cancer care activity was conserved. In brief, in 2020, the number of mammograms decreased by 10% (\u2212 492,500 procedures) , digestive endoscopies by 19% (\u2212 648,500), and cancer-related excision by 6% (\u2212 23,000 surgical procedures). Hospital radiotherapy activity was down 3.8% (\u2212 4400 patients) and that in private practice was down 1.4% (\u2212 1600 patients). Chemotherapy activity increased by 2.2% (7200 patients), however. To summarize, COVID-19 had a very substantial impact during the first lockdown. Safeguarding cancer care activity helped limit this impact over the months that followed, but the situation remains uncertain. Further studies on the medium-and long-term impact on individuals (survival, recurrence, after-effects) will be conducted.",

This had led the health authorities to propose new strategies, prioritise cancer patients, and take action in the uncertainty. In this context, the French National Cancer Institute has set up, with support from the French Ministry for Health, a national steering and monitoring committee in concert with major national and regional stakeholders in cancer care and user representatives. It is organised in a regional structure via local and regional steering committees, helping pass on alerts and important information, and report, on a national level, innovative and exemplary organisations along with issues encountered on a regional level.",

The activity in the months following the easing of lockdown restrictions failed to bridge the gap observed, with activity reaching a similar level to the previous year. Over the last months of the year, greater activity was observed in 2020 for mammograms, prostate biopsies, and excisions as a whole. Nevertheless, for oesophageal cancers and ENT cancers, the activity remained lower in 2020 compared to 2019 even at year end. Unlike the first lockdown, the restrictions applied from the end of October 2020 were not associated with a significant decrease in activity, suggesting a safeguarding of cancer care activity and the application of the guidelines issued following the first lockdown.",

A further advantage of this study is that it covered a population of 67 million inhabitants, and included all patients regardless of their social or economic status or insurance scheme. Due to its exhaustive nature, it made it possible to monitor the health impact of the different lockdown periods, and of the different measures following the first lockdown and applied during subsequent months.",

            "text": "A number of lessons can be taken from these scorecards. During the first lockdown in March 2020, a substantial decline in activity as a whole was observed, both for the diagnostic and treatment activity. In the case of the latter, a lag occurred with a slight decrease in activity during March, but a later recovery came in June after the lockdown was lifted in May. This particularly reflects the impact of the health crisis on scheduled activity www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (particularly surgical activity). Furthermore, the shortfall in activity was not bridged in the months that followed the lifting of the lockdown. A further lesson relates to the lockdown initiated in November 2020. Unlike the first lockdown, the directives given to safeguard diagnostic and therapeutic activities in cancer care appear to have been followed, thus limiting the impact of this further lockdown period. The impact of the health crisis is observed in many countries. For example, in the USA, several studies on medico-administrative databases report decreases of over 75% in breast, colorectal and cervical cancer screening activity during lockdown 12, 18, 19 . Similar findings are observed in Europe, with treatment-related activity also being impacted, with changes in practices and times to complete treatments [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

Indeed, even though the aim is to enable accurate steering of the health crisis, these scorecards provide a good overview of the situation. This limitation is explained by the need to obtain exhaustive data. In the context of COVID-19, it is necessary to have daily monitoring of all hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in order to adapt health measures on a day-by-day basis. As regards cancer care activity monitoring, it is necessary to differentiate between a decrease in activity due to underreporting (lack of exhaustive data) and an actual decrease in activity. Furthermore, the measures adopted by the authorities on a national and local level and by www.nature.com/scientificreports/ healthcare professionals are measures to be applied over subsequent weeks or even months and do not require day-to-day steering. Following on from these scorecards, further processing may be conducted to study the impact on a department or regional level. This could be compared to the spread of the virus in these areas. Besides these scorecards which do not allow monitoring of diagnostic and treatment activity for each individual, it would be beneficial to conduct follow-up studies on cancer patients' care pathways. It will then be possible to estimate times to treatment, the potential transfer of activity particularly from surgery to chemotherapy and hormone therapy, or the forgoing of care. The number of chemotherapy inpatients is slightly higher in 2020, and there may be a carryover to oral therapies in non-hospital settings. The number of patients treated with radiotherapy is also lower, suggesting that the decrease in the number of sessions is not only due to the higher frequency of hypofractionated regimens. Follow-up studies will also help assess the impact of the current health crisis on recurrence and survival rates.",
