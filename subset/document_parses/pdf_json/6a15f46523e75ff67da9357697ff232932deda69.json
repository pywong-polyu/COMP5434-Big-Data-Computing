Little is known whether adjustments affected the success of weight reduction. Weight reduction of at least 5% is related to improved fertility and better pregnancy outcomes in obese women. This study compared success of the weight loss program in infertile polycystic ovary syndrome women with obesity who attended the program before and during lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we checked whether there were any differences in spontaneous pregnancy rates between both groups at the end of the program. Methods: Altogether, 27 women were prospectively included to the weight loss program. Twelve women attended the 8 -week program before COVID-19 pandemic. Fifteen women began the program before the lockdown and ended it during lockdown. Due to lockdown, the program was prolonged for 4 weeks and taken online.

Discussion/Conclusions: Although statistical significance has not been reached in the present study, we have shown that lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic has led to almost half lower BMI reduction despite adaptations and longer duration of the weight loss program. On average, BMI in the group of women that attended the program during lockdown was 3.7% lower after the end of the weight loss program. This means they did not reach the wanted 5% reduction which is known to improve fertility. We have also shown that weight reduction is the correct approach for treating infertile women with obesity, as almost 30% of those who reduced their body weight by 5% or more conceived spontaneously.",

Obesity exacerbates pathophysiological and clinical findings of PCOS and is associated with worse reproductive, endocrine, metabolic, and social functioning [5, 6] . Women with obesity and women with PCOS have lower spontaneous as well as IVF pregnancy rates [7] [8] [9] .

Initially, exercises were simple and technically undemanding. No jumps and rapid changes of direction were performed, but the exercises were designed to involve as many muscle groups as possible at the same time. Exercise units were mostly designed as an interval training with limited time intervals, where the ratio between the duration of the break and the exercise changed. Training sessions became more demanding over time (heavier forms, increase in the amplitude of movement, decrease or increase of the support surface, and shortened break time) and longer (extended interval time from 30 s/15 s-60 s/30 s -exercise/break ratio, increased number of repetitions, increased number of series). A polygon was also included in the exercise, which included crawling, running between cones and side running. At the end of the main part, high-intensity workout called \"Tabata\" was occasionally performed (8 intervals -20 s/10 s exercise/break ratio).

The first study group began and ended their weight loss program in 2019, prior to COVID-19 pandemic. They attended a group live exercise program twice a week besides exercising at home twice weekly. The second group of women started their weight loss program in February 2020. On March 16, 2020, Slovenia went under complete lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. Sports centers were closed, and group exercise was forbidden. Therefore, we needed to adapt the weight loss program and instead of having live exercise sessions at the gym twice weekly, sessions were performed online, through ZOOM application. These women also exercised at home twice weekly. Due to this adaptation, we decided to prolong the program for the second study group for 6 weeks.",

Endocrine disturbances are common in PCOS and biochemical hiperandrogenism occurs in 78.2% of PCOS women [22] . According to different studies, androgen hypersecretion negatively affects conception. In a study of Ramezanali et al. [23] , a combination of hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation in PCOS women was associated with lower clinical pregnancy rates in IVF procedures. Furthermore, a study comparing concentrations of free and total androgens in pregnancy and nonpregnancy cycles has shown that follicular phase androgen levels were significantly lower in cycles where pregnancy was achieved [24] . Overall however, measured endocrine parameters mostly showed an improvement after the weight loss program in both study groups. This finding is in accordance with other studies which have shown that weight reduction reduces testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels and increases sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations [4] . It seems that these changes are responsible for the improvement of PCOS related signs and symptoms in PCOS women with obesity.",
