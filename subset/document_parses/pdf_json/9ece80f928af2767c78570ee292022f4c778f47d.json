Many people were hosed via water cannons, attacked by police dogs, beaten, and jailed; several were killed in their fight for equality. The Black Lives Matter Movement was a response to the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager who was shot to death by a vigilante killer, George Zimmerman in Florida. Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013 which resulted in public outrage and numerous protests. \"Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise. It is an affirmation of Black folks' contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression\" (Garza, 2014) . Although there has been some progress in eliminating some of the institutional, legalized racial discriminatory laws that can be traced back to the beginning of this country such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, \"separate but equal\" schools, and prohibitions regarding voting or owning land, racial disparities are still readily apparent when examining white lives versus Black lives in this country.",

This discussion also focused on the repeated shooting of Blacks by police officers across America. The ISP Board of Directors decided that the organization could not ignore what was happening in this country nor could it ignore the fact that ISP has always been a predominantly White organization. The ISP Board of Directors decided that ISP must address racism in the organization and engage in actions to become an antiracist organization. ISP joined many other national and international organizations and institutions to confront and address racism sooner rather than later. ISP started its work by making a concerted effort to diversify the board of directors and the general membership; there has been some progress in this area.",

However, recent events have once again brought to the forefront of our collective consciousness the painful fact that is, for too many of us, common knowledge: the repeated injustices experienced by Blacks in American are not relics of the past. They thrive in the modern day: The slaying of Almaud Arbery while jogging in Brunswick, GA; the shooting death of Breonna Taylor by police in Louisville, KY in her own apartment; the racist accusation of violence against Christian Cooper in New York City's Central Park; the desperate cry of 'I can't breathe' from the voice of Manual Ellis, Tacoma, WA who was tasered, cuffed and later died in police custody; and most recently, the tragic killing of George Floyd who when restrained by the police cried out, 'I can't breathe.' These senseless killings stem from the pervasiveness of white supremacy in law enforcement and racialized policing that must be disavowed and dismantled. ISP affirms all of the painful feelings experienced by Black and brown people in America. The grief, anger, and pure frustration firmly justified by our nation's deep-seated racist history. We know that all institutions by nature are steeped in privilege and have done little to recognize, validate and affirm this scourge on black and brown communities. Statements are not enough. It is incumbent upon the social work community to recognize that we all bear responsibility for this ongoing injustice, and that we are capable of proactive steps to address it, if only we have the courage and will. As part of the social work and social policy community, ISP recognizes and accepts our responsibility for this ongoing injustice and commits to take proactive steps toward change. Therefore, ISP will work with our supporters and our partner organizations to do everything within our power to dismantle the shameful and deadly systemic oppression of black and brown people (Influencing Social Policy, 2020).",

It is always difficult to reassess an organization's mission, core values, and bylaws, yet ISP is using an antiracist lens for this reassessment. This work requires each board member to engage in a personal journey and develop some awareness of their implicit and explicit biases. \"Bias is a cognitive phenomenon that denotes a preference toward a certain perspective or ideology; this preference can interfere with one's ability to be objective, impartial, or unprejudiced\" (Harris, 2021, p. 141) . A deep understanding of one's own implicit (unconscious) and explicit (conscious) biases is crucial to dismantle internalized racial oppression and a difficult and often painful experience for many individuals, especially those who have lived and benefitted from white privilege.",

The Anti-Racist Action Committee (ARAC) will develop a set of anti-racist principles, goals, and action items, and will monitor the work undertaken by ISP's standing committees to transform ISP into an antiracist organization. The committee's goals and progress will be reported to the Board of Directors semi-annually and published on the website. The ARAC will include ISP Board members (including a member of the Executive Committee) and non-Board members. The other action is a requirement that all ISP Board members participate in Undoing Racism training that will be conducted by the Peoples Institute for Survival and Beyond, New Orleans, Louisiana, in July 2021. \"The People's Institute for Survival and Beyond is a national collective of anti-racist, multicultural community organizes and educators dedicated to building an effective movement for social transformation\" (The People's Institute for Survival and Beyond, 2020).",
