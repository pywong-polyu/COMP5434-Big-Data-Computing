Evidence regarding detection, management, and monitoring of COVID-19eassociated coagulopathy is still missing. We propose to describe the thrombus viscoelastic properties to investigate the mechanisms of hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed in 24 consecutive patients admitted to a single intensive care unit for COVID-19 pneumonia, and 10 had a second TEG before being discharged alive from the intensive care unit. Results: Compared with a group of 20 healthy participants, patients with COVID-19 had significantly decreased values of reaction time, coagulation time, and lysis index and increased values of a angle, maximum amplitude, clot strength, and coagulation index. Velocity curves were consistent with increased generation of thrombin. These values persisted in surviving patients despite their good clinical course. Discussion: In patients with COVID-19, TEG demonstrates a complex and prolonged hypercoagulable state including fast initiation of coagulation and clot reinforcement, low fibrinolysis, high potential of thrombin generation, and high fibrinogen and platelet contribution. The antithrombotic strategy in patients with COVID-19 during intensive care hospitalisation and after discharge should be investigated in further studies.",

            "text": "After China, the whole world is now facing the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This unprecedented outbreak has caused a global health crisis and is straining health systems, especially the intensive care units (ICUs), because around 15% of the hospitalised patients require critical care. 1 A high number of both venous thromboembolism and arterial thrombotic complications have been reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19. 2 Some authors found an incidence up to 69% of venous thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 hospitalised in ICUs; the incidence was still elevated to 56% even among patients who were given therapeutic anticoagulation. 3 In another series of 100 patients with COVID-19 and severe clinical features, a 23% incidence of acute pulmonary embolism has been reported. 4 These complications appear to be related to a hypercoagulable state, but its mechanism remains unclear. COVID-19 is associated with coagulopathy that correlates with disease severity. 5 Abnormal coagulation parameters, especially elevated levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products, have been associated with poor prognosis. 6 For its part, anticoagulant therapy may reduce mortality in selected patients. 7 Prophylactic doses of low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH) have been recommended for all patients requiring hospital admission for COVID-19. 8 However, evidence regarding detection, management, and monitoring of COVID-19eassociated coagulopathy is still missing.",

Owing to the high incidence of thromboembolic events reported during the COVID-19 outbreak, we decided, as a standard of care, to assess haemostasis by thromboelastography (TEG) in all the patients admitted to the ICU.

Within 30 min after the patient's citrated whole blood sample had been collected, blood coagulation was accelerated by the addition of one millilitre of blood into the manufacturer-supplied activating solution containing kaolin, phospholipids, and buffered stabilisers. From this vial, 340 mL was drawn and recalcified with 20 mL of calcium chloride (200 mM) within a specific plastic cup for TEG use. Each sample was run simultaneously with and without added heparinase to neutralise the presence of LMWH or unfractionated heparin (UFH) and determine the baseline coagulation profile. According to the manufacturer's recommendations, the selected result was the one achieved with heparinase if there was any evidence of interference with heparin.",

Some featured parameters are used to describe the TEG trace and are detailed in Fig. 1A . The split point (minutes) is the elapsed time until the earliest resistance detected by the TEG analyser. The reaction time (R, minutes) is the elapsed time to reach a 2-mm amplitude on the TEG trace. The delta parameter (D, minutes) is the difference between the R and split point. The coagulation time (K, minutes) is the time interval from the R until the trace reaches a 20-mm amplitude. The a angle (a, degrees) is the slope of the line joining R and K. The maximum amplitude (MA, mm) refers to the maximum amplitude of the TEG trace. The clot strength (G, dyn/cm 2 ) is a calculated value derived from the MA parameter (G \u00bc (5000MA/(100-MA)). The lysis index (LY30, percentage) is the amplitude reduction percentage 30 min after the MA.

Although it has been recommended to check for the occurrence of DIC, none of our patients reached a DIC score of 5, and the highest scores were only due to isolated increase in the D-dimer level. 8 COVID-19erelated coagulopathy seems to be mainly a severe hypercoagulable state. 15 This may explain why the rate of venous and arterial thrombotic complications we observed was so high, but consistent with the other data in the literature. 4 Our study highlights the relevance of TEG for exploring hypercoagulable profiles. Routine clotting assay provides limited information regarding the overall haemostatic competency of a patient. Standard tests do not include the participation of platelets in the coagulation process, and the end point of clotting assays is the formation of fibrin, that occurs whereas less than 5% of the total thrombin has been generated. 16 TEG provides a comprehensive view of coagulation and hypercoagulability mechanisms. 17 Enzymatic contribution to clot formation is assessed using the R value; it has also been reported that a D value lower than 0.6, as we found in our study, might reveal an enzymatic hypercoagulability. 18 K values and the a angle explore the rate of clot strengthening and are representative of thrombin cleaving of the available fibrinogen into fibrin. 18 Contribution of fibrinogen and platelet to clot strength is assessed by MA and G parameters. 19 Finally, TEG is also a simple method for fibrinolysis assay. 20 Our findings suggest that COVID-19 coagulopathy is a hypercoagulable state related to all of these parameters, even if fibrinogen and platelet participation appears to be paramount. These results are consistent with recent research on the viscoelastic characteristics of the clot in patients with COVID-19, based on TEG or rotational thromboelastometry, which describe a similar prothrombotic state with supranormal clot firmness. 21, 22 The hypofibrinolytic state has also been reported. 23 However, our study is to our knowledge the first including velocity curves. These curves allow evaluating the profile of thrombus generation in whole blood under in vivo conditions. It was previously demonstrated that TTG was significantly correlated with the generation of thrombin assessed by the thrombineantithrombin complex. 24 We observed greatly increased values of TTG and MRTG, as well as a decreased TMRTG, which reveal high potential for thrombin generation.",

As an easy, real-time, and widely available point-of-care technique, TEG may help to identify at-risk patients and to provide tailored antithrombotic prophylaxis. 28 Because of a lack of statistical significance, we did not find any association between the TEG values and the occurrence of thromboembolic events. However, in other studies, elevated MA values 29 or fibrinolysis shutdown 23 was associated with a high rate of thrombotic events. Concerning high platelet involvement, some authors reported the addition of antiplatelet drugs when the platelet count was higher than 400 \u00c2 10 9 /L. 26 Hyperfibrinogenemia, for its part, could lead to heparin resistance. 30 Some authors advocate for prolonged systemic anticoagulation using UFH. 15 While one author reported a return to normal of the viscoelastic parameters in COVID-19esurvived patients, we are concerned about the persistence of a hypercoagulable state in surviving patients despite their good clinical course. 26 Given this finding, the question of the continuation and duration of antithrombotic prophylaxis after ICU discharge should be evaluated.",
