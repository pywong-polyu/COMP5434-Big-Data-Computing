            "text": "Background: During social distancing, resident mentorship may be an unmet need. Telementorship, mentorship through video conferencing software, presents a unique approach to overcome these challenges. Aims: This study evaluated whether telementorship through video conference increased access to mentorship encounters and decreased perceived barriers to access, factors that determine likelihood to maintain mentor relationships, and quality of mentorship. Methods: A year-long randomized, prospective cohort study was conducted in 2016-2017 with pairs of resident mentors from seven different training programs and medical student mentees, randomized to telementorship or in-person mentorship. The number of quarterly encounters was monitored and demographic predictors of meeting were determined. Likert scale survey responses were analyzed with linear regression. Results: Forty-three of 46 (93.5%) volunteer mentor-mentee pairs participated. Telementorship did not alter likelihood of meeting or attitudes toward mentorship barriers (time and distance). Mentee satisfaction increased from 42.5% to 65.4% (P<0.05) throughout the year. Operating room-based practice (P<0.05) and higher postgraduate level (P=0.02) decreased the likelihood of meeting. Conclusion: Telementorship provided an equal number of encounters compared to the pairs who were asked to meet in-person. Telementorship may serve as an adjunct modality for flexible communication. Relevance for Patients: Medical mentorship is a key component to medical education. Effective mentorship increases academic research productivity, job satisfaction, and advancement of clinical skills, which translate to improved patient care.",

The majority of mentorship literature in medicine focuses on training faculty to become better mentors [12] [13] [14] . However, there is little literature that evaluates telementorship for professional mentorship of medical students. When trainees are studied, they are commonly in the mentee role within specific training programs [15] [16] [17] [18] .

The substitution of telementorship for in-person encounters did not alter the likelihood of meetings, indicating that mentorship was just as likely to occur remotely as in-person. Even though the type of meetings that occurred between each group was not significantly different over the year, the second quarter meeting frequency was nearly identical in occurrence. We attribute this to chance as there were no other external factors that influenced the participants more so during the second quarter. In addition, because the differences in meetings each quarter were statistically insignificant, we believe that the difference in meetings each quarter was due to chance. Regardless of group assignment, medical student mentees had increased confidence in each core domain that was examined ( Figure 3 ). Commonly published barriers to mentorship, including the time cost of arranging in-person mentorship encounters and distance, were confirmed as barriers in this study [8] [9] [10] . The number of mentorship encounters did reduce throughout the year. We hypothesize that given 85% of medical student mentees who were second year medical students, their academic focus shifted to studying for the USMLE step two examination. Increased PGY level and OR-based specialties were less likely to maintain quarterly meetings, which may be attributed to less scheduling flexibility. Interestingly, more female resident mentors n=27 (67.5%) and female medical student mentees n=27 (65.9%) participated in the study than males, which has not been well documented in the literature. Further studies are needed to clarify if this was a local phenomenon or representative of a larger trend.",

It is unknown if this is a local phenomenon or a symptom of a wider endemic of resident well-being. The majority of residents and medical students were interested in continuing their mentor relationship, encouraging the development of an ongoing culture of mentorship training for residents.

However, participation rates in previously published mentorship studies have reported similar attrition [1, 30] . Second, as a pilot study, there were uninvestigated areas, including the length of the mentorship meetings between groups and additional meetings outside of the assigned quarterly meetings. Given the volunteered time of the mentors and mentees and number of other surveys being administered, we limited the number of outcomes measured in this pilot study. It is possible that unmeasured data, including meetings outside of the formal program, may have biased the results in unpredictable directions. Third, this study recruited volunteers, which may have resulted in selection bias, favoring participants who already value mentorship. Fourth, the survey instruments were not tested for construct validity before utilization in this study. All attempts were made to utilize clear language with scale anchors. There were no queries or clarifications by participants. Fifth, this study enabled mentors and mentees to meet face to face and engage in activities before transitioning to a virtual relationship, which distinguishes our approach from fully online mentorship. Last, the intervention was performed at a single institution. The results may not be transferrable to other institutions with different demographics.",
