However, convalescent HCWs may shed SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA for prolonged periods. Methods 40 healthy HCWs off work because of ongoing positive RT-PCR results in combined nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs following SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited to participate in this study. These HCWs had been in self-isolation because of a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NP and OP swabs as well as a blood sample were collected from each participant. RT-PCR and virus isolation was performed with each swab sample and serum neutralization test as well as two different ELISA tests were performed on all serum samples. Results No viable virions could be detected in any of 29 nasopharyngeal and 29 oropharyngeal swabs taken from 15 longtime carriers. We found SARSCoV-2 RNA in 14/29 nasopharyngeal and 10/29 oropharyngeal swabs obtained from screening 15 HCWs with previous COVID-19 up to 55 days after symptom onset. Six (40%) of the 15 initially positive HCWs converted to negative and later reverted to positive again according to their medical records. All but one HCW, a healthy volunteer banned from work, showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in concomitantly taken blood samples. Late threshold cycle (Ct) values in RT-PCR [mean 37.4; median 37.3; range 30.8-41.7] and the lack of virus growth in cell culture indicate that despite the positive PCR results no infectivity remained. Conclusion We recommend lifting isolation if the RT-PCR Ct-value of a naso-or oropharyngeal swab sample is over 30. Positive results obtained from genes targeted with Ct-values > 30 correspond to non-viable/noninfectious particles that are still detected by RT-PCR. In case of Ct-values lower than 30, a blood sample from the patient should be tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. If positive, non-infectiousness can also be assumed.",

            "text": "In Austria, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first documented in January 2020 [1] . As the disease progressed all over Austria, increasing numbers of infected health care workers (HCWs) contributed to long periods of absence in the system-relevant infrastructure, placing an unprecedented strain on the healthcare systems. Current guidance (by ECDC [2] ) regarding ending isolation for HCWs requires two negative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from respiratory specimens gained at 24 h interval, taken at least 8 days after the onset of symptoms. However, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding with a median duration of 53 days and a maximum of 83 days has been reported recently in 36 patients by Li et al. [3] . In another study, median viral shedding duration of 20 days was observed with a maximum of 37 days [4] . In the context of HCWs, these facts lead to long periods of sick leave, potentially causing staff shortage in hospitals and a potential overload of the healthcare service. As there is no consistent evidence that viral nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR automatically equates to infectivity, these periods of absence may be longer than necessary. The aim of our evaluation was to determine if the infectious virus can be isolated from upper respiratory tract samples from clinically recovered HCWs with continued SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding and to match these data with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in serum.",

Currently, it is not clear what role neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) play during a SARS-CoV-2 infection [15] . NAb titers in the early stages of the infection are inversely correlated with subsequent viral loads, measured as RNA copies in sputum and throat swabs, but are directly correlated with a more severe subsequent disease [8] . People with mildly symptomatic infections not requiring hospitalization generally have far weaker antibody responses than patients who develop the most severe disease, also in the oldest ones [16, 17] . Wu et al. tested 175 patients who had recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19; in 10 cases (5.7%) NAbs were undetectable [18] . This percentage correlates very well with our finding, where 1/13 (7.7%) participants lacked any detectable NAbs. Undetectable NAbs must not be misunderstood as evidence for lack of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severe disease. Gallais et al. recently stated, that some contacts of patients with COVID-19, who failed to seroconvert, already show evidence of T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the development of non-humoral immunity or prior T-cell immunity due to a previous infection with other coronaviruses [19] .",

However, no prolonged isolation of persons recovered from such viral infections is demanded by public health authorities. Based on our findings of the absence of culturable virus in respiratory swabs from convalescent SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedders, we recommend revising present guidelines; we propose de-isolation of HCWs clinically recovered from COVID-19, despite positive RT-PCR results, from swabs gained after at least 8 days of isolation. If the threshold cycle of the RT-PCR of a naso-or oropharyngeal swab is over 30, the person can be considered non-infectious and isolation can be repealed. Positive results obtained from genes targeted with Ct-values over 30 are most likely due to non-viable/noninfectious particles that are still detected by RT-PCR. In case of a threshold cycle, lower than or equal to 30, a serum neutralization test (SNT) should be performed on the convalescent HCW. If the latter is positive, non-infectiousness could be assumed. We acknowledge that SNT is not available in all laboratories and is time-consuming and expensive. Our data suggest that there is a correlation between levels of IgG antibodies and the probability of detecting neutralizing antibodies. However, no ELISA cut-off level could be determined. Further studies will be needed to show the suitability of IgG antibody levels for the determination of infectiousness.",
