Lower heart rate is associated with better survival in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a disease mostly caused by sepsis. In our study, we hypnotized that use of ivardrabine as heart rate reducing agent in septic patient with renal impairment may improve renal function. Results: Fifty patients with sepsis with early renal impairment were divided in 1: 1 ratio to receive Ivabradine (group I) or not (group C). The average age of the included patients was almost 45 years, chest disorders were the main cause of sepsis in both groups. There were statistically significant differences between both groups in terms of reduction of heart rate group (I) (68.13 \u00b1 3.34) versus (group C) (87.04 \u00b1 3.23) and (P < 0.001) also, improvement in eGFR by Cystatin c in group (I) (103.32 \u00b1 6.96) versus (group C) (96.25 \u00b1 6.36) and (P < 0.001) also vasopressor dosage consumption (P < 0.001). As regards secondary outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences between study's groups in terms of length of hospital stay (P = 0.390), need for hemodialysis (P = 0.384), and mortality (P = 1.000). Conclusions: We concluded that Ivabradine as an adjuvant therapy in septic patients with renal impairment is promising agent to reduce such impairment.",
