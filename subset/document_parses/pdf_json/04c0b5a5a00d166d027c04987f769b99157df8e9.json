This multi-stage estimation of the model parameters offers a better model fit compared to the whole period analysis and shows how the COVID-19's infection patterns change over time, primarily depending on the effectiveness of the public health authority's non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Methods: This paper uses the SEIR(D) compartment model to simulate and estimate the parameters for three distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, using a manually compiled COVID-19 epidemic dataset for the period between 18 February 2020 and 08 February 2021. The paper identifies three major stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, conducts multi-stage estimations of the SEIR(D) model parameters, and carefully infers context-dependent meaning of the estimation results to help better understand the unique patterns of the transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in each stage.",

In the real-world, however, the susceptible population is not homogeneous. Nor is it that the one-time transmission dynamics captured by the estimated model parameters stay constant throughout the whole period of observation. More importantly, the public health authority's non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), even in the absence of vaccines and medical treatments, can significantly alter the value of parameters, drastically changing the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. [6, 7] Given this real-world complexity, to what extent one can safely rely on existing SIR-based epidemic models to analyse the COVID-19 pandemic becomes a controversial issue. This paper addresses this problem by demonstrating that carefully calibrated epidemic models used in a particular epidemiological context can better capture potentially time-varying and context dependent parameters. These context dependent and time-varying parameters can then be used to evaluate the relative effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical policy interventions to the COVID-19 in each stage. The analysis in this paper can offer a useful insight into both developing a better theoretical model and evaluating existing public health policies.",

The immediate trigger of this second spike was also related with another super spreader event that was more political in nature: A conservative opposition party and some Christian fundamentalist factions joined their forces to hold a massive political demonstration at the centre of the capital city, Seoul, blaming the government's various epidemic mitigation strategies. Unlike the first wave, however, the public health authority was unable to implement proper public healthcare measures such as enlisting and conducting pre-emptive diagnostic testing for suspected patients who participated in the political rally. Leading figures of Christian fundamentalist movements fiercely opposed the public heath authority's healthcare measures and even instructed their members not to fully cooperate with the authority. Consequently, it took much longer time for the Korean health authority to bring down the number of daily confirmed cases below 100 (only by 20 September 2020), and it is not even clear whether the second wave was suppressed at all.",

Compared to the previous two waves, the latest phase of the infection dynamics does not seem to be associated with any single super spreader event. Instead, it stems from persistent small scale and multi-sited infection cases found in childcare and elderly care facilities as well as private education, various entertainment facilities and religious venues throughout the country. The median age of newly confirmed cases is also lower than during the second wave, as increasing numbers of younger asymptomatic patients are suspected to spread virus variants that are likely to be more infectious and deadlier to some demographic groups.",

The SIRS model (also called the SIS model in the literature) is to account for this reinfection case. It is also possible to build a model that captures the proportion of infected yet asymptomatic patients among those who are infected. In this case, we are classifying the total number of infected population group into either asymptomatic or severely symptomatic sub-groups. Of course, any combination of these secondary models is possible as long as the proposed models are used to successfully reveal various hidden aspects of the COVID19 epidemic with sound statistical reasoning and data",
