This provides persuasive evidence that capital markets reacted particularly negative during this period, reflecting higher degrees of uncertainty. We furthermore find that larger firms experience a better SEO performance and that COVID-19 related biotech & healthcare firms react particularly negative. This effect is more negative the lower the company valuation beforehand.",

The WHO declared the disease to be a pandemic on the 11th of March, when COVID-19 was already spreading exponentially in the U.S. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021; WHO 2020).

Stock markets have been very volatile since the pandemic's inception with persistent high degrees of uncertainty, arguably making it harder for companies to obtain equity financing. With this paper we address the question on how markets value the announcement of a firm's seasoned equity offering (SEO) during these extraordinary times. To this end, we study the stock price reactions to SEO announcements in the United States. Further, we examine whether the announcement effect's heterogeneity can be explained by a firm's affiliation to a certain industry. This is a natural question as industries are affected quite differently by the pandemic and the lockdown measures taken to control its course. We are particularly interested in the most attractive industry segment during the pandemic, namely the COVID-19 related biotech and healthcare industry. These companies are affected quite differently by the pandemic than companies from other industries in the sense that the pandemic provides earnings growth opportunities for these firms while it is generally bad news for other firms. For this, we examine a representative sample of 297 SEO issues announced in the US between 11.03.2020-the date the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic-and 30.09.2020.",

Different industries face diverse challenges and chances during the pandemic. We thereby explore the mechanism of the SEO announcement effect during a crisis. We find that companies that profit from the crisis incur a more negative announcement effect, which may indicate higher degrees of information asymmetry. Former studies have tried to capture and explain the announcement effect in general (Masulis and Korwar 1986; Mikkelson and Partch 1986; Myers and Majluf 1984) . Recent studies have focused on more specific questions like on offer date revisions, customer supplier relationships, or weekday of the announcement (Chan et al. 2018; Johnson et al. 2018; Michaely et al. 2016) . This paper examines the relevance of individual stock run-ups (Masulis and Korwar 1986) , firm valuation (Jung et al. 1996) , firm size (Guo and Mech 2000) , profitability (Mueller 1972; Myers and Majluf 1984) and deal size (Intintoli and Kahle 2010) . We thereby find that only firm size yields significant explanatory power during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

First, following the implied cashflow hypothesis, the announcement of a SEO signals that the firm's managers anticipate lower future cashflows (Miller and Rock 1985) . Consequently, a firm's leverage needs to be reduced in order to maximize its valuation (DeAngelo and Masulis 1980) . Hence, a rational investor reacts negatively to a SEO announcement. This theory is supported by empirical evidence provided by Downes and Heinkel (1982) and Masulis and Korwar (1986) . A second explanation considers market timing and states that the management of a firm acts in favor of existing shareholders. Thus, managers, having superior information to the market, issue new equity only when the firm's stock price is overvalued (Myers and Majluf 1984) . Consequently, rational investors discount the stock price after a SEO announcement, as the firm's management has signaled that the stock is overvalued. This theory is also related to the pecking order hypothesis as the deviation from the pecking order signals a possible overvaluation (Myers 1984) . The impact of information asymmetry between a firm's managers and potential stockholders on the announcement effect is supported empirically by numerous studies, such as those by Eckbo and Masulis (1995) , Masulis and Korwar (1986) and Dierkens (1991) or more recently Demiralp et al. (2011) .",

It can be argued that uncertainty regarding the firm's value and information asymmetry is less pronounced during expansionary periods. Accordingly, more firms issue equity during these favorable market conditions (Henderson et al. 2006) . This also corresponds with findings that show that price reactions are two percentage points less severe in hot markets than in cold markets (Bayless and Chaplinsky 1996) . Bayless and Chaplinsky differentiate regarding the timing of SEOs, introducing hot periods and cold periods. These findings are robust to the different macroeconomic characteristics of the hot and cold periods. Firms with a higher price-to-book ratio experience less pronounced price reactions upon SEO announcement. Dierkens (1991) argues that a high price-to-book ratio can be found with firms that have predominantly intangible assets and valuable projects.",

We focus on companies whose business models are positively related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 On the one hand, these \"winners\" of the pandemic are more likely to be overvalued and therefore experience more negative SEO announcement effects. On the other hand, firms with \"the most valuable investment opportunities do not experience adverse stock returns when they issue equity\" (Jung et al. 1996) . As such, companies with business models that profit from the growth opportunities brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic should experience no or less pronounced adverse stock returns. As these growth opportunities did not just emerge with the SEO announcement but existed before it could be assumed that these should be priced in sufficiently.

(1996) . \u2022 Firm size as measured by the logarithm of its market capitalization following Guo and Mech (2000) . \u2022 Profitability measured by the return on equity, analogous to Myers and Majluf (1984) or Mueller (1972) . \u2022 The deal size of the seasoned equity offering divided by the market capitalization, corresponding to Intintoli and Kahle (2010) . We are primarily interested in whether the SEO announcement effect differs significantly across industries. Latest research provides evidence that government restrictions and social distancing are the main reasons for the strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock market (Baker et al. 2020) . As certain industries are hit harder by the measures taken by governments, industry affiliation might also explain different reactions to SEO announcements during the pandemic. A particularly interesting industry is COVID-19 related biotech and healthcare, as these companies are affected quite differently by the pandemic in the sense that the pandemic provides earnings growth opportunities for these firms while it is generally bad news for other firms. We also add interaction terms of industry affiliation with the stock run-up and the price-to-book ratio, respectively. Table 6 shows the estimation results of the cross-sectional regression analysis. Column I thereby shows the regression with the control variables alone which explain 15% of the dependent variable's variation. The logarithmized market capitalization has a highly significant and positive influence on the announcement effect, implying that larger firms experience less negative abnormal returns upon SEO announcement. This finding is in line with the theory of Guo and Mech (2000) regarding firm size and information asymmetry.",

Compared to prior literature on SEO announcements in non-crisis times this constitutes a considerably more negative price reaction. We show that larger firms have a more positive SEO performance. In the context of the COVID pandemic, one particular explanation might be the reason for this pronounced effect. To limit the negative consequences on a firm level, governments passed bills and enacted instruments to offer additional liquidity. However, as an experience from the global financial crisis, markets are aware that this kind of public support comes fastest and easiest for the largest corporations. This may serve as an explanation for better financing conditions for larger firms. This paper further shows that COVID-19 related biotech and healthcare companies experience a more negative SEO announcement effect of \u2212 6.73% and that within this industry the effect is influenced positively by the firms' valuation. This presents a remarkable result as this is an exceptional industry in the sense that the pandemic provides earnings growth opportunities for these firms while it is generally bad news for other firms. The fact that these firms exhibit a particularly negative SEO announcement effect points towards lower levels of investor confidence with respect to these firms' valuation. When being put to test by a SEO announcement, investors adjust their valuation conservatively. Especially COVID-19 related biotech and healthcare firms with a lower valuation experience lower return, as these companies are generally considered to have less earnings growth potential which seems to be further detrimental to the investor confidence. COVID-19 related companies with ongoing growth opportunities and, therefore, only short-term liquidity needs show highly significantly more positive stock market reactions to their announcements compared to firms with lower valuations. All these companies that should profit most from the pandemic nevertheless experience intensified negative market reactions compared to other industries. Nonetheless, investors are highly reflective of the reasons for capital increases in this industry and discriminate between their reaction accordingly.",
