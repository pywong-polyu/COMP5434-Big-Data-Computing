            "text": "Recently, a new coronavirus was isolated from the lung tissue of autopsy sample and nasal/throat swabs of the patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the causative association with SARS was determined. To reveal further the characteristics of the virus and to provide insight about the molecular mechanism of SARS etiology, a proteomic strategy was utilized to identify the structural proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) isolated from Vero E6 cells infected with the BJ-01 strain of the virus. At first, Western blotting with the convalescent sera from SARS patients demonstrated that there were various structural proteins of SARS-CoV in the cultured supernatant of virus infected-Vero E6 cells and that nucleocaspid (N) protein had a prominent immunogenicity to the convalescent sera from the patients with SARS, while the immune response of spike (S) protein probably binding with membrane (M) glycoprotein was much weaker. Then, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to separate the complex protein constituents, and the strategy of continuous slicing from loading well to the bottom of the gels was utilized to search thoroughly the structural proteins of the virus. The proteins in sliced slots were trypsinized in-gel and identified by mass spectrometry. Three structural proteins named S, N and M proteins of SARS-CoV were uncovered with the sequence coverage of 38.9, 93.1 and 28.1% respectively. Glycosylation modification in S protein was also analyzed and four glycosylation sites were discovered by comparing the mass spectra before and after deglycosylation of the peptides with PNGase F digestion. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry determination showed that relative molecular weight of intact N protein is 45 929 Da, which is very close to its theoretically calculated molecular weight 45 935 Da based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the genome with the first amino acid methionine at the Nterminus depleted and second, serine, acetylated, indicating that phosphorylation does not happen at all in the predicted phosphorylation sites within infected cells nor in virus particles. Intriguingly, a series of shorter isoforms of N protein was observed by SDS-PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry characterization. For further confirmation of this phenomenon and its related mechanism, recombinant N protein of SARS-CoV was cleaved in vitro by caspase-3 and -6 respectively. The results demonstrated that these shorter isoforms could be the products from cleavage of caspase-3 rather than that of caspase-6. Further, the relationship between the caspase cleavage and the viral infection to the host cell is discussed.

After overnight incubation at 47C in blocking buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 5% nonfat dried milk), the membranes of group A were probed by the addition of the antisera (1:1000, v/v in PBST, 5% nonfat dried milk) from one clinical case of convalescent SARS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Group B membranes was hybridized with pooled antisera from 10 convalescent patients, which were all qualified to be positive for antibodies to the SARS-CoV by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Group C was testified by adding sera from uninfected donors (negative in IFA). After washing in PBST 3610 min each, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Amersham Biosciences, 1:10 000, v/v in PBST, 5% nonfat dried milk), and then washed in PBST three times. Finally the blots were developed with ECL Western blot kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and reactive bands were detected by exposure to Kodak X-Omat K film for 3 min at ambient temperature. Bands that showed an apparent reaction with antisera were cut out and stored at 47C until analyzed by MS.",

The analytical results by LC-ESI MS/MS showed that fraction 24 in the HPLC chromatogram con-tained intact N protein (Fig. 5, peak 2) , so MALDI-MS was used to measure the M r , as shown in Fig. 5 , which was defined as 45 929 Da. This result is in agreement with the data published [12] that the first amino acid methionine in the N-terminus of the protein was depleted and the second serine was acetylated. The theoretical molecular weight calculated based on the predicted amino acid sequence is 45 935 Da. Comparing the calculated molecular weight with the measured one, the relative error was less than 0.13/1000. To confirm the amino acid sequence in the N-terminus of N protein, Edman degradation was performed on a PVDF membrane blotted from SDS-PAGE of the N protein by protein sequencer following the instrument's manual (Procise Sequencer; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Only after deacetylation with TFA according to [15] was the first amino acid serine identified (data not shown). The phosphorylation of N protein is a well documented phenomenon in many coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), bovine coronavirus (BCV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , in which phosphorylation were determined by metabolic labeling methods for recombinant forms rather than natural forms. The functional significance of N proteins' phosphorylation is still under investigation. In the case of MHV, the widely investigated coronavirus, phosphorylated N protein was considered as having a higher RNA binding capacity than the unphosphorylated one, and its dephosphorylation was found to be in connection with initiation of the infection [21, 22] . As phosphorylation of the N protein may be a general phenomenon in coronavirus, several methods were tried to confirm the hypothesis but all failed (data not shown). These included Western blot analysis for phosphoprotein from viral proteins separated by SDS-PAGE using an antiphosphoprotein antibody, IMAC (immobilized metal affinity chromatography) combined with LC-MS/MS to looking for phosphopeptides from tryptic digest of N protein, and phosphatase digestion to find the new peptides after dephosphorylated. Although we did not find any evidence that the N protein is a phosphoprotein, its real status is still unknown due to the sensitivity of the methods used. Metabolic labeling using 32 P should be a more sensitive method and will provide the direct evidence for the phosphorylation status of SARS N protein. However, as a strong indirect evidence, we should indicate the result of molecular weight resolution of intact natural N protein, 45 929 Da (real M r ) compared with the theoretical one of 45 935 Da of almost naked protein (only with N-terminal acetylation, without any phosphorylation). Their difference, like the relative error, was less than 0.13/1000, indicating that there is no phosphorylation in natural N protein at all.",

This phenomenon was also observed with various coronaviruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), MHV, feline coronavirus (FIPV), BCV, avian IBV and turkey coronavirus (TCV) late in infection in cell culture, which resulted from caspases cleavage in the host cell [23] . To testify the role of caspase in N protein cleavage, caspase-3 and -6 were selected to cleave recombinant N protein of SARS CoV. The experimental result showed that recombinant N protein of SARS CoV could be cleaved by caspase-3 rather than caspase-6 and the pattern of peptide distribution was similar to that in infected cells (Fig. 6) , which may imply that caspase-dependent apoptosis occurs and that caspase-3 cleaves the N protein in vivo during the late phase of virus infection. This phenomenon was not reported by the Canadian group [12] . Apoptosis is an important process in the development and cell defense, which usually causes morphological and biochemical changes. Caspases, special kinds of proteases participating in such a reaction, are activated in a cascade triggered by apoptosis signals. Virus-infected cells undergo apoptosis by the attack of cytotoxic cells, including cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells [24] [25] [26] . As for coronavirus, it is reported that infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) results in lethal fulminant hepatic necrosis [27] . In IBV research, it was found that replication of IBV in Vero cells caused extensive cytopathic effects, leading to destruction of the entire monolayer and the death of infected cells [28] . In some further research on apoptosis about coronavirus, the E protein of MHV has been confirmed as an apoptosis inducer in 17Cl-1 cells [29] . In the TEGV-infected cells, the nucleocaspid protein can be cleaved by caspase-6, and caspase-7 in vitro rather than caspase-3 [23] . Although apoptosis in the Vero E6 cell infected by SARS-CoV has not been reported, the result in our experiment may give a clue to apoptosis in the virusinfected cell and the N protein of SARS-CoV may be a substrate of caspase-3 in vivo.",

In our experiment, however, only the sequence from 107-221 amino acids was covered (Table 3) , which may be because of its high hydrophobicity, especially in its N-terminus. Furthermore, our experimental results showed that besides the 25 kDa position (slice 22 in Fig. 3) , M protein also appeared at higher molecular weight position but only together with the spike protein in SDS-PAGE. Whether this is because of a possible interaction between M and S protein or the hydrophobic character of the M protein, which kept it at its higher molecule weight position, still needs further research.",

First, the total proteins from Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, all bands were sliced, in-gel digested and MS/MS analyzed. Three structural proteins (S, N and M) were identified, but E protein was not found. Then we used 2-D LC-MS/MS, the total proteins from the infected cells were digested directly and 2-D capillary HPLC separated the digestion with a strong cation ion exchange chromatography as the first dimension and reverse phase chromatography as the second dimension, and the protein was still not identified. It is therefore likely, as previously reported for other coronaviruses, that the E protein is present only in minute amounts in infected cells [31] and in the viral envelope. Its strong hydrophobicity, i.e. the N-terminal two-thirds region is highly hydrophobic [36, 37] , also results in difficulties to discover this protein. However, we can not conclude so far that the E protein is not expressed in Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV or are not present in the SARS-CoV envelope, because the E protein is not only present in envelopes, but also plays an essential role in the assembly of known coronaviruses.",

Glycosylation modification of S protein was analyzed, and four glycosylation sites were characterized. Cleavage of S protein into two subunits was also suggested. Molecular weight determination of intact N protein showed that a post-translational modification only happened in its N-terminus as acetylation and no phosphorylation modification was detected within the entire N protein. Antigenicity analysis indicated that the N protein has a prominent immunogenicity to the convalescent sera from patients with SARS. The immune response of S protein probably depends on the strong interaction with the M protein. Cleavage of recombinant N protein with caspase-3 and -6 in vitro demonstrated that the series of shorter isoforms of N protein observed in SDS-PAGE might be the products of caspase-3 cleavage rather than caspase-6 and might have a relationship with the apoptosis of Vero E6 cells induced by the infection of SARS-CoV.",
