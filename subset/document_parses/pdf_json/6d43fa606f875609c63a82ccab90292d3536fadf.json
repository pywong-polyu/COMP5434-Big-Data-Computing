We aim to identify the qualitative and quantitative constituents present in e-cigarette liquids and aerosols. METHODS A comprehensive search of scientific databases included literature up to July 2020. A total of 28 articles met inclusion criteria; 18 articles assessed e-liquid constituents and 15 articles assessed aerosol constituents. Of these, 5 assessed constituents present in both mediums. We included English-language publications that examine qualitative and/or quantitative constituents in e-cigarette liquids and aerosols. RESULTS In total, articles identified 60 compounds in e-liquids and 47 compounds in aerosols. A total of 22 compounds were identified in both e-liquids and aerosols.",

The recent outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) has been linked to vitamin E acetate, however, there is insufficient evidence to rule out the contribution of other chemicals of concern 4 . Without first identifying the chemicals present in e-liquids and aerosols, it is challenging to understand their short-and long-term effects on human health and implement EC regulations. Quantification of secondhand aerosol exposure is another challenge. Given the increasing prevalence of EC use, identifying and quantifying the chemical compounds present in e-liquids and aerosols is a vital first step in risk assessment and implementation of effective regulations.",

Further, it is important to note that several of these constituents have been identified in tobacco smoke and are listed by the FDA as harmful or potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) 35 . Acenaphthylene is present in a majority of samples among studies that identified this chemical. Acetaldehyde was detected in five e-liquid studies and six aerosol studies; another study showed that acetaldehyde was present in 100% of e-liquid and 100% of aerosol samples 12 . Antimony was present in 6 of 6 samples in e-liquids, but only 4 of 6 samples in aerosols in one study 9 . Of the studies that detected diacetyl, it was present in all of or a majority of e-liquid or aerosol samples. Other than in one article, formaldehyde was present in 100% of all e-liquids that identified it; the same is true for formaldehyde detected in aerosol samples. Both glycerol and propylene glycol, known components of e-liquids, are present in all samples in studies that identified them.

Nickel was present in all but one sample of e-liquids and all samples of aerosols that reported sample size values. Of the constituents discussed in the current section, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, lead, and nickel have been identified in conventional cigarette smoke and are classified as HPHCs by the FDA. Several other constituents identified in this review, such as nicotine, ethyl benzene, crotonaldehyde, chromium, and anabasine, are also HPHCs as classified by the FDA 35 .

Exposure to several of the constituents have been shown to cause harmful effects in humans. Diacetyl, which was identified in a majority of aerosol samples, is a flavoring agent that has been shown to cause bronchiolitis obliterans, also known as popcorn lung, when inhaled 39 . This is a chronic, irreversible pulmonary condition that causes a rapid decline in lung function; prognosis is usually poor and non-transplant related treatments are insufficient. Carcinogens, such as NNN and NNK, were identified in e-liquids and aerosols. Activated NNK and NNN induce mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, which may be an indication of tumor initiation 40 . Formaldehyde can increase the risk of asthma 41 , squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and leukemia 42 . Some chemicals, such as acetaldehyde, are suspected to contribute to abuse liability of ECs. Acetaldehyde, a known toxicant identified in several e-liquids and aerosols, increases the reinforcing effects of nicotine and has been shown to have reinforcing effects itself. It also can alter the oral microbiome, which may result in poor oral hygiene and downstream negative health impacts 43 . Nicotine increases the risks of cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disorders, lowers the human immune response, can harm reproductive health, and can lead to cancer. Secondhand exposure to nicotine results in substantial occupancy of \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain 44 . Though solvents used in e-liquids are typically safe for ingestion at low doses, their effects on human health when inhaled are unknown. One case study indicates that inhalation of vegetable glycerin may be a cause of lipoid pneumonia seen in patients presenting with respiratory illnesses 45 .",

E-liquids have been shown to significantly reduce energy intake and induce hyperglycemia 46 . EC exposure was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms and changes in respiratory functioning and host defences, such as airway irritation, mucus hypersecretion, and inflammatory responses 46 . Several constituents listed in this review, such as diacetyl, acrolein, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde, are known respiratory irritants 47 . E-liquids may be nephrotoxic, as they alter the antioxidant defences present in renal collecting ducts and promote minor changes in renal function 48 . Early exposure to e-liquids may lead to chronic neuropathology, hindering proper central nervous system development 49 . There were greater changes in gene expression among animals exposed to aerosols without nicotine compared to those exposed to nicotine, suggesting that non-nicotinic constituents in ECs lead to neuropathological changes 49 . E-liquids have shown toxicity in the liver; one study shows that injection of e-liquids gave rise to more histopathological injuries compared to injection of nicotine alone 50 . Exposure to e-liquids has also been shown to alter testicular function in male rats 51 . Though there is no consensus regarding which constituent is associated with the aforementioned harms, the authors indicate that nicotine and flavoring compounds (i.e. diacetin), may be viable culprits in altering liver and testicular function 50, 51 . We speculate that harmful outcomes are a result of multi-constituent interaction.",

The exposure of human lung cell lines to EC aerosols results in damage to bronchial epithelial cells 54 . It is unclear whether this damage is linked to flavoring agents or aerosol nanoparticles. There is agreement that the cytotoxicity of e-liquids is highly dependent on their flavoring chemicals 55 . Not surprisingly, considering the myriad of flavoring chemicals used, various cellular physiological responses have been documented. Exposure to aerosols is shown to induce cell shape modification and promotion of cell apoptosis 56, 57 . Flavoring agents cause high levels of cytotoxicity in human embryonic cells and mouse neural stem cells 58 .
