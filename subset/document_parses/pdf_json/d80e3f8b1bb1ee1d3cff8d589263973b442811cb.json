            "text": "Available knowledge shows that individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 undergo an altered metabolic state in multiple organs. Metabolic activities are directly involved in modulating the immune responses against infectious diseases, yet our understanding remains limited on how host metabolism relates with inflammatory responses. To better elucidate the underlying biochemistry of leukocytes response, we focused our analysis on the possible relationships between SARS-CoV-2 post-infection stages and distinct metabolic pathways. Indeed, in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, n=48) obtained 60-90 days after infection and showing in vitro IgG antibody memory for spike-S1 antigen (n=19), we observed a significant altered metabolism of tryptophan and urea cycle pathways. This work for the first time identifies metabolic routes in cell metabolism possibly related to later stages of immune defense against SARS-Cov-2 infection, namely when circulating antibodies may be absent, but an antibody memory is present. The results suggest a reprogramming of leukocyte metabolism after viral pathogenesis through activation of specific amino acid pathways possibly related to protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Covid-19 is the acute illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 with initial clinical symptoms such as cough, fever, malaise, headache, and anosmia 1 . Being a new form of virus, pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood, contrasted by vaccination policies and potential drugs developed 2 . The viral infection stimulates immune responses, also directed against the spike protein (S1 protein) present on the surface of SARS-Cov-2, being a ligand that binds to ACE2 receptor in host cells. After entry into cells the corona viruses (CoV) activate aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) through an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1)-independent mechanism. This leads to an unregulated up-stimulation of downstream effectors among which the modulation of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and in particular of interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, consistent with the role for AhR activation following viral infection 3 . When SARS-Cov-2 infection persists, inflammation activates IDO1 by massively overexpressing proinflammatory cytokines, a deleterious process known as cytokine storm. The resulting cytokine storm diffuses to other organs, leading to multiorgan damage. Secretion of such cytokines and chemokines attracts immune cells, notably monocytes and T lymphocytes, from the blood into the infected site 4 . In the respiratory tract, a recruitment of immune cells and lymphocytes from the blood might explain the lymphopenia and increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio seen in around 80% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and after contact with viral antigens most of the effector T cells undergo apoptosis. Next, a pool of memory T cells is formed to fight reinfection. In the case of a subsequent infection, CD4+ memory T cells become restimulated, activate B cells and other immune cells by producing cytokines, with the help of CD8+ memory T cells that kill virus-infected cells 5, 6 . Among the host responses, changes in cell metabolic processes play a pivotal role, and multiple approaches are currently used to identify key pathways involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, during targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses, altered tryptophan metabolism involved in the kynurenine regulating inflammatory and immunity pathways have been identified 7 . Accordingly, 77 metabolites including amino acids, lipids, polyamines, sugars, as well as their derivatives have been discovered to be altered in the plasma of Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms, with respect to those showing mild symptoms 8 . Moreover, also cytosine (reflecting viral load), kynurenine (reflecting host inflammatory response), nicotinuric acid, and multiple short chain acylcarnitines (energy metabolism) were altered, in agreement with a severe outcome of the pathology, as already reported 9 . Despite an increasing knowledge on metabolic changes in Covid-19 patients, little attention has been paid to post-infection stages (>60 days) where immune memory becomes responsible to protect against possible SARS-CoV-2 reinfection 10 . Indeed, as for other viral pathologies such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), there is a concern about Covid-2 effects. These effects may have longterm consequences and, importantly, the criteria for \"recovery\" are still ill-defined 11 and mainly focused on the reduction of respiratory symptoms. In this respect, a knowledge on possible metabolic pathways linked to leukocytes and related to later stages of antiviral defences may be of importance.",

Fold change analysis was performed on the entire metabolomics data set using the MetaboAnalyst 5.0 software. Before the analysis, raw data were normalized by median and autoscaling in order to increase the importance of low-abundance ions without significant amplification of noise. The purpose of fold change (FC) analysis was to compare absolute value change between two group averages and find some features that are changed consistently (i.e. up-regulated or down-regulated) between two groups. In order to analyze a correlation network of the compounds in shared pathways, MetScape, an app implemented in Java and integrated with Cytoscape (version 3.8.2), was used. To further explore the metabolic differences between the two groups of subjects, multivariate statistical analyses were employed on the entire metabolomics data set using the same software.

With these IgG + -PBMC premises, 26 metabolites resulted to have the most significant changes in IgG + -PBMC whereas 10 metabolites resulted increased in IgG --PBMC (table and Fig.1) .",

Namely, gluconeogenic amino acids (e.g., arginine, valine, glutathione, aspartate, proline and glutamine) and taurine (sulfur-containing amino acid) were upregulated in IgG + -PBMC. In contrast, cysteine, glycine and methionine sulfoxide (oxidized forms of sulfur-containing amino acid), showed a decrease (Fig. 2) . Based on the online database of metabolic pathways (KEGG, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), MetScape software running on Cytoscape was used to visualize and interpret metabolites in the context of a global metabolic network (Fig. 3) . Network visualizations may be helpful to show connections between metabolites and to understand relationships between compounds and pathways in order to have a high-level overview of changes in metabolic activities caused by Covid-19 in IgG + -PBMC. The network reflects a complexity of effects of the pathology and provides further evidence for the involvement of tryptophan metabolism, urea cycle and metabolism of arginine, proline, glutamate, aspartate and asparagine. Complementary to the network analysis, Pathway Enrichment Analysis revealed a significant alteration in leukocytes IgGm+ on amino acid metabolism, especially the pathways involving in glycine serine threonine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism, (Fig.  4) . Top hits from these pathways were mapped against the KEGG pathway and tryptophan metabolism and arginine biosynthesis (urea cycle) are highlighted in Figures 4-5. Tryptophan metabolism was the one of top pathways altered in leukocytes displaying an IgG antibody memory to SARS-Cov-2. Specifically, tryptophan increased in the IgGm+ and serotonin did not undergo significant change compared with controls ( Fig. 5 ). At the same time, the reduction in the level of indolepyruvate and the increase in the level of kynurenine, knowing to be rich source for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands, suggested a restoration of the kynurenine pathway to decrease the cytokines storm (Fig. 5 ) also confirming by the increased level of taurine in IgGm+. In addition to Tryptophan metabolism, arginine biosynthesis has a significant impact on leukocytes showing IgG memory. Some metabolites of the Urea cycle (e.g., arginine, aspartate and arginosuccinic acid) were increased in IgGm+ samples, leading to an up regulation of creatine. In contrast, ornithine, glutamic acid and alanine, but not glutamine, did not change in abundance, suggesting an altered homeostasis of the Urea cycle (Fig. 6) . As consequence citrulline results fully converted in arginosuccinic acid in IgM+ samples because it wasn't restored by ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate.",

            "text": "Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism is one of the major pathways affected in IgGm+ leukocytes as shown in our results of non-targeted metabolomic data (Fig. 3) . Trp fuels the synthesis of kynurenine (Kyn), serotonin (5-HT) and indoles. A recent study by Gardinassi et al, revealed high involvement of inflammatory networks and increased expression of genes involved in tryptophan metabolism in COVID-19 patients 14 . Interestingly, decrease of tryptophan and the contemporary increase of kynurenine pathway were the major effects of COVID-19 on which regulates inflammation and immunity 7 .This metabolic pathway involves the conversion of tryptophan into L-kynurenine by the enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 and 2 (IDO1 and IDO2). IDO enzymes are activated by inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b1,-\u03b2,-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) and in particular interleukin-6 (IL-6) 15 . These changes in tryptophan metabolism, due to regulation of IDO enzymes, correlated with a greater increase of interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels 7 , induce a cytokine storm through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) 16 . The term 'cytokine storm syndrome' is perhaps one of the critical hallmarks of COVID-19 disease severity 17 . In our results the increased level of tryptophan, an almost unchanged level of serotonin, and the strongly decreased level of indole pyruvate support the hypothesis of the restoration of kynurenine pathway through attenuation of IDO activity. In addition to kynurenine, also indole pyruvate are endogenous ligands that activate AhR 18, 19 . Therefore the reduction level of indole pyruvate negatively modulates the AHR activity in leukocytes which display IgG memory for spike-S1 antigen 60-90 days after infection. Moreover the increased level of Taurine in IgGm+ attenuated IL-6 level 20 cooperating to reduce inflammation. Increasing evidence from several studies show that tryptophan can reduce inflammatory reactions and enhance the immune system 21 . Furthermore, recent studies have suggested a link between tocilizumab immunosuppressive therapy and tryptophan metabolism in COVID-1. In fact, tocilizumab has been proposed as a drug to counteract hyperinflammatory responses in ICU patients with COVID-19 22 . This possibility indicates that tryptophan-rich sources could be beneficial for COVID-19 subjects 23 . The potential relevance of these observations confirm the impact of Trp and its metabolites against the severity of COVID-19, and our results highlighted for the first time to our knowledgement the biochemical mechanism adopted by leukocytes to counteract viral infection by reactivating the tryptophan metabolism. Another metabolism significantly influenced by Sars-Cov2 virus was arginine biosynthesis. Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that can be obtained from the diet or produced in certain cells via the complete or partial urea cycle. In the urea cycle, when arginine is catabolized by arginase (Arg1), the products are urea, ornithine, polyamines and proline, and when degraded by NO, the products are a large amount of NO and citrulline 24 . The ornithine used for citrulline production can originate from alanine and glutamate/glutamine reactions.",

            "text": "In our results arginine wasn't converted to ornithine. In fact this latter was not fuel by glutamine that are major substrates for citrulline production 25 . At the same time the increased level of glutamine is in agreement with the role of this amino acid in boosting the immune system especially by inhibition of inflammatory responses 26 . Indeed, adding enteral glutamine to the normal nutrition in the early period of Covid-19 infection may lead to a shortened hospital stay and lead to less need for ICU 27 . The conversion of arginine in citrulline rather than ornithine leads to a higher release of NO. In the immune system, the NO produced in macrophages and neutrophils is necessary to kill invasive microorganisms (such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi) and activate the immune cells in defense mechanisms 28, 29 . Arginine is a substrate for nitric oxide (NO) production, which can induce antiviral activity against RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 29 . The accumulation of this amino acid in IgGm+ 13 and consequently alteration of urea cycle was probably due to an restoration of arginase enzyme (Arg1). It has been reported that the Arg1 gene is located in the cytoplasm and is strongly expressed in the liver but, in addition to its metabolic role in the hepatic urea cycle, it can regulate immune responses. In fact, in humans, arginase was detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) 31 and several studies highlighted that Arg1 inhibits immunity against intracellular pathogens and represses T-cell-mediated inflammatory damage 32, 33 . Arg1 up-regulation might be associated with higher virus load in COVID-19 patients 34 . Since Arg1 can limit the bioavailability of L-arginine, the inhibition of Arg1 can drive the recycling of L-citrulline to generate L-arginine for the production of NO, paving the way for developing antiviral immunity in IgGm+. A significant proportion of L-arginine flux is attributable to synthesis of creatine by the enzyme L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT). Generation of creatine is estimated to consume ~70% of labile methyl groups, with S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) serving as the methyl donor 35 . This methylation demand may reduce the available methyl which therefore leads SAM to be metabolized into S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and finally into homocysteine and indirectly limits methylation of the 5' cap of viral messenger RNA of coronavirus 13 . So it is not surprising that the Creatine Kinase (enzyme that catalyses the conversion of creatine to create phosphocreatine) levels are higher in COVID-19 patients and are associated with a more severe prognosis in COVID-19 36 .",
