ACE2 (FC \u00bc \u00fe1.88, p 0.05) and DPP4 (FC \u00bc \u00fe3, p < 0.01) genes showed a significant overexpression in COVID-19 patients. ACE2 and DPP4 expression levels had a good performance (AUC \u00bc 0.75; p < 0.001) in distinguishing COVID-19 patients from negative subjects. Interestingly, we found a significant positive association of ACE2 mRNA and PCSK3, EMILIN1, MMRN1 and MMRN2 expression and of DPP4 mRNA and EMILIN2 expression only in COVID-19 patients. Noteworthy, a subgroup of severe COVID-19 (n \u00bc 7) patients, showed significant high level of ACE2 mRNA and another subgroup of less severe COVID-19 patients (n \u00bc 6) significant raised DPP4 levels.",

COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic or mild sub-clinical symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARSD). COVID-19 manifests differently depending on patients age, underlying health conditions, and gender [2] . A growing body of evidence indicates sex differences in the clinical outcome of COVID-19 [3, 4] . It is known that although men and women have a similar sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, men are more prone to have higher severity and mortality than women, regardless of age [5] . However, phenotypic variability of COVID-19 is a consequence also of the individual genetic variability, that can make certain subjects more susceptible or more resistant to viral infection and disease progression [6, 7] . Currently, no suitable vaccines are available for SARS-CoV-2, although there are ongoing clinical trials and also studies of treatments with monoclonal antibodies [8] .",

            "text": "The identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of COVID-19 is crucial for identifying appropriate medical therapies to combat viral infection. The main mechanism of the entire process of infection include the action of different human proteins. ACE2 is the host receptor for the novel SARS-CoV-2 [9] . A recent expression profile of ACE2 RNA in lung at a single cell 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56 resolution suggested that ACE2 expression is concentrated in alveolar type II (AT2) cells [10] . SARS-CoV-2 entry also depends on the activity of the TMPRSS2 protease previously detected in the nasal and bronchial epithelium [4, 6] where TMPRSS2 is co-expressed together to ACE2 [9, 11] . PCSK3/furin is one of the important proteases that facilitates viral invasion. In fact, it cleaves viral S protein and helps SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2 receptor [12] . A main regulator of extracellular PCSK3/furin activity is EMILIN1 and, in particular, its N-terminal EMI domain [13] . EMILIN1 belongs to EMILIN/Multimerin family that includes also EMILIN2, Multimerin1 (MMRN1 or EMILIN4) and Multi-merin2 (MMRN2 or EMILIN3), all containing an N-terminal EMI domain. EMILIN/Multimerin family is responsible for the activation of different precursor proteins as growth factors, hormones, receptors and adhesion molecules, as well as cell surface glycoproteins of infectious viruses [14] . Given their role in the activation of cell surface proteins, this protease family might be implicated in viral infections. Recently, another interaction between virus and host cell besides ACE2 receptor was suggested. DPP4, also known as cluster of differentiation 26 (CD26), may interact with the viral S glycoprotein [15] . DPP4 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells and in bronchiolar epithelial cells [16] , where it performs different functions as post-translational cleavage of hormones and chemokines, T-cell activation, cell adhesion, and apoptosis [17] . The combination of binding and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell, so the expression and distribution of these key proteins decides the path of infection by the virus and this is important for understanding pathogenesis and designing therapeutic strategies. In this pilot-study, we investigate the expression pattern and level of SARS-CoV-2 host invasion genes (ACE2, TMPRSS2, PCSK3, EMILIN1, EMILIN2, MMRN1, MMRN2, DPP4) in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs of negative subjects and severely affected COVID-19 patients. In fact, we collected naso-and oropharyngeal swabs in the period 20 th March-20 Th April 2020, that was the period with raised numbers of affected patients and also with worse prognosis in Italy [18] .",

Moreover, the expression levels of human genes encoding the main proteins involved in this mechanism could be critical for the susceptibility, symptoms and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, elevated ACE2 expression promoted in vitro the susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection [22, 23] . Moreover, ACE2 is up-regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [24] . Interestingly, conditions like old age, obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in which was reported DPP4 upregulation are associated with severe COVID-19 [25] . It was shown that DPP4 acted for Coronavirus (CoV) co-receptor, thus suggesting a potential similar mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry [26] .

We selected naso-and oropharyngeal swabs in the critical epidemic period 20 th March-20 th April 2020, during which a lot of seriously affected patients referred to Policlinico Tor Vergata of Rome. Our results indicate a significant nasal and oropharyngeal overexpression of ACE2 and DPP4 genes in COVID-19 patients and that this overexpression is not correlated with patients' age. Moreover, to evaluate the ability of ACE2 and DPP4 levels to discriminate COVID-19 patients from negative subjects, we performed a ROC curve analysis. We evaluated the discriminating potential of the combined gene expression levels and we observed that they allow us to identify about 75% of COVID-19 patients (Figure 3 ). These results support the hypothesis that ACE2 and DPP4 expression level are altered in COVID-19 patients and that their combined evaluation could be a potential good discriminatory genomic biomarker. Interestingly, the expression level of ACE2 and DPP4 genes is significant higher respectively in a subgroup of seven (ACE2h-COVID-19) and six (DPP4h-CO-VID-19) COVID-19 patients (Figure 2 ).",

Lymphocytes express ACE2 on their surface and may represent a direct target of the virus.

However, it also acts as a means of clathrin-mediated internalization of viruses such as SARS coronavirus [31] . By now, the functional role of the surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor protein for viral entry is well known. This protein is widely found in different organs such as the lung, kidney, heart, and endothelial tissue. According to our results, other study report that in symptomatic patients affected by COVID-19 ACE2 expression is higher in alveolar epithelial cells [24, 29, 32] . Since an important therapeutic approach is to impair the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with the type II pneumocytes ACE2 receptor, thus inhibiting and preventing any type of destruction of the type II pneumocytes, its overexpression in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs of severe COVID-19 patients when compared to negative subjects and to other positive patients, suggest that this approach may be useful also in the first step of infection, when ACE2 expression in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tissue is high.",
