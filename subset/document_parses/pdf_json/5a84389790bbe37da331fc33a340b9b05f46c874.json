DZNep treatment resulted in reduced synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins without affecting other steps of viral life cycle. We demonstrated that deposition of N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the infected cells recruits heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1), an RNA binding protein which serves as a m6A reader. DZNep inhibited the recruitment of hnRNPA1 at m6A-modified SARS-CoV-2 RNA which eventually suppressed the synthesis of the viral genome. In addition, m6A-marked RNA and hnRNPA1 interaction was also shown to regulate early translation to replication switch of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Furthermore, abrogation of methylation by DZNep also resulted in defective synthesis of the 5' cap of viral RNA, thereby resulting in its failure to interact with eIF4E (a cap-binding protein), eventually leading to a decreased synthesis of viral proteins. Most importantly, DZNep-resistant mutants could not be observed upon long-term sequential passage of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. In summary, we report the novel role of methylation in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and propose that targeting the methylome using DZNep could be of significant therapeutic value against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Gene expression is not determined solely by the sequence information encoded in the individual's genome but is rather subjected to multiple levels of control both at the DNA and RNA levels. At the DNA (genomic) level, besides promoters and enhancers, the gene expression is regulated by DNA methylation, histone remodelling, alternative histone variant use and deposition of modifications on histone tails, collectively referred to as epigenetic regulation (Chokkalla et al., 2020) . Similarly, covalent modifications also contribute in determining the stability and translation of mRNA and are referred to as epitranscriptomic gene regulation (Seo and Kleiner, 2021) . Out of the over 160 different posttranscriptional modifications described so far, most are abundantly present in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) (Boccaletto and Baginski, 2021) . The messenger RNA (mRNA) also contains at least 13 different chemical modifications (Anreiter et al., 2021) which are grouped as cap-adjacent-and internal modifications (Anreiter et al., 2021) . Internal modifications occur in coding regions, introns as well as 5 \u2032 and 3 \u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. The N 6 -methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification of mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in mammalian cells (Anreiter et al., 2021) . The enzymes that install, remove and bind to mRNA modifications are called as \"writers\" \"erasers\" and \"readers\" respectively. m6A is installed by a methyltransferase complex (writers) containing the core catalytic heterodimer [methyltranferase-like protein 3 (METTL3) and METTL14] and a splicing factor WTAP (Wilms tumor 1-associated protein). The writers bind to short consensus sequence motifs in the target mRNA. m6A can be reversibly removed by demethylases (erasers) such as FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein) and ALKBH5 (alkylation repair homolog protein 5). m6A is widely distributed along the mRNA, although it is enriched around the stop codons and at the 3 \u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) (Dominissini et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2012) . Readers, such as YTH-domain family 2 (YTHDF2) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), directly or indirectly recognise the m6A-marked transcripts and affect various aspects of mRNA metabolism, including RNA localization, splicing, stability (degradation) and translation. Modifications of cap-adjacent nucleotides are deposited to the 5 \u2032 -ends of RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Typically, the cap consists of a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) moiety added in a characteristic 5 \u2032 -5 \u2032 triphosphate linkage to the first transcribed nucleotide. The first and second nucleotides adjacent to the cap can be 2 \u2032 -O-methylated at the ribose sugar (cOMe) in animals, protists and viruses (Galloway and Cowling, 2019) . While the m7G is essential for RNA translation and stability (Trotman et al., 2017) , the cOMe of mRNA cap is implicated in the innate host antiviral responses (Daffis et al., 2010) .",

Depending on the nature of the virus involved, m6A modifications may either support Lichinchi et al., 2016a; Tirumuru et al., 2016) or inhibit (Gokhale et al., 2016; Lichinchi et al., 2016b ) viral gene expression. Recent studies have mapped eight m6A sites in SARS-CoV-2 genome (Burgess et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) and have suggested that m6A pathway positively regulates virus replication. In this study, we extend the role of methylation by elucidating its novel functions in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle (translation-to-replication switch) and propose that inhibition of methylation by chemical inhibitor (DZNep) may provide therapeutic effect against SARS-CoV-2 without inducing an antiviral drug-resistant phenotype.",

DZNep is known to act as inhibitors of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase and, as a result, to deplete cells of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor used by METTL3 and several other writers. At the noncytotoxic concentrations (Fig. 1a) , DZNep exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b) . Since DZNep did not exert any virucidal effect, anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of DZNep could be a result of the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in the target cells, rather than the inactivation of cell free virions (Fig. S1 ). Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of m6A writers (METTL3) (Fig. S2a ), m6A reader (hnRNPA1) (Fig. S2b ) and MAT2A-the enzyme involved in synthesizing universal methyl donor (SAM) (Fig. S2c ) resulted in a decreased virus yield (Fig. 1c , d and 1e), suggesting that m6A epitranscriptomic machinery positively regulates SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, DZNep was also shown to block replication of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1f) , suggesting, as an antiviral agent, it may act against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, DZNep was also shown to exhibit its antiviral effects in BHK-21 cells (other than Vero cells) (Fig. 1g) .",

In addition to determining the relative levels of m6A-marked RNA during the course of SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, we also examined the absolute levels (ratio of m6A-modified RNA versus total RNA) of m6Amarked RNA by EpiQuik m6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit. In non-infected (mock-infected) cells ~0.03% of the total cellular RNA was found to be methylated whereas in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, it varied from 0.02 to 0.09%, depending on the stage of the virus replication cycle involved-the highest being at middle-late step of virus replication cycle (3 hpi to 10 hpi) and lowest during the initial hours of infection (1 hpi and 2 hpi) (Fig. 2b) . No detectable amount of methylation was observed in RNA derived from cell-free virions (Fig. 2b) . Addition of DZNep significantly reduced the levels of methylated RNA (Fig. 2c) .

In order to evaluate which specific step(s) of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle are affected, DZNep was applied at various times post-infection and the progeny virus particles released at 12 h were quantified. Addition of DZNep had similar levels of suppression in virus yield whether it was applied at 30 min before-or 1 h after virus infection (Fig. 3a) , suggesting that DZNep had no effect on the early steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Likewise, there was no inhibitory effect if it was applied at later time points (\u22656 hpi) of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle which suggested that DZNep does not target the SARS-CoV-2 budding/release. The magnitude of the inhibitory effect of DZNep on SARS-CoV-2 replication decreased from 1 hpi to 6 hpi, suggesting that DZNep most likely targeted the middle stages (replication/transcription/translation) of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In order to further confirm the specific steps of SARS-CoV-2 targeted by the inhibitors, we conducted the virus step-specific assays . The DZNep did not affect the SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry and budding (data not shown). To evaluate the effect of the DZNep on the synthesis of viral genome, it was applied at 3 hpi (a time point when early steps of viral life cycle such as attachment and entry are expected to occur) and the cell lysates were prepared at 10 hpi, a time point when virus is close to completing its life cycle.

In coronaviruses, viral mRNA translation takes place in a cap-dependent manner wherein the eIF4E plays a central role in the initiation of translation . Upon phosphorylation by the upstream kinase(s), elF4E binds to the 5 \u2032 cap of mRNA to initiate translation . Besides internal RNA modifications, the 5 \u2032 -cap of coronaviruses also undergoes epitranscriptomic changes which include m7G and cOMe (Imam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021) . The SAM serves as a methyl donor in both these reactions. We further explored if DZNep-induced perturbation of epitranscriptomic changes may affect interaction of the viral mRNA and eIF4E. At 8 hpi (when SARS-CoV-2 RNA was expected to be at its peak level), cells were covalently cross-linked and evaluated for viral RNA and eIF4E interaction in a CHIP assay. In agreement with our previous findings , \u03b1-eIF4E (reactive antibody) but not \u03b1-ERK (non-reactive antibody) or beads control immunoprecipitated SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Fig. 5b) . The levels of viral RNA immunoprecipitated by \u03b1-eIF4E were ~99.9% lower in DZNep-treated cells as compared to the vehicle-control-treated cells (Fig. 5b) which suggested that DZNep inhibits eIF4E/SARS-CoV-2 mRNA interaction which may eventually result in the decreased synthesis of viral protein. In qRT-PCR, the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in \u03b1-ERK-treated cells (but not \u03b1-eIF4E-treated cells) were undetectable which clearly indicated that \u03b1-eIF4E specifically interacted with SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Fig. 5b) .",

We observed a switch on/off phenomenon in the hnRNPA1 expression levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells (Fig. 4a) . This tempted us to speculate that hnRNPA1 could be involved in switching from translation to replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. At 1 hpi, we could detect low levels of hnRNPA1 (m6A reader) (Fig. 4a ) and viral/cellular m6A methylome ( Fig. 2a and  b ) but higher levels of p-eIF4E-the cellular protein that participates in translation) (Fig. 6a) .

To provide further insights into this switching phenomenon, SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells were cross-linked at 2 hpi and evaluated for the interaction of m6A-modified RNA with RNA-binding proteins (p-eIF4E/hnRNPA1) in a CLIP assay. The hnRNPA1 principally binds at the 3 \u2032 -end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table S2) whereas the eIF4E is a 5 \u2032 mRNA cap-binding protein. Therefore, the sonication step was omitted in the CLIP assay which ensured the recovery of all the RBPs associated with SARS-CoV-2 genome. The cross-linked m6A-modified RNA was immunoprecipitated by \u03b1-m6A and the associated RBPs viz; hnRNPA1 and p-eIF4E, were probed in Western blot analysis. At 2 hpi, only hnRNPA1 but not eIF4E was shown to be associated with m6A-modified SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting repression of translation (2 hpi) due to recruitment of hnRNPA1 (Fig. 6b) . The amount of hnRNPA1 immunoprecipitated by \u03b1-m6A was lower in DZNep-treated cells as compared to the control ( Fig. 6b) which suggested a decreased synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 genome due to perturbation of the epitranscriptomic machinery.",

As shown in Fig. 6c , the amount of m6A-modified total RNA immunoprecipitated by \u03b1-hnRNPA1-was much higher than those immunoprecipitated by \u03b1-peIF4E, suggesting that hnRNPA1 (but not eIF4E) interacts with m6A-marked RNA or in other words m6A marks on SARS-CoV-2 allows recruitment of RBPs such as hnRNPA1 which represses translation and facilitate transcription. Further, the amount of m6A-modified RNA immunoprecipitated by \u03b1-hnRNPA1 was found to be significantly lower in DZNep-treated cells as compared to the vehicle-control-treated cells, suggesting an arrest in RNA synthesis due to perturbation of epitranscriptomic (m6A modification) machinery.

Only 2-5% of cellular RNA is mRNA (Anreiter et al., 2021) . Further, the abundance of mRNA modifications is low, with a prevalence rate of <0.5% of all nucleotides (Dong et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017) . These modifications are variable in the range of 5-88% at a given site or transcript (Liu et al., 2013; Molinie et al., 2016) . m6A is the most predominant epitranscriptomic modification in mRNA, accounting for 0.1-0.5% of all adenosines (Kadumuri and Janga, 2018) . Despite an extremely low distribution, they play important roles in cellular homeostasis (Shi et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2017) and are dysregulated in several disease conditions including viral infections (Brocard et al., 2017; Manners et al., 2019; Mauer and Jaffrey, 2018) . SARS-CoV-2 infection also triggers a global increase in m6A methylome (Liu et al., 2021) . The levels of m6A methylome in our study varied from 0.02 to 0.09% (Fig. 3b) , depending on the course of virus infection. Since cell free SARS-CoV-2 particles do not harbour any significant m6A modifications (<0.003%) (Fig. 3b) , these are deposited inside the host cell and removed before formation and budding of the mature virion particles. However, some viruses can maintain a relatively high amount of m6A-modified genome in the intact virion particles (Choy et al., 2020) , suggesting a complex pattern of epitranscriptomic regulation of virus replication.",

In coronaviruses, viral mRNA translation takes place in a cap-dependent manner (Stukalov et al., 2021) wherein the eIF4E plays a central role in the initiation of translation . Upon activation by upstream kinase(s), elF4E binds to the 5 \u2032 cap of mRNA to initiate translation (Kumar et al., 2018b . The 5 \u2032 -cap structure of viral mRNA also undergoes at least two epitranscriptomic (methylation) modifications viz; m7G and cOMe (Imam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021) .",

Alternatively, reduced levels of viral proteins in the DZNep-treated cells could also be due to defective synthesis of the 5 \u2032 cap of viral mRNA. In a cell-free viral mRNA and cellular p-eIF4E interaction assay, perturbation of the epitranscriptomic machinery by DZNep resulted in the production of viral RNA which was not able to interact properly with eIF4E, suggesting that methylation of the cap-adjacent nucleotides of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA is essential for the proper formation of the 5 \u2032 cap.",

The polyprotein is further cleaved to produce 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), which then facilitates the transcription of genomic and subgenomic RNAs (Finkel et al., 2021; Stukalov et al., 2021) . We reveal that this early switch from translation to replication in the viral life cycle is regulated by epitranscriptomic modifications. Initially we observed a switch Statistical analysis in survival curves was made using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software.

This, together with previous studies on m6A-mediated repression of cellular translation (Slobodin et al., 2017) , tempted us to speculate that hnRNPA1 could be involved in switching from translation to replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. It has been hypothesized that besides viral proteins, RBPs also play an important role in switching from translation to replication of the viral genome Andino, 1998, 2000; Li and Nagy, 2011) , although there is very limited experimental proof (Gamarnik and Andino, 2000) . Recruitment of cellular factors associated with translation (p-eIF4E) at 1 hpi and those associated with transcription (methylome/hNRNPA1) at 2 hpi indicated the involvement of epitranscriptomic marks in switching from translation to transcription. Perturbation of m6A pathway (2 hpi) resulted in a defective hnRNPA1-mediated synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA which further confirmed the recruitment of epitranscriptomic machinery during viral transcription (Fig. 6b) . Furthermore, we also demonstrated (at 2 hpi) that hnRNPA1 (but not eIF4E) interacts with m6A-marked internal RNA and inhibition of m6A modification results in an arrest in hnRNPA1-mediated synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 genome ( Fig. 6c and d) . These lines of evidence clearly suggest that installation of m6A marks in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA recruit hnRNPA1 that eventually facilitates transcription and represses translation (Fig. 9) , a novel role of epitranscriptomic machinery in regulating switch from translation to replication in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.",

Methyltransferase inhibitor DZNep together with siRNA knockdown of METTL3 (m6A writer), hNRNPA1 (m6A reader) and MAT2A (enzyme that participates in the synthesis of SAM-the universal methyl donor) in Vero cells resulted in a reduced virus yield indicating that the m6A epitranscriptomic machinery facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication and could serve as a novel target for antiviral drug development. These findings are in agreement with other two recent studies which have demonstrated virus supportive function of METTL3 (Burgess et al., 2021; . Contrary, in another study, Liu et al. (2021) , revealed a negative impact of m6A methylome on SARS-CoV-2 gene expression. However, this study by Liu et al. was based on measuring \"S\" protein expression as an indicator of virus infection, rather than quantifying virus yield employed in ours and two other studies (Hesser et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, our study suggests that methylation may differentially regulate transcription and translation of SARS-CoV-2 genome, depending on the course of virus replication.",

We demonstrated in vitro antiviral efficacy of DZNep (inhibitor that targets cellular factor-methyl transferase) against both wild-type and Delta strains of SARS-CoV-2, besides demonstrating it's protective effect against lethal IBV (Coronaviridae family member) infection in embryonated chicken eggs suggesting a broad-spectrum antiviral effect. Antiviral drug resistance is a matter of great clinical importance. The inherent ability of the RNA viruses to rapidly acquire drug-resistance is a major challenge in developing antiviral drugs (Kumar et al., 2016) . Most of the direct virus-acting agents rapidly induce drug-resistant phenotypes (Kumar et al., 2011b . Inhibitor such as DZNep (epidrug) blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting a cellular factor (m6A pathway), therefore the emergence of drug-resistant viral mutants would seem to be unlikely as has been observed with other host-directed antiviral agents (Chaudhary et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2008 Kumar et al., , 2011a Kumar et al., , 2018a Kumar et al., , 2018b Kumar et al., , 2019 Kumar et al., , 2020 Xu et al., 2020) . Because of its low tendency in generating drug-resistant viral variants, DZNep might possibly be useful as a salvage therapy in clinical settings where the virus has developed resistance to other available drugs. However, since such drugs would also inhibit the epitranscriptomic modification of cellular mRNAs, they may lead to toxicity and should be preferably used for treating the acute infections. Nevertheless, the majority of the host-directed agents which are in clinical use against cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases or cancers have minimal or no adverse side effects (Zeisel et al., 2013) .",

Inhibiting this RNA modification pathway by chemical inhibitors (DZNep) may provide significant therapeutic effect against SARS-CoV-2 and other Fig. 9 . Role of epitranscriptomic machinery in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Immediately following infection (~1h), the nascent positive sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA interacts with cap-dependent translational initiation machinery to directly translate the viral polyprotein which is further cleaved to produce 16 NSPs. After sometime (~2h), viral RNA is subjected to m6A modifications (eight m6A sites in SARs-CoV-2 genome) via cellular writers such as METTL3 and METTL14. m6A deposition facilitates recruitment of hnRNPA1 (three hnRNPA1 binding sites-two at 3 \u2032 end and one in \"S\" gene) which eventually repress translation and facilitate transcription-switch of viral RNA from translation to transcription. DZNep treatment inhibits deposition of m6A mark on SARS-CoV-2 RNA which eventually inhibits recruitment of hnRNPA1 and hence reduces synthesis of the viral RNA. coronaviruses, without generating any drug-resistant viral variants.",
