A deep learning model based on EfficientNet with noisy student was constructed using the three datasets. The test set of 150 CXR images in the private dataset were evaluated by the deep learning model and six radiologists. Threecategory classification accuracy and class-wise area under the curve (AUC) for each of the COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy were calculated. Consensus of the six radiologists was used for calculating class-wise AUC. The three-category classification accuracy of our model was 0.8667, and those of the six radiologists ranged from 0.5667 to 0.7733. For our model and the consensus of the six radiologists, the class-wise AUC of the healthy, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 pneumonia were 0.9912, 0.9492, and 0.9752 and 0.9656, 0.8654, and 0.8740, respectively. Difference of the class-wise AUC between our model and the consensus of the six radiologists was statistically significant for COVID-19 pneumonia (p value = 0.001334). Thus, an accurate model of deep learning for the three-category classification could be constructed; the diagnostic performance of our model was significantly better than that of the consensus interpretation by the six radiologists for COVID-19 pneumonia. then it had spread across the world 2 . The website of the World Health Organization has listed the total number of reported patients with COVID-19 and the associated deaths.

However, RT-PCR sensitivity is not very high in the detection of COVID-19; for example, one study reported that the sensitivity of RT-PCR (71%) was lower than that of chest computed tomography (98%) 4 . Owing to the low RT-PCR sensitivity, the effectiveness of chest X-Ray imaging (CXR) and computed tomography in the diagnosis of COVID-19 has been investigated 5 . The combination of CXR and artificial intelligence, such as deep learning (DL) 6 , has been extensively examined for automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 7-14 . Since CXR is widely available and its cost is relatively low, the combination of CXR and artificial intelligence could be employed for screening purposes of COVID-19 without the need for medical doctors.",

Elgendi et al. compared the performance of 17 DL models with and without different geometric augmentations and examined the influence of data augmentation with respect to automatic classification of COVID-19 pneumonia. Their results demonstrated that the removal of the geometrical augmentation steps actually improved the performance of the DL models 13 . Monshi et al. optimized the data augmentation and the DL hyperparameters for classifying COVID-19 pneumonia. Their proposed CovidXrayNet based on EfficientNet-B0 achieved state-of-the-art accuracy 18 . Karakanis et al. proposed a new approach to classify COVID-19 pneumonia by exploiting a conditional generative adversarial network that generated synthetic images for augmenting the limited data amount. Their lightweight DL model (ResNet8-based) achieved competitive performance 19 . These technical advances of DL make the classification models of COVID-19 pneumonia more accurate and robust. However, the performance of DL models was mainly investigated using the public database of CXR, and the comparison of the diagnostic performance between DL models and radiologists was limited 14 .",

The other CXR images were used as development sets in the COVID BIMCV and COVID private datasets. Thus, the number of CXR images of the development set was 13,958, 10,953, and 305 in the COVIDx, COVID BIMCV , and COVID private datasets, respectively. The test set size was 300 in the COVIDx and COVID BIMCV datasets, and 150 in the COVID private dataset. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The development set was further divided into a training and validation set for each dataset. The validation set size was 300 in the COVIDx and COVID BIMCV datasets, and 90 in the COVID private dataset. The combined training set was constructed from the training sets of the three datasets for training the DL model. For the development set, five different random divisions of training and validation sets were performed for each dataset. Based on the five random divisions, model training with transfer learning and performance validation were performed. Therefore, five different trained models were obtained. In order to predict the diagnosis from the CXR image of the test set, an ensemble of the five trained models was used. Schematic illustration of the dataset splitting, model training, and prediction using our DL model is shown in Fig. 2 .",

For our DL model, performance evaluation was conducted using the classification metrics of the three-category classification (class-wise precision, recall, F1-score, and three-category classification accuracy) in the three test sets 29 . For radiologists and the code-available DL models, the same performance evaluation was conducted in the test set of the COVID private dataset with 150 CXR images. In addition, the class-wise area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was calculated for COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy 29 . For the ROC analysis of the radiologists, a consensus interpretation score for the six radiologists was determined by majority voting of the individual interpretations 14 ; the score ranged from 0 to 6. Statistical analysis. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the classification metrics were calculated using 2000 bootstrap samples 14 . In addition, the class-wise AUC was compared using DeLong's test between our DL model and the consensus interpretation of the radiologists. In order to control the family-wise error rate, Bonfer- www.nature.com/scientificreports/ roni correction was used; a p value less than 0.01666 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using scikit-learn package 30 of Python and pROC package 31 of R (version 4.0.4, https:// www.rproje ct. org/). Table 3 shows the results of the diagnostic performance of the four DL models, including our DL model, and the six radiologists in the test set of the COVID private dataset. The three-category classification accuracy of our DL model was 0.8667 (130/150), and those of the six radiologists ranged from 0.5667 (85/150) to 0.7733 (116/150). The 95% CI of the three-category classification accuracies were 0.8067-0.9200 and 0.7067-0.8400 for our DL model and the radiologist with best accuracy (Radiologist 3), respectively. The three-category classification accuracy of our DL model was better than that of the six radiologists. For our DL model, the class-wise F1-scores of the healthy and COVID-19 pneumonia were higher than that of the non-COVID-19 pneumonia. This indicates that for our DL model, the diagnostic performance of the healthy and COVID-19 pneumonia was better than that of the non-COVID-19 pneumonia. On the other hand, for the six radiologists, the class-wise F1-scores of the healthy were higher than those of the COVID-19 pneumonia and non-COVID-19 pneumonia; hence, the diagnostic performance of the healthy was higher than that for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia. The three-category classification accuracies of the three code-available DL models were 0.6467 (97/150), 0.4267 (64/150), and 0.4000 (60/150), and COVID-Net 12 achieved the highest accuracy in the three-category classification among the three code-available DL models. Although the three-category classification accuracy of COVID-Net (0.6467) was comparable to those of the six radiologists, those of the other code-available DL models (0.4267 and 0.4000) were worse than those of the six radiologists. Table 4 shows the results of class-wise AUC and its 95% CI of our DL model in the test sets of the COVIDx, COVID BIMCV , and COVID private datasets. Table 4 also shows the results of the consensus of the six radiologists in the test set of the COVID private dataset. Figure 3 shows the class-wise ROC curves of our DL model and consensus of the six radiologists in the test set of the COVID private dataset.

Using the two public datasets and one private dataset, our DL model could achieve a higher diagnostic performance than the three code-available DL models and the six radiologists. Especially, for COVID-19 pneumonia, the class-wise AUC of our DL model was significantly higher than that of the consensus of the six radiologists. In DL, a large number of datasets is necessary for accurate classification. While COVID-Net used more than 10,000 CXR images to develop and evaluate its model 12 , we used more than 20,000 CXR images for our DL model. We believe that the dataset size was a major factor in the diagnostic performance of our DL model. Another reason for the superiority of our DL model could be attributed to the use of a pretrained model constructed using noisy student 21 . Noisy student is a relatively new method for increasing the robustness of the DL model; the pretrained model of EfficientNet 20 with noisy student could be useful in improving our DL model.",

Although the three-category classification accuracy of COVID-Net was the highest in the three DL models, the F1-score of COVID-Net was the worst for COVID-19 pneumonia. In the other two models, the three-category classification accuracy was lower than those of the six radiologists. Many studies have used DL models for automatic classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy using CXR images 7-14,18,19 . Table 5 summarizes these previous studies. While most of them were developed and The three-category classification accuracy of the six radiologists ranged from 0.5667 to 0.7733. There was large variability in the diagnostic performance of the radiologists in the classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy using CXR images. Inversely, this indicates that the radiologists' diagnostic performance could be improved using our DL model. The effectiveness of our DL model for computeraided diagnosis system should be evaluated in future studies.",

First, although our DL model was developed and validated using two public datasets and one private dataset, it was not evaluated using external validation. Clinical usefulness of our DL model should be further evaluated by external validation 32 . Second, our DL model focused on the threecategory classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy. The DL model ignored lung cancer and other diseases, which are considered important for detection on CXR images. This threecategory classification may be considered unnatural from a clinical viewpoint. However, we speculate that this was justified owing to the higher priority of the three-category classification in the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, our observer study was conducted on the CXR image obtained from relatively large-sized hospitals. However, since CXR can be performed in various hospitals and clinics, further studies are warranted to determine whether our DL model is effective in small hospitals and clinics. Thus, the outputs of our DL model should be adjusted based on the circumstances in which our DL model is used. Fourth, we focused on the automatic classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy using CXR images and the diagnostic performance of radiologists with our DL model was not evaluated. Thus, we did not evaluate the usefulness of our DL model as a computer-aided system. If radiologists doubt the results of our DL model, the diagnostic performance of radiologists may not be improved using our DL model. Therefore, in the future, it is crucial to build trust between the radiologists and the DL model for its implementation in clinical practice 33 . Fifth, although the results of Grad-CAM (for example, Fig. 4 ) could be useful to radiologists for comprehending the classification results of our DL model, the effectiveness of the results of Grad-CAM was not validated in the current study.",
