Moreover, RNAbased tests do not provide information on past infection. From a dissemination implementation perspective, the major limitations of RNA-based PCR self-tests are their expense (>$100) and associated delays in obtaining results. The overall process requires 3 steps: (1) the test is ordered and delivered, (2) the consumer performs the test and mails it back to the laboratory, and (3) the laboratory performs the testing procedures and returns the test results. This 3-step process may take 4-6 days to complete. In some rare circumstances, this process may take longer due to delays in acquiring or returning specimen collection kits. Processing of self-test specimens typically occurs at national laboratories. Manufacturers (eg, LabCorp) [10] estimate that laboratory specimen analysis alone will take 1-2 days. Moreover, specimens that are delayed in arriving at the laboratory may be rejected, which requires a new specimen collection by the consumer.",

This is a single-use test kit intended to detect active infection using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (LAMP) to detect viral RNA [15] . Although this test could conceivably be a major step forward in home-testing, it requires a prescription from a physician and costs approximately $50 per test. The prescription requirement will potentially reduce the reach of this home test kit to (1) those individuals who are experiencing symptoms and have a physician and (2) those who have insurance coverage. Consequently, low-income individuals without insurance and who do not have a regular physician (eg, rural Latino farmworkers) may have difficulty accessing this test [16] .",

The SARS-CoV-2 self-tests more often use written and graphic inserts and less frequently use online videos as training materials. These materials need to be examined closely, particularly in low-literacy populations that might have trouble understanding written or graphic instruction materials. Prior investigations [20, 21] have not reported self-test performance fidelity for those who are less likely to perform self-testing correctly (eg, low income, less educated persons) or for high-risk segments of the population (eg, low-income African American or Latino persons) (eg, Tu et al [21] do not report race/ethnicity data; Altamirano [20] reports data for only 2 Latino cases and reports no education data). Moreover, these studies do not examine training materials and self-implementation in natural settings outside of the clinical environment. Parallel literature on implementation fidelity for HIV oral self-testing may be helpful to investigators pursuing SARS-CoV-2 self-testing research (see \"Lessons From Human Immunodeficiency Virus Testing\" below).",

Evidence that approximately 15%-20% of new HIV cases were previously unaware of their HIV status [29, 31, 32] suggests that venue-based testing resources in the United States have limited reach in some population segments. In particular, venue-based testing has been demonstrated to have poor reach into high-risk populations in which self-testing is more acceptable [6, 30, 33] . In this regard, self-implemented HIV testing has gained global acceptance and has significant potential to extend the reach of HIV testing among priority populations [6-8, 14, 34] .",

            "text": "Another criticism of SARS-CoV-2 self-testing is that people will not faithfully test themselves [17] . However, such criticisms are somewhat vague and unsubstantiated. The ability of self-testing to identify COVID-19 cases to facilitate earlier quarantine or treatment is an empirical question to which we do not currently have an answer. However, from the experience of people working in the field of HIV, we have found that individuals can overcome their reluctance to get tested as well as overcome barriers to venue-based testing through access to self-testing [7, 8] . Large-scale dissemination studies have shown the ability of HIV self-testing to reach never-tested populations [7, 8] . Nevertheless, we assume that there remains a population segment that cannot be reached with either venue-based or at-home self-tests. From this perspective, we believe that individuals who are resistant to COVID-19 prevention messages and disbelieve the presence of a COVID-19 pandemic will probably not get tested, just as they are unlikely to get vaccinated. However, it is specious to argue that we should not widely disseminate COVID-19 self-tests because some population segments will not participate. An early concern regarding HIV self-testing was whether it would improve or inhibit identification of HIV cases and, in turn, if it would be possible to link people to care and/or counseling if they were self-testing at home. In this context, it is important that people self-test frequently to increase the chance that they can identify a new infection and, in turn, take reasonable action. With HIV self-testing, the FDA required that at-home self-tests provide the consumer with a link (telephone/ internet) to counselors to aid in the interpretation of test results, provide necessary prevention information, and direct individuals to treatment sites geographically proximal to their home residence. Similar comprehensive services should be attached to SARS-CoV-2 self-testing strategies. This type of proactive service will help produce a potentially seamless link between self-testing and prevention and/or treatment. In this regard, we would assume that individuals who seek self-testing will also be motivated to engage in prevention activities and/or seek treatment advice.",

A diagnostic criticism is that only symptomatic individuals will seek self-testing, and, therefore, it cannot be useful as a true preventative strategy in that asymptomatic persons who are infected and capable of spreading SARS-CoV-2 will not be identified. From the field of HIV, it has been clear for some time that asymptomatic individuals will test themselves for HIV given public health messages that motivate asymptomatic persons to get tested.

We agree based on our work in HIV that there are some population segments that may have problems. However, the problem is not with the tests per se, but with the instructional or training materials that accompany self-tests. For instance, OraSure's oral-HIV self-test combines graphic and written instructions along with video instruction that facilitates good training comprehension and performance fidelity, even among less-educated populations [30, 45, 55] . Video training components need to be culturally and linguistically appropriate and have been shown to significantly improve implementation fidelity (vs graphic instructions) among populations with low literacy [56] . The video component is critical because it supplants the need for reading and understanding written or graphic instructions. We strongly recommend more extensive self-implementation studies for SARS-CoV-2 self-tests in a wider range of populations, particularly those at highest risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes and for individuals least likely to understand written or graphic instructions.",

The present SARS-CoV-2 venue-based and self-testing system has challenges with respect to dissemination, implementation, and reach. There is an urgent need to conduct studies that examine these issues particularly among those who are at high-risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes (eg, low income, elderly persons, African American, Indigenous, and other people of color) [2, 3] . We need to expand the testing policy-practice framework to encompass the entire translation pipeline within a multilevel perspective (ie, multiple dissemination and implementation pipelines).",

This process should include increased information dissemination on availability and where to access self-tests to better inform individuals who are unaware of self-testing strategies. Along these lines, an elimination of the need for prescriptions to obtain self-testing is fundamentally necessary; currently, prescriptions add an additional access barrier. In addition, research is needed to examine COVID-19 self-testing training materials that rely too heavily on graphic and written instructions and test the cultural appropriateness of these materials for low-income Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander, or African American populations. Lastly, expensive tests that require mailing specimens to a laboratory for processing have reduced utility because individuals may not take necessary preventative precautions while they are awaiting their test results. Full at-home self-tests that are available at relatively low costs are required. Ideally, these costs should be underwritten with by the US government.",
