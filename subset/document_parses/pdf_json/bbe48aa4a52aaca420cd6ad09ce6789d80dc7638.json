Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors. Case presentation: We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and antirejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3 + T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus. Conclusions: The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients. And the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients is challenged by the immunosuppressive state of these patients under chemotherapy or surgery.",

After 4 weeks of radiotherapy, the patient presented fever on 24 January 2020, and this was accompanied by cough. Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans found slight interstitial abnormalities in both lower lungs, indicating a possibility of viral pneumonia (Fig. 1a, b) . The SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by positive detection of the virus in throat swab sample using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The laboratory results revealed reductions in white blood cells (WBCs) and lymphocytes in the blood, especially CD3 + CD8 + T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells ( Table 2 ). The patient was then diagnosed as suffering from COVID-19 and transferred to an isolation ward in the Department of Infectious Diseases. The symptoms were relieved after 2 days.

She was admitted to the Department of Hematology because of her past medical history of chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) for 5 years. She was also suffering hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for more than 10 years. She received percutaneous coronary intervention on 23 February 2014. She took aspirin and atorvastatin orally every day, and took nifedipine sustained-release tablets and indapamide sustained-release tablets to control blood pressure. Because of the presentation of the critical underlying diseases, she did not receive any treatment for B-CLL. The chest CT images found bilateral patchy shadowing, indicating double pneumonia in this patient on 19 January 2020 (Fig. 1d) . The patient was diagnosed as suffering from double pneumonia, COPD, hypertension, B-CLL, and coronary heart disease, and received antibiotic therapy with oseltamivir, cefoperazone, sulbactam, linezolid, and caspofungin. Because of the immunocompromised state and the severe pulmonary infection in this patient, the initial empirical antimicrobial treatment covered influenza virus, bacteria and also fungi. However, the pneumonia progressed, and symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, and dyspnea appeared in the patient on 25 January 2020 (Fig. 1e) . The SARS-CoV-2 was found in a throat swab sample by real-time PCR. The patient was then transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU), and high flow humidification oxygen inhalation therapy and methylprednisolone (40 mg daily) were employed as combination therapy. After 5 days of therapy in the ICU, symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia improved, and the patient was transferred to an isolation ward in our department on 31 January 2020. We continued the combination therapy employed in the ICU. However, the patient died on 10 February 2020 due to respiratory failure, despite the noninvasive ventilation ( Table 1 ). The lymphocyte subset analysis in this patient showed an increase in B cells, which may indicate uncontrolled B-CLL ( Table 2 ).

Because the patient had increased plasma level of 1-3-\u03b2-D polyglucosan, and positive detection of influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2) , he received a combination antimicrobial therapy.

Case 2 had an increased count of B lymphocytes in the blood, which may be attributed to her underlying disease, B-CLL. Moreover, in the other three cases, we found a reduction in all lymphocyte subsets, including CD3 + CD4 + helper T cells, CD3 + CD8 + cytolytic T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Peripheral lymphopenia was also observed during another coronavirus, SARS-CoV infection [8, 9] . In our study, we found that the counts of CD3 + CD4 + helper T cells were much lower in two severe cases (Cases 2 and 4) compared to patients with mild (Case 1) or common (Case 3) types of COVID-19. Recently, several groups including our group demonstrated that the reduction of peripheral lymphocytes, especially CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, was positively correlated with severity of illness and inhospital death in SARS-CoV-2 infection [10] [11] [12] . However, the peripheral reduction of these T cells might be the result of infiltration and sequestration of lymphocytes in lungs and other organs. The infiltrated lymphocytes were activated in the lung and secreted a lot of cytokines, which might lead the severity of the disease. In a pathological study of a patient who died due to COVID-19, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, were found in both lungs [13] . Moreover, the study found that the counts of peripheral CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were substantially reduced, while their status was hyperactivated [13] . In consistence, a recent study demonstrated that significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases [14] . Taken together, the counts of peripheral lymphocytes, especially of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, may be useful in predicting the severity and clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection in both tumorous patients and general population.",

In our four cancer patients, Cases 2 and 4 were diagnosed as severe cases of COVID-19, and Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common COVID-19, respectively, according to the diagnostic and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 infection issued by Chinese National Health Committee (5th edition). Case 2 was suffering from uncontrolled B-CLL, along with many underlying diseases including COPD, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. This condition and the greater age might have caused the severity of COVID-19 and might have led to the death of the patient. Results from the laboratory showed an elevation in markers of bacterial infection, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, after admission and diagnosis of COVID-19. Though antibiotics were used, the contaminated bacterial infection might also have contributed to the death of this patient, which was indicated by the further increases of procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein ( Table 2 ). Case 4 was diagnosed as having COVID-19 at 10 days after liver transplantation. The immunosuppressive agent tacrolimus, which was used for anti-rejection, might have inhibited the host immune system and might have led to the severity of COVID-19. Consistent with this, we found an extreme reduction in lymphocytes including CD3 + T cells, B cells, and NK cells in this patient. However, the patient entered into remission of COVID-19 after comprehensive therapy. Liver transplantation was also attributed to the severity of pneumonia. Cases 1 and 3 had better control of their related tumors and had a low risk of immunosuppression. This might have contributed to the success in recovery from COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The durations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in our three survived patients were 18 days (Case 1), 23 days (Case 3) and 39 days (Case 4) as measured from the first time of positive detection of the virus in throat swab samples (Table 2) . A recent study demonstrated that a median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 days as measured from illness onset in general population [15] . It seemed that the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was delayed in our tumor patients, especially Case 4, who received immunosuppressive agent tacrolimus after liver transplantation. Thus, the immunosuppressive state in tumor patients might contribute to the delayed virus clearance. Further large-scale studies are needed to verify this hypothesis.",

It will be interesting to know whether antiviral treatment against SARS-CoV-2 may influence the severity or outcomes of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Thirdly, we speculated that the immunosuppressive state in cancer patients might lead to severity of COVID-19 after their infection of SARS-CoV-2. However, we did not find a specific marker that could reflect the suppression of immune system in cancer patients. The reduction of peripheral CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + T cells is a universal phenomenon for all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, not only in cancer patients.",
