Here, we show that viral particles of Pseudomonas nucleus-forming jumbo phage PhiPA3 assemble into a unique structure inside cells we term phage bouquets. We show that after capsids complete DNA packaging at the surface of the phage nucleus, tails assemble and attach to capsids, and these particles accumulate over time in a spherical pattern, with tails oriented inward and the heads outward to form bouquets at specific subcellular locations. Bouquets localize at the same fixed distance from the phage nucleus even when it is mispositioned, suggesting an active mechanism for positioning. These results mark the discovery of a pathway for organizing mature viral particles inside bacteria and demonstrate that nucleus-forming jumbo phages, like most eukaryotic viruses, are highly spatially organized during all stages of their lytic cycle.",

Upon infection of a host cell, many eukaryotic viruses manipulate host proteins and components of various organelles such as the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum to form replication factories in which they can safely and efficiently replicate their genomes (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . They also assemble mature viral particles in specific subcellular compartments (1, 10) . Despite bacteria generally lacking organelles to manipulate and the longstanding assumption that bacteriophage reproduction is spatially disorganized, recent work suggests that some phages reproduce by forming replication factories and display a high level of subcellular organization within their host cells (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .",

            "text": "We recently demonstrated that Pseudomonas jumbo phage replication is spatiotemporally organized and involves formation of a key structure called the phage nucleus (11, 12, 21) . Immediately upon injection of phage DNA into the host cell, several large bacteriophages including related PhiKZ-like Pseudomonas phages PhiPA3, 201Phi2-1, and PhiKZ, as well as Serratia phage PCH45, enclose their replicating DNA in a roughly spherical, nucleus-like, proteinaceous shell that expands as the viral DNA replicates (11) (12) (13) (21) (22) (23) . The phage nucleus compartmentalizes proteins according to function, with proteins involved in DNA replication, recombination, and transcription localized inside and those involved in translation and metabolic processes outside (11, 12, 24) . This compartmentalization provides an advantage to nucleus-forming phages by allowing them to shield their DNA from host-encoded DNA restriction and CRISPR-Cas systems (13, 25) . The bacterial chromosome is degraded by an as yet to be identified nuclease, leaving the bacterial cell unable to further mount a genetic response to the phage infection (11, 12, 22, 23) .",

Over time, these filaments extend and push the phage nucleus along the cell length to ultimately form a bipolar spindle that positions the phage nucleus at the midcell (22, 23) . The PhuZ spindle's dynamic instability allows the filaments to grow and shrink to keep the phage nucleus centered at midcell throughout infection (22, 23) . Later during the infection cycle, capsids assemble on the cell membrane and migrate along the treadmilling PhuZ filaments to reach the surface of the phage nucleus, where they dock and initiate DNA packaging (21) . As it traffics the capsids to the phage nucleus, the PhuZ spindle also pushes on the phage nucleus, causing it to rotate at midcell (11, 21) . Notably, elements of this sophisticated spatiotemporal subcellular organization, including compartmentalization of viral replication and transport of viral components along cytoskeletal elements, mirror those of many eukaryotic viruses (26) (27) (28) .",

By studying phages PhiPA3 and PhiKZ, we identified subcellular genetic isolation and virogenesis incompatibility as two general mechanisms that contribute to viral speciation (29) . Subcellular genetic isolation reduces the ability of two viruses that have entered the same cell to undergo genetic exchange because they are spatially segregated (29) . For nucleus-forming jumbo phages, coinfections can result in subcellular genetic isolation due to the establishment of two separate nuclei that physically isolate the two competing viral genomes (29) . Virogenesis incompatibility occurs when common components from two different phages interact negatively to inhibit viral particle production during coinfection of the same host cell (29) . In the case of PhiPA3 and PhiKZ, for example, PhuZ monomers from each phage are similar enough to each other to coassemble. However, these hybrid filaments are nonfunctional, lacking treadmilling and dynamic instability (21, 29) . This disrupts phage nucleus positioning and capsid trafficking to the phage nucleus, reducing phage DNA packaging. Subcellular genetic isolation and virogenesis incompatibility are likely widespread speciation mechanisms among eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses and highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying viral spatiotemporal subcellular organization.",

For example, the major steps of T4 phage capsid assembly occurs at the membrane, followed by viral DNA packaging and finally attachment of the phage head to the tail.

            "text": "We investigated the major steps of viral maturation in nucleusforming jumbo phage PhiPA3 using fluorescence microscopy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells were infected with PhiPA3, stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to reveal DNA, and imaged throughout the infection cycle. Using fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have previously demonstrated that Pseudomonas phages PhiPA3, 201Phi2-1, and PhiKZ degrade the host chromosome early in the infection cycle, which allows the use of DAPI staining to visualize phage DNA (11, 12, 21, 22, 23) . At 15-min post-infection (mpi), during the early stages of PhiPA3 replication, DAPI staining revealed the phage nucleus as a small focus near one cell pole (Fig. 1A , top leftmost panel, orange arrows), while the host chromosome filled most of the cell. By 30 and 45 mpi, the host chromosome had been degraded and the phage nucleus appeared as a larger focus located near midcell as previously reported (Fig. 1A , top panels, white arrows) (11, 12, 21, 22, 23) . From 60 to 90 mpi; however, two new DAPI staining structures appeared on each side of the phage nucleus. These structures appeared as foci at 60 mpi and grew into rings at 75 and 90 mpi (Fig. 1A , top panels, green arrows). These structures only appeared after DNA packaging into capsid heads (60 mpi), suggesting that they are composed of capsids containing viral DNA assembled into a spherical structure that appears as a ring when viewed in cross section. The number of DAPI rings per cell increased over time such that, at 60 mpi, infected cells contained either one (3%, n = 126) or two rings (8%, n = 126) of capsids (Fig. 1E ). By 75 mpi, more than 50% of infected cells contained two rings [n = 117; Fig. 1 , A (top panels) and E], and by 90 mpi, more than four rings were detected in some cells (n = 128; Fig. 1 , B and E). The infected cells were later lysed at approximately 120 mpi. We used structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (Fig. 1C ) to observe these structures at higher resolution in DAPI-stained infected cells at 90 mpi. At this resolution, the rings appeared as two horseshoe-shaped structures that averaged ~660 \u00b1 83 nm (n = 8) in diameter with an opening of ~150 \u00b1 48 nm (n = 8) located ~1 \u00b1 0.15 \uf06dm away from the phage nucleus when measuring from the center of the horseshoe structure to the center of the phage nucleus (n = 8 and n = 255; Fig. 1 , C and F). The distance from the edge of the horseshoe structure to the edge of the phage nucleus averaged ~200 \u00b1 70 nm (n = 8; Fig. 1C ).",

At early time points, gp136-GFP appeared uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm, excluded from the phage nucleus (30 mpi; Fig. 2A ). At 45 mpi, gp136-GFP localized to the periphery of the phage nucleus, indicating that capsids assembled and docked on the phage nucleus (45 mpi; Fig. 2A ). From 60 to 100 mpi, capsids relocalized to distinct regions on each side of the nucleus, forming small foci that colocalized with the DAPI rings ( Fig. 2A ). In addition, DAPI staining intensity in the flanking rings increased over time while simultaneously decreasing in the phage nucleus (Fig. 2C ). Together, these results support the conclusion that DAPI rings visualized at late stages of infection are composed of capsids that have been filled with DNA at the nucleus surface and then migrated to be arranged in spheres on each side of the nucleus.",

At these late time points, the bright ring of DAPI staining capsids completely surrounded the fluorescence from GFP-tagged gp165. Three additional phage structural proteins (gp164, gp166, and gp167) also localized inside the DNA rings with the other tail proteins (Fig. 2D) , while gp11 and gp12 colocalized with the DAPI-stained capsid rings (Fig. 2D) .

At late stages of PhiPA3 infection, bouquets also weakly excluded fluorescence from each of these GFP fusion proteins, which was demonstrated with a line plot of fluorescence intensity drawn through the long axis of the cell (Fig. 2E , green arrows). Although the extent of the exclusion from the bouquets was not as strong as the exclusion from the nucleus, the ability to weakly exclude these proteins as well as soluble GFP and mCherry ( Fig. 2F and fig. S3 ) suggests that bouquets are densely packed with phage particles that prevent free diffusion of these cytoplasmic proteins through the structures.",

First, we simultaneously examined the localization of tails (gp165-GFP) or capsids (gp136-GFP) with the phage nucleus shell protein (mCherry-gp53) (Fig. 3, A and B) . Capsids (gp136-GFP) assemble and dock on the nucleus at 45 mpi (Fig. 3B ) and then colocalize with DNA rings on either side of the nucleus by 70 mpi (Fig. 3B ; see also Fig. 2A ). In comparison, the tail sheath protein gp165-GFP was uniformly distributed until 60 mpi (Fig. 2B ), at which time it relocalized into foci inside DAPI-stained rings on both sides of the nucleus (Fig. 3A) . Next, we visualized the tail sheath protein (gp165-GFP) together with the capsids (gp136-mCherry) and found that tail sheath fluorescence occurred inside the ring of capsids (Fig. 3, C and D) . To study the relative timing of capsid and tail assembly, we simultaneously visualized capsid gp136-mCherry and tail sheath protein gp165-GFP during infection using time-lapse microscopy. In the example shown in Fig. 3E , capsids (red foci) leave the nucleus and migrate to form bouquets nearly simultaneously to the accumulation of tail proteins at the same sites flanking the phage nucleus. Most of the tail sheath protein gp165-GFP accumulates into two foci within approximately 4.5 min (270 s) ( Fig. 3E  and fig. S4 ).",

The distance from the edge of the capsid clusters to the edge of the phage nucleus (~200 nm) also agreed with measurements from fluorescence microscopy.

At 75 mpi, the majority (92%, n = 100) of infected cells expressing wild-type PhuZ contained two or more bouquets, while ~8% contained a single bouquet (Fig. 5D ). In contrast, in cells expressing PhuZD190A, ~35% (n = 100) of infected cells contained two or more bouquets and ~30% contained a single bouquet at the same time point of infection (Fig. 5D ), resulting in a small but significant decrease in the overall average number of bouquets per cell observed (Fig. 5F ). The average bouquet size was also smaller, measuring 0.27 \uf06dm 2 (n = 109) in the cells expressing PhuZD190A compared to 0.39 \uf06dm 2 (n = 182) for the wild-type PhuZ-expressing strain (Fig. 5, B, C, and E) . The decrease in bouquet size and number is likely due to the PhuZD190A mutant inhibiting capsid trafficking to the nucleus and therefore phage DNA packaging that precedes bouquet assembly (21) . To determine whether this was the case, we localized capsids and tail proteins in the presence of the PhuZD190A-GFP mutant at late stages of infection. In wild-type cells, bouquets form on each side of the nucleus, with tail proteins localized inside a sphere of capsid proteins (Figs. 2 and 3) . In contrast, in the presence of the PhuZD190A-GFP mutant, tails were localized properly inside the bouquets (Fig. 5H) , while many capsids were associated with the sides of the PhuZ filaments (Fig. 5I) . These results suggest that, in the presence of the PhuZD190A-GFP mutant, bouquets decrease in size and number due to a failure of capsids to be transported to the phage nucleus, although bouquet positioning is largely independent of the PhuZ spindle. However, further work must be done to determine how the phage designates and maintains bouquet position.",

            "text": "Our discovery of a highly organized assemblage of phage particles inside bacteria late during infection demonstrates that nucleusforming jumbo phages are capable of surprisingly complex subcellular organization throughout their entire replication cycle. Our updated model for jumbo phage replication, shown in Fig. 6 together with our proposed model (40) , begins with the attachment of phage to the host cell and injection of viral DNA. The expression of the nuclear shell protein occurs immediately after injection to form an enclosure around phage DNA that provides a safe compartment for DNA replication to occur. Bacterial chromosomal DNA is degraded, possibly providing nucleotides for DNA synthesis and eliminating the ability of the cell to mount any further defense based on gene expression. Inside the phage nucleus, phage-encoded RNA polymerases transcribe viral mRNA that is exported by unknown mechanisms to the cytoplasm. Some of the proteins required for phage DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription are selectively imported into the phage nucleus, while phage structural proteins, metabolic enzymes, and ribosomes remain in the cytoplasm. Viral capsid proteins assemble on the membrane midway through the infection cycle and are transported by treadmilling PhuZ filaments to the phage nucleus, where they dock to initiate DNA packaging. Treadmilling filaments rotate the phage nucleus to allow capsids to be evenly distributed on its surface (40) . Once capsids are full of viral DNA, they coassemble with tails and form bouquets containing what appear to be mature particles. These large assemblages of particles occur at a specific distance from the phage nucleus even when the nucleus is severely mispositioned due to expression of a catalytically dead PhuZ mutant. While our results suggest that the PhuZ spindle is likely not essential for their formation, we cannot completely rule out a role for the spindle in bouquet production since the PhuZ protein is also involved in delivering capsids to the nucleus.",

            "text": "We do not currently understand how bouquets form but propose two possible hypotheses. In one scenario, capsids are filled with DNA, leave the nucleus surface, and attach to tails that have assembled in the cytoplasm. The mature particles then accumulate in bouquets. In one variation of this model, clusters of tails assemble adjacent to the nucleus, followed by the attachment of DNA-filled capsids. Alternatively, tail-less capsids might assemble in a spherical configuration adjacent to the nucleus, followed by assembly and attachment of tails in the bouquets. We cannot currently distinguish between these models, and the mechanism driving assembly is unknown. Although the role of bouquet formation in phage replication is unclear, it is tempting to speculate that they are viral assembly centers that increase the efficiency of phage particle maturation. As they exclude examined host cell proteins (Fig. 2E) , the bouquet structure may also protect the phage particles from host proteases or other defenses that might damage tail fibers and reduce their infectivity. However, we note that bouquets are not observed in every cell during PhiPA3 infection and are less frequently observed during infections by phages PhiKZ and 201Phi2-1 under these conditions. This is intriguing as these three phages are genetically related (overall amino acid similarities: 201Phi2-1 versus PhiPA3 = 39%, 201Phi2-1 versus PhiKZ = 38%, and PhiKZ versus PhiPA3 = 44%), share many similarities in their replication mechanisms (PhuZ spindle assembly, nucleus formation, and capsid trafficking), and produce particles at comparable efficiencies [titers, ~1 \u00d7 10 11 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ ml]. Therefore, it seems likely that these assemblages are not essential for these phages to reproduce. However, we have recently shown that Escherichia coli jumbo phage Goslar also forms a nucleus and large phage bouquets late during infection, demonstrating that this phenomenon is conserved in a distantly related jumbo phage (41) . We do not observe intact bouquets after cell lysis by fluorescence microscopy, suggesting that they do not survive the forceful lysis of the host cell. In relatively rare cases, previous electron microscopy studies examining phage lysates have noticed clusters of phages in a bouquet structure outside of cells, but it was unclear if these structures were formed inside of cells as part of phage production or if they resulted from attachment to a common substrate after cell lysis. Together, our results expand our knowledge of viral subcellular organization and suggest that viral assembly and maturation are spatially organized in viruses across kingdoms.",

Membranes and capsid shells were semiautomatically segmented with TomoSegMemTV that were then manually refined with Amira software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (47) . EMAN2 was used to manually pick the ribosomes, which were then subsequently averaged, classified, and placed back in the tomogram using Dynamo as a representation in Fig. 4 (48, 49) . For further subtomogram averaging of ribosomes, the tilt series corresponding to Fig. 4 was motion-corrected and the tomogram was reconstructed using Warp v1.09 (50) . Contrast transfer function correction was then performed in Warp v1.09, and a deconvolved binned version (30 \u00c5/pixel) of the tomogram was used for ribosome template matching. False-positive particles that corresponded to membranes and exterior of the cell were manually removed, and the extracted ribosomes were then classified using RELION (51) and M software ( fig. S6 ) (52) .",

(A) Time-series images over a course of infection of P. aeruginosa by phage PhiPA3 (\uf066PA3; top panels), PhiKZ (\uf066KZ; middle panels), and P. chlororaphis infected with 201Phi2-1 (bottom panels). Cell membranes were stained with FM4-64 (red), and DNA was stained with DAPI (blue or gray). The phage genome was injected into the host cell close to the pole (orange arrows) at early infection, grew in size, and centrally located at midcell at 45 mpi (white arrows), and bouquet structures appeared adjacent to the phage nucleus (nu) after 60 mpi (green arrows). (B) Still images of phage PhiPA3-infected P. aeruginosa cells at late infection (100 mpi). (C) Three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) image of the bouquet structures in phage PhiPA3-infected P. aeruginosa cells at 90 mpi reveals horseshoe-shaped structures adjacent to the phage nucleus, with average distance and size indicated (n of bouquets = 8). Subpanels show magnified images of the horseshoe-shaped structure and its heatmap intensity. (D) Graph showing the percentage of Pseudomonas cells infected with phages PhiPA3, PhiKZ, and 201Phi2-1 containing bouquets at 60, 75, and 90 mpi.

S1). Phage PhiPA3 was added onto the pad to initiate infection. Cell membrane was stained by FM4-64 (red), and DNA was stained by DAPI (blue or gray).(A and B) Temporal localization pattern of major capsid protein gp136 (A) and tail sheath protein gp165 (B) during infection relative to the location of the phage nucleus and bouquets. (C) Heatmaps of the DAPI intensity inside the PhiPA3-infected cells as corresponding to the fluorescent micrographs in (B) showing DNA distributed from the nucleus into bouquets at late infection. nu and b indicate the position of the phage nucleus and bouquets, respectively. A.U., arbitrary units. (D) Localization of other structural proteins in PhiPA3-infected cells at 75 mpi: virion structural proteins gp11, gp12, and gp164 and tail proteins gp166 and gp167. These proteins localized with DAPI, indicating that they are part of the capsid or accumulated inside the bouquets and suggesting that they are tail proteins.
