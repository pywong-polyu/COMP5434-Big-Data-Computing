All families with at least one parent and one child below the age of 20 who lived at the same address (N = 662,582), where at least one member, i.e. the index case, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, were included. Secondary attack rates (SAR7) were defined as the share of non-index family members with a positive PCR test within 7 days after the date when the index case tested positive. SARs were calculated separately for parent-and child-index cases, and for parent-and child-secondary cases. We identified 7548 families with an index case, comprising 26,991 individuals (12,184 parents, 14,808 children). The index was a parent in 66% of the cases. Among index children, 42% were in the age group 17-20 and only 8% in the age group 0-6. When the index was a parent, SAR7 was 24% (95% CI 24-25), whilst SAR7 was 14% (95% CI 13-15) when the index was a child. However, SAR7 was 24% (95% CI 20-28) when the index was a child aged 0-6 years and declined with increasing age of the index child. SAR7 from index parent to other parent was 35% (95% CI 33-36), and from index child to other children 12% (95% CI 11-13). SAR7 from index child aged 0-6 to parents was 27% (95% CI 22-33). The percent of non-index family members tested within 7 days after the index case, increased from about 20% in April to 80% in December, however, SAR7 stabilized at about 20% from May. We conclude that parents and older children are most often index cases for SARS-CoV-2 in families in Norway, while parents and young children more often transmit the virus within the family. This study suggests that whilst the absolute infection numbers are low for young children because of their low introduction rate, when infected, young children and parents transmit the virus to the same extent within the family.",

Estimates of transmission from children to other family members are particularly scarce [3, 5] due to less testing and consequently low numbers of confirmed cases, and possibly more asymptomatic infections in children [6] . One prospective study from the USA found secondary attack rates of over 50%, also from children below 12 years of age, but this study included just 5 index cases in this age group [5] . Viner et al. conclude their systematic review by underlining the particular need for studies \"that investigate secondary infections from child or adolescent index cases compared with secondary infections from adult index cases\u00bb [7] .",

Ascertaining the role of index case characteristics in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to other family members, has been difficult in previous studies because testing strategies have varied, and the number of families included has been limited. We provide a populationwide study of the testing and secondary infection rates for all affected families in Norway.",

A trough in new infections in the summer, accompanied by many of the strict containment measures being loosened, was followed by a second peak in late autumn. During the first wave, testing capacity was limited, but there was still comprehensive testing of symptomatic patients and healthcare personnel. During the second wave, testing has been easily accessible and free for anyone with symptoms, as well as all close contacts of confirmed cases. All results from PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 are transferred automatically and electronically to a national administrative system. This information can be combined with other information about individuals by merging registers based on unique personal identification numbers.

The children aged 17-20 years comprise 22% of all the children, but as many as 42% of the child index cases. The younger children are not often the index case. This could be because they display less symptoms, because it is easier to test an adult than a small child if both have symptoms, or because small children are less often infected outside of the family. This distribution of index cases in the families does not fully reflect the age-distribution of infected residents of Norway in 2020, where 6629 of those below 20 (0.5% of residents in the age group) and 18,643 of those aged 20-50 (0.9%) had been infected. This suggests that the overrepresentation of parents as index in the family group (66%) is lower than for adults 20-50 in the population at large (74%), possibly reflecting both different infection rates in adults living in families with children compared with adults living in families without children or alone, and higher SARs between parents within the family. Subsequent transmissions within the families follow different patterns depending on the age of the index case. SAR7 was high both when a parent was the index (24%, 95% CI 24-25) and when a young child aged 0-6 was index (24%, 95% CI 20-28). However, it was low when an older child aged 17-20 was the index (11%, 95% CI 10-13). In short, parents and older children contribute the most to the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the family, while parents and young children contribute the most to transmitting the disease within the family. It could be that older children more often have another residence than the one they are registered at, i.e. in student accommodation or due to shared custody between parents. However, older children may also behave in ways that restrict viral transfer more than young children.",

Very few studies calculate SARs across characteristics of the index or separately to parents and children. Grijalva et al. is a notable exception, but they only have five index children below the age of 12 [5] . Viner et al. find that their data were insufficient to conclude whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children is lower than by adults, and they conclude their review by stating that studies \"that investigate secondary infections from child or adolescent index cases compared with secondary infections from adult index cases are particularly needed\u00bb [7] .",

This may affect who we identify as index cases, and maybe also which secondary cases are identified. For example, when a young child (0-6) was index, about 90% of the family members were tested within 7 days after index date, while this number was about 70% when a parent was index, which might suggest that more secondary cases were identified when index was a child than when index was a parent.",

            "text": "Better knowledge of actual directions of transmission within families requires prospective studies where all family members are tested daily with the same method in the week following index identification, preferably also with reporting of symptoms and genome identification of the viruses. Genome analysis would also help to reveal exposure to multiple infection events within the same family, which could interfere with the detected SAR. However, the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 has been low in Norway during the pandemic, estimated to peak at 74 per 100,000 per week towards the end of 2020 [9] , which makes several transmission incidents into the same family at the same time less likely. A clear advantage of our study to such prospective studies, is that we do not have attrition: We observe every family, and we can observe all family members in the followup period, regardless of motivation to participate in a study or not. Indeed, our data stem from a real-world situation, where detection of secondary cases relates to a combination of the actual transmission of the virus and the behavioral responses to disease and the actual testing regime. This point is illustrated by us seeing lower SAR in the two first months of the pandemic, when testing capacity was limited, than later, when testing of family members was widely available. It seems that a test capacity where about 50% of the nonindex family members are being tested, results in roughly the same SAR as a test regime where 80% of the non-index family members are tested. Another way of putting this, is that testing of cases with mild symptoms captures most of the cases. It should also be noted that we intentionally excluded families where there were \"co-indexes\" that could result in a greater infection pressure within the household.",

Similar factors may also explain some of the variation in SARs between different studies. We observed a small increase in SAR during December 2020, which may be a coincidence, or perhaps due to colder weather or closer contact between family members during the celebration of Christmas. Moreover, the introduction of variants of new and more easily transferable virus mutants could have played a role.",
