Furthermore, with the COVID-19 guidelines of social distancing, internet connectivity became necessary to everyday activities such as work, learning, and staying in touch with family and friends. This paper introduces a publicly available U.S. Broadband Coverage data set that reports broadband coverage percentages at a zip codelevel. We also explain how we used differential privacy to guarantee that the privacy of individual households is preserved. Our data set also contains error ranges estimates, providing information on the expected error introduced by differential privacy per zip code. We describe our error range calculation method and show that this additional data metric does not induce any privacy losses.",

Getting these numbers right is vitally important. This data is used by federal, state, and local agencies to decide where to target public funds dedicated to closing this broadband gap 1 . That means millions of Americans already lacking broadband access have been made invisible, substantially decreasing the likelihood of additional broadband funding or much-needed broadband service. At the same time, making this data available in the clear, without any type of post-processing, may affect the privacy of individual households. In this contribution we solve this dilemma by presenting a data set that allows researchers and policy makers to develop solutions to improve broadband access while simultaneously preserving the privacy of individual households. This paper describes the data privatization process used in the release of the broadband coverage data set 2 . The data sets utilized are derived from anonymized data Microsoft collects as part of our ongoing work to improve our software and services' performance and security. We estimate broadband coverage by combining data from multiple Microsoft services. Every time a device receives an update or connects to a Microsoft service, we can estimate the throughput speed. We know the package's size sent to the computer, and we know the total time of the download. We also determine zip code level location data via reverse IP. Therefore, we can count the number of devices connected to the internet at broadband speed per each zip code based on the FCC's definition of broadband that is 25mbps per download 3 . Using this method, we estimate that in 2020, \u2248 123 million people in the United States are not using the internet at broadband speeds.",
