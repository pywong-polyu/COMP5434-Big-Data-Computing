            "text": "Objectives: The objective of the study is to investigate the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes in France. Study design: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among a representative sample of the French population between November 20th and 23rd 2020 (N \u00bc 1146). Methods: Factors associated with the intention to get vaccinated and with COVID-19 vaccine attitudes were estimated using ordered logistic and multinomial logistic regressions, respectively. Independent variables of interest include COVID-19 and vaccine perceptions, trust, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and time/risk preferences. Results: Only 30.5% of our respondents would agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19 during the first semester of 2021 while 31.1% declare being unsure of their vaccination intentions. COVID-19 risk perceptions are associated with vaccination intentions and attitudes. Individual and collective benefits of the vaccine and the concerns over its safety are strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes. Vaccine acceptors are more willing to take risks in the health domain compared with vaccine hesitant respondents which indicates that the COVID-19 vaccine is perceived as a greater health risk than the COVID-19 itself by some respondents. We also find a positive association between future preference and the willingness to get vaccinated. Conclusion: Awareness campaigns should be conducted to enhance vaccination uptake among vaccine hesitant individuals. These campaigns could highlight the positive benefit-risk balance of the COVID-19 vaccines or the short-term benefits of vaccination and should reinsure the public on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines.",

            "text": "In France, the COVID-19 vaccination campaign has started in January 2021. After the vaccination of high-risk individuals, the vaccination campaign has been scaled-up to the rest of the French population from spring 2021 onward. Despite the low initial COVID-19 vaccination intentions among the French population before the launch of the vaccination campaign (only 53% 1 and 39% 2 of respondents from nationally representative samples of the French adult population were willing to get vaccinated in November and December 2020, respectively) and the growing vaccine hesitancy since the H1N1 influenza pandemic vaccination campaign of 2009, 3e6 half of the French population had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine at the beginning of summer 2021. Nevertheless, the rhythm of first doses administration is currently slowing down while it is estimated that a 60%e90% level of COVID-19 vaccination uptake is needed to create herd immunity. 7 Convincing vaccine hesitant populations to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is now crucial to reduce the level of circulation of the virus, to prevent the emergence of variants and to reach herd immunity. In this context, studying the factors associated with the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 appears crucial to design effective awareness campaigns enhancing vaccination uptake. Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccination intentions are lower among women, unemployed and less educated respondents 8e10 and that they are positively associated with COVID-19 risk perceptions 11, 12 and with the perceived benefit of the vaccine. 13, 14 On the other hand, concerns over the efficacy or the safety of the vaccine were stated as reasons for not wanting to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in several studies. 10,14e16 Lack of trust in vaccine development or testing processes and in scientific research was also found to be prevalent among vaccine hesitant respondents in the United States and Italy, 16, 17 whereas COVID-19 misinformation or endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories were found to be negatively associated with vaccination intentions. 18e20 In France, several studies have investigated the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions among the general population during or just after the first wave of the epidemic in spring 2020. 21e25 These studies, conducted either in representative 22e24 or non-representative 21,25 samples of the French adult population, have found that vaccination intentions are lower among female, older (>65 years old) and low-income respondents. Respondents declaring to be 'afraid of the new coronavirus' or feeling 'at risk of getting infected by the new coronavirus' were more likely to declare they will get vaccinated if a vaccine was available in a study conducted among a non-representative sample of the French adult population. 21 Being very concerned about getting infected with COVID-19 was found to be negatively correlated with COVID-19 vaccine refusal, i.e., declaring 'probably not' or 'certainly not' agreeing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available, among a representative sample of the French population. 23 Vaccination history and risk factors of a severe form of COVID-19 were also shown to be significantly associated with vaccine outright refusal (never choosing to get vaccinated whatever the vaccine characteristics) and vaccine hesitancy (choosing to get vaccinated or not depending on the vaccine characteristics) in a discrete choice experiment conducted among a representative working-age population. 24 COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, measured through the level of agreement with nine items such as 'a vaccine against the coronavirus exists, but it is kept secret by those who have it in order to increase its value', were also found to be negatively associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions in a study conducted among a non-representative sample of the French population in spring 2020. 25 Finally, a study on COVID-19 vaccination intentions among French healthcare workers found that COVID-19 fear or perceived risk and previous flu vaccination were associated with vaccination intentions. 26 Using data of an online survey conducted among a sample representative of the adult population living in France with regard to gender, age, region and socio-professional category between November 20th and 23rd 2020 (N \u00bc 1146), we study the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes at a time the first efficacy results from phase 3 trials of COVID-19 vaccines were publicly released. Our objective is to study how COVID-19 risk perceptions, perceived efficacy and concerns over the COVID-19 vaccine, trust, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and time and risk preferences are associated with the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 during the first semester of 2021.",

Using respondents' answers to this question, we created a three-category vaccine attitude variable based on the continuum of vaccine hesitancy developed by the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy. 27 Participants were categorized in the 'vaccine acceptance' category if they declared they would get vaccinated in less than three months, in the 'vaccine hesitancy' category if they declared they would get vaccinated after three months or if they declared being unsure of whether they would get vaccinated and in the 'vaccine outright refusal' category if they declared they would never get vaccinated.",

Factors associated with the vaccine attitude categorization ('vaccine acceptance', 'vaccine hesitancy' and 'vaccine outright refusal') were estimated using multinomial logistic regressions using the 'vaccine acceptance' category as the base outcome.

Among our respondents, 30.5% declare they would probably or definitely agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine were to be approved in France during the first semester of 2021, whereas 31.1% declare being unsure whether they would be willing to get vaccinated. Regarding the COVID-19 vaccine attitude, 25% of respondents are classified in the 'vaccine acceptance' category, 60.6% in the 'vaccine hesitancy' category and 14.4% in the 'vaccine outright refusal' category.

Among respondents at risk of a severe form of COVID-19, vaccination intentions are higher for pregnant women and for respondents with chronic diseases but not for respondents older than 65 years. Respondents who frequently get vaccinated also express higher intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and are less likely to be vaccine hesitant.

The magnitude and level of significance of the associations between the intention and lower COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy vaccine perceptions and COVID-19 vaccination intentions/ attitudes are higher than those observed for COVID-19 risk perceptions.

            "text": "Our results are in line with previous studies using the HBM to investigate vaccination intentions. Indeed, a meta-analysis of studies using the HBM found that risk likelihood, susceptibility, and severity significantly predicted vaccination behaviours 35 while we also find that the perceived threat is significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions. Moreover, the strong associations we find between the perceived efficacy/concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination intentions/attitudes are consistent with a recent scooping review which highlighted that of the four main HBM constructs, perceived barriers and perceived benefits were the strongest predictors of health-related behavioural changes. 36 More specifically, as found for COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes in this study, previous literature on vaccination behaviours during epidemic contexts, such as H1N1 or influenza, highlighted the importance of the perceived barriers 31, 37 and perceived benefits 38,39 of the vaccine on vaccination uptake. Very recently, and in concordance with our results, other studies investigating COVID-19 vaccination intentions using the HBM theoretical framework also emphasized the importance of perceived severity, perceived vaccine benefits and perceived barriers to vaccination on vaccination acceptance. 30, 40, 41 Taken together, our results on the HBM variables suggest that targeted communication campaigns should be launched to enhance trust in the newly developed vaccines and to increase vaccination uptake among vaccine hesitant populations. Convincing vaccine hesitant populations to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is indeed crucial to reduce the level of circulation of the virus and to prevent the emergence of variants against which the currently available vaccines might be less effective. Given the observed concern over the rapidity of development, these campaigns could explain how the rapid progresses on the COVID-19 vaccines were made possible by unprecedented research efforts and financing (including government financing), by previous scientific knowledge on coronaviruses and on vaccine development for other pathogens and by the rapid genetic sequencing of this new coronavirus that allowed the subsequent development of messenger RNA vaccines. Public health authorities should also explain that, while accelerated trial procedures allowed for a rapid assessment of COVID-19 vaccines by health technology agencies, safety and efficacy routine checks were performed as scrupulously as done for any other drugs or vaccines seeking market authorisation.",
