The early implementation of teleoncology internship can also be beneficial in sharing knowledge from overseas and establishing exchange programs or international summer schools in oncology to resume a highly appreciated [6] part of medical studies. Students, who are usually more active than their professors on social media, can also share evidence-based knowledge, especially in the preventive share of oncology [7] .",
