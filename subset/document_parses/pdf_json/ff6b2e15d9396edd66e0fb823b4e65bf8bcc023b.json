With accuracy matching or exceeding chest X-ray (CXR) for most acute respiratory illnesses, 1-3 LUS additionally lacks the radiation and laborious workflow of computed tomography (CT). Further, as a low cost, battery operated modality, LUS can be delivered at large scale in any environment and is ideally suited for pandemic conditions. 4 B lines are the characteristic pathological feature on LUS, created by either pulmonary edema or non-cardiac causes of interstitial syndromes. The latter includes a broad list of conditions ranging from pneumonia, pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or fibrosis. 5 While an accompanying thick pleural line is helpful in differentiating cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic causes of B lines, 6 reliable methods to differentiate noncardiogenic causes from one another on LUS have not been established. Additionally, user dependent interpretation of LUS contributes to wide variation in disease classification, 7, 8 creating urgency for techniques that improve diagnostic precision and reducing user-dependence.",

These profiles were chosen deliberately to challenge the neural network to classify images with obvious qualitative differences (HPE vs ARDS) and with no obvious differences (NCOVID vs COVID) between their B lines patterns ( Figure 1 , Videos 1, 2, 3). The COVID class consisted of confirmed cases of COVID-19 via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. The NCOVID class consisted of an assortment of causes: aspiration, community acquired pneumonia, hospital acquired pneumonia and viral pneumonias. Exams were conducted as part of patient encounters in the emergency department, intensive care unit and medical wards across the 2 hospitals.",

Videos from our dataset represented a variety of ultrasound systems with phased array probe predominantly used for acquisition. Videos of the costophrenic region (which included solid abdominal organs, diaphragm, or other pleural pathologies such as effusions or trans-lobar consolidations) were excluded as 1) these regions did not contribute greatly to alveolar diagnoses, 2) this would introduce heterogeneity into the still image data, and 3) a trained clinician can easily distinguish between these pathologies and B lines. Duplicate studies were discarded to avoid overfitting. From each encounter, de-identified mp4 loops of B lines, ranging from 3-6 seconds in length with a frame rate ranging from 30-60/second (depending on the ultrasound system), were extracted. As COVID was the newest class available to our database, its comparably smaller number of encounters governed the number of encounters we extracted from HPE and NCOVID. A balanced volume of data for each class of image is important to avoid model over training on a single image class and/or overfitting.",

The output tensor of the final convolutional layer of the Xception model was subject to 2D global average pooling, resulting in a 1-dimensional tensor. Dropout at a rate of 0.6 was applied to introduce heavy regularization to the model and provided a noticeable reduction in overfitting. The final layer was a 3-node fully connected layer with softmax activation. The output of the model represents the probabilities that the model assigned to each of the 3 classes, all summing to 1.0. The argmax of this probability distribution was considered to be the model's decision. To further combat overfitting, early stopping was applied by halting training if the loss on the validation set did not decrease over the most recent 15 epochs. 20 For additional details on model selection, training, coding practice, our GitHub repository and hardware used in this project, please see Supplementary Appendix.",

While many approaches exist to avoid an overfit model, we, in addition to multiple data augmentation techniques, reserved 10% of our data (test-2) as a hold-back set, not involved in model fitting or selection. This approach mimics the unbiased, generalizable performance desired of an image classifier and is familiar to other notable deep learning vision research in medicine. [9] [10] [11] Deep learning has shown similarly favorable results in recent CXR and CT studies of COVID-19. 26, 27 Given LUS image creation is fundamentally different (producing artifacts, rather than anatomic images of the lung), it could not be expected that our work with LUS would have yielded such similar results.

Our results point to a unique, pixel-level signature within the COVID-19 image. Though the exact mechanism of distinction is unknown, the heat map results suggest that subvisible variations in the pleural line itself is most active in driving the model's performance. The precise taxonomical implications of our findings, whether they are driven by COVID-19, coronaviruses or viruses a whole, will require additional research.",

The first relates to the opaqueness that is implicit to deep neural networks. Despite using Grad-CAM, the decisions by the trained model are not outwardly justified and we are unable to critique its methods and must trust its predictions. Our benchmarking survey did not exactly replicate the questions posed to our neural network which made our statistical analysis more complex than it might have needed to be otherwise. The other limitations of our study related to the data size and sources. Though our model performance signal was strong, the addition of further training data can only aid with generalizability of the model. Future work will focus on validation through multi-center collation of COVID LUS encounters. Lastly, our data were all from hospitalized patients and our results may not generalize to those who are less ill.",
