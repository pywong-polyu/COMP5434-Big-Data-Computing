Patients with dilated pancreatic ducts (\u2265 3 mm) who underwent MIPD were 1:3 propensity score-matched to patients with dilated ducts who underwent OPD and outcomes compared. Likewise, patients with non-dilated pancreatic ducts (< 3 mm) who underwent MIPD were 1:3 propensity score-matched to patients with non-dilated ducts who underwent OPD and outcomes were compared. Results 371 patients underwent PD-74 (19.9%) MIPD and 297 (80.1%) underwent OPD. Overall, patients who underwent MIPD had significantly less intraoperative blood loss. After 1:3 propensity score matching, patients with dilated pancreatic ducts who underwent MIPD (n = 45) had significantly lower overall complication and 90-day readmission rates compared to matched OPD patients (n = 135) with dilated ducts. Patients with dilated duct who underwent MIPD were more likely to have an ideal outcome than patients with OPD (29 vs 15%, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in postoperative outcomes among propensity score-matched patients with non-dilated pancreatic ducts who underwent MIPD (n = 29) compared to matched patients undergoing OPD (n = 87) with non-dilated ducts. Conclusions MIPD is safe with comparable perioperative outcomes to OPD. Patients with pancreatic ducts \u2265 3 mm appear to derive the most benefit from MIPD in terms of fewer complications, lower readmission rates, and higher likelihood of ideal outcome.",

Therefore, patients who develop pancreatic fistulas after PD may be less likely to experience a benefit from a minimally invasive approach compared to patients without pancreatic fistulas. However, in most modern series, the majority of patients undergoing PD do not experience a pancreatic fistula postoperatively [11] . The risk factors for pancreatic fistula after PD are well described, with small pancreatic ducts and soft pancreatic gland texture being the primary predisposing factors [11] [12] [13] [14] . Of these, pancreatic duct size can be objectively measured preoperatively with commonly used radiologic and ultrasound imaging modalities. Understanding preoperatively which patients (if any) benefit from MIPD could be useful, as starting an MIPD program is not only costly and resource intensive but is also associated with a steep learning curve [2] . Such knowledge, may allow surgeons to better optimize preoperative patient selection, which might be especially valuable during one's early experience with MIPD.",

Results were presented at a weekly surgical conference at which time the type and grading of complications were confirmed or adjusted [15] . Whenever feasible, NSQIP definitions of postoperative complications were used. Complication severity was judged using the Modified Accordion Grading System (MAGS) [16] . MAGS is a validated severity grading system based primarily on the type and morbidity of interventions needed to treat a complication. It was derived from a severity grading system first published in 1992 by Clavien et al. [17] and modified in the course of validation and hence the term \"modified\" [16] . There are 6 grades of complications. The highest-grade complication in MAGS is death (grade 6). Patients without complications are graded as zero. \"Severe complications\" are those that are grade 3 or higher.",

Totally laparoscopic cases typically used 6 trocars (four 12 mm trocars and two 5 mm trocars) while robotic-assisted typically used 5 trocars (four robotic 8 mm trocars and one 12 mm assistant trocars). The decision to use robotic assistance largely depended on institutional robot availability. Initially, the Department had access to the robot 2 days per month, which limited the amount of robotic cases that could be scheduled. There were no specific selection criteria for patients to be considered eligible for MIPD. All patients underwent pancreaticojejunostomy in a 2-layered duct-to-mucosa fashion.

We sought to understand which patients (if any) benefit from MIPD in order to allow surgeons to better optimize preoperative patient selection.

In our experience, MIPD was associated with significantly fewer overall complications, lower readmission rate and higher likelihood of an Ideal Outcome compared to OPD in patients with dilated pancreatic ducts. We did not observe a significant difference in overall complication rate or readmissions in patients with non-dilated ducts; however, MIPD appears safe in this patient subset as well, with similar rates of complications and severe complications, and no significant difference in 90-day mortality. Pancreatic fistula is the \"Achilles Heel\" of pancreaticoduodenectomy. Fortunately, most patients do not experience pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy, and perhaps these are the patients that benefit most from the minimally invasive approach. Most studies have not found a difference in the rate of pancreatic fistula with MIPD compared to OPD [3-7. Although there is some recent literature to suggest a reduction in clinically relevant pancreatic fistula with robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy compared to OPD, it is unlikely that MIPD will \"solve\" the problem of pancreatic fistula [19] .

            "text": "There have been three randomized trials comparing MIPD to OPD. In a randomized study comparing 32 patients undergoing laparoscopic PD to 32 patients undergoing OPD, Palanivelu et al. demonstrated significantly reduced postoperative length of stay in patients undergoing laparoscopic PD as well as significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss, less perioperative blood transfusions, and increased operative time compared to OPD patients [5] . In a study by Poves et al. which randomized 32 patients to laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy and 29 patients to OPD, laparoscopic PD patients had significantly fewer severe complications as well as significantly fewer patients requiring prolonged postoperative length of stay compared to OPD, but also had significantly increased operative times [6] . In a multicenter randomized controlled trial from the Netherlands, van Hilst et al. found no significant differences in postoperative outcomes, but the trial was stopped prematurely due to a nonstatistically significant trend toward increased mortality in the laparoscopic group [7] . Meta-analyses of the these small randomized trials suggest that MIPD is associated with significantly increased operative times with significantly decreased intraoperative blood loss without an observed difference in other postoperative outcomes [20, 21] . None of these randomized trials excluded patients at high risk of pancreatic fistula, a complication which could perhaps limit the potential benefit of MIPD on recovery. Likewise, these randomized trials have not addressed the issue of duct size driving postoperative outcomes. Our rate of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula in MIPD patients was over 5 times higher in patients with non-dilated ducts compared to patients with dilated ducts. We suspect that this higher rate of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula could mitigate the benefit that MIPD offers in terms of 90-day readmission rate and overall rate of ideal outcome. Our findings in the overall patient cohort are similar to those reported in the literature with regards to increased operative times and decreased intraoperative blood loss [3] [4] [5] . Nassour et al. demonstrated that MIPD was associated with increased 30-day readmission using the NSQIP pancreatectomy database [22] . However, we observed a statistically significant reduction in 90-day readmission in the MIPD group of patients with dilated pancreatic ducts. The overall complication rate in our study was around 70%, which is somewhat higher than other published studies in the literature. However, the majority of these complications were MAGS non-severe. We have previously shown that the incidence of MAGS non-severe complications vary widely depending on the definition and method of complication gathering, which makes it challenging to compare the rates of lesser severe complications between studies at different institutions [15] . Most complications in the current study, such as the rates of pancreatic fistulas (17.8%), delayed gastric emptying (22.4%), and postoperative bleeding/anemia complications (32.1%), were similar to previously published results. Our study had several limitations. While our study was prospective, it was not randomized and is thus subject to selection bias. We report here our experience with our first 74 MIPD at our institution, and thus our sample size is relatively small. However, these results demonstrate that MIPD can be instituted safely with acceptable outcomes at a high-volume pancreatectomy center. A limitation in comparing intraoperative blood loss between MIPD and OPD may reside in the differences inherent to the measurement of intraoperative blood loss in patients during open versus minimally invasive/laparoscopic surgery. Propensity score matching attempts to equally distribute variables in matched patients, but it is possible that unmeasured variables could confound the analysis. Despite these limitations, our methodology using propensity score matching of prospectively gathered observational data is likely to be highly predictive of the results from independently performed randomized, controlled clinical trials [23] .",

In our early experience, patients with dilated pancreatic ducts (at low risk for pancreatic fistula) appear to derive the most benefit in terms of reduced complications, lower readmission rates and higher likelihood of ideal outcome. Due to its complexity and steep learning curve, these results may help guide preoperative patient selection and indications during the adoption of MIPD. Further prospective study is needed to confirm the validity and generalizability of these findings.",
