The following modeling methodology was developed as a platform to introduce a predictive tool supporting a therapeutic approach to Covid-19 disease. A time-dependent nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations model was constructed involving type-I cells, type-II cells, SARS-CoV-2 virus, inflammatory mediators, interleukins along with host pulmonary gas exchange rate, thermostat control, and mean pressure difference. This formalism introduced about 17 unknown parameters. Estimating these unknown parameters requires a mathematical association with the in vivo sparse data and the dynamic sensitivities of the model. The cybernetic model can simulate a dynamic response to the reduced pulmonary alveolar gas exchange rate, thermostat control, and mean pressure difference under a very critical condition based on equilibrium (steady state) values of the inflammatory mediators and system parameters. In silico analysis of the current cybernetical approach with system dynamical modeling can provide an intellectual framework to help experimentalists identify more active therapeutic approaches.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "At present, the biggest challenge to the world is the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spreading by developing an appropriate vaccine.

It can be suggested that implementing an anti-inflammatory or antiviral therapy may help in preventing further injury. 30 In general, the prognosis and recovery from Covid-19 in its critical stages are poor. Prompt recognition of Covid-19 and application of therapies such as anti-inflammatory and anti-viral modalities are likely to limit disease pathogenesis and improve clinical outcomes of Covid-19. The time period in which antiinflammatory treatments can be successfully administered to patients is currently unknown. However, prompt initiation of treatment is essential as an early response preventative measure for Covid-19 pathogenesis in patients. This model examines the relationship between time and the onset of physiological outcomes.
