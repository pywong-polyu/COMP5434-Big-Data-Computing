In recent years, on-site H 2 gas generators, which produce high-purity H 2 by water electrolysis, have begun to be introduced in hospitals, clinics, beauty salons, and fitness clubs because of their ease of use. In general, these generators produce H 2 at a low-flow rate, so physicians are concerned that an effective blood concentration of H 2 may not be ensured when the gas is delivered through a nasal cannula. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate blood concentrations of H 2 delivered from an H 2 gas generator via a nasal cannula.",

            "text": "Molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) has a wide range of benefits, ranging from improving health to preventing and treating disease. The health benefits include improving mood, reducing anxiety, and counteracting an overactive sympathetic nervous system [1] . In terms of disease prevention and treatment, H 2 has been used to treat many diseases, including lifestyle diseases [2] ; immune diseases, such as atopic dermatitis [2] , hay fever [3] , and chronic rheumatoid arthritis [4] ; respiratory diseases, such as asthma [5] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [6] , and pneumonia caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COV-ID-19) [7] ; neurological diseases, such as depression [8] , dementia [9] , stroke [10] , post-cardiac arrest syndrome [11, 12] , subarachnoid hemorrhage [13] , and traumatic injury from blast shock waves [14] ; myocardial infarction [15] [16] [17] ; chronic kidney disease [18] ; sepsis [19] and hemorrhagic shock [20, 21] ; and cancer [22] . H 2 exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. As a molecular mechanism, ex vivo experiments have been shown that H 2 reduces hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) and peroxynitrite [10] and suppresses the propagation of the radical reaction in lipid bilayers [23] . Clinical and animal studies have shown that H 2 therapy reduces circulating levels of oxidative stress markers and proinflammatory cytokines in shock from a wide range of etiologies [11, 24] . H 2 can be supplied from a high-pressure gas cylinder [11, 12, [15] [16] [17] , generated from a hydrogen-absorbing alloy [25, 26] or hydride, or produced by electrolysis of water [7] . In recent years, on-site H 2 gas generators, which generate highpurity H 2 by electrolysis of water, have begun to be introduced in hospitals, clinics, beauty salons, and fitness clubs because of their ease of handling.",

In this study, the researchers used an H 2 gas generator as the source of H 2 and administered a mixture of H 2 and oxygen (O 2 ) gas (66% H 2 ; 33% O 2 ), obtained by electrolysis of water, by a nasal cannula. An improvement in clinical symptoms was seen in a significantly higher percentage of patients in the treatment group, who inhaled a mixture of H 2 and Because the H 2 produced from an on-site H 2 gas generator has a low-flow rate, clinicians are concerned that when H 2 is inhaled through a nasal cannula, blood concentrations may be lower than expected because of leakage of H 2 from the nostrils. We hypothesized that the H 2 concentration could be better ensured if patients wore an oxygen mask over the nasal cannula. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis in pigs, whose organs are similar in size, anatomy, and physiology to those of humans.",

The generator represents a safe and convenient alternative to high-pressure gas cylinders for H 2 inhalation therapy and requires no replenishment of supplies. For example, installing an H 2 gas generator at the bedside of a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia with hypoxemia allows the patient to consistently inhale H 2 through a nasal cannula. In addition, a suitable mask (face mask, face mask with reservoir, or Venturi mask) can be worn over the nasal cannula, depending on the patient's level of oxygenation.

H 2 has been used in laboratories for a variety of applications, including gas chromatography and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. In addition, it is used in the chemical industry to synthesize ammonia, cyclohexane, and methanol, and in the food industry to hydrogenate oils to make them more solid. Recently, it has been gaining attention as a clean energy source. The best way to produce high-purity H 2 on demand is by electrolysis of water. A noteworthy innovation in this technology was water electrolysis with solid polymer electrolyte membranes proposed by General Electric in the early 1970s. Subsequent significant research and development led to a technology for efficiently and stably generating high-purity H 2 from pure water 24 h a day, 365 days a year. This method for generating H 2 , which has been cultivated by the industry for a long time, has found many uses in humans. The H 2 gas generator H2JI1 that we used in our experiments also uses a polymer electrolyte membrane with a durability of more than 50,000 h. The amount of H 2 that remains in this device is small, so safety is guaranteed. Also, the device is not subject to the High-Pressure Gas Safety Act. Although the hydrogen gas generator itself is expensive, the durability of the electrolytic cells is long and the running costs are almost zero. Therefore, the cost per hour is as low as less than $0.47.",
