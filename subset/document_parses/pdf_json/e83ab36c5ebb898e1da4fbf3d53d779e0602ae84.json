            "text": "Nowadays, due to the vast applications of fuzzy graph theory, many researchers are working on topological indices (TIs) on fuzzy graphs. In the year 1965, the concept of uncertainty in a classical set was firstly introduced by Zadeh [45] and called it fuzzy set. In 1975, inspired by this, Rosenfeld [37] introduced the fuzzyness for a graph and called the graph is the fuzzy graph (FG). Generalized the neutrosophic planer graph [23] and link prediction in the neutrosophic graph [24] are studied by Mahapatra et al. A telecommunication system based on fuzzy graphs [40] and a social network system based on fuzzy graphs [41] is studied by Samanta and Pal. Bipolar fuzzy graph [3] , fuzzy soft graph [4] , m-polar fuzzy graph [5] , generalized m-polar fuzzy graph [43] , bipolar fuzzy soft hypergraph [42] and measures of connectivity in rough fuzzy network [6] are studied by Akram et al. Rashmanlou et al. [38] studied the product of bipolar fuzzy graphs with their degree. In 2016, Rashmanlou and Borzooei studied vague graph in [39] . The degree of a vertex in a FG is also discussed in [33] and also discussed strong degree, strong neighbour of a FG. In [5, 32, 33] , one can see for more generalization of a FG and related results.",

These TIs are numerical quantities of a graph that describe its topology. Vertex represents an atom and an edge represents the bond between two atoms in a molecular graph. In 1947, the Wiener index (WI) was introduced by Wiener, which is used to calculate the boiling point of paraffins. Zagreb index (ZI) is degree-based TI established by Gutman and Trinajstic in 1972 [15] and used to calculate \u03c0 -electron energy of a conjugate system. In 2015, Fortula and Gutman defined another degree-based topological index called forgotten topological index (Findex) [14] . Amin and Nayeem studied the F-index and F-coindex of subdivision graph and line graph in [7] . In 2017, Abdo et al. [1] studied the extremal trees (crisp) with respect to F-index. Extremal unicyclic and bicyclic graphs (crisp) with respect to F-index is determined by Akhtar et al. De et al. [13] studied F-index for some crisp graph operations.",

            "text": "Topological indices have an important role in molecular chemistry, chemical graph theory, spectral graph theory, network theory, etc. Zagreb index (ZI) is one such TIs which is degree-based TI and established by Gutman and Trinajstic in 1972 [15] and these TIs are used to calculate \u03c0 -electron energy of a conjugate system. Followed by this topological index, in 2015, Fortula and Gutman defined another degree-based topological index called forgotten topological index (F-index) [14] and they proved that first ZI and F-index have the almost same entropy, predictive ability and acentric factor and F-index obtain correlation coefficients greater than 0.95. So this TI is very much useful in molecular chemistry, spectral graph theory, network theory, and several fields of mathematics and chemistry. Some neighbourhood degree-based topological indices are introduced and studied their correlations between the physico-chemical properties of some chemical compounds by Mondal et al. [26, 27] . In [29] they also studied neighbourhood Zagreb index of product graph and analyzed QSPR of some novel degree-based topological descriptors [30] . In [28, 31] , they also studied molecular descriptors of some chemicals that prevent COVID-19. But, those indices are defined in the crisp graph only. Recently, in 2021, Islam and Pal [18] introduced and studied F-index for fuzzy graphs. Also, they introduced so many interesting results on F-index for various fuzzy graphs like path, cycle, star, complete fuzzy graph, etc. Motivated by this article, we start research on further developing the F-index for fuzzy graphs. F-index is used not only for application but also for theoretical purposes. Abdo et al. determined the extremal n-vertex trees (Crisp) with respect to the F-index and Akhtar et al. [2] determined the extremal n-vertex unicyclic and bicyclic graphs with respect to the F-index. Still, those results for the fuzzy graph have been unsolved till now. In this article, We established that n-vertex star has maximal F-index among the class of n-vertex trees (fuzzy) and determined the n-vertex unicyclic fuzzy graph with cycle length r having maximal F-index, which are partially generalization of the article [1] and [2] , respectively. De et al. [13] studied F-index of some graph (crisp) operations. Motivated by this article, we also studied this index of some fuzzy graph operations (Cartesian product, composition, join and union of fuzzy graphs).",

To overcome this, many topological indices have been presented in theoretical chemistry. But sometimes it is seen that most real-life problems cannot be modelled using crisp graphs. Those topological indices are needed to define in a fuzzy graph for these circumstances. In 2021, Islam and Pal [18] introduced and studied F-index for fuzzy graphs. In this paper, some bounds on F-index are provided for several fuzzy graph operations such as Cartesian product, composition, union and join of two fuzzy graphs. Some interesting relations of the F-index are established during fuzzy graph transformations. Using those transformations, it is shown that n-vertex star has maximal F-index among the class of n-vertex trees (fuzzy) and determined the n-vertex unicyclic fuzzy graph with cycle length r having maximal F-index, which are partially generalization of the article [1] and [2] , respectively. At the end of this article, railway crime in India is studied, and F-index is used to analyze the crimes rate in the railway in India and compared with three other topological indices. Also, F-index for fuzzy graphs and the first Zagreb index for fuzzy graphs provide similar results and F-index for fuzzy graphs provides better realistic results than F-index for crisp graphs and first Zagreb index for crisp graphs to detect the crime in Indian railway.",

The national rail network comprised 126,366 km of track over a route of 67,368 km and 7,325 stations. It is the fourth-largest national railway network in the world after United States, Russia and China. But with the passage they are posing as a threat for the general public at large while traveling, being the instances of crimes rising fourfold in rails. The ongoing railway crime has become a cause of concern for the common passenger now. So the objective of this section is to find out the railway where the most crime occurs. Now, we consider the railways network graph in Fig. 11 , where an state is considered as a vertex and if there is rail communication between the neighboring states then an edge is consider between the states. The railways crime share percentage and population share percentage in the year 2019 (last updated data) of each state are listed in the table 3 and railway distance between the main station of the neighboring states are listed in Table 4 . Now the vertex membership value of a state S is denoted by \u03c3 (S) and is calculated by the formula:",

Note that, the topological indices defined only for the crisp graph, does not depend on the nature of the vertex or nature of its neighbour vertices, i.e. those topological indices do not depend on the number of crimes in any state and its neighbour. Hence, the topological indices for crisp graphs cannot predict the actual crime for any railways. Therefore, fuzziness is required to predict such consideration. Here, F-index for fuzzy graphs depends not only on the number of crimes of each state but also on the total number of crimes of neighbour states for each state. So this index always provides realistic results compared to the other existing indices. The score of each edge for those indices is shown in Table 8 . From Table 8 , each index provides the edge \"MP-Mah\" has the highest score, which implies the railway crime is highest on that railway track in India. But the first two indices, defined for crisp graphs, also provide the highest score value for the edges: AP-Kar, Bih-Chh, Bih-WB, Chh-MP, Chh-Mah, Kar-Mah. If the decision-maker used the indices for a crisp graph, they could not distinguish among those edges. But, the other two indices, which are defined for fuzzy graphs, provide different scores for different edges. Hence, from this point of view, the topological indices defined in crisp graphs also need to be introduced in fuzzy graphs. We also fit linear and parabolic curves between the score values obtained by the first Zagreb index for fuzzy graphs and F-index for the fuzzy graphs (See Fig. 13 ). Here X \u2212axis represents the value of the score obtained using the first Zagreb index for fuzzy graphs, and Y \u2212axis represents the value of the score obtained using the F-index for fuzzy graphs. The relation between those scores are shown below:",
