Additionally, mutations at 12,053bp are within the ORF1ab gene, in a region encoding for the protein nsp7, which is necessary to form the RNA polymerase complex responsible for viral replication and transcription.",

To identify potential links between viral mutations and mortality, we utilized the GISAID database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017) , which currently contains data on 3,626 COVID-19 patients from 68 countries, for whom full metadata is available, i.e. age, sex, location and patient status, and whose viral genomes have been sequenced (see Table 1 ) and probed each locus of the single stranded RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for direct association with host/patient mortality. The variable patient status indicates if the patient was alive or deceased at the time the virus sample was submitted to GISAID; we use it as a surrogate for mortality in our analysis. For the analysis, we repurposed the methodology of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Manolio, 2010) . This approach is widely used in human genetics and can test thousands of genetic loci for association in datasets such as GISAID.",

We utilized the Jaccard similarity matrix because its computation does not require estimates of the mutation frequency for each locus in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, in contrast to other similarity matrices such as the variance/covariance matrix (Prokopenko et al., 2016) . We found that the virus genomes clustered in distinctive branches that correspond to the geographic regions from where their data was submitted to GISAID (Forster et al., 2020) (Figure 1 ). The geographical clustering of the viral genomes can cause bias in the association analysis if unaccounted for. Hence, we generated additional eigenvector plots to investigate the number of eigenvectors needed to eliminate bias caused by such clustering. Based on visual inspection of these plots, we selected the first 5 eigenvectors of the Jaccard matrix as covariates for the following logistic regression analyses.",

Our data set was restricted to genomes that were matched based proximity in the eigenvector plots (see Methods for details). 3. As further examination of the deceased indictor variable revealed that all \"deceased\" carrier genomes came from Brazil, our analysis was restricted to genomes that were submitted from Brazil. In all three secondary analyses, both loci remained significant (Table 2) . For both loci, 3 the effect size estimates of the mutations showed risk increases for mortality of 5-fold and higher (Table 2) . Furthermore, as the association signals for both loci stem from the Brazilian Covid-19 patients, we also obtained Fisher-exact tests for the data from Brazil overall and from Sao Paulo alone (Table 3) . Sao Paulo is the only Brazilian center/city for that sufficient numbers were available to compute the Fisher-exact test. For both loci and for both subgroup analyses, the Fisher-exact test detected significant associations between the presence of a mutation and the deceased indicator variable. In sum all results of the secondary analyses (Tables 1-4) support the genome-wide significant association between the mutation 25,088bp and mortality. The locus at 12,053bp did not achieve formally genome-wide significance in the three secondary analyses, but nonetheless remains a viable candidate locus. The large effect estimates for both mutations in all analyses (Table 2) , are substantial in support of the associations. Since the criteria for selection into the study likely varies by country, and may be related to the deceased indicator, the odds ratio estimate from the Brazil sample alone may be most interpretable. Among the samples from Brazil, 19.1% of the patients whose viral genome did not carry any mutation at either loci were deceased at enrollment, 83.7% of the patients whose viral genomes carried the mutation at 25,088bp, and 84.2% of the patients whose viral genomes carried both mutations. We did not observe any viral genomes that carried the mutation at 12,053bp, but not 25,088bp.",

The mutation at 25,088 is in the S2 subunit, and specifically occurs within the S2' site, which is cleaved by host proteases to activate membrane fusion (Figure 3a ) In many 4 viruses, membrane fusion is activated by proteolytic cleavage, an event which has been closely linked to infectivity-for instance, a multibasic cleavage site is a signature of highly pathogenic viruses including avian influenza (Walls et al., 2020) . In coronaviruses, membrane fusion is known to depend on proteolytic cleavage at multiple sites, including the S1/S2 site, located at the interface between the S1 and S2 domains, and the S2' site located within the S2 domain. These cleavage events can impact infection-in fact, a distinct furin cleavage site present in the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site is not found in SARS-CoV (Vankadari, 2020) , and it is thought to increase infectivity through enhanced membrane fusion activity (Walls et al., 2020; Vankadari, 2020; Xia et al., 2020) . Consequently, mutations at these sites can alter virulence-for instance, a recent study reported that mutations disrupting the multibasic nature of the S1/S2 site affect SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion and entry into human lung cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Several studies have also found that SARS-CoV mutants with an added furin recognition site at S2' had increased membrane fusion activity (Belouzard et al., 2009; Watanabe et al., 2008) . While enhanced infectivity does not always cause higher fatality rate, more infectious viruses can lead to a higher viral load, which can impact symptom severity and mortality (Pujadas et al., 2020) .",

While valine, leucine, and isoleucine are branched-chain amino acids with similar biochemical and structural properties, phenylalanine has a bulkier aromatic structure. Such a substitution may impose local structural constraints, stabilize particular secondary structures (Makwana and Mahalakshmi, 2015) , or introduce specific interactions which lead to preferential binding. Therefore, a mutation in the S2' domain which promotes proteolytic cleavage could theoretically enhance viral infectivity ( Figure 3b ) and consequently, patient mortality.

The QQ-plot shows the expected pvalue distribution plotted against the observed p-values obtained from the logistic regression analysis. The p-value distribution we observe for the GISAID dataset follows the reference line, confirming that the analysis is conservative. The grey horizontal line depicts the threshold for genome-wide significance at the corrected Bonferroni threshold 0.05/28,492=1.75e-6. We observe that only 2 p-values exceed the threshold for genome-wide significance, precise the loci at 12,053bp and 25,088bp. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is colored by region (blue-S1, green-S2, magenta-S2'). The S2' site is cleaved by host proteases, facilitating membrane fusion and viral entry into host cells.
