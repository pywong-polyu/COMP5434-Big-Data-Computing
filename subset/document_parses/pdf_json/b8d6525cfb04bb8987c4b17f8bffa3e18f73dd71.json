Here, we report a hybrid strategy to create such a predictor, combining the development of a baseline severe respiratory infection risk predictor and a post-processing method to calibrate the predictions to reported COVID-19 case-fatality rates. With the accumulation of a COVID-19 patient cohort, this predictor is validated to have good discrimination (area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.943) and calibration (markedly improved compared to that of the baseline predictor). At a 5% risk threshold, 15% of patients are marked as high-risk, achieving a sensitivity of 88%. We thus demonstrate that even at the onset of a pandemic, shrouded in epidemiologic fog of war, it is possible to provide a useful risk predictor, now widely used in a large healthcare organization.",

It entered wide use in CHS around mid-March 2020, just before the first case of COVID-19 fatality in Israel. Since then, with the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in Israel, some with severe outcomes, it became possible to validate its performance. We showed that on a validation set of 4179 COVID-19 patients (3.4% death rate), the model was highly discriminative, with an AUROC of 0.943. We also showed that the postprocessing multicalibration phase resulted in a large improvement to the calibration of the baseline model when evaluated on COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4a) .

This is a problem especially when health resources are at a premium, for example when making personal phone calls by the medical staff. Second, defining a risk group by a list of risk factors (in the form of A or B or C etc.) usually results in many patients placed at the high-risk group, which is wasteful in its attempt to identify those who are truly at risk. This was noted in our COVID-19 patients' population, where the CDC criteria define 40% of the patients to be at high risk. While this group does include 98% of the death cases (sensitivity), a cutoff of 5% absolute risk by our more granular model allows defining only 15% of the COVID-19 patient population as high risk, while still attaining a sensitivity of 88%.",

In this case, however, the algorithm was used to make sure that the baseline model is calibrated for the reported CFRs of different age and sex groups. It should be noted that on top of the sex and age groups, we initially intended to calibrate the predictions to reported CFRs of populations with specific comorbidities, as any calibration target can be fed to the multicalibration algorithm in order to further refine the predictions' accuracy. This was eventually not done because of issues that were raised about the quality of the published comorbidity data in the Chinese report. As we could find We consider this approach to provide an efficient combination of individual-level data and epidemiologic reports. The resulting model can easily be further recalibrated whenever new data regarding different subpopulation CFRs become available, whether conditioned on a single characteristic (e.g., CFR in obese patients) or more (e.g., CFR in 50-70-year-old smokers).",

It should be emphasized that due to the urgent circumstances, many of these models were published as preprints, and have not yet been subjected to peer review. These studies were performed in an inpatient setting, with sample sizes ranging from dozens to several hundreds and a relatively high rate of severe outcomes (some with mortality rates of over 50%).

It was conducted and reported according to the standard guidelines for prediction model reporting 11 . The baseline model was developed on a random and large sample of the CHS population, and validated on a separate test set, thus limiting the possibility of overfitting. In addition, the performance of the COVID-19 adjusted model was evaluated on all COVID-19 confirmed CHS cases that were diagnosed at least 3 months prior to the analysis. Given that Israel has a relatively high testing rate 21 , and given that all tests and patients' status reports are collected centrally (whether they are treated in the community or in the hospital), the possibility for selection or sampling bias is markedly reduced. This work also has several limitations. First, the method described depends on being able to construct a discriminative model for a related outcome, for which the resulting ranking is relevant to the outcome of interest. This is usually not known accurately in advance, particularly for emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Second, the method requires subpopulation-specific CFRs that are relevant to the study population. These will usually be found in foreign populations and will need to be corrected to the local population. The correction method used in this study, using a linear probability model, is coarse, and could result in significant bias if the populations are sufficiently different. Third, patients that were diagnosed later in the follow-up period had a shorter follow-up time (with a minimum of 3 months). While this could potentially result in under-estimation of the outcome risk, a sensitivity analysis shows that this follow-up is sufficiently long to identify nearly all deaths.",

As the overall COVID-19 epidemiology and risk factors witnessed in Israel were very similar to those described in other countries, it is likely that the predictions will provide good discrimination in other settings as well. Despite this, as in any application of an external prediction model, external validation should be performed prior to using the model in a different setting. In this scenario, it is important that the distribution of predictors is as similar as possible to the training population, so for variables that can be missing (e.g., laboratory results), in which the missingness is used in the model as an important input by itself, data should not be completed or imputed.",

This can be particularly useful, for example, in the early stages of dealing with an emerging or reemerging disease (infectious or otherwise), or when individual-level data does not exist for technical reasons.

Going from top to bottom, features are ordered by their overall importance in creating the final prediction (sum of SHAP values). In each feature (line), every point is a specific case (individual), with colors ranging from red (high values of the predictor) to blue (low values of the predictor). Gray points signal missing values. The point's location on the X-axis represents the SHAP value-the effect the variable had on the prediction in this specific individual, with points further to the right marking that for that individual this covariate contributed to increasing of the risk and points to the left indicate that the covariate contributed to decreasing the risk. The vertical line in the middle represents no change in risk. b A plot of the odds ratio for different values of age. A smoothed red line is fit to the curve and a horizontal gray line is drawn at odds ratio = 1. c A plot of the odds ratio for different values of percent of lymphocytes in the blood.
