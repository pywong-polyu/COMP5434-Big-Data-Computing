            "text": "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients usually require long periods of mechanical ventilation and sedation, which added to steroid therapy, favours a predisposition to the development of delirium and subsequent mental health disorders, as well as physical and respiratory sequelae. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) at 3 months after hospital discharge, in a cohort of mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). An ambispective, observational study was conducted in three hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up clinics. We studied adults who survived a critical illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. A physical (muscle strength and pulmonary function), functional [12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Barthel score], psychological [hospital anxiety and depression (HADS) and posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity scales], and cognitive [Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test] assessment were performed. A total of 186 patients were evaluated at 88 days (IQR 68-121) after hospital discharge. Mean age was 59 \u00b1 12 years old, 126 (68%) patients were men, and median length of mechanical ventilation was 14 days (IQR 8-31). About 3 out of 4 patients (n = 139, 75%) met PICS criteria. Symptoms of cognitive and psychiatric disorders were found in 59 (32%) and 58 (31%) patients, respectively. Ninety-one (49%) patients had muscle weakness. Pulmonary function tests in patients with no respiratory comorbidities showed a normal pattern in 93 (50%) patients, and a restrictive disorder in 62 (33%) patients. Also, 69 patients (37%) were on sick leave, while 32 (17%) had resumed work at the time of assessment. In conclusion, survivors of critical illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring mechanical ventilation have a high prevalence of PICS. Physical domain is the most frequently damaged, followed by cognitive and psychiatric disorders. ICU follow-up clinics enable the assistance of this vulnerable population.",

A symptom is considered when it is scored with at least 2 points. In order to consider PTSD, the presence of one www.nature.com/scientificreports/ symptom is required in section A (re-experiencing), three symptoms in section B (avoidance), and two symptoms in section C (increased activation).

In the COVID-19 era, a large number of patients required PMV and deep sedation (with the coexistence of two or more hypnotics) and relaxation to facilitate MV in the prone position. There have been substantial concerns about respiratory sequelae due to COVID-19. At 3 months after hospital discharge, we observed that pulmonary function was normal in over 50% of patients in our study. Also, 43% did not manifest dyspnea, and in those who did, the mean modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale 34 was 1.7 \u00b1 0.9 which corresponds to a low symptom intensity (mainly breathlessness only on strenuous exercise). Other authors 35 have published similar spirometry results. Morin et al. 7 included functional and morphological assessment, reporting that severe pulmonary sequelae were infrequent, although all had experienced a severe or very severe form of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. In contrast, both, prevalence of restrictive spirometry results in our patients, was slightly higher compared to COVID-19 pneumonia patients who did not require ICU admission 36 . Mean SF-12 physical and mental summary scores in our cohort was lower when compared to previous reports at three months of follow-up 20 . These findings can be explained by a longer ICU stay and PMV.

Second, participating ICUs followed the same protocol, reducing heterogeneity among centres. Third, this is the largest study involving mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Fourth, all patients in our study were assessed in a face-to-face consultation room with an intensivist and the support of a \"post-ICU-team\" (physiatrists, psychiatrists, psychologists and physiotherapists). No patient was assessed by phone or any other telematics mean. However, we acknowledge some limitations of our study. First, our study is an uncontrolled study design and, therefore, comparison with non-COVID-19 patients could not be established. Second, since our design is ambispective, some variables were retrospectively recorded. Third, 49% of studied patients were survivors of the first wave, the most devastating and challenging wave in which patient individualization and PICS prevention was inapplicable, along with changes in treatment protocol and patient upmake over time. Fourth; although according to our methodology patients with psychiatric www.nature.com/scientificreports/ impairment, severe cognitive impairment and patients with severe neuromuscular or neurological diseases were excluded from the PICS evaluation, baseline like HADS scale, MOCA test or muscle strength are unknown. Many of complaints related to these domains are often underdiagnosed. All of this probably may have overestimated its incidence in this patient population. Fifth, although our study is the largest cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, sample size is still limited to draw definitive conclusions. Participation of more centres would have been desirable to enlarge sample size. However, the number of centres with ICU follow-up clinics is still limited and some of them were forced to close due to the pandemic. Sixth, pulmonary function was assessed using forced spirometry. This test has obvious limitations, especially if it is not accompanied by other diagnostic procedures. Seventh, the possibility of performing lung morphological analysis at 3 months exceeded the objectives of the present study, which focused mainly on evaluating classically described PICS in a population of critical COVID-19 patients.",
