As of August 2020, the International Council of Nurses reported 572,478 HCWs from 32 countries were infected with SARS-CoV-2, comprising approximately 10% of confirmed infections. 4 Similarly, WHO found that in Europe and the Americas, 14% of reported COVID-19 cases were among HCWs, despite comprising just under 3% of the population of lower-and middle-income countries and 8% in higher-income countries. 5 Extrapolating from these data, the International Council of Nurses estimated at least two million HCW infections worldwide. In February 2021, WHO estimated that at least 30,000 HCW had died from COVID- 19. 6 Although COVID-19 has drawn global attention to the issue of HCW infections, multiple epidemics over the past 2 decades also put HCWs at risk (Table 1 ). In addition to becoming ill themselves, HCWs played a significant role in transmitting the virus in hospitals: 55% of likely SARS cases in Taiwan and 72% in Toronto were linked to hospital infection. 21 ",

During the 2014-2016 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic in Sierra Leone, 7% of the health care workforce died, leading to a 23% reduction in health services. 15 One study estimated that an additional 4022 women would die each year during childbirth as a result of HCW deaths. 3 The International Monetary Fund estimated that US$11 trillion was spent as of June 2020 for COVID-19 response, including new spending, lost revenues and loans to boost economies. 22 McKinsey & Company estimated that preparations to prevent and fight future pandemics would cost US$70-120 billion to establish over two years and US$20-40 billion a year to maintain thereafter-not including costs of implementing infection prevention and control (IPC) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs. 23 As of December 2020, WHO reported that 1 in 4 health care facilities worldwide had no water services and, in the world's 47 least-developed countries, 1 in 2 health care facilities had no basic drinking water, 24 despite costing roughly US$1 per capita to establish basic water services in all health facilities. Both IPC and WASH are essential for day-to-day care, for preventing transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and for preventing outbreaks small and large. 25 Taken together, rigorous implementation of IPC and WASH prevents transmission of infections in health care settings, increases patient safety, and keeps HCWs from becoming patients themselves. Progress must be closely tracked to ensure that policy implementation moves from national to local facility levels.",

Administrative controls include universal screening and triage of all patients and standardized training of HCWs; environmental controls reduce the risk of exposure and include use of outdoor screening and triage areas to improve ventilation, as well as adequate distance between HCWs and patients; while PPE provides additional protections and is most effective in conjunction with other components of the hierarchy.",
