It is important to underline that: (i) for the whole population, this statistically significant difference is largely under the MCID of 30 min [1] ; (ii) this difference is not exclusively related to the COVID-19 pandemic but also the consequence of circumstantial events like the 2019 heat wave in Europe. PAP adherence is known to worsen during the summer [12] and we can reasonably speculate that heat waves do not create favorable conditions for PAP adherence. In our opinion, the increase in 2020 versus 2019 PAP adherence for weeks 26 to 30 seems to be more the consequence of the 2019 heat wave rather than the consequence of the COVID 2019 pandemic. Other circumstantial events, such as New Year celebrations, also impact PAP adherence on a whole population basis. In our study population, the last 7 days of either year are associated with a fall in both PAP adherence and the percentage of adherent patients was lower in 2020 (not only because of a curfew but also because of a French state policy not to celebrate the New Year).",

It can be assumed that the impact of COVID-19 on SApatient sleep is also influenced by the country they live in, not because of the health care system characteristics for SA-patient management but rather because of cultural and sociological parameters. In our results, people still in professional activity (age < 62) could have had less social jetlag and thus improved their sleep duration and PAP adherence [13] . As an example using crowdsourced smartphone data for non SA-populations, recent publications have described an average increase in sleep duration of 4.9 to 20 min (18.3 min for France) during the initial lockdown weekdays [13] [14] [15] . During the first lockdown, in an Italian population, a gender-dependent effect of COVID 19 pandemic on sleep quality was reported [16] . In this study, additional lockdown-related stress such as taking care of children and other family duties were hypothesized to explain women's probability of developing sleep problems.",
