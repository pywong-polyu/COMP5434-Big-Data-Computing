Recent studies support the concept that the gut microbiota is involved in the development of hypertension and that dietary fibre intake may act through the gut microbiota to lower blood pressure (BP). Resistant starch is a type of prebiotic fibre which is metabolised by commensal bacteria in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Previous work in pre-clinical models provides strong evidence that both prebiotic fibre as well as SCFAs (i.e. postbiotics) can prevent the development of hypertension. The aim of this clinical trial is to determine if acetylated and butyrylated modified resistant starch can decrease BP of hypertensive individuals via the modulation of the gut microbiota and release of high levels of SCFAs.",

Early ex vivo studies showed that acetate and butyrate mediate concentrationdependent dilatation of ventral tail artery in rats and human colonic resistance arteries [15, 16] . These are consistent with findings by us and others supporting that a diet high in resistant starches [8] or direct supplementation with acetate [8] , propionate [17] , and butyrate [18] prevent the development of high BP and its cardio-renal complications in pre-clinical models. In pre-clinical models, lack of resistant starches lead to the development of a hypertensinogenic gut microbiota in germ-free mice [19] . Combined, these studies suggest that the use of prebiotic resistant starches and postbiotics (i.e. SCFAs) may lower BP, but translational evidence in humans are lacking. Here, we describe our ongoing world-firstproof-of-concept phase IIa clinical trial, the Microbial Interventions to Control and Reduce Blood Pressure in Australia (MICRoBIA), where we are assessing the use of an acetylated and butyrylated high amylose maize starch (HAMSAB) as a treatment for hypertension.",

One participant had to be excluded after completion of the trial due to antibiotic intake needed whilst in the second arm of the study, resulting in 16 participants that have completed the trial.

Participants are randomly stratified based on age, sex and BMI using REDCap (Version 9.1.0 Tennessee) to either a diet containing 40 g HAMSAB or placebo maize-starch daily by the study coordinator. REDCap is also used to manage all the information by the study coordinator. The choice of use of a placebo food instead of BP-lowering drug intervention addresses the issue that participants who volunteered to our study did not want to take medication in the first place. Both the study participants and study coordinator are blinded to the diet containing the prebiotic supplement (thus, they are referred to Diet A and Diet B in the Figures). The study period is 9 weeks: 3 weeks actively on either diet, with a 3-week washout period in between. The purpose of the washout period is to allow the gut microbiota and levels of acetate and butyrate to return to baseline. These will be confirmed in samples collected in the third visit compared to the first visit. The washout period was determined based on previous gut microbiota studies with a similar design [21] , based on the fact that the gut microbiota can change rapidly (< 7 days) [22] . Since this is a cross-over study, data will be compared between visits one and two, and visits three and four, minimising the effect if we find that the effect of HAMS AB lasted longer than 3 weeks in those randomised into the intervention arm first. Participants are provided 2 meals daily and are instructed to eat their usual foods around the trial's food. The dietary intake of the participants is not restricted, and the foods provided to them are suggested to in place of normal foods (i.e. replacing a usual breakfast of toast with a 'breakfast muffin'). To increase compliance, we have opted to not replace every meal. A sample 7-day meal plan that is cycled during the 3-week diet phase is shown in Table 1 . Participants are provided with a list of foods containing natural resistant starches and SCFAs to avoid during the study period (e.g. green banana flour, waxy maize starch, kombucha, vinegars). Participants are provided with a food diary for the duration of the study, where they document approximate intake in quartiles (i.e. 0, \u00bc, \u00bd, \u00be, all). This data is then translated for nutritional analysis using FoodWorks Professional Software (Version 7.01, Xyris, Queensland).",
