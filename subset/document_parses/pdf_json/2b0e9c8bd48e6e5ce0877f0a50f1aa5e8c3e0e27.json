Crystal structures have revealed that the phenylmethyl group of GRL0617 points toward the active site but is located >7 \u00c5 from Sg of Cys111 (Fig. 1b) . We reasoned that replacing the methyl substituent of GRL0617 with a hydrolytically stable linker connected to an electrophilic group capable of reacting with Cys111 would yield a potent covalent inhibitor of PLpro. We chose an N,N'-diacetylhydrazine linker as a linear Gly-Gly peptidomimetic that could reach through the narrow S2 and S1 groove to the active site while also preserving some of the hydrogen-bonding interactions (e.g., with Gly163 and Gly271) afforded by natural peptide substrates. To the resulting hydrazide linker we appended a series of electrophiles including a fumarate methyl ester, 17 chloroacetamide, 18 propiolamide, cyanoacetamide, and \u03b1-cyanoacrylamide.",

We also docked each molecule noncovalently to assess the favorability of pre-covalent binding. We used an ensemble of 50 structural models derived from X-ray crystallographic data to account for protein exibility 12 and included selected crystallographic waters during docking, including those that are known to remain stably bound in the S4 subsite in the presence of noncovalent inhibitors. 12, 13 Key interactions between PLpro and GRL0617 include (i) a hydrogen bond between the backbone N-H of Gln269 and the amide carbonyl of the inhibitor, (ii) a hydrogen bond between the N-H of the GRL0617 amide and the carboxylate side chain of Asp164, and (iii) an edge-to-face interaction of the naphthyl group of GRL0617 and Tyr268 (Fig. 1b) . All candidate inhibitors contain the naphthylmethylamine core of GRL0617 (Fig. 2) and we aimed for our modi ed compounds to recapitulate its binding mode. To assess pose similarity, we measured the maximum common substructure RMSD (MCS-RMSD) between the docked poses of the candidate inhibitors and the crystallographic pose of GRL0617. In general, the core of the inhibitor designs reproduced the binding mode of GRL0617 to within 2 \u00c5 RMSD, maintaining interactions with Asp164, Tyr268, and Gln269 while the linker simultaneously occupied the S2 and S1 subsites to place the electrophilic group near the catalytic Cys111 nucleophile (Fig. 1e , f and Extended Data Fig. S2 ). Compounds were prioritized for synthesis based on low MCS-RMSD values (\u2264 2 \u00c5), favorable noncovalent and covalent docking scores (Extended Data Fig. S3 and Extended Data File 1), and synthetic tractability.",

IC 50 values were determined following a 30-minute incubation of PLpro with inhibitor (Extended Data Fig. S5 ). Of the noncovalent analogs of GRL0617, we found that both 14 and 15 had somewhat increased IC 50 values, with the N-acetylated compound 15 having an IC 50 more like that of GRL0617. We found that extension of the methyl group with a substantially larger peptidomimetic group could maintain potency. For example, addition of the linker alone without an electrophile to form 5 led to an IC 50 of 24 mM ( Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. S5 ). The introduction of ve different electrophilic warheads to produce compounds 7, 9, and 11-13 resulted in improved IC 50 values for all except \u03b1cyanoacrylamide 13. Time-dependent inhibition assays were performed as time-dependence is consistent with multiple mechanisms of slow-binding inhibition, including covalent inhibition via bond formation between Cys111 and the electrophile. Installation of a chloroacetamide electrophile to form 9 improved the IC 50 compared to 5 to 5.4 mM after 30-minute incubation and resulted in a k inact /K I of 100 M -1 s -1 , where k inact /K I is a second-order rate constant describing the e ciency of the overall conversion of free enzyme to the covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex (Extended Data Fig. S6 ). 21 Similarly, the IC 50 and k inact /K I for N-acetylated analog 10 are 4.4 mM and 120 M -1 s -1 , respectively.",

We determined a crystal structure of wild-type PLpro in complex with fumarate methyl ester 7, the most promising lead, at 3.10 \u00c5 resolution (Extended Data Table S2 ). The electron density maps show clear densities for PLpro, Zn cations, and 7, con rming the design concept of this compound and revealing key interactions with PLpro ( Fig. 4) . A covalent bond is present between Sg of Cys111 and C1 of compound 7 (Fig. 4a) . The carbonyl oxygen from the fumarate ester accepts hydrogen bonds from the indole side chain of Trp106, like that of the tetrapeptide-based covalent inhibitor VIR251, 9 as well as the side chain of Asn109. The N, N'diacetylhydrazine moiety was designed to link the electrophile and the naphthylmethylamine core while also hydrogen bonding with residues in the S1-S2 groove. Indeed, the crystal structure revealed that the proximal and distal carbonyl oxygens of the N, N'-diacetylhydrazine linker interact with the backbone N-H groups of Gly163 and Gly271, and the proximal and distal N-H groups of this moiety participate in hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl backbones of Gly271 and Gly163. As intended, the carbonyl oxygen and N-H group of the amide adjacent to the naphthyl group of 7 are hydrogen bonded with the N-H backbone of Gln269 and the carboxylate side chain of Asp164. Compound 7 makes ve main-chain and three side-chain hydrogen bonding interactions in the binding site. In addition, the side chains of Tyr268 and Gln269 interact with 7 similarly to GRL0617. Electron density for the methyl group of the ester of 7 was not visible. It is possible that the ester linkage is exible and adopts multiple conformations or that it could have been hydrolyzed. Encouragingly, the covalently docked pose for 7 agrees closely with the cocrystal structure (Fig. 4b) .",

Non-covalent inhibitor 14 exhibited a half-life >60 min in the S9 fraction, and 41 min in microsomes. Conversion to its covalent counterpart 7 maintained the half-life (60 min in S9, 50 min in microsomes). Analysis of 14 and 7 with MetaSite 6.0.1 27 suggested that successive oxidations of the tolyl methyl of 14 were the predominant metabolic liability, followed by the benzylic methylene (Extended Data Figure S10 ). Given that the linker and electrophile replaced the labile methyl group, it is unsurprising that the benzylic methylene is predicted to be the primary site of metabolism for 7. To address the benzylic liability several modi cations could be pursued, including substitution of the benzylic position with heavy atoms such as deuterium 29 or uorine 30 to increase steric hindrance, 28 or blocking the site of metabolism via replacement of the tolyl methyl with cyclopropane. 31",

Wild-type PLpro from SARS-CoV-2 was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells transformed with the pMCSG53 expression plasmid with a T7 promoter and a TEV-cleavable, N-terminal 6xHis-tagged PLpro. E. coli cells were grown in LB media containing 50 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator (200 rpm) until the optical density (OD 600 ) of the culture was 0.6.
