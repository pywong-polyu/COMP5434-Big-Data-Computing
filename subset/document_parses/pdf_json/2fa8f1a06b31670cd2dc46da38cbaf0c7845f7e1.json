The overall seroprevalence detected using the rapid tests was 15.3% for Leishmania spp., whereas 2.3% of the examined dogs were found to be positive for Anaplasma spp. and 7.5% for Ehrlichia spp. while B. burgdorferi was not detected. Twenty-four samples positive to A. phagocytophilum by ELISA were analysed by PCR for the presence of Anaplasma DNA.

These diseases are characterized by a complex pathogenesis with a potentially fatal clinical course for the majority of cases with new pathogenic findings being uncovered every year [5] . In addition, several have a zoonotic potential with possible transmission to the human population [6] [7] [8] . It is important to recognize that the transmitted pathogens may also frequently originate subclinical infections that nevertheless render the host as a carrier and even a reservoir [9] .",

However, islands in the Ionian Sea could represent a more favourable environment for both sand flies and Leishmania due to the different climatic conditions. Regardless of both areas covering a similar latitudinal range and having a typical Mediterranean climate, precipitation levels are higher on the Ionian islands (with mean precipitation of approximately 1000 mm annually) compared to the Aegean islands (with mean precipitation of approximately 600 mm annually), according to World Clim-Global climate data [22] . As previously documented by Ntais et al. [11] animals living in areas with higher annual rainfall, and low and medium values of mean wind speed had a higher risk of exposure to Leishmania. The high wind speed, influencing sand fly activity, could also be a reason for the lower seroprevalence found in Leros [23] .",

Therefore, a lower number of seropositive dogs were detected when positive rapid test results were confirmed with the quantitative ELISA, resulting in 50% lower infection rates in Paxoi.

Even within the island of Crete there was an obvious tendency of a higher prevalence to the East (Heraklion showed highest prevalence for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma). Moreover, Ehrlichia seropositive dogs were not identified on the Ionian Sea islands. In the present study, the overall seroprevalence recorded was lower than that found in studies recently conducted in the whole of Greece (a prevalence of approximately 12.5%) with similar sample size and methods applied [14, 15] . In these studies, however, the majority, if not all, of samples originated from mainland Greece. In another recent study with a remarkable number of dogs (n = 200), a similar to the present data from Aegean islands Ehrlichia spp. seropositivity was found (9.5%) [16] . The above data further support the observation in this study that the exposure of dogs to Ehrlichia spp. varies significantly within the country, a fact which could be attributed to microhabitat conditions favouring (or not) both the vector and the pathogen. It is quite interesting to note that a recent study testing ixodid ticks (i.e. Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato), R. turanicus, Haemaphysalis parva, and H. concinna) from mainland Greece for the presence of VBP could not confirm the presence of Ehrlichia DNA [13] .",

This high positivity for A. phagocytophilum, especially in Crete, was surprising insofar as the predominant tick species in Greece is R. sanguineus (s.l.), which is the vector for A. platys [28] . While A. phagocytophilum has been previously reported from Rhipicephalus bursa ticks in Greece [29] , as well as from Rhipicephalus spp. ticks from other areas, indicating that there is a potential also for these ticks to play a role in the transmission of A. phagocytophilum [30] . The primary tick vector for A. phagocytophilum, Ixodes ricinus, is only rarely found in Greece. Ixodes ricinus ticks are primarily associated with shrubs and forests with deciduous trees; therefore, they can be found around the forested zones in the north, but the hot and dry semi-arid environment around studied areas does not represent the optimum conditions for this species.",

Therefore, in order to further investigate the presence of A. phagocytophilum within the study population, samples which tested positive for A. phagocytophilum by ELISA were further analysed by PCR. As a result, A. phagocytophilum DNA was not detected at any of the samples tested positive by ELISA. Instead, the presence of A. platys was confirmed in four of these samples and also the presence of E. canis DNA was detected in four other samples, which however, were also found to be positive for antibodies against E. canis by the species-specific ELISA. The failure to detect Anaplasma DNA by PCR could be due to chronic infections, in which parasites are not always present in the blood, or to cross-reactions leading to false positive results in serological testing [31] . Similar to the results for Ehrlichia, the overall seroprevalence recorded in the present study was lower than that in a recent study where samples originated mainly from mainland Greece [14] . Likewise, in the study including samples from Aegean islands, Anaplasma spp. were recorded in only 1% (2 out of 200 samples); however, A. phagocytophilum was isolated in one of the samples by PCR [16] . The presence of Anaplasma spp. DNA was confirmed in ticks collected from dogs from various locations in Greece and identified at the species level [32] as either A. platys [13] or A. phagocytophilum and A. platys [29] .",

The seroprevalence of CVBPs reported here represent a constant health risk for both native and visiting dogs, and in some cases may amplify the risk for human infection. Additionally, a major threat is posed by the potential spread of both vectors and pathogens, endemic in southern Europe to northern, non-endemic regions of Europe and beyond. However, in order to define this threat, the infection pressure (i.e. as calculated by the seroprevalence of native dogs) and time of exposure to it (e.g. days in the specific environment), in order for na\u00efve dogs to become infected, need to be better understood, since there are studies that claim the risk for infection is low especially during a limited single stay in endemic countries [3] . In order to reduce the risk of transmission and the spread to non-endemic regions, the protection of dogs together with owner education, are of paramount importance. ",
