SHARE is a biennial multi-nationally representative individual survey of people aged 50 or over, with centrally standardized methods across its participating countries for the explicit purpose of cross-country comparison. SHARE participants are sampled based on probability selection methods; sample frames (mostly population registers) are chosen in accordance with the best available frame resources in the country to achieve full probability sampling, though there are small variations in sampling frames. 7, 8 In both surveys, participants were interviewed by trained personnel using computer-assisted interviewing. 6, 7 Items included sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, and wealth status), activities of daily living (ADL), a measure of depressive symptoms, and use of antidepressants. Differences between HSE and SHARE include: (1) a single country within a study (HSE) versus multiple countries (SHARE); (2) age range: HSE includes both adults (16+) and children (0 \u221215) but only children aged 13+ are interviewed directly, 9 while the age range is 50+ in SHARE 10 ; (3) a sample of people in private residential addresses (HSE) versus people in private residences \u00a7 people living in institutions (SHARE, varying by country); (4) repeated resampling with facilities for further longitudinal linkage (HSE) versus longitudinal re-interviewing plus sample refreshment (SHARE); (5) interviewer visit then nurse visit (HSE) versus interviewer only (SHARE); (6) the measure of depressive symptoms used (see below); (7) whether medication usage was recorded by a nurse (HSE) or self-recalled by participants (SHARE) (see below); (8) the wealth measure (see below). 11, 12 Detailed descriptions of HSE and SHARE, including the sampling methods, quality control procedures, and data collection, can be found elsewhere. 10, 11, 13, 14 The data collected by SHARE in each wave that was required for our analysis did not cover all countries and ages. We included the available data nearest to the relevant implementation times of the EMHAP. We excluded data collected by SHARE in 2020, in view of the unusual influence that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had on both services and data collection. 15, 16 We retrieved data from HSE and earlier versions of SHARE, covering 19 European countries, with a first (or start) phase of 2011\u22122015 and a second (or end) phase of 2015\u22122018.",

HSE collects direct household income directly but the data are provided in categorical format prohibiting the calculation of quintiles.) The wealth measure in SHARE was self-reported gross total household income.

However, the changes observed were not consistently in line with the process of community-based care in the countries studied. For instance, results varied between countries considered to have well established and strong community-oriented delivery systems, such as the UK, Italy, Spain, Austria, and France. 32 Our country-level analyses ( Table 2 ) provide more detail on this variation, showing that the percentage receiving antidepressants was associated with overall health expenditure in a country, but not with GNI or specific mental health care resource measures (general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychiatric beds). Furthermore, the progress made by countries was negatively associated with the changes in psychiatric beds, but not other country-level measures. Possible explanations include that financed public campaigns to inform the population about depression and to educate frontline professionals may have reduced stigma and encouraged people to seek help for depression. 4, 31 Compared to additional financial input, reconfiguration of existing services could also have increased access to, or use of, antidepressants.

            "text": "People aged 65 or over were less likely to be prescribed antidepressants than people aged 50\u221264 in 15 of 19 European countries studied, a finding consistent with previous studies showing a decrease in antidepressant usage with age, or highest usage in middle-aged populations. 34, 35, 41 Older populations are more likely to present with multiple diseases resulting in polypharmacy, and are more likely to suffer cognitive and functional impairment. Physicians may, as a result, be reluctant to prescribe antidepressant medications to avoid potential adverse drug\u2212drug reactions, or may prefer psychological therapies because of the suboptimal effectiveness of antidepressant medications among frail individuals with cognitive and functional impairment 42\u221244 ; patient preference in considering of benefits and adverse effects of antidepressant use versus psychological therapies may also contribute. 45, 46 Alternatively, these findings could also indicate inappropriate under-prescription of antidepressants to the older population, as suggested by findings from Germany (using data from 2008 to 2010) and the United States (using data from 2004 to 2005). 47, 48 An updated study is needed, as our findings suggest that the age disparity in access to antidepressants has widened from 2011\u22122015 to 2015\u22122018-particularly as the underuse of antidepressants for depressive disorders is associated with increased disability, worsening of clinical outcomes and increased mortality. 49 A further reason for the increase in age disparity might be population/sample aging (e.g. if the average age of people in the \u226565-year-old group was higher during 2015\u22122018 than 2011\u22122015). In contrast to other European countries, people aged 65 or over in the UK were more likely to be prescribed antidepressants than people aged 50\u221264. Prior work has also suggested over-prescription of antidepressants for older people, identified in England and Wales using data from 1993 to 1997. 50 Some large-scale studies have found that the peak onset for depression is from the late teens to about 20 years old 51 (though estimates have varied 52 ). We found that UK people aged 13\u221219 were 94% less likely to receive antidepressants, followed by people aged 20 \u221224 (77%), than people aged 50\u221264. Given evidence from data gathered at a similar time of increasing prevalence of depression among young people in the UK, we should be concerned about under-prescription. 53, 54 However, UK clinical guidelines advise psychological therapies as the first-line treatment, unless depression is severe, for those under 18 years old. 55 There is a great deal of media and policy attention to mental health in young people, a mental health workforce shortage, and consequent referral pressures impeding access to child and adolescent mental health services. 56 We lacked data on younger age groups from other European countries, but access to child and adolescent mental health services is also sometimes suboptimal in other European countries. 57 More attention to depression in young people is needed, given the particularly high developmental price of impairment during this key life stage, with further evidence of worse outcomes in recent cohorts. 58 Subgroup disparities were also identified in relation to sex and physical disability. In accordance with previous studies, 4,5,33,59,60 we found that males were significantly less likely to receive antidepressants in 8 of 19 countries. Physicians' prescribing behaviour may be influenced by sex difference in external expression of emotions, or because men may be less likely to seek help. 33, 59, 60 This disparity changed little from 2011 \u22122015 to 2015\u22122018, even widening in Belgium. Our finding that people with physical disability were significantly more likely to receive antidepressants in 13 of 19 countries is also consistent with previous studies. 59, 61 Physical disability is associated with a higher prevalence of depression, so it is possible that depression is more likely to be recognized and treated in this context. 59, 61 This disability disparity narrowed in 5 of 13 countries primarily because of the improvement for people without physical disability, including Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, and Greece, which yet might suggest a degree of diagnostic overshadowing or lack of access to treatment for people with disability. The disparity in the UK was different from other European countries, in that people with physical disability in the UK (and screening positive for depressive symptoms) were less likely to receive antidepressants than those having no such disability, a picture that did not change from 2014 to 2018. A further study is needed to explore if this results from the use of psychological therapies or under-treatment, or potentially methodological differences between HSE and SHARE (discussed below).",

The antidepressant recording methods may have had different biases: for example, HSE's method, based on formulary drug class, would categorize a tricyclic antidepressant prescribed for neuropathic pain in the antidepressant category, but would omit lamotrigine for bipolar depression, while SHARE's self-rating method, based on perceived purpose, would enable participants to include benzodiazepines in the anxiolytic/antidepressant category but might exclude antidepressant drugs prescribed for an indication other than depression. Within SHARE, sampling methods are designed to be as similar as possible, but are not identical. We used survey weighting to adjust for differences caused by the survey design to make the data representative for each country and each period, and also analysed the data for each country separately. While this method provides robust handling of individual countries (as a given country was surveyed consistently over time), and consistent methods were used across 18/19 countries, statistical comparisons between countries, particularly between the UK and other countries, should be viewed with care. For other country-specific reasons (discussed above/below), Figure 1 should not be taken as a measure of countries' performance against some kind of standard.",

First, informal support, other measures within primary care (such as exercise and sleep management), and psychological therapies are important complements to antidepressants for treating depression. 31,64\u221267 However, no corresponding data from primary care were available. Second, there was a lack of clinical confirmation of diagnosis, as data were drawn from large-scale population surveys using self-administered instruments. Additionally, as a result, we were unable to distinguish unipolar depression (major depressive disorder) and bipolar depression; the latter is often not treated with conventional antidepressants. Third, the self-administered instruments have only been validated for binary detection of depressive disorders, and do not provide accurate quantification of severity. No data on antidepressant type/dose/duration were available. These limitations prevent us from establishing the relationship between degree of need and antidepressant prescription or measuring any potential over-prescription. Fourth, people with depression may have been successfully treated, and thus have been taking antidepressants but without residual symptoms to be identified by the survey instruments; such people would have been missed by this approach, underestimating the proportion of people with depression being treated with antidepressants. We note also the potential for bias in the other direction by including such people, given (for example) that monoaminergic antidepressants are also used for other conditions such as migraine or neuropathic pain syndromes. Fifth, the results of country-level analyses should be treated with caution. For instance, in most countries a considerable proportion of antidepressant prescribing is by non-psychiatrists; although we took into account the number of GPs, other types of non-psychiatric specialists, such as general physicians (internists) also make such prescriptions. Public expenditure on health is a common index to reflect country-level input and healthcare affordability, but in countries without universal health coverage, this measure may not account adequately for the requirement for patients to pay directly for antidepressant prescriptions, sums that are not included in national health expenditure evaluations. Psychiatric bed count and antidepressant receipt may be only loosely associated, because a majority of people with major depressive disorder are not treated in hospital psychiatric settings (though bed counts and the number of psychiatrists may be proxies for spending on secondary mental health care more broadly). Therefore, the national-level results are only a macroscopic reflection with multiple possible underlying reasons. For instance, spending saved by reducing psychiatric beds might be used to improve mental health care in primary (or outpatient secondary) care, or promote awareness in the general population. Sixth, since within-country analyses were of a priori interest, such comparisons were made without correction for multiple comparisons across all countries to reduce the chance of type II errors, though this of course increases the potential for type I error.",

There were disparities in antidepressant usage by age, sex, and physical disability. The difference in usage by age deserves particular attention, as this disparity has in some cases widened. Our findings suggest that characteristics other than clinical need influence access to antidepressants for those who screen positive for depressive symptoms, though there are limitations that may reduce generalizability to those with depressive disorder. Commissioners, practitioners, and policy makers could use these findings as one starting point to investigate and improve appropriate access to mental health treatments in their regions.",

OR >1 indicates a higher likelihood of receiving antidepressants during the end phase compare to the start phase. *** p < 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05; . p < 0.1.",
