Abstract Background: Sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) is common in critical patients and results in the elevation of mortality. Red cell distribution width (RDW) can reflect body response to inflammation and oxidative stress. We try to investigate the relationship between the RDW and the prognosis of patients with SAT through machine learning. Methods: 809 patients were retrospectively analyzed from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to analyze the impact of each feature. Logistic regression analysis, propensity score matching (PSM), receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, and the Kaplan-Meier method were used for data processing.",

It had been reported that mortality rates of sepsis can still be as high as 60% in the absence of adequate treatment. 2 In the early stage of sepsis, in order to protect the host from invading pathogens, innate immune cells are activated significantly to clear invading pathogens. If this process is not properly controlled, it will result in exaggerated innate immune and inflammatory responses that could damage organs. 3, 4 To better identify patients with multiple organ dysfunction caused by sepsis earlier, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was born. 5 A patient with the SOFA score greater than or equal to two points indicates multiple organ dysfunction and in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. 1, 6 The incidence of thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <150 \u00d7 10\u2079/L) is about 35%-40% in intensive care unit. 7 Sepsis is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia in critical patients, with an incidence of more than 50%. 8 The exact etiology and pathogenesis of sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia (SAT) are still not clear.",

Firstly, we compared basic characters between septic shock patients with and without thrombocytopenia on admission, and we found that the mortality of patients with thrombocytopenia on admission was significantly high. Secondly, we sought to investigate the risk factors leading to the death of septic shock patients with thrombocytopenia on admission, and we revealed that age, RDW, lactate, and SOFA score were independent predictors through logistic regression analysis. Besides, the SHAP-based interpretation of the XGBoost model indicated that RDW was the second most important in predicting 28-day death after SOFA. Lastly, after adjustment for covariates by PSM, RDW still showed a good capacity to predict the mortality of patients with thrombocytopenia. In addition, receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis also demonstrated that RDW could predict the mortality of septic shock patients with thrombocytopenia better than others. To our knowledge, this is a unique study focusing on the relationship between RDW and septic shock patients with thrombocytopenia.",

In the critical care unit, RDW is very strongly associated with the risk of death and bloodstream infection. 44 As shown in our study, elevated RDW on admission was associated with higher mortality of septic shock patients with thrombocytopenia. In addition, the potency of RDW to predict mortality was almost equal to the classical indicators, such as, lactate and SOFA score. After adjusting confounders (Table 3) by PSM, RDW also elevated significantly in patients with thrombocytopenia on admission, and it showed moderate predictive power for 28-day mortality through ROC analysis.

Multiple organ failure and severe platelet depletion are caused by extensive microthrombus; the same pathological process can also be seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).[41][42][43] All of these can lead to severe thrombocytopenia.
