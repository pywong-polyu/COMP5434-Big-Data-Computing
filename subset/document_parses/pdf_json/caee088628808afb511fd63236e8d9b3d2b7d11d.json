An outstanding question is whether these diverse pathologies are due to replication of the virus in these anatomical compartments and how and when the virus reaches those sites. To answer these outstanding questions and study the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection a method for tracking viral spread in vivo is needed. We developed a novel, fluorescently labeled, antibody-based in vivo probe system using the anti-spike monoclonal antibody CR3022 and demonstrated that it could successfully identify sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rhesus macaque model of COVID-19. Our results showed that the fluorescent signal from our antibody-based probe could differentiate whole lungs of macaques infected for 9 days from those infected for 2 or 3 days. Additionally, the probe signal corroborated the frequency and density of infected cells in individual tissue blocks from infected macaques. These results provide proof of concept for the use of in vivo antibody-based probes to study SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in rhesus macaques.",

            "text": "Since its emergence in late 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout the world causing a global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 . COVID-19 is considered primarily a respiratory disease as the initial characterizations focused on the resulting pneumonia and respiratory symptoms of cough, difficulty breathing, low O 2 saturation, and other lung pathologies (1, 2) . However, it has become increasingly clear that people who have COVID-19 experience the effects of infection at multiple anatomical sites. Some well documented non-respiratory symptoms include brain fog, loss of taste and smell, kidney failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Additionally, there are reports of several other potential non-respiratory symptoms including erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular pathologies (9) (10) (11) . The underlying question for all these symptoms is whether they are caused directly by infection at these sites or are secondary effects of infection elsewhere. Limited studies have shown the presence of virus in tissues outside of the respiratory tract, but these studies have used autopsy tissue or biopsies from infected individuals (3, 4, 7, 12) . Unfortunately, these single time-point samples cannot be leveraged to understand the kinetics of how the infection spreads to these tissues. There is also some indication that SARS-CoV-2 can persist at specific anatomical sites, which could be related to long COVID symptoms (3, 13, 14) . A better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection would help to determine sites of viral persistence and elucidate the biology behind non-respiratory tract symptoms. However, both a model system that closely recapitulates human disease and a way to track infection in vivo is needed to study these spatiotemporal dynamics.",

These probes rely on an immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting a specific protein of interest that is chemically modified to allow tracking and detection of the probe. Antibodybased probes can be labeled with radioisotopes detected using positron emission tomography (PET) or with fluorescent dyes detected through optical imaging. These techniques have been used for many years to image cancerous cells and biological processes, but only more recently have they been applied to study pathogens (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . Studies of fungi, bacteria, and even parasites have been undertaken using pathogen specific antibodies as probes to study the distribution and kinetics of infection (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) . In addition, we and others have used imaging of antibody probes to study the dynamics of viral infection (40) (41) (42) . However, unlike the pathogens mentioned above, viruses hijack the machinery of the cells they infect to replicate; this leads to viral proteins being expressed by infected cells. We can exploit this mechanism by using antibodies against viral proteins to uncover the location of infected cells in vivo. The utility of this approach, to describe novel sites of infection in an unbiased manner, has been demonstrated in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection (40, 42) . Here, using a similar approach, we describe the development of the first SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody-based probe, the fluorescently tagged antispike IgG, CR3022, to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that following administration of this probe to SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques the probe penetrates the lung tissue and the corresponding fluorescent signal can be used to discern between areas of tissue with many infected cells versus areas with few or none. In addition, the probe's ability to detect infection was greater after one week of infection compared to 2-or 3-days post infection (p.i.). These results provide proof of concept for using antibody-based probes to track viral spread and study the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the rhesus macaque model. Future use of radiolabeled versions of this probe targeting SARS-CoV-2 will overcome the limitations of fluorescent labeling. The unbiased, whole-body, PET/CT scan will provide unique insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 distribution and dissemination providing novel insights into COVID-19 related pathology.",

Briefly, 1-5 mg of IgG1 was added to the FragIT column after equilibration and allowed to rock at room temperature for 45 minutes, the column was then centrifuged to elute IgG fragments. Fc fragments were removed by passing through a CaptureSelect Fc Column. F(ab')2 fragments were eluted and collected. F(ab')2 production was checked through SDS-PAGE. The resulting gel was first imaged under white light to show the fluorophore labeling of the F(ab')2 before staining with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Thermo-Fisher, #LC6060). For labeling, 3 mgs of purified CR3022-F(ab')2 was combined with 60ug of sulfo-Cy5 NHS ester (#53320, Lumiprobe), sulfo-Cy3 NHS ester (#51320, Lumiprobe), or AF647-NHS ester (#A20106, Thermo-Fisher) in PBS with 100mM sodium bicarbonate and gently rocked at room temperature for 1 hour as previously described (43) . Solutions were then passed through a Zeba column (Thermo-Fisher, #89882) to remove free dye. Labeled F(ab')2 was filtered through a 0.22-mm filter and stored at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Labeled F(ab')2 to be infused into macaques was tested using the Pierce LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit (Thermo-Fisher, #88282).",

Briefly, primary bronchial epithelial cells from a single donor (#CC2540S, Lonza, Switzerland) were differentiated at an air-liquid interface in Pneumacult ALI medium (#05001, Stemcell Technologies, Canada) for at least 4 weeks. Differentiation was assessed by observation of ciliary motion and elevated transepithelial electrical resistance; cultures were used for experiments within 2 months of differentiation. HAE cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 WA1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI = 1), as described previously, leaving the apical surface exposed to air after removal of the viral inoculum (45) . Forty-eight hours after infection, CR3022-F(ab')2-Cy3 was applied at 0.01 mg/mL (approximating macaque serum concentration) to the basolateral surface in media. At 72 hours post infection, cultures were fixed in 5% formaldehyde for 4 hours, then frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium and sectioned for analysis by microscopy.

Imaging confirmed the specificity of the Cy5 labeled probe to bind only cells that were expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike ( Figure 1B) . Although we have used this methodology in the past with SIV infection, one concern was that unlike SIV, SARS-CoV-2 does not bud directly from the cell surface, likely leading to less spike protein being present on the cell membrane of infected cells in vivo (49, 50) . However, there is evidence that infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses leads to a measurable amount of spike on the surface of infected cells (50) (51) (52) . To confirm this and further validate the probe in a more physiologically relevant context, we tested the probe in primary human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures. These cultures consist of bronchial epithelial cells that are grown at an air liquid interface to induce differentiation into a ciliated, pseudostratified epithelium with tight junctions closely resembling the native conducting airway. Forty-eight hours p.i. the probe was applied to the basolateral surface of the HAE culture to mimic distribution of immunoglobulins in vivo. The probe was seen both on the surface of infected cells as well as intracellularly ( Figure 1C) . These data indicate that the probe can be internalized and accumulate in infected cells; thereby, increasing the power of the probe to detect infected cells. Infected cultures without probe showed no background fluorescence in the Cy3 channel ( Figure 1D) . Importantly, the finding that the probe was able to localize to the apical surface of the HAE after basolateral application implies that the probe can cross epithelial barriers like those of the lung, making it suited to detect infection in this compartment. These in vitro experiments showed that the probe specifically binds spike being expressed on the surface of cells and confirmed that there is enough spike on the plasma membrane of these differentiated cells for the probe to identify infected cells, thereby providing evidence for the use of the CR3022 based antibody probe in live animals infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

The probe was injected intravenously, and animals were necropsied 24 hours after probe administration as was shown to be optimal by previous studies (33, 42) . Ongoing work to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics in rhesus macaques had shown that viral loads in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs peak 2-3 days p.i. (15, 18, 19) . Therefore, we hypothesized that this time point would give us the best opportunity to test the probes' ability to detect infection in the lungs. The first two animals, LP86 and DGD8, were administered probe i.v. 1-day (LP86, Cy5) or 2-days (DGD8, Cy3) p.i. and were necropsied 24 hours later (Figures 2A, B) . LP86 and DGD8 were administered probe labeled with different fluorophores, Cy5 and Cy3 respectively, to determine the optimal fluorophore in this system. To determine the background tissue and probe fluorescence associated with the lungs of an uninfected rhesus macaque we used a single uninfected animal (KM31) as a control for both fluorophores. This control animal was administered a mixture of the Cy3 and Cy5 probes 24 hours prior to necropsy ( Figure 2B) . Following necropsy and tissue fixation, lungs from all animals were fluorescently imaged at the whole organ level with IVIS imaging, which revealed no discernable difference in fluorescent signal between the control animal and the infected animals, regardless of fluorophore ( Figures 3A, B) . However, we did observe a higher background fluorescence signal when imaging in the Cy5 channel. Subsequent research has shown that the mAb CR3022 may have some ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (53); therefore, we hypothesized that administering the probe early after infection may have changed the kinetics and spatial distribution of the infection resulting in a low number of infected cells. Consequently, to further test the probe and reduce the chance that it is interfering with infection we moved to a weeklong infection model.",

Lungs were again fluorescently imaged using the same IVIS imaging settings as the previous animals. For LM30, we substituted Alexa Fluor 647, which can be imaged in the same channel as Cy5 to determine if the increased stability of the Alexa Fluor dyes compared to cyanine-based dyes could improve the signal of the probe. We found that after 9-days of infection, there was a strong Cy3 signal detected in the lungs of KF89 as compared to the lungs of KM31 and DGD8 ( Figure 3A) . Additionally, the detected signal was spread throughout the upper and lower lobes but appeared stronger in discrete areas and was not uniform across the entire tissue. These data corroborate pathology reports from other infection studies indicating that SARS-CoV-2 has a patchy, uneven distribution in the lungs (15, 16, (18) (19) (20) (21) . The AF647 signal in the lungs of LM30 was also higher than the Cy5 signal seen in the negative control animal, KM31 and the 2-day animal, LP86; however, the signal was more uniform across the lung tissue ( Figure 3A) . The higher Cy5 signal seen in uninfected control KM31, coupled with the unexpectedly uniform probe signal using two distinct fluorophores (Cy5 and AF647), led us to conclude that the background fluorescent signal in Cy5 was too high for straightforward interpretation of whole organ fluorescent images. In contrast, the Cy3 signal was seen in discrete areas in the lungs of KF89 after 9-days of infection, with little to no background signal, indicating that Cy3 is the optimal fluorophore for this system. Furthermore, the differences in the Cy3 fluorescent signal between KM31 and KF89 persisted as the lungs were dissected. For example, a cut was made parallel to the frontal plane to bisect the hilum of the left lung and left main bronchi ( Figure 3C ). Fluorescent IVIS imaging of this dissection showed that the Cy3 signal persisted throughout the lung tissue of KF89 and was still absent from the bulk of the lung tissue from KM31. However, we did observe a high Cy3 fluorescent background associated with the hyaline cartilage of the main bronchi in both KM31 and KF89 ( Figure 3C , white arrows). Further dissection of these tissues also illustrated that the signal in KF89 was present in tissue pieces at the centimeter scale and was clearly brighter and more prevalent than the signal in KM31 despite some background associated with the small airways ( Figure 3D) . These results indicate that the fluorescent probe accumulates in the lungs of animals that have more wellestablished infection.",

            "text": "To confirm the probes' ability to locate infected cells in tissue, wide field fluorescent microscopy was used by staining with a SARS-CoV-2 antiserum. Large, low magnification (10x or 20x) image panels were acquired from multiple lung tissue sections for each animal to search for infected cells. Lung sections from KF89 showed SARS-CoV-2 infected cells distributed throughout the tissue ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, in DGD8 ( Figure 4A ) we observed only a few lung sections that contained small clusters of infected cells. These images validate the difference in infection between DGD8 and KF89 suggested by the Cy3 signal from the fluorescent probe. Furthermore, these results are consistent with our hypothesis that giving the probe only 1-or 2-days p.i. may have blocked some replication and led to a more limited infection. In addition, higher magnification images of KF89 show infected cells clustering near major airways ( Figure 4C ) as well as infected cells lining the alveolus ( Figure 4D) , including an infected type II pneumocyte ( Figure 4E) , recapitulating infection phenotypes previously reported in the rhesus macaque model (15-17, 20, 21, 23) . Similar differences in infection were observed between LP86 and LM30 ( Figure 5) . LP86 had few infected cells, and several sections contained no infection ( Figures 5A, C) . In contrast, LM30 had robust infection with large numbers of infected cells widely distributed throughout lung sections ( Figure 5B ). Although the Cy5 and AF647 fluorescent signal had higher backgrounds, there was still a clear difference in fluorescent signal between LM30 and LP86 that was reflected by the difference in numbers of infected cells. Taken together, these data show that the fluorescently labeled probe can locate infected cells in lung tissue of rhesus macaques. During our image analyses, we found that both 9-day animals, KF89 and LM30, also had substantial infiltration of immune cells, most likely alveolar macrophages, into the alveolar space of the lungs (Figures 4G, 5E) . These cells were not seen in the earlier time point animals, DGD8 and LP86 ( Figure 4F) . These alveolar macrophages have a small amount of signal in all channels, including the SARS-CoV-2 antiserum channel, the probe channel, and an unstained channel. While this is consistent with background autofluorescence, it is also possible that some of the antiserum and probe channel signals reflect real SARS-CoV-2 staining and probe distribution. It is possible that these alveolar macrophages may have picked up the probe through phagocytosis of infected cells or clearance of lysed but previously infected cells and subsequently increased the probe concentration at these sites (54) .Although our images do not provide strong evidence for this, further work to understand whether the alveolar macrophages are contributing to accumulation of fluorescent probe signal is needed. Additionally, we see clear differences in the kinetics of infection between LM30 and KF89 despite both being necropsied 9 days p.i. LM30 has many more infected cells visible in the lungs while KF89 has fewer infected cells but substantially more alveolar macrophages present. Interestingly, neither animal had detectable viral load in the supernatant from a BAL collected at necropsy, but KF89 had a higher measured viral load in cells isolated from the same BAL ( Figure 2C ). This may reflect that KF89 was in the process of clearing the infection at the time of necropsy while LM30 still had active viral replication indicating slower infection kinetics, as seen by others (21) . A detectable viral load in a nasal swab at necropsy for LM30, but not KF89, further corroborates this ( Figure 2C ). Because these two animals were given the probe labeled with different fluorophores, we cannot directly compare the fluorescent signals to see if this difference in kinetics in discernable by the probe. However, the results presented here show that the fluorescent probe signal we observed at the whole organ level mirrors the level of infection observed at the individual cell level. Next, we sought to determine if the probe can successfully discern between tissue pieces from a single animal containing differing levels of infected cells.",

These results indicate that the IVIS fluorescent probe signal can directly reflect the number of infected cells in tissue.

The efficacy of these techniques for uncovering unknown sites of infection and elucidating the kinetics and distribution of viral infections has been proven in studies focusing on SIV pathogenesis in nonhuman primates (40, 42) . The first such study, by Santangelo et al. (42) , used PET/CT imaging combined with a radio-labeled antibody targeting the SIV envelope to show the reservoir sites of infected cells after initiation of anti-retroviral treatment in rhesus macaques. We and others have been using this same antibody probe to further study SIV pathogenesis and increase our understanding of the anatomical location of latently infected cells. After the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the globe, we hypothesized that we could design an antibody-based probe to help further our knowledge of the pathogenesis and spatiotemporal distribution of this novel virus. We evaluated the potential of a fluorescently labeled F(ab')2 fragment of the monoclonal antibody CR3022 in the pilot studies described here, toward the goal of developing it for future use as a PET/CT probe. Here, we report the successful use of the mAb CR3022 as an in vivo probe targeting SARS-CoV-2 infection. In vitro testing demonstrated that the probe could label cells transfected with the spike protein as well as HAE cultures infected with a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus (Figures 1B, C) . We infused the probe into infected rhesus macaques to determine if it could discern infection in vivo. However, we found very limited evidence of infection in lung tissue sections of these animals 2-or 3-days p.i. (Figures 4A, 5A) . Consequently, there was little to no fluorescent probe signal associated with the lungs of these animals ( Figure 3 ). This contrasts with previous work in rhesus macaques showing that viral load in nasal swabs and BAL fluid peaked at day 2 or 3 p.i. and evidence of interstitial pneumonia and infection in lungs at 2 days p.i. (15, (18) (19) (20) 23) . One reason we chose CR3022 as the basis for our probe is that it had been shown to bind tightly to, but not neutralize, SARS-CoV-2 (48) . Not only has subsequent research shown that CR3022 has potential to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (48), but we observed some inhibition of infection after applying the probe to the apical surface of an HAE culture early after infection (data not shown). Therefore, we hypothesize that the probe was interfering with the establishment and spread of infection in those macaques given probe 1-or 2-days p.i. Similar interference with the biological process under study has been seen with other antibody probes (34) . This underscores the need to carefully choose antibodies to be developed as probes, as those that interfere with the natural progression of infections will be less useful in studying pathogenesis. We plan to test other antibodies in this system, as there has been an abundance of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies cloned from infected individuals since this study was conducted.",

These animals were necropsied after 9-days of infection and showed strong probeassociated fluorescent signal in the lungs by IVIS imaging (Figure 3 ). Of note, the Cy3 labeled probe had less background fluorescence associated with the lung tissue as compared to the Cy5 or AF647 labeled probes. The difference in Cy3 fluorescent signal between the uninfected animal, KM31, and the animal infected for 9-days, KF89, persisted even as the lungs were dissected ( Figure 3D ). In the lungs of KF89 the fluorescent signal was also able to differentiate between two tissue pieces, one that contained a high number of infected cells and one that contained fewer cells based on immunofluorescence staining as well as quantification of signals ( Figure 6) . Importantly, the infection phenotype and kinetics elucidated by the probe matched what has been reported previously in the lungs of rhesus macaques (15, 16, (18) (19) (20) (21) 23) . This emphasizes that the probe signal is associated with physiologically relevant infection in the lungs and that giving the probe after infection was already established didn't interfere with pathogenesis.",

The infected cells found in KF89 and LM30 were most often found in large foci. These large foci may be important for concentrating fluorescent probe signal and detection at the whole-organ level. We also observed clear differences in the kinetics of respiratory infection between KF89 and LM30 despite them receiving the same dose of virus and being necropsied at the same time. This manifested as a difference in both the number of infected cells and the frequency of alveolar macrophages. The presence of these alveolar macrophages in the lungs corroborates lung pathology previously established in the rhesus macaque model (20, 21) . Although direct infection of alveolar macrophages was not observed, a weak signal in the probe channel indicates these cells may be acquiring the fluorescent probe through phagocytosis of excess probe or of previously infected dead cells labeled with the probe. Further work is necessary to determine what role macrophages are playing in the probe signal. Overall, the results observed here closely recapitulate the well-established respiratory tract infection in the rhesus macaque model (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . Taken together these data indicate that the CR3022 based in vivo probe works to elucidate sites of infected cells in the respiratory tract of SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques.",

            "text": "Although we chose to focus the early tests of this system on the respiratory tract, which is the most studied anatomical site of infection in macaques, to validate this technique for studying SARS-CoV-2, we are currently extending the use of this probe to studying whole animals using PET imaging. However, the use of PET scanners in biosafety level 3 animal facilities is limited and we wanted to prove this approach was successful using fluorescent imaging and a well-established anatomical site of infection before embarking on these resource intensive experiments. Previous work in mice has shown that signal from fluorescently labeled probes correlates well to signal from identical probes imaged using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) or PET (31, 34) . The promising results reported here have given confidence in adopting this antibody-based fluorescent probe system to PET imaging. Performing PET imaging experiments using this probe will allow us to look at live animals to search for novel sites of infection in an unbiased manner possibly revealing new anatomical sites where SARS-CoV-2 expands and persists. Moreover, such a probe will allow us to study the kinetics of viral distribution in real time in a live animal. Notably, because these techniques use well established animal models and wild-type virus, this technique could be used to study and compare the pathogenesis of different SARS-CoV-2 variants and leveraged to test therapeutics in the rhesus macaque model as new studies have shown that CR3022 retains the ability to bind circulating variants (55) . This is the first report of an antibody based in vivo probe being used to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in non-human primates. Although a previous study examined the in vivo spread of a modified SARS-CoV-2 in mice expressing human ACE2 using BLI (56), using the antibody-based probe system has distinct advantages over BLI, which, relies on both a genetically modified pathogen and animal. In contrast, our antibody probe can be used in an unbiased manner and can be a powerful tool for uncovering novel sites of viral infection within a model that closely recapitulates human disease. In summary, we have demonstrated the utility of the CR3022 antibody-based probe system to locate sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to differentiate them from sites of no infection both at the whole organ and microscopic level.",
