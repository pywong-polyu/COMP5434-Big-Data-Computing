The university students filled out the EPSI and other self-report assessments of eating pathology and related impairment. The results provide support for the F-EPSI's 8-factor structure among Iranian university students. The F-EPSI was found to be comparable across genders. Convergent validity as well as internal consistency of the F-EPSI were supported. Furthermore, this study supports the reliability of the F-EPSI subscales over time.",

In Iran, both men and women have similar or higher rates of muscularity/athletic-ideal internalization compared to their counterparts in Western societies [9] [10] [11] [12] . Furthermore, eating pathology in Iranian university students was associated with muscularity/athletic-ideal internalization [10] and exercise [13] [14] [15] , suggesting that muscularity is an important correlate of eating pathology in this population.

The 45-item version has demonstrated a robust eight-factor structure in university men and women in the US [17] and China [18] as well as in outpatients with eating disorders in the US [19] . Furthermore, the EPSI was invariant by gender [16] and age [20] , suggesting that the EPSI can be compared across genders [21] . Studies from the US and China comparing EPSI scores across genders found that women reported higher scores than men on all subscales except excessive exercise, muscle building, and negative attitudes toward obesity [17, 18, 22] . Such findings are consistent with gender differences in eating pathology typically observed in these populations [1] .",

The purpose of the current study was to translate the EPSI into Farsi (F-EPSI) and examine the factor structure, measurement invariance, and other psychometric properties (i.e., convergent validity; internal consistency; test-retest reliability). We postulated the original eight-factor structure of the EPSI would replicate in the Farsi version ( [16, 17] ; H1). Consistent with previous research [16] [17] [18] 22] , we expected that the F-EPSI factor structure would be invariant across genders (H2), and that women would have higher scores than men on all F-EPSI subscales except for excessive exercise, muscle building, and negative attitudes toward obesity (H3). Furthermore, we hypothesized that the EPSI would demonstrate high test-retest reliability (r \u2265 0.60) and internal consistency (alpha \u2265 0.70) in both men and women ( [17, 18, 22] ; H4). We also expected that the F-EPSI total score would have a strong correlation (r \u2265 0.40) with eating-related clinical impairment, and that the restricting subscale would demonstrate a moderate (r \u2265 \u2212 0.30) negative correlation with BMI ( [16, 19, 26] ; H5). The associations between the other F-EPSI subscales and BMI were exploratory. We also predicted that individuals scoring above the clinical cut-off for eating related impairment (\u2265 16 on the Clinical Impairment Assessment [CIA], [27] ) would demonstrate significantly higher scores on the F-EPSI subscales compared to those scoring below the severity cut-off ( [23, 27] ; H6). Finally, we explored associations between the F-EPSI and other measures of eating pathology and impairment across BMI and genders.",

Potential participants from a broad range of departments (i.e., Agriculture, Engineering, Psychology, Sociology) were invited to participate in a study that examined psychological issues. Interested students (n = 253) completed paper-pencil questionnaires without any remuneration. Due to the pandemic and the lack of students physically on campuses, we were unable to approach students in other departments (i.e., Physics, Chemistry, etc.). Thus, we transitioned to Google drive forms and collected data from 512 more university students. No differences were found between the two methods (paper-pencil method vs. online method) on the F-EPSI subscales mean scores To assess for test-retest reliability, a subset of participants (n = 88; 65.9% women) completed the scales 5-to 6-months later. Men ranged in age from 18 to 21 years (M = 19.1 \u00b1 1.0) and self-reported BMI ranged 16.2-34.0 kg/m 2 (M = 23.6 \u00b1 4.4). Women ranged in age from 18 to 27 years (M = 20.24 \u00b1 1.91) and self-reported BMI ranged 14.7-31.6 kg/m 2 (M = 22.4 \u00b1 3.6).

A third translator compared these two versions, reconciling linguistic differences. A fourth researcher and clinical psychologist with expertise in eating pathology in Western and non-Western cultures made minor adjustments to ensure conceptual and item equivalence. This final Farsi version was then back-translated by two translators. The original sentences of the scale and back-translated sentences were compared by a bilingual translator in Iran to determine if they held the same meaning, demonstrating semantic equivalence. Finally, the EPSI in its Farsi version was piloted with an independent group of university students (n = 39), who were asked to assess the comprehensibility of each item. To do so, this sample was presented with the F-EPSI items in Farsi and asked to circle any word, phrase, or sentence fragment that they found difficult to understand.

Findings were similar in men and women (see Table 1 ).

Model fit statistics and change in fit values from the multi-group CFAs are included in Table 1 . The F-EPSI factor structure demonstrated good fit in both men and women, providing evidence for configural invariance. Change in fit indices between the configural and metric models provided support for metric invariance, suggesting that factor loadings were equivalent across genders, which supported H2. Although there was evidence of scalar invariance across genders based on change in RMSEA and TLI, scalar invariance was not indicated based on change in CFI. These findings are consistent with recent work examining measurement invariance across adolescents and adults [20] and provide support for similar factor structure and factor loadings across genders; however, there may be variance at the level of the intercepts (see Table 1 ).",

Consistent with previous studies in the US [17, 19] and China [18] , results support the eight-factor structure of the F-EPSI with high internal consistencies across subscales. The current study adds to the literature by demonstrating that the F-EPSI subscale scores were stable over a 5-to 6-month period [44] and indicates the suitability of the scale for use in longitudinal studies in Iran. Consistent with our hypotheses and with previous research in the US [16] , the F-EPSI factor structure was largely equivalent across genders, demonstrating evidence for configural and metric invariance, as well as some evidence for scalar invariance. Scalar variance (i.e., variance in item intercepts) between men and women implies that one group may find the items \"easier\" to endorse; thus, differences in scores may not reflect true differences in the level of the latent construct. Collectively, our findings suggest that F-EPSI is appropriate to use for exploring gender differences. Consistent with previous research [17] , women endorsed significantly higher scores than men on the Body Dissatisfaction and Restricting subscales, and men reported higher Excessive Exercise and Muscle Building than women. Importantly, no gender differences emerged for Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, and Purging subscales, suggesting that Table 3 Internal consistency and intercorrelations among F-EPSI subscales in university men (n = 279) and women (n = 486)",

Intercorrelations above the diagonal are for men and below the diagonal are for women [17, 18] , Negative Attitudes toward Obesity subscale was not different across genders. One explanation is that weight-related stigma is not limited to men or women in Iran, but rather both report similar levels of weight-related stigma. The F-EPSI subscales were associated with impairment (i.e., F-CIA scores) and loss of control over eating (i.e., F-LOCES). Consistent with US samples [16] , the Restricting subscale was negatively associated with women's BMI, suggesting that the Restricting subscale may capture actual caloric restriction in women. However, the Restricting subscale was not associated with BMI in men, indicating that shape/weight preoccupation irrespective of body weight might contribute to eatingrelated restriction in Iranian men [4] . Additionally, the Muscle Building subscale was not associated with men's BMI, which aligns with a previous study in Iran [10] . This finding may suggest that men, irrespective of BMI, tend to use supplements to build muscularity. In contrast, the Muscle Building subscale was negatively associated with women's BMI, such that lower BMI was related to more muscle building behaviors, which is consistent with the thin ideal for women including aspects of muscularity. It could also suggest that women with higher BMI may be motivated to lose weight via more socially acceptable forms of weight loss (e.g., shape/weight-related exercise). Interestingly, associations with other F-EPSI subscales and BMI were significant in men and women, suggesting that BMI may be a correlate of eating pathology in Iranian university students. Collectively, these findings support the convergent validity of the F-EPSI.",

One possible explanation is that dietary restriction may represent a more impairing form of eating pathology in men compared to women. For example, restrictive eating may be seen as more normative in women and thus less strongly associated with clinical impairment. On the other hand, the correlation between Body Dissatisfaction and BMI was stronger in women than men, which aligns with the literature [46] , and may reflect gender-related body ideals. For example, women of higher body weights may be more dissatisfied with their body than men of higher body weights if cultural values related to thinness are stronger for women than men. The correlations between the other F-EPSI subscales and F-CIA, F-LOCES, and BMI were not significantly different between men and women, indicating that clinical impairment, loss of control over eating, and BMI are implicated similarly in men and women's scores on the F-EPSI.",
