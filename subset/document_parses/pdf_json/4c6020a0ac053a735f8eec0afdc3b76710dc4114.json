There was no difference in intraoperative complication rates, critical care admission rates or length of stay. One patient had confirmed COVID-19 infection (0.4%). The 30-day post-operative complication rates were significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (58 [20.1%] versus 32 [10.8%]; p = 0.002) for both minor and major complications.

Strategies to mitigate its impact have been proposed to prioritise finite resources in different healthcare settings. Consequently, elective surgery has been put on hold in many hospitals, even for patients with cancer [1] . Recently published evidence has shown that patients who received elective or emergency surgery and developed COVID-19 were vulnerable to pulmonary complications and more likely to die from their operations. This increased risk was particularly evident in the elderly (>70 year-old) who had undergone surgery for malignant disease [2] . As primary surgery is among an important treatment strategy for women with gynecological cancer, which are more prevalent in the elderly, delaying or relying solely on non-surgical treatment may potentially impact on their long-term outcomes.",

Aerosol transmission from general anesthetic airway management and, theoretically, in laparoscopic procedures have led to changes in intraoperative pathways [3, 4] . Emerging evidence also suggests the importance of minimising the risks of hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection during the perioperative period. A recent UK-based study reported one in eight (12.5%) COVID-19 infections were acquired in hospital [5] . Moreover, a COVID-19-free surgical care pathway was associated with 47% fewer early (\u226430 days) post-operative COVID-19 infections (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.36-0.76) [6] .",

However, some patient pathways were inevitably altered. We identified a significant reduction of laparoscopic operations performed during the pandemic (19.7% in 2020 versus 30.7% in 2019; p = 0.002). We therefore attributed this observed difference in potential deferral of surgery in selected patients with early low-grade endometrial cancers and significant medical comorbidities who were offered hormonal therapies. Delivery of complex ovarian cancer was considered particularly challenging during this pandemic [10] . Nevertheless, with our mitigation plan, we were still able to maintain our surgical throughput to undertake complex cytoreductive surgery for patients with ovarian cancer. We observed that fewer primary and secondary cytoreductive operations were performed for ovarian cancers in 2020 compared to 2019 ( Supplementary Fig. 1) , consistent with our pragmatic solution to prioritise the limited access to CCU facilities available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also observed an increase in the number of patients undergoing radical vulvectomy, with or without groin lymphadenectomies, during the pandemic. In addition to approaches described in Fig. 1 , surgery for vulvar cancer, which often affects the elderly population, was made possible by undertaking these procedures under regional anesthesia. However, patients who required major reconstructive surgery underwent general anesthesia instead.",

Infections (6.2% in 2020 versus 3.4% in 2019), wound issues (e.g. wound dehiscence without infection; 3.1% in 2020 versus 0% in 2019) and ileus (2.1% in 2020 versus 0.7% in 2019) were the commonest complications in 2020 (Fig. 2) . The rise in post-operative complication rates coincident with the evolution of the pandemic (Fig. 3) . There are multiple possible reasons behind this observed increase in postoperative complication rates. Firstly, as we transferred care from our specialist centre to the private sector, our gynaoncology nursing and ward staff were not transferred. Patients under the care of different surgical specialties were cared for on the same wards. The expertise developed over the years by our gyneoncology nursing staff was difficult to achieve within a short period. Secondly, when primary care was stretched during the pandemic, we had lower threshold to ask our patients to be reviewed by us in the tertiary care setting post-operatively, which could have led to detection bias. Nevertheless, it was also possible that we may have under estimated our post-operative complication rate, given that patients were less likely to attend hospital for minor complications during the height of the pandemic. Thirdly, it is possible that we prioritise the cases that were symptomatic, already deferred previously and/or received neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 2020. The results suggest the importance of considering team factors and additional attention on postoperative care for future pandemics or service re-configurations. Lastly, changes in surgical priority during the pandemic may have in part contributed to the rise in minor post-operative complications observed in 2020 (Supplementary Table 2a ). For instance, there were significantly higher number of patients who underwent radical vulvectomy and groin lymphadenectomies. Both procedures are often associated with high post-operative morbidity. However, higher minor post-operative complications were also seen in patients undergoing surgery for cervical cancer despite cases of cervical cancer were lower in the 2020 than 2019 cohort. This could be explained by the higher number of minor cases (e.g. Table 2b ). An important reminder about the impact of this pandemic is not only on our patients, but also on our doctors-in-training. Appropriately, surgery performed by attending surgeons was recommended during the initial periods of this pandemic based on safety concerns. This has no doubt impacted on surgical training. Individualised strategies to ensure recuperation of lost training opportunities are paramount to ensure high-quality surgical services in the long run.",

However, information on surgical morbidity and treatment outcomes were collected retrospectively, all information was available for the digital electronic records. Although our mitigation plan was not fully implemented until April 2020, we included data from January to March 2020 to show if there was any changes in our surgical practice and surgical morbidities as the pandemic progressed. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with the onset of our annual seasonal winter flu which can be as disruptive as COVID-19 to our cancer service. Including data from January to March allows us to evaluate whether the seasonal winter flu in 2020 was likely to have independently influenced our surgical performance. Our study shows that the annual seasonal winter flu did not impact on our surgical performance in 2020. We acknowledged that this study focused on the clinical outcomes of patients who have overcome the challenges during the pandemic and underwent their surgical treatment, and further follow-up studies of those whose care pathways were altered and delayed are planned. Although historic comparator (the 2019 cohort) was used in this study, our internal clinical effectiveness audits had previously demonstrated minimal variations in perioperative outcomes over time (i.e. the significant increased in complication rates are unlikely to be due to normal yearon-year variations). Multi-centre studies comparing the approaches taken to mitigate the effects of this pandemic on surgical cancer care in different cancer types are awaited.",

In addition, for further peaks of COVID-19 outbreaks and future pandemics, additional plans and training are required for the post-operative periods to enhance recovery and minimise post-operative complications. Additional training for nursing staff who were inexperienced or new to caring for post-operative gynecological cancer patients may potentially reduce post-operative complications. However, despite the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study has demonstrated the feasibility of maintaining surgical throughput with meticulous planning by a cohesive multidisciplinary team in a timely manner. We believe that appropriating shielding and screening protocol in place for our patients coupled with a robust mitigation plan to protect surgical and theatre staffs have ensured the delivery of a safe cancer surgery service. Through a robust mitigation plan, we were able ring fence our cancer service to deliver surgical care with minimal disruption from the pandemic. However, in country with severely stretch health resources, the use of the Modified Elective Surgery Acuity Scale (ESAS) may help to prioritise surgical treatment and ensure continuity in cancer treatment during the pandemic [11] .",
