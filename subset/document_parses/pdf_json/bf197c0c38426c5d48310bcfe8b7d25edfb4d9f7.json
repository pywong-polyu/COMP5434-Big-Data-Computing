            "text": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken for tackling it had the potential to lead to changes in numerous areas, including the illegal substances market and substance users' health. At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe (March 2020), the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction published a report on the disease's impact on drug users and drug service providers [1] . For highly vulnerable persons, the risks related to disease include high prevalence of chronic diseases, increased risk of lethal intoxication in cases of infection, the sharing of substance use equipment which might increase infection risk, crowded environments and the disruption of social and health care facilities. The report also highlighted risks related to changes in the illegal substance market, such as disruptions and reductions in the supply of illicit drugs which \"could have a range of repercussions especially for dependent drug users and could potentially result in an increased demand for drug services\" [1] . At the same time, many countries implemented population lockdowns, reinforced their border controls, and drastically curtailed the transportation of goods and people. This was the case, not only in Switzerland and neighbouring countries, but also in many other countries producing and transporting illegal substances, such as Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and the Balkan states for opioids, [2] , Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Venezuela for cocaine [3] , Morocco and Spain for cannabis [4] and the Netherlands, Belgium, and Czech Republic for various other stimulant substances [3] . This unprecedented situation could have led to deep modifications in the supply and distribution of drugs. There were worst-case scenarios of shortages of substances such as heroin and cocaine, and reduced supplies of cannabis [since part of this market is locally supplied [4] , but they were only hypothetical, since there were no observational data nor knowledge of similar situations to predict what course the supply of illegal substances would follow [5] .",

Several publications addressed these issues, but usually discussed only potential effects and/or recommendations, such as ensuring service continuity and accessibility of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) during the pandemic [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] without providing original data or direct observations. Since then, research on this topic has been conducted and several studies have been published (see Discussion). Among these, one study showed that COVID-19 patients with substance use disorders had significantly worse outcomes than other COVID-19 patients. Death rates were 9.6% vs. 6.6%, while hospitalizations were 41.0% vs. 30.1%, respectively; this highlighted the need to screen and treat individuals with SUDs as part of the strategy to control the pandemic, along with preventing disparities in access to healthcare support [11] .",

Due to lockdown and social distancing measures, normally open drug scenes were practically deserted and the social and health care facilities for drug users were poorly attended. Therefore, we targeted patients in the opioid agonist treatment (OAT) program at the Addiction Treatment Centre (ATC) of Lausanne University Hospital, because they were still being treated and were in frequent contact with the clinical staff (who knew that many of them were still using illegal substances, such as cocaine, cannabis, or street heroin).",

In order to specifically address the COVID-19 outbreak, the ATC implemented hygiene measures (e.g., social distancing, face masks, hydro-alcoholic solutions and temperature controls), adapted its operating hours to mitigate the flow of patients, decreased visit frequency when appropriate (i.e., certain patients were given several take-home OAT doses) and authorized telehealth services (e.g., consultations by phone or video chats). For the most vulnerable patients, OAT home delivery was introduced. In such cases, some treatments were modified (e.g., oral vs. injected), since hospital monitoring of clinical parameters and emergency care could not be as extensive as it was previously.

The form was developed for this study and designed to be short and clearly written, in order to minimize refusals and difficulties in responding (see original questionnaire in Supplementary Material). The first section focused on the use and purchase of three of the most common illegal substances in Switzerland (heroin, cocaine, and cannabis). Questions on use were 1-'any use of the substance during the last 7 days (yes/no)', 2-'number of days of use', and 3-'usual number of episodes of use per day'. Questions on substance purchase were 1-'where did the substance come from' and had multiple choices (black market dealer, bought from another user, given by another user, and personal stock), 2-'amount and purchase price', separately for typical categories in Switzerland [2] [3] [4] . These categories included heroin small baggies (0.2-0.5 gr.) and \"zip\" bags (5 gr.), cocaine small baggies (0.2 gr.) and big baggies (0.8-1 gr.), herbal cannabis (marijuana, weed) and cannabis resin (hashish). For each category, we asked the amount (in grams) purchased and the price in Swiss francs (CHF; CHF 1 \u2248 USD 1 \u2248 EUR 0.95 at the time of the study). The price per gram for each category was computed by dividing the price per amount purchased. Participants were asked to estimate the purity of the substance on a 4-point scale ('low', 'medium', 'high', and 'very high'). Additional parameters were provided to help estimate purity, based on standard purity measured in Switzerland [2] [3] [4] : for heroin 0-10% (low), 11-20% (medium), 21-30% (high), and >30% (very high); for cocaine 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, and >75%; and for cannabis THC content 0-5%, 6-10%, 11-15%, and >15%.",

Despite the unprecedented barriers to the transport and supply of illegal substances that were created to contain the pandemic, both quantitative and qualitative data showed minor differences in the market. Over the two waves of quantitative data collection covering periods with various levels of lockdown measures, the use, price and purity of three main illegal substances did not significantly vary. Substance prices and purity basically mirrored those measured in studies before the pandemic [2] [3] [4] . Nonetheless, there was some variability and non-significant trends indicating small effects that our limited study design may not have captured. Data from the qualitative study similarly indicated relatively stable conditions in the drugs black market. There seemed to be no shortages and few changes in heroin purchases. It also appeared that the cocaine market remained relatively stable, although the price of \"small baggies\" rose slightly and there were periods with more proactive dealers in the streets. However, the cannabis market was a different case, particularly for resin (hashish). There were several indications of restricted supplies, together with increases in price and scams. One participant mentioned very bad resin making him vomit, which might indicate the production of low-quality resin adulterated with synthetic cannabinoids. This had not been seen in western Switzerland, but recently appeared in Bern and Zurich and was connected to severe intoxication and deaths in Europe [17] . Other explorations of the illegal substance market during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Switzerland showed similar results [18] . Indeed, while triangulating analyses of wastewater, used syringes, and drug seizures, interviews with the heads of five regional drug squads, and analyses of purchases on darknet sites selling drugs, we showed a rather stable situation and limited impact of the pandemic on substance supply, prices, and quality, except for a cannabis resin shortage [18] .",

It also appeared that the market of substances imported from far countries such as Afghanistan (for heroin) and Latin America (for cocaine) was less impacted than was the market of substances imported from near countries such as Morocco (hashish) and Spain (herbal cannabis), or locally produced (herbal cannabis). The pandemic in Spain, which was among the most serious in Europe at the time, may explain these unexpected findings. It might also be that the cocaine and heroin markets are strongly established and sufficiently well-organized enough to overcome law enforcement obstacles such as reinforced border controls, drastic decreases in goods and people transportation, population (consumer) lockdowns, social distancing measures and other controls. Organized crime groups remained resilient and adapted their modi operandi to the current situation, further exploiting secure communication channels and adapting transportation models, trafficking routes and concealment methods [20] .",

Similar findings were seen in online surveys among substance users in Switzerland [23] , Europe [24] , and Canada [25] , or in wastewater analyses in European cities [26] . In those countries, decreases were more frequent for stimulants (e.g., cocaine, MDMA), mainly due to the closure of the night scene. Additionally, consistent with these findings, a survey of more than 36,000 adult substance users in Europe [27] suggested that the use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and other illicit substances remained unchanged for around half of the respondents during the first wave of the pandemic. Among those who changed, overall patterns suggested that more users tended to reduce rather than increase their alcohol use, whilst the opposite was observed for tobacco use and for cannabis use; there was no clear pattern of change for illicit drug use [27] .",

In a study among thirty subjects with substance use disorder (not receiving OAT), hair analysis showed that samples positive for heroin, cocaine, MDMA and cannabis fell considerably during the lockdown while the consumption of benzodiazepines and alcohol followed the opposite trend [28] . Some were concerned that shortages in heroin supply would lead to the consumption of other substances, such as fentanyl and its derivatives, or resold pharmaceutical products, such as benzodiazepines and buprenorphine [19] . It seems that this was not the case in Switzerland, or at least that it was only temporarily scarce. Similar patterns were also seen in the Czech Republic [29] .",

However, there was relatively high variability in the scales that was captured in semi-directive interviews as well. A minority of participants indeed reported higher impact related to anxiety, boredom, depression and lack of social contacts. Multivariate analyses also nuanced overall findings and showed that the impact was more important for those who were female, younger, and using a low number of substances, and less important for those who were male, older, and using multiple substances. A recent study showed similar patterns in France, where the impact on substance users' health and social situation was heterogeneous and depended on substance use patterns and socio-demographics. A particular burden on mental health was also noticed there [21] . In a study among outpatients and residential inpatients suffering from substance use disorders and/or behavioural addictions recruited across Italy [30] , the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was shown to be related with high rates of psychopathological symptoms. Nevertheless, psychopathological burden was globally higher among residential patients than among outpatients.",

These findings might indicate that the social and financial situation during wave 1 (with harder lockdown measures) might have had a stronger impact on cocaine and cannabis use. This could be due to fewer social interactions and occasions to use. Similar findings were observed in Europe [24] and among recreational users in Switzerland [23] . It could also be related to lower financial resources to invest in substances, as seen in France [21] . Conversely, the positive correlation of heroin use with mental health impact might reflect the use of heroin to cope with mental health issues triggered by the pandemic and lockdown measures. Coping might also explain the significant correlations of stress/anxiety, mental health, and physical health in general with increases in prescription drugs and alcohol use, and the correlation between a higher impact on social situation and increase in alcohol use at wave 2. Several studies pointed to increased use of heroin, alcohol, and prescription drugs, such as benzodiazepine, related to mental health issues and coping behaviours [24, [31] [32] [33] .",

Injections are not allowed outside the hospital due to lack of monitoring of clinical parameters and emergency care. All other comments were favourable toward the adaptations implemented. Beyond the mandatory changes required by the urgency of the COVID-19 crisis, one ponders which of those measures might be sustained in the long run. Similar measures were implemented elsewhere [34, 35] . Additional measures were also proposed, such as improving addiction treatment access using telehealth encounters for OAT induction [36, 37] , substance use decriminalization [38] , and safe supply of opioid [39] and other substances, including stimulants [40] .

This methodology quickly furnished valuable findings directly reported to the clinical staff and other local and national institutions [41, 42] . Nevertheless, it was accompanied also by several scientific limitations. First, we used anonymized questionnaires in the quantitative phase of the study in order to avoid patients refusing to provide written records of sensitive illegal activities. As a result, we were unable to conduct follow-ups assessing the evolution of individual situations over time via more advanced longitudinal statistical methods. This limit was partly offset with a qualitative follow-up of a sub-group of participants. Additionally, the high participation rates overall, along with the high follow-up rate in the qualitative phase lend strength to the research. Then, we used an ad hoc questionnaire, developed for this project. This was not validated, and no reliability tests were performed.",

Our thematic analysis relied on interview notes, which might have introduced bias. Additionally, it should be noted that our findings are limited by our sample, which was comprised of patients receiving OAT in the Addiction Treatment Centre of a University Hospital in Switzerland. Our country is among the most wealthy in the OECD and has a high performing health system [43] , including a universal mandatory health insurance system with virtually 100% coverage [44] . OAT is included in this coverage, and most patients also receive social welfare support. The participants in this study may have higher social integration, more frequent clinical follow-up, and have lower risk of opioid withdrawal or other substance-related consequences, than do others using substances but not receiving OAT. Recent studies suggest that those who are more vulnerable, such as the homeless [45] and those who have lower socioeconomic status [46, 47] , are more affected by the pandemic. Further empirical research should address the plight of these populations. Finally, our analysis focused only on the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Future research should investigate the impact of subsequent epidemic waves and the long-term effects of the crisis on the illegal substance market and on the health and social situation of drug users.",

Despite the unprecedented measures taken such as reinforced border controls, drastic decreases in goods and people transportation, population lockdowns, social distancing measures and other controls, the supply, price and purity of the three main illegal substances in Switzerland did not significantly vary over the two waves of data collection. The impact of the pandemic on participants' social situation and health was appraised as low to medium. Nonetheless, a minority of participants reported a higher impact related to mental health and a lack of social contacts and multivariate analyses showed that the impact was more important for those who were female, younger, and not using multiple substances. The present project aimed to rapidly overcome the lack of knowledge about the evolution of the illegal substances market and substance users' social situation and health during a major pandemic crisis. Several publications addressed this issue, but usually discussed only potential effects and/or recommendations and did not provide observational data. In spite of the limitations related to our sample and methods, we were able to show that there were no deep modifications in the supply of illegal drugs and no substantial impact on substance users' health and social situation. Nevertheless, further research should address the plight of more vulnerable populations, as well as the long-term effects of this crisis.",

There was also a small effect of age impacting on the fear of police control (B = \u22120.02, SE = 0.01, p = 0.047) and stress and anxiety (B = \u22120.01, SE = 0.001, p < 0.001) which decreased with age; while the effect on mental health in general increased with age (B = 0.02, SE = 0.01, p = 0.006). The number of substances used was related to decreases in experienced impact on stress and anxiety (B = \u22120.14, SE = 0.06, p = 0.01) and physical health in general (B = \u22120.24, SE = 0.09, p = 0.007), while the fear of police control increased (B = 0.11, SE = 0.02, p < 0.001).",
