It has been suggested that the higher risk in healthcare workers may reflect higher or repeated exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and to aerosol-generating procedures 35, 36 as well as reported lack of adequate personal protective equipment at that time. [35] [36] [37] [38] Comorbidities are also associated with lower SES, but again we found that they were independently and jointly contributing to increased risk, specifically, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory and autoimmune diseases. Unlike other studies reporting higher risk in obese individuals, 39, 40 and postulating ACE2 expression in adipose tissue as a potential mechanism for the role of obesity in severe COVID-19, 41 we found that the association of obesity and COVID-19 was attenuated while adjusting for comorbidities. These included cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and respiratory disease, which were the most strongly associated with the risk of developing COVID-19 symptoms, independently of obesity. This points to a potential role for metabolic and proinflammatory disorders in the development of COVID-19. Furthermore, we found an excess of ever smokers in the tested group, in agreement with some studies 6 but not others 27 -although the former may have been affected by collider bias. 42 Although increased risks from higher levels of outdoor air pollutants at the person's residence was seen in the unadjusted analysis, these were attenuated after multiple adjustment and only associations involving PM2.5 were (borderline) statistically significant.
