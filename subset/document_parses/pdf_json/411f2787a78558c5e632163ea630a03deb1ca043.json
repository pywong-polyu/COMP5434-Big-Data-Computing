            "text": "Compartmental models are often used to understand and predict the progression of an infectious disease such as COVID-19. The most basic of these models consider the total population of a region to be closed. Many incorporate human mobility into their transmission dynamics, usually based on static and aggregated data. However, mobility can change dramatically during a global pandemic as seen with COVID-19, making static data unsuitable. Recently, large mobility datasets derived from mobile devices have been used, along with COVID-19 infections data, to better understand the relationship between mobility and COVID-19. However, studies to date have relied on data that represent only a fraction of their target populations, and the data from mobile devices have been used for measuring mobility within the study region, without considering changes to the population as people enter and leave the region. This work presents a unique case study in Andorra, with comprehensive datasets that include telecoms data covering 100% of mobile subscribers in the country, and results from a serology testing program that more than 90% of the population voluntarily participated in. We use the telecoms data to both measure mobility within the country and to provide a real-time census of people entering, leaving and remaining in the country. We develop multiple SEIR (compartmental) models parameterized on these metrics and show how dynamic population metrics can improve the models. We find that total daily trips did not have predictive value in the SEIR models while country entrances did. As a secondary contribution of this work, we show how Andorra's serology testing program was likely impacted by people leaving the country. Overall, this case study suggests how using mobile phone data to measure dynamic population changes could improve studies that rely on more commonly used mobility metrics and the overall understanding of a pandemic.",

These interventions included stay- at-home orders and restrictions on economic activity, which were used as a means to reduce contact and hence transmission rates, effectively limiting mobility. Country border restrictions were also put in place to reduce the chance of importing the virus through inter-country travel. At the same time, tests became more available to better track population infection rates [1] . There has been an influx of data and research used to study the efficacy of various interventions [2] [3] [4] . In particular, this work addresses the use of population movement data.",

            "text": "Research preceding COVID-19 has indicated a close relationship exists between human mobility and the spread of infectious disease [5] . Past studies have shown how mobility data, such as commuter trips, can be used to improve disease forecasting models [6] . These earlier works highlighted the importance of combining their modeling frameworks with mobility data to address potential future emergent respiratory viruses, while also citing a lack of realtime mobility data as a limitation. In the wake of COVID-19, such real-time mobility data became widely available to study the pandemic, largely collected through airlines or via mobile phones. This is demonstrated in early works using aggregated metrics from Baidu LBS [7] to estimate domestic population movement in China. By combining this data with airline transportation data to estimate international travel, researchers modeled the effect of travel restrictions and the international spread of COVID-19 [8] . Similarly, the Baidu LBS data was also used to model the spatial spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan to evaluate the impact of domestic control measures [9] . Mobility data collected from mobile phones has also since been made available by Google [10] , Facebook [11] , Safegraph [12] , transit apps [13] , telecoms, and other companies [14] . Metrics based on these sources have been used to model or predict COVID-19 transmission rates [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] as well as to verify model results [21] , with the assumption that changes in transmission rates are correlated with changes in the mobility metrics. Researchers have also combined mobile phone data from multiple sources to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of how the virus can spread. This includes work that simulated relationships between the number of virus cases imported to an area, subsequent population mobility, and virus spread in multiple European countries [22] . Whereas another study tracked a specific fast-spreading lineage of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom by combining aggregated mobility metrics from both Google and the O2 telecommunications service provider with genomic data [23] .",

This framework was first developed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 [35] and has been well described more recently by Keeling et al. [36] . In short, the SEIR model takes its name from its compartments: S = Susceptible E = Exposed I = Infectious R = Removed (quarantined, recovered, or deceased) S represents the number of Susceptible people in the population who have not yet been exposed to the virus. Individuals transition from Susceptible to Exposed after exposure to individuals in the Infectious (I) compartment. Hence the transition S to E is a function of the number of people in the Susceptible (S) and Infectious (I) compartments, as well as the transmission rate, \u03b2, and the total population size, N.

The estimation and value of the reproduction number is complex and often misrepresented, but in general it represents the expected number of secondary infections which would be caused by a typical infected case if everyone in the population were susceptible [37, 38] . R 0 can be calculated as the ratio of the transmission rate to the removal rate. Often in compartmental models, both of these parameters are constant in time. However, if one or both of these parameters is timevarying, then the variation of R 0 over time can be estimated. While the R 0 only represents the true reproductive rate at the start of the pandemic when the whole population is susceptible, the variation of this ratio over time isolates the impact of changes in human behavior and NPIs on the reproductive rate. (The effective reproductive rate R t , on the other hand, represents the actual reproductive number at any point in time, given the behaviour as well as the susceptible portion of the population [39] .)

There were also already fewer total daily trips being taken at the start of March, 2020, compared to 2019. This is largely due to fewer people in the country making the trips. This metric also substantially dropped at the start of the lockdown. This drop was partly due to even fewer people in the country making trips, and due to the government imposing restrictions on movement. The number of trips gradually rose again before the border restrictions were lifted in June, indicating that the population increased internal mobility. The number of daily entrances to (and departures from) Andorra also significantly dropped in mid March of 2020, as tourists and others left the country and border restrictions were imposed, limiting entry to the country. These daily metrics remained near zero throughout April and May, until border restrictions were lifted in June.",

However, Fig 1 shows that daily trips were able to increase throughout May of 2020 while newly reported cases remained low. Case growth did not increase again until daily entrances increased again when the border restrictions were lifted in June.

All models performed relatively well during the period of study. Note their evaluation used cumulative deaths data whereas this work uses cumulative cases data.) The model (iii) using both trips and entrances data outperformed the other models in all but excluding the first week that followed the training period. More importantly, the model (ii) that used trips data to model transmission rates (without entrances data) had results similar to, and slightly worse than, the baseline model (i) which assumed a constant transmission rate. This is not surprising, as the data indicated trips were able to increase without impacting transmission rates (Fig 1) . This is also shown in that the best fit for model (ii) had parameters that flattened the impact of the trips data, resulting in a nearly flat reproduction number, R 0 . Given that there were few new infections at the end of the training period (i.e. a smaller population in the I compartment), this resulted in relatively flat predictions for new reported cases for model (ii) over the forecasting weeks that followed the training period (similar to model (i)). This is in contrast to the model (iii) that used both trips and entrances data, and where predictions for new reported cases closely tracked with actual predictions. See Fig 4. Overall, these estimated R 0 values are reasonable and within the range of values estimated by previous works [60] .",

However in this case, the model (iii) using trips and entrances data consistently outperformed the other models for all forecasting weeks. These results may seem surprising and their interpretation remains unclear. In epidemiology, the 3 models may be considered as (i) a homogeneous mixing model, (ii) a model of one population in which transmission depends on local mixing only, and (iii) a model that accounts for local mixing and external seeding, where trips are a proxy for local mixing and entrances are a proxy for external seeding. It is possible that the lack of predictive power of trips in the model is due to the model being calibrated during a lockdown period, when transmission opportunities represented by trips were not as important without external seeding. However, it is also possible that while trips have been used as a proxy for mixing in related works, trips did not necessarily convert to transmission opportunities in this case. This may be due to trips being safely taken with social distancing guidelines and other NPIs in place. And again, this may partly be due to the model being calibrated during a lockdown. At the same time, the entrances metric may represent more than external seeding, and also represent a more open economy and additional activities that may increase transmission opportunities.",

We again take a simplified approach to modeling, and create hypothetical trips and entrances data for a counterfactual scenario where mobility and border restrictions were not put in place. We do this by using the true metrics up to March 13 of 2020, and then keeping the metrics constant at the March 13 values. This is shown in Fig 5. We then estimate counterfactual case reports by using the previously fit model (i.e. we use the model parameters that were fit with the true trips and entrances time series values) and replace the model's trips and entrances data with the counterfactual data. We then run the simulation over the same period that was used to train the original model. The result is a prediction of 2941 cumulative reported cases up to May 31, 2020 under the counterfactual model, versus the actual 766 reported cases up to May 31, under the true scenario. The difference is an additional 2175 (more than 3x as many) reported cases during this time period under the counterfactual scenario.",

(2021) [15, 43, 44, 49, [61] [62] [63] , but their purpose was not to be highly accurate; the purpose of these models was to illustrate the relative importance of trips mobility data versus real-time population data, namely country entrances. In particular, for the case of Andorra, we find that the population was able to regain internal mobility measured in daily total trips with limited growth in cases, and that total trips per day did not have predictive value in the SEIR models while country entrances did.",

For example, there was likely an interaction effect between the trips and entrances metrics that was not captured in the models. The models also assumed that the case identification rate (and hence removal rate) and reporting rate were constant, which related works have as well (e.g. [21] ). However, these rates likely changed with Andorra's increased testing. Future works can more accurately model the impacts of mobility and entrances, and the interaction between these metrics. This might also include incorporating data on the infection rates for other countries whose populations contribute to entrances. Future work can also incorporate data on testing rates to better model changes in the removal and reporting rates. Furthermore, our modeling approach was able to leverage features that make Andorra a special case study compared to other countries. In particular, Andorra normally has a highly dynamic population, given its small population and relatively large number of cross-border traffic and temporary workers. These features, along with the fact that our study was conducted over one period at the start of COVID-19, may make our results less transferable to other countries or contexts.",
