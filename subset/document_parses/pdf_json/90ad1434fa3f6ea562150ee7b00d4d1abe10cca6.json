The disadvantages of chemotherapy are related to the drug's toxic effects, which act on cancer cells and the healthy part of the body. The solution of the problem is drug encapsulation and drug targeting. The present study aimed to develop a novel method of preparing multifunctional 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) nanocarriers and their in vitro characterization. 5-FU polyaminoacid-based core@shell nanocarriers were formed by encapsulation drug-loaded nanocores with polyaminoacids multilayer shell via layer-by-layer method. The size of prepared nanocarriers ranged between 80-200 nm. Biocompatibility of our nanocarriers as well as activity of the encapsulated drug were confirmed by MTT tests. Moreover, the ability to the real-time observation of developed nanocarriers and drug accumulation inside the target was confirmed by fluorine magnetic resonance imaging ( 19 F-MRI).",

            "text": "Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 (World Health Organization). Despite significant progress in cancer research, it remains a disease with limited treatment approaches. Metastasis and recurrence of cancer contribute a lot to disability and mortality. Currently, the issue is superior due to the soaring mortality rates correlated with the COVID-19 pandemic situation and a rapidly aging population. Global Cancer Observatory predicts that by 2030 approximately 30 million cancer patients will die from cancer each year. Standard cancer treatment is invasive and consists of surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Surgery is an effective measure to remove solid malignant tumors, especially in an early stage of cancer development; however, due to late diagnosis, combined therapy involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy is necessary for treatment. The disadvantages of chemotherapy are the toxic side effects and the development of resistance to the chemical agents, which is related to non-specific targeting of chemotherapeutics that harming both healthy cells and cancer ones, moreover, poor drugs bioavailability in biological fluids, undesirable side effects, and faint drugs loading capacity resulting in low therapeutic effectiveness [1] . Although novel approaches are constantly proposed, there are still many obstacles to overcome. The main challenge is to find new, more sophisticated, and efficient drug delivery systems capable of overcoming all of the limitations through the delivery of chemotherapeutics only to strictly defined pathologically changed places in the body. Details concerning targeted soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in chloroform (data from National Center for Biotechnology Information. PubChem Compound Summary for CID 3385, 5-Fluorouracil. https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5-Fluorouracil, accessed on 18 October 2021). 5-FU is an anticancer drug used to treat of multiple solid tumors; however, its short biological half-life and little affinity to tumor cells limit therapeutic efficacy. Undoubtedly, an additional benefit of 5-FU is the fluorine atom contained in the compound structure, which allows the possibility to monitor that drug by MRI [36] [37] [38] . Taking into account all this information, 5-FU was selected for our investigation.",

The nanocores were prepared by addition of a solution of 5-fluorouracil (45 mg/mL) and AOT (330 mg/mL) in DMSO to the poly-L-lysine solution during stirring by magnetic stirrer (300 RPM). Formed nanocores were encapsulated with polyaminoacids multilayer shell via layer-by-layer method with saturation technique [54, 55] . A fixed volume of 5-FU loaded, or empty nanocores, were added to the oppositely charged polyaminoacid's solution with various concentrations during vigorous mixing, and the consecutive layer formation was followed by the zeta potential measurements. Then, the coating process was repeated with the use of the oppositely charged polyaminoacids. The multilayer shell was constructed from the following polyaminoacids: poly(L-lysine) as a polycation and poly(l-glutamic acid) as polyanion and poly(l-glutamic acid)-g-poly(ethylene glycol) as pegylated polyanion used to form pegylated external layer.",
