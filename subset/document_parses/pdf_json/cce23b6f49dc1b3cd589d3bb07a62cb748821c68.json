Faculty and instructors have had to transform the content of face-to-face instruction into a format fit for distance education. In the virtual space, understanding or facilitating interactivity is a key component of online teaching for sustaining engagement and social interactions; promoting active learning between participants; and providing resources, tasks, and activities. The learning management system as a facilitative boundary object makes pivoting to online classes more tactical when adopting cultural-historical activity theory as an analytical lens, which can be used as a guide to re-envision how interactions can be implemented in e-learning or online courses and how instructors can repurpose resources and tools to maximize their instructional practices. Examples of interactivity and the implications for practitioners are synthesized, and the multiple components at play in the online and hybrid space are characterized in order to promote the exchange of practices and knowledge mobilization.",

One way higher education has pivoted is by using a learning management system (LMS). An LMS is an online platform that the groundwork for understanding interactivity in boundary crossing, as this theoretical understanding can help instructors to approach online teaching and learning more dynamically during the distance education. Next, we focus on using an LMS as a facilitative boundary object to encourage knowledge to be mobilized among the course participants and instructors with low-stakes innovations, which we refer to as knowledge mobilization.",

CHAT requires a minimum of two activity systems coming together to work toward the partially shared goals with a motive that draws both subjects together. For instance, when students take the initiative to share their screens or documents on their desktops on Zoom, they become the subject of their own activity system, reversing the participating roles and class rules to engage other members in the virtual learning environment in a different way. From the CHAT perspective, the LMS can then be proposed as a facilitative boundary object that promotes interactivity to leverage communities of practices and knowledge mobilization. With the LMS-integrated tools, the division of labor of the online participants could be technologically delineated, such as the assignment of discussion forums for peer-reviewing and how peer reviews can be conducted in the e-course.",

The object, or the motive of this activity, is the reconfiguring of a web space in which a facilitative boundary object emerges to actively combine synchronous and asynchronous learning, so that the expected outcome of new e-course implementation can best serve both instructors' and students' needs and foster a positive teaching/learning experience. The rules, aside from institutional technology policy, refer to when and how to conduct synchronous and asynchronous sessions online. The community consists of both individual students and the virtual smaller groups they form. The division of labor is the role each participant plays in their online course engagement, including collaboration, discussion, and peer review. Lastly, envisioning the repurposing of tools helps the subjects (both instructors and students) to reimagine possible reconfigurations of interactivity within the LMS, especially when it comes to providing access and engaging a diverse array of students located in different time zones and geographical locations.",

            "text": "To promote interactivity, instructors need to become aware of how it works as a mediator, and how it is best curated and interspersed (Farber 2013). Equally important are instructors' beliefs about interactivity (Bolld\u00e9n 2016) . These beliefs guide pedagogical decisions across all e-learning contexts but are particularly important (2021) 1: 62 62 Page 4 of 15 for the sudden transition to online courses, as everyone is immersed in a hybrid environment as they generate new learning. In these contexts, instructors must be aware of multiple modes of communication, practices, and the principles of multimodality (Kress et al. 2004; Latour 2005; Leeuwen 2015) . In discussions of interactivity, Wagner (1994) defines the term as consisting of \"reciprocal events that require at least two objects and two actions. Interactions occur when these objects and events mutually influence one another\" (p. 8). For instance, the concept of a module is a sub-unit of learning composed of asynchronous and synchronous class sessions. Modules organize the sequence of learning throughout the course regardless of which LMS is adopted. If we couple Wagner's viewpoint with a CHAT perspective (Bharosa et al. 2012; Engestr\u00f6m 1987 Engestr\u00f6m , 2001 , instructional interactivity then becomes an event containing a mediating process between a learner and the learning environment, including the learning materials, with an intended learning or performance outcome. Specifically, modules may include a series of instructional videos, reading assignments, practical exercises, and class discussions that focus on a particular topic for each session. Moreover, Smuts (2009) states that \"interaction [is] best described [as] a kind of behavior one engages in\" (p. 63). Instructors most often regard face-to-face classes as having the strongest degree of interaction among course participants (Ishii et al. 2019) .",

It is important to note that Smuts distinguishes \"interactive\" from \"interactivity.\" According to Smuts (2009) , interactivity \"must be responsive in a way that is neither completely controllable nor completely random\" (p. 54). In other words, when engaging in interactivity, \"the type of responsiveness is more important than the degree\" (Smuts 2009, p. 64) . The responsiveness of interactivity could be understood in relation to one or more types of online learning interaction, such as learner-content interaction or learner-technology interaction.",

Perhaps the most productive way to engage and indulge interactivity is to think of technology as a kind of division of labor (Chang and Mart\u00ednez-Rold\u00e1n 2018) that can be used to its full potential in some formal learning settings. Divisions of labor are roles in the human activity system that participants assume or assign. Socioculturally speaking, learning is mediated by tools. In terms of substance, these tools are mostly tangible in face-to-face classrooms, for instance, a hardcopy of a worksheet that students can write in, or Play-Doh for students to make sculptures with in their groups.",

            "text": "However, in online teaching, these tools become largely semiotically mediated. For instance, graphic interchange format (GIF) files support both animated and static images, and emoji icons notated in distance learning share a semiotic importance equal to the spoken text. Depending on how online teaching is materialized, semiotic mediation plays an even more critical role in engaging and indulging interactivity as instructors cross disciplinary boundaries in a virtual collaborative space SN Soc Sci (2021) to maintain academic integrity, continuity, and even authenticity (Marull and Kumar 2020) . Hence, it is more generative to begin to rethink the roles of technologies that would allow instructors to engage course participants in different capacities. Furthermore, online instructional interactivity is regarded as a \"dialogue between learners and e-Learning tools through which learners become engaged and involved in the e-Learning process\" (Pappas 2015, n.p.) . This dialogical definition fits the purpose of this article in identifying the types of responsiveness in interactivity (Juwah 2006) . Also of significance is that interactivity can be embodied with on-site learning materials and thus transferred from online platforms to face-to-face teaching in a post-COVID-19 environment, which is especially important since some schools have decided to reopen their campuses using blended learning formats. The repurposing of tools can make them more advantageous compared to what would have been used only for in-person learning as we cross the boundaries between the two contexts, such as a flipped method (Voss and Kostka 2019) . In fact, based on our empirical experiences, there is more transfer from online teaching to face-to-face teaching than there is the other way around.",

In short, how instructors approach instructional interactivity has important implications for online teaching: How can course instructors make teaching visually, pedagogically, and technologically interactive online? One way to approach online teaching is to avoid restricting collaborative conversations to verbal or face-to-face formats. There is an increasing amount of in-depth and insightful conversations taking place in online classes, whether on the default discussion forums on an LMS or through the integrated tools that are embedded on the LMS page. The blessing in disguise here is that trying to reimagine one's instructional interactivity online requires risktaking to retune the content delivery and make each unit (session or module) more visually, pedagogically, and technologically interactive. Such a risk-taking ability may vary according to the individual instructor's training, motivation and interest in online education, which can affect their conceptualizations of an LMS as a facilitative boundary object. While this is beyond the scope of the article to address instructors' conceptualization of an LMS as a facilitative boundary object, some studies have shown that reimagined instructional interactivity has positively impacted students' learning outcomes.",

(2006) , groups working with interactive video content, as opposed to groups presented with linear video or no video content, were shown to exhibit \"higher achievement of learning outcomes in post-gain tests\" (p. 23). The test scores of the students in the interactive video group were on average nearly 20% higher than those of the linear video group and approximately 22% higher than those of the group with no video. The students in the interactive video group had test scores that were approximately 30% higher than those in the traditional classroom group. Zhang et al. (2006, p. 22) found that video/audio learning tools are beneficial for students in engaging and indulging interactivity as the types of responsiveness are diversified. Semiotic mediating artifacts can also be used for a face-to-face course through flipped classroom teaching methods (Johnson and Lester 2016; Knapp 2018) . All in all, video/audio learning tools can enhance and improve SN Soc Sci (2021) 1: 62 62 Page 6 of 15 group dynamics when meaningfully embedded and integrated in the facilitative boundary object, which helps students transcend their current state of learning and rethink online engagement. Much of the LMS functionality relies heavily on interweaving and interacting with different versatile tools, which, broadly speaking, are the artifacts used to mediate the learning in action-be it software, hardware, cloud-based services, digitized physical objects, or a combination of different artifacts. Therefore, instructors are in greater need of a dynamic tool system for deeper and more active digital learning. For example, instructors in higher education conventionally regard teaching faceto-face courses as more engaging and effective than online courses due to perceived physical interactions (Ishii et al. 2019; Kenzig 2015; Sun and Cheng 2007) . In a time in which learning and teaching must be done remotely, faculty and online instructors without professional training in the technology field face tremendous challenges in adopting and adapting tools to use LMS as a facilitative boundary object in the digital professional learning space. One starting point is to allow the lesson objectives and learning content to help instructors to curate the tools, rather than beginning with the selections of tools first.",

Repurposing the tools not only aids instructors in templatizing their semiotic mediating tools but also helps class participants to move their learning goals from familiarity to sophistication by generating case studies, deliberate annotation, and peer reviews. The video/audio learning tool helps instructors to combine the actual tasks to reduce the amount of time spent going back and forth on the discussions or email chains; it also allows them to reuse the first part of the presentation to extend the video discussion as a formative assessment and to create a feedback loop by developing individual exercises and small group assignments that are either graded or ungraded.",

In other words, embodied agents act as teachers in an alternative mode of interaction. When the instructors are not in the same physical space as the students, they may need to seek alternative embodied agents to co-facilitate learning. Moreover, the LMS-integrated tools also allow instructors of online courses to integrate multimodal methods into the process of chunking the content (Hicks and Bose 2019). Admittedly, the video/audio learning tools challenge instructors to reframe teaching (and learning as well) in synchronous and asynchronous spaces.

Practically, a video/ audio learning tool creates a positive line of synergy between the flipped, virtual classroom and the online class participants (Knapp 2018; Voss and Kostka 2019) in any given LMS and semiotically promotes boundary crossing. With this boundarycrossing challenge in mind, we seek to examine how the facilitative boundary object can be used to engage and indulge interactivity in the LMS (Ross 2019).",

Such an approach highlights the importance of \"content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), and technological knowledge (TK)\" (Harris et al. 2009, p. 397) .

The relationships between TPACK and the community of practices make knowledge mobilization difficult in designing online learning that engages and indulges interactivity. It is not viable to assume that instructors have the same TPACK digital literacy as instructional designers or students. Hence, Costa et al. art education programs can no longer engage their students in the same way as they typically would in the ceramic studio with wheels and clay in hand. Rather than focusing on the one-to-one replication and the institutionalized knowledge-based TPACK skill sets instructors need to acquire, the LMS could be better approached as a facilitative boundary object. As we reconceptualize the usage of tools in shared web spaces to reimagine interactivity, we can also use the LMS to teach online in a time of need. E-courses have been delivered and implemented in conventional distance education, through which course instruction is conducted entirely online with asynchronous and/or synchronous sessions. Some e-courses have been developed with a blended method where course participants meet physically at a work site or on campus for a certain period of time for student teaching, a practicum, or a clinical internship, and meet online for other segments of learning. This option is currently limited for educators and students impacted by COVID-19. Other e-courses, prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, have been offered in a hybridization space, with face-to-face participants meeting on campus and online participants meeting at the same time in a physical classroom that is technologically enhanced (i.e., having a wireless internet connection, cameras, microphones, and speakers ready). After the demand for instructors to move classes online to ensure academic continuity, the new e-course format involves a stronger level of boundary crossing of two or more learning communities coming together in a shared web space.",

Currently, much of the professional development for faculty regarding online design focuses on accessibility and formats without accounting for the underlying awareness and beliefs about interactivity that govern faculty and course instructors' decisions and practices. In the domain of digital learning and online teaching, it would be beneficial to contextualize the LMS within the scope and scale of a facilitative boundary object to seek additional possibilities to curate course participants' learning experiences online and retool the modules. Focusing on how course participants and instructors take form and shape to co-construct and negotiate knowledge in light of multimodality further aids in engaging and indulging interactivity, as has been argued in this article. There are three ways instructors can view the LMS as a facilitative boundary object: (1) by noticing web spaces SN Soc Sci (2021) 1: 62 62 Page 10 of 15 and simulation, (2) by renegotiating orientations and attitudes, and (3) by comparing personal learning and collaboration.

The LMS as a facilitative boundary object encompasses external and internal tools and digitized resources in web spaces. These web spaces form a virtual social world, extending the course duration and its physical boundary. Interactivity as a concept is not equivalent to interactive experiences in the gaming industry but is in this case mediated by tools and divisions of labor, as understood through the CHAT approach. Thus, interactivity occurs as a result of meeting information and communication needs, the demands of teaching arrangements, and the requirements of course participants and instructors positioned as learners. While online course instructors typically assume the role of primary facilitators in web spaces for the purpose of community building, they also serve as the curators of syllabi at the beginning of the coursework. To engage and indulge interactivity, the divisions of labor will need to be gradually rotated among the course participants in order to co-construct knowledge and mediate learning semiotically.",

For example, in the same graduate teacher education course mentioned above, students were asked to read academic journal articles, state and federal policy briefs, and practitioner tools on a weekly basis and to synthesize their takeaways. Instead of composing discussion board posts, students created an infographic either by hand (and digitize it for online display) or use a cloud-based program. Students were also expected to provide a brief description of their infographic and comment or ask questions of a few colleagues. Allowing the option of creating a visual representation of information supports various learning and reflection methodologies and models student choice and the inclusion of tools (technology and non-technology) as part of good instructional practice. Asking students to create an infographic also breaks up the monotony of weekly discussion board participation and engages students' creativity.",

In other words, course participants become the mediators in this boundarycrossing process. The LMS as a facilitative boundary object insinuates non-linear movement, as the course participants cross their own socially defined boundaries of learning. The LMS is conceptualized as a facilitative boundary object because it is where the new expanded, informed beliefs about e-learning are formed and recreated via reconciliation, reconstruction, reconceptualization, renegotiation, and re-mediation within the discourses of course participants and instructors. These non-linear movements provide a common meaning-making ground for the higher education community to extrapolate its disturbances and tensions in digital learning and online teaching in a time of need and in the wake of COVID-19.",

Proposing the LMS as a facilitative boundary object has instantiated the possibility of shaping learning non-linearly and the move to expand on creating shared web spaces that further probe boundary crossing as the digital tools are constantly repurposed among two or more learning contexts (Akkerman and Bakker 2011) .",

Students were able to explore a wide range of topics, including instructional strategies for supporting ELs in math and science to understand the research around EL policy and accessibility resources for large-scale testing. The final project components were broken down into smaller chunks throughout the quarter to allow for multiple interactions between the student, the materials, and the instructor. The project started with the topic selection that was discussed and refined and then moved to resource selection and summaries. At each SN Soc Sci (2021) 1: 62 62 Page 12 of 15 stage, students were expected to check in with the instructor through a short assignment and feedback, a conversation, or both. The instructor's role became that of a facilitator of the process instead of the center of learning. In this case, the instructor simultaneously supported the acquisition of research and academic skills and also built the student's capacity to problem solve and engage with the resources in the shared web spaces. The project culminated with a paper and presentation at the end of the course. This was done through Canvas and Zoom, where participants would be able to share their screens and present the resources they have created to enhance their presentations, and could be replicated with other LMS and communication technologies.",

Both groups are jointly learning for concerted purposes, and being positioned in this way allows the instructors to reflect on the use of technological tools in digital learning and associated online teaching strategies. To further understand how the LMS as a facilitative boundary object could encourage new forms of interactivity, it is critical to base further discussion on boundary crossing between the two online communities (Marheineke et al. 2016) .",

An alternative to learning from another person could be reading about an experience in a book or watching a film or documentary; however, purposeful engagement provides a back and forth for deeper learning and understanding. For the CLD case study, students were provided with a list of questions to choose from for the semistructured interview with a specific lens on the immigration experience, learning SN Soc Sci (2021) inside and outside of school, and challenges during the transition. In addition to expanding the awareness of the heterogeneity of students designated as EL and immigrant students, the assignment also emphasized the importance of getting to know your students to be able to build appropriate and targeted supports based on their prior knowledge, experiences, and backgrounds.",

The LMS as a facilitative boundary object aids both course instructors and students in positioning themselves in a redefined online and hybrid learning environment. With an analytical lens, CHAT characterizes the multiple components at play in the online and hybrid space. In providing courses online, participants who are usually constrained by distance from the institution are now able to acquire resources and tools to improve their instructional practice. When using CHAT as an analytical lens, the coursework and all of its activities, tools, and interactions are viewed as part of the activity system, through which the LMS as a boundary object emerges. Opportunities for interactivity are not limited to engagement with resources. Interactivity also extends engagement with resources outside of the syllabi. Engaging and indulging interactivity can be used as a guide to re-envision how tools could be repurposed and how the LMS can be utilized as a facilitative boundary object through which more non-linear learning occurs. This article contributes to the existing literature promoting the use of CHAT as an analytical lens in conceptually addressing the interactivity problem for designing interactive online instruction.",
