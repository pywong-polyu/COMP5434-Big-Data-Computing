For example, in Italy, the prevalence of low vitamin D is high in elderly women (aged 60-80 years) with values of 25(OH) vitamin D <5 ng/mL seen in 27% and <12 ng/mL in 76% [23] . This has prompted the question as to whether insufficient vitamin D could influence the course of COVID-19 [24] [25] [26] . Supporting other evidence [27] , Ilie et al. recently analyzed data from 20 different European countries and observed a negative correlation (r = \u22120.44, p = 0.05) between levels of mean vitamin D (average 56.79 \u00b1 10.61 nmol/L) and the number of cases of COVID-19/1 million population in each country [28] . The SENECA study group observed that mean vitamin D levels were severely low in the aging population, mainly in Spain (26 nmol/L), Italy (28 nmol/L) and Switzerland (23 nmol/L), this group recognized as the most vulnerable in relation to COVID-19 [29] .",

Furthermore, several studies evaluating the effect of vitamin D on COVID-19 patients have been limited by the low dose administered [30, 31] or because patient characteristics may have precluded the possibility to observe a measurable effect of treatment [31] . The use of high-dose (~500,000 IU) cholecalciferol has already been shown to reduce hospital mortality in critically ill patients who were severely deficient in vitamin D [35] , however, few studies have examined the effect of high-dose cholecalciferol in COVID-19 patients. The principal aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the combined outcome of transfer to ICU and/or death in hospitalized comorbid fragile COVID-19 patients receiving 400,000 IU cholecalciferol (200,000 IU administered in two consecutive days) and also to determine if the effect of vitamin D may be modified by the comorbidity burden of these patients. In this regard, patients were also divided into four subgroups according to their comorbidity burden (no comorbidities, one comorbidity, two comorbidities and three or more comorbidities).",

The single need for transfer to ICU was invasive mechanical ventilation. Twenty-seven (29.7%) patients were transferred to the ICU and 22 (24.2%) patients died, in six cases after being transferred to the ICU (in 16 cases prior to transfer to ICU). Overall, 43 (47.3%) patients experienced the combined endpoint of transfer to ICU or death. In a crude analysis, initially including comorbidity burden as a potential confounder, vitamin D treatment was observed to be associated with a 43% and 55% reduction, respectively, in the OR of the combined endpoint, but these effects did not attain statistical significance (Table 3) .

Of note, this effect modification remained significant (p = 0.018) after also forcing age and treatment with tocilizumab into the logistic model (e.g., two variables which were not specifically included in the propensity score, but were different across patient stratification). This analysis showed that the OR of vitamin D treatment for the incidence of the combined outcome was reduced in parallel with the increase in the comorbidity burden (Table 4 ). A sensitivity analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method showed that the in-hospital mortality rate did not significantly differ between vitamin D-treated and untreated patients (see Supplementary Materials Figure S1 ).

Those who were supplemented with vitamin D after a diagnosis of COVID-19 did not show any significant benefit compared to untreated controls [30] . Instead, patients who regularly received bolus vitamin D3 supplementation in the preceding 12 months experienced a significantly lower mortality rate over 14 days (HR: 0.07, p = 0.017) compared to the control group (without vitamin D). Patients in the second group (receiving vitamin D after COVID-19 diagnosis) were older than in our study (85 vs. 74 years) with higher male predominance (68.7% vs. 53% in our study), and higher CRP levels (69 vs. 55 mg/L), characteristics which would not explain the lack of benefit compared to the control group. However, the dose of oral vitamin D3 was 80,000 IU, approximately five times lower than that administered to patients in the present study, potentially a decisive explanatory factor for the differences observed. In a randomized controlled trial performed in India on 40 middle-aged patients positive for COVID-19, 16 patients were randomized to receive bolus cholecalciferol (80,000 IU for 7 days) and 24 patients did not receive vitamin D (control group) [32] . Although mortality was not assessed in that trial, 10/16 (62.5%) patients receiving a high dose of cholecalciferol (admittedly spread over 7 days), similar to that used in the present study (560,000 IU vs. 400,000 IU), achieved SARS-CoV-2 negativity compared to five out of 24 (20.8%) participants (p = 0.018) in the control arm. Furthermore, a 42.4 ng/mL increase in serum 25(OH)D was seen after 14 days (compared to a 5.1 ng/mL increase in the placebo group). This trial included patients aged around 50 years and as such are poorly representative of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Europe. Furthermore, no effort to adjust for confounding variables was considered in their analysis. In another randomized controlled trial involving 240 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, a single dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 supplementation was found to be effective in increasing 25(OH) vitamin D levels, but it did not significantly decrease length of hospital stay or other clinical outcomes compared to the placebo group. Patients were aged 56.8 years and 57.8% were obese (and 91.7% obese or overweight), characteristics again that are poorly representative of patients in Europe, but have been observed elsewhere [54] . The reduced age, high frequency of obesity and only mildly reduced basal 25(OH)D levels (21 ng/mL) may have precluded the possibility to observe a clinically measurable effect of vitamin D.",

Furthermore, in these critically ill patients, physicians were under extreme pressure to rapidly make a correct diagnosis and decide on how best to treat and manage the patient. Due to time restrictions in this real-life scenario, the completion of the CCI online form may not have been appropriate and we therefore used the number of comorbidities as a measure of prognosis.",

The fact that all patients who participated in this study were na\u00efve to recent vitamin D supplementation allowed us to avoid important confounding issues, such as confounding by indication, as well as residual confounding. Despite the limited number of patients included in this analysis, both crude and propensity score-adjusted analyses display similar values in terms of OR and p-value, providing some degree of internal consistency. More important, perhaps, is that the only other similar study performed to date examining the effect of high-dose vitamin D on outcome in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [30] shows similar ORs for crude analysis.",
