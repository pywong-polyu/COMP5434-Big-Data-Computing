Fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor may appear as mass lesions with distinct borders on conventional mammography. Tumor size over 3 cm, poorly demarcated borders and microlobulated architecture favor the diagnosis of phyllodes tumor. Cystic spaces which can be demonstrated by US and T2W sequences on breast MRI can be used for the differentiation of phyllodes tumor from fibroadenoma. Post-gadolinium-enhanced MRI findings of phyllodes tumor are reported in the literature; intense enhancement with no washout represents type 1 kinetic curve [8, 9] . CESM is also a post-contrast imaging modality demonstrating the functional properties of the breast tumor similar to breast MRI. To our knowledge, this is the first report of enhancement properties of phyllodes tumor as defined by CESM. Excellent spatial resolution of mammography combined with contrast enhancement demonstrates the well-defined borders as well as cystic spaces with rim enhancement within the tumor. This appearance is highly suggestive of phyllodes tumor. We also propose that more vivid enhancement may be an indicator for malignant potential. Further case series and studies are needed to support CESM findings phyllodes tumors.",

The size of the breast increased dramatically, and lesion could even be seen easily by visual inspection. The lesion measured 8.5 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7.5 cm in diameter and was more vascular when compared with the previous examination. Ultrasonographic and color Doppler imaging examination demonstrated increased vascularization and also revealed new cystic areas (Fig. 1A, B) . On low-energy image mammography, the lesion was well circumscribed and had no calcification (Fig. 2) . On contrast-enhanced spectral mammography, solid parts of the lobulated lesion enhanced vividly with contrast. There were multiple, well-defined, non-enhancing areas representing cystic changes. Cystic areas and clefts outlined by the enhancing solid component were eccentric in location. These findings created a bubbly appearance which was a clue for phyllodes tumor (Fig. 3A, B) . We demonstrated this contrast enhancement pattern with CESM for the first time in literature. The superb spatial resolution of CESM enabled demonstration of both morphologic and metabolic properties of the phyllodes tumor in one stop shop. We performed a second Tru-Cut biopsy from this lesion prior to excision to rule out possible interval malignant transformation. On macroscopic examination of the mastectomy material, a tumor measuring 8.2 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7.5 cm was observed. On cut surface, it was relatively well-circumscribed, with vague nodular pattern, containing clefts and small cystic areas (Fig. 4A) . Upon microscopic examination, in most areas tumor had well-circumscribed borders; however, in a few foci it was noticed that it had created extensions toward the normal breast parenchyma as tongues. The tumor was comprised by long, some branching, cleft-like spaces and duct lined by an inner epithelial and outer myoepithelial cell layer. They were surrounded by a rather cellular stroma containing cells showing mild or moderate atypia and 13 mitoses were observed at 10 high power fields in the densest areas (Fig. 4B) . Ki-67 immunohistochemistry revealed a proliferative index of 40 percent. No tumor was seen at the surgical margins. The case was diagnosed as borderline phyllodes tumor due to the absence of stromal overgrowth, marked stromal cell atypia, intensive infiltrative border and/or malignant heterologous elements despite the presence of prominent mitotic activity.",
