            "text": "X-ray computed tomography (CT) is one of the most commonly used three-dimensional medical imaging modalities today. It has been refined over several decades, with the most recent innovations including dual-energy and spectral photon-counting technologies. Nevertheless, it has been discovered that waveoptical contrast mechanisms-beyond the presently used X-ray attenuation-offer the potential of complementary information, particularly on otherwise unresolved tissue microstructure. One such approach is dark-field imaging, which has recently been introduced and already demonstrated significantly improved radiological benefit in small-animal models, especially for lung diseases. Until now, however, dark-field CT could not yet be translated to the human scale and has been restricted to benchtop and small-animal systems, with scan durations of several minutes or more. This is mainly because the adaption and upscaling to the mechanical complexity, speed, and size of a human CT scanner so far remained an unsolved challenge. Here, we now report the successful integration of a Talbot-Lau interferometer into a clinical CT gantry and present dark-field CT results of a humansized anthropomorphic body phantom, reconstructed from a single rotation scan performed in 1 s. Moreover, we present our key hardware and software solutions to the previously unsolved roadblocks, which so far have kept dark-field CT from being translated from the optical bench into a rapidly rotating CT gantry, with all its associated challenges like vibrations, continuous rotation, and large field of view. This development enables clinical dark-field CT studies with human patients in the near future.",

Its versatility allows for a wide variety of applications and thus, makes it an essential tool in diagnostic imaging. For example, just recently CT imaging proved to play a crucial role in clinical practice in the fight against COVID-19 (2) . While very successful so far, present CT approaches [including the latest dual-energy and spectral approaches (3) ] generate contrast solely based on attenuation differences in the tissue. As shown recently, significant additional diagnostic potential lies in also exploiting the complementary wave nature of X-rays, which results in refraction and small-angle scattering as complementary signal channels. A range of preclinical studies has proven that particularly the small-angle scattering (usually referred to as dark-field) signal is very valuable for the diagnosis and staging of lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (4, 5) , lung fibrosis (4, 6) , pneumonia (7) , and lung cancer (8) . This is because the dark-field signal picks up complementary information on microstructural properties in lung parenchyma, which is beyond the resolution limit of presently used CT approaches (9, 10 ) and yet, does not require a higher dose than conventional CT.",

            "text": "X-ray dark-field CT, based on a grating interferometer, was originally introduced at highly brilliant synchrotron sources (11) and was then successfully translated to more readily available medical X-ray tube sources (12, 13) . There have been a number of important technical advances in fabrication of the required grating optics (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , and new data processing approaches were introduced (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . More recently, first clinical prototypes have been developed for two-dimensional radiographic grating-based X-ray imaging, again supporting strongly the significant benefit of diagnostic information, particularly for lung diseases (24) (25) (26) (27) . The implementation into a human-scale CT system for first clinical studies, however, could so far not be achieved. This is essentially due to the markedly increased technological challenges Significance X-ray computed tomography (CT) is one of the most commonly used diagnostic three-dimensional imaging modalities today. Conventionally, this noninvasive technique generates contrast by measuring the X-ray attenuation properties of different tissues. Considering the wave nature of X-rays, complementary contrast can be achieved by further measuring their small-angle scattering (dark-field) properties. This provides additional valuable diagnostic information on otherwise unresolved tissue microstructure. In our work, we have translated this wave-optical mechanism from the optical bench to a human-sized prototype CT system. This involved the integration of an interferometer into a clinical CT gantry and overcoming several associated challenges regarding vibrations, continuous gantry rotation, and large field of view. This development puts complementary X-ray contrast within reach for real-word medical applications. associated with the required large field of view for human scanning, the cylindrical interferometer geometry, and the rapidly and continuously rotating gantry. Moreover, the fast rotation times (subseconds), with all the associated vibrational instabilities, posed many so far unresolved algorithmic challenges, which have not at all been addressed with presently existing benchtop or small-animal systems featuring step and shoot acquisition and typical acquisition times of several minutes to hours (4, 26) .",

Commonly, the use of a Talbot-Lau interferometer is considered to be the most promising approach for dark-field imaging with respect to medical applications (28) . The major challenge of implementing a Talbot-Lau interferometer into a CT gantry originates from the required X-ray optical gratings, which have typical features in the micrometer range and yet, must be arranged precisely over the full field of view. Other than the challenges regarding grating fabrication and mounting, their fine periods make the system extremely sensitive to drifts and vibrations, which are immanent as a CT gantry is a fast-rotating platform. While the gantry (i.e., the rotating part of the system) is decoupled from the surroundings by an air bearing (29) , it still carries several vibrating components like pumps and the X-ray tube with a quickly rotating anode (30) .",

Gratings G0 and G1 are close to each other, and G2 is positioned on the opposite side of the bore. This allows for good use of the available space on the gantry and still retains the original CT bore diameter of 70 cm for the patient. The distances L and d, as well as the grating specifications, have been optimized to the setup-specific geometry and X-ray spectrum in Fresnel propagation-based simulations for maximum fringe visibility, which is a key performance parameter for dark-field imaging (15) . Contrary to common Talbot-Lau interferometers, which use a rectangular G1 design, our simulation results in Fig.  1C show superior performance for a G1 grating with a triangular profile (32) . Moreover, the simulations also reveal that, compared with common laboratory setups, the relatively large focal spot size of a medical high-performance X-ray source leads to significantly tighter tolerances for positioning and grating periods. As shown in Fig. 1D , deviations in the G 1 period on the nanometer scale or deviations in the inter-grating distance L on the submillimeter scale will cause a significant visibility loss. The presented simulations use a source size of 1.1 mm. For high stability and precise positioning, special grating mounts shown in Fig. 1 E and F have been developed. The curvature of these mounts focuses into the X-ray source spot, which adapts the interferometer to the extremely divergent beam geometry (33) . This requires bending of the gratings as they are manufactured on a flat substrate.",

The grating G2 is installed directly in front of the detector as shown in Fig. 1 B and F and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 . The largest component of the interferometer is the G2 grating, which must cover about 80 cm of arc length in order to support a field of view of 45 cm. Gratings of such size can currently only be combined from several smaller tiles, as shown in Fig. 1F and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 . This increases the complexity of the system because all individual gratings must be carefully aligned to each other, but this allows replacement of tiles if required. Optimization and Characterization Procedure Due to the typical energies used in clinical CT systems (80 to 120 kVp), the fabrication of the fine grating structures for a Talbot-Lau interferometer is extremely difficult, as very high absorbing structures (> 200 \u00b5m) yet with feature sizes of a few micrometers are required. Even though gold is used as the absorber material because of its high X-ray absorption crosssection, the fine periodic lines must still exhibit a height of more than 200 \u00b5m for reasonable performance. For fabrication of such high-aspect ratio structures, we chose the deep X-ray LIGA (German for \"Lithographie, Galvanik, Abformung\") process (14, 34) , as it outperforms silicon etchingbased methods (aspect ratios < 80) (18, 35) and is applicable to grating substrates suitable for bending (16, 17, 33) . In Fig. 2A , an example of a 280-\u00b5m-high grating structure with an aspect ratio exceeding 100 demonstrates the most recent LIGA fabrication results. In order to closely monitor and improve the fabrication process at this level and to ensure coverage of the whole detector surface with sufficient grating quality and low defect rate, we have developed a dedicated angular X-ray transmission (AXT) analysis, which extends the standard quality control process (36) .",

Since these areas do not contribute to the required field of view, they do not affect the overall system performance. Recent advances in the fabrication process now allow for manufacturing G0 and G1 in the required dimensions and small bending radii, which reduce potential errors during assembly and increase the stability. However, the much larger G2 must still be combined from multiple separate tiles, which is realized by a specialized modular mount. It allows us to combine and adjust the bent grating tiles inside the gantry with a gap size comfortably below 100 \u00b5m and to maintain a continuous phase across the tiles at the same time to avoid stitching artifacts (17) . An example is presented in a high-resolution transmission image of a stitching gap in Fig. 2B , where the red line indicates the continuous period.",

The intensity variation across the detector is a desired effect, which optimizes the applied radiation dose. While usually achieved with a bowtie filter in conventional clinical CT, here it is caused by partial shadowing of the X-ray beam in G 0, which increases toward larger fan angles from the center of the detector. Due to the large source spot size and the small acceptance angle of the high-aspect ratio G0, an increasing fraction of the radiation traverses the grating structure nonperpendicularly and thus, is attenuated. Additionally, this leads to a degeneration of the slit sources for larger fan angles (i.e., where the X-ray source spot is larger) (30) . This effect leads to a visibility decrease toward the left and right as can be seen in the visibility image in Fig. 2F . Nevertheless, the most important central region performs well with a maximum visibility of 26% in the center, which is close to the simulation results shown In SI Appendix, Fig. S3 , a rendering is shown to visualize the high aspect ratio. (B) Highresolution X-ray microscopy of a G 2 stitching gap between two tiles. (C-E) Quality evaluation of the G 0 , G 1 , and an example G 2 tile using AXT analysis. The shape factor is a measure directly correlated to the quality of the grating. The factor is zero for perfectly rectangular gratings (G 0 and G 2 ) and one for perfectly triangular gratings like G 1 . The G 2 tiles have consistent quality and only minor defects. G 0 and G 1 are mostly of fine quality, with defects toward the left and right edges. These defects are tolerable as the layout width is slightly larger than necessary. (F) Sample free projection data show the typical Moir\u00e9 fringes in the raw data. By processing of the raw data, intensity and visibility images are generated. Visibility directly correlates to the performance of the interferometer, and the measured peak visibility of up to 30% is a good result considering the hard X-ray spectrum of 80 kVp. A plot of the column mean visibility is shown in SI Appendix, in Fig. 1 . Including the outer regions, where the visibility drop due to the partial shadowing in G0 reduces the performance (a plotted version is in SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ), the mean visibility of the interferometer is around 20%.",

Note that the fringe phase changes by 2\u03c0 if any of the gratings are moved relative to the others by its full period. Mechanical parts, such as fans, the cooling system, and the anode drive, cause vibrations of the interferometer, which induce the observed oscillation of the fringes. While this frequency is defined by the exciting mechanical components, the resulting amplitude is configurable by the stiffness of the grating mounts. Fig. 2H shows an analysis of the oscillation over one full rotation. In addition to the highfrequency oscillation, a slow phase change coupled to the angular position of the gantry is observed. This low-frequency phase change is identical in every rotation and originates presumably from deformations of the system caused by gantry imbalance as well as the centrifugal and gravitational forces.",

Therefore, all so far developed processing methods cannot be applied since they cannot, for example, deal correctly with local intensity variations, which are among the major cause of artifacts we found during development of this dark-field CT system. We, therefore, developed an algorithmic approach for the data processing, which can cope with the various challenges laid out above. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A and C, we analyze a sample free reference scan to extract scan-to-scan persistent system characteristics, such as the mean performance, and use linear combinations of correction arrays to model the fluctuations in intensity, visibility, and phase in each individual detector reading. Fig. 3A lists the different reference processing steps, and Fig. 3B shows the resulting system characteristics. The only information that is not scan-to-scan persistent is the highfrequency component (around 175 Hz) of the correction array coefficients, which are plotted in Fig. 3E as an example for the three intensity correction arrays. Only the low-frequency component, plotted in orange, is persistent among different scans, and therefore, further extensions are necessary during the sample processing.",

The subsequent tomographic reconstruction with filtered back projection (FBP) (37) shown in Fig. 3 I and J is now free of vibration-induced artifacts. The remaining low-frequency noise-like structures in the dark-field image are due to motion artifacts. With more advanced processing methods, this artifact can be effectively suppressed (22) . All scans presented in this paper are single-rotation axial scans measured at 1 s rotation time. Since the gantry rotates continuously, a sliding window approach (19) is applied for the signal extraction. While vibrations in an interferometer generally only cause difficulties, our setup actually leverages the induced high-frequency phase variation. As demonstrated in Fig. 2H , the vibration guarantees relatively adequate phase sampling over at least 1.5\u03c0 within comparably small window sizes of only 10 projections. If this intrinsic phase oscillation was absent, we would require an actuator to displace one grating during the scan, similar to a regular phase-stepping approach (11) .

            "text": "The Principle of Talbot-Lau Interferometry. An X-ray grating interferometer is used to measure X-ray attenuation, refraction, and small-angle scattering simultaneously (12, 13) . The gratings are patterns composed of many parallel absorbing lines at a fixed periodicity (14, 16, 17) . Grating G 1 introduces a fine intensity modulation on the incident radiation with a periodicity in the range of a few micrometers. To resolve this line pattern, a highly absorbing analyzer grating G 2 is positioned in front of the detector. Hence, the subpixel-sized intensity modulation is converted by the Moir\u00e9 effect to a low-frequency fringe pattern resolvable by the detector. An additional source grating G 0 splits the radiation from an incoherent X-ray source into many slit sources, which fulfill the coherence requirement for this method (12) . Attenuation of the radiation by the sample causes a decrease of intensity, while refraction and small-angle scattering induce small distortions and contrast change of the generated fringe pattern, respectively. SI Appendix, Fig. S1 shows a simplified illustration of the interaction processes. The conventional signal extraction method involves the recording of the so-called stepping curve, where one of the gratings is precisely moved in multiple steps over one period (11) . A comparison of two stepping curves acquired with and without a sample in the beam path allows us to extract the attenuating, scattering, and phase-shifting properties of the measured object (11, 13) . In a rotating gantry, the controlled movement of gratings is not feasible because instabilities, like centrifugal forces and system vibrations, perturb the system. Therefore, we use the presented alternative signal extraction approach, which involves the modeling of all grating movements in the measured data.",

The AXT analysis method used for grating characterization provides spatially resolved mapping of several grating parameters and was originally proposed for rectangular, high-aspect ratio absorption gratings (36) . However, it is also applicable to our phase grating G 1 considering two aspects. First, the triangular G 1 height profile is obtained by the projection of inclined lamellae and not by triangular-shaped grating structures. Second, the limitation of the method to high-aspect ratio absorption gratings was avoided by using a low energy spectrum of 30 kVp. For a structure height of approximately 18.5 \u03bcm, this yields sufficient contrast in the AXT measurements. The shape factor is calculated from the period and the duty cycle as well as the lamellae height and inclination relative to the substrate. It hence represents a suitable quality measure, indicating a degree of lamellae inclination. Perfectly rectangular lamellae are described by a value of zero. If the lamellae are tilted such that the projection perpendicular to the substrate yields a triangular height profile, the shape factor is one.",

The absorption X-ray gratings G 0 and G 2 produced for this setup via the LIGA process consist of fine lamellae oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface (14) . On flat substrates, the high-aspect ratio gratings hence only work as intended in a parallel-beam geometry. In divergent-beam geometry, the incident angle of the rays varies, and due to the height of the absorbing structures, partial absorption leads to intensity and visibility loss. Only X-rays crossing the grating perpendicular to the substrate surface are not affected by shadowing. Consequently, a solution to suppress the shadowing artifact in fan beam geometry is to bend the grating, such that the focal spot of the lamellae coincides with the X-ray source spot (33) . In SI Appendix, Fig. S3 , a rendering visualizes the high aspect ratio and the bending process of the G 0 . With this approach, the usable field of view can be extended while still using high-aspect ratio gratings (50) . To achieve small bending radii, flexible substrate materials, such as graphite and polyimide, replaced fragile silicon and glass substrates. For the used one-dimensional grating structures, cylindrical bending of the gratings is sufficient to reduce the shadowing artifact.",

In the presented system, the interferometer performance and characteristic vibration patterns are stable over time and thus, are also present in sample scans. For example, the intensity fluctuations follow a certain frequency, amplitude, and pattern. Since the same pattern also appears with the same frequency and amplitude in a following sample scan, its contribution can be corrected during sample processing and reconstruction. A correction solely based on the sample scan would not be possible because differentiation between intensity fluctuation and sample data would be difficult and might lead to cross-talk. During reference processing, the challenge lies in efficiently identifying and separating the occurring patterns in a way that is correctable during sample processing. As shown in Fig. 3A , the reference processing is a multistep approach that optimizes the measured data to the Talbot-Lau interferometry data model. It starts with a standard signal extraction (i.e., phase retrieval), which yields the interferometer intensity I 0 , visibility V 0 , and phase P 0 . While in this early step, the results are greatly corrupted by the vibrations, this result is an initial guess for following steps.",

A window of several consecutive projections is converted to a single intensity and visibility projection located at the center of the processed set of projections. To minimize motion artifacts (i.e., visible in Fig. 3J as low-frequency noise-like structures) due to the effect that the projection angle changes in subsequent projections, the window size needs to be small. On the other hand, the window should be sufficiently large to ensure good phase sampling over ideally 2\u03c0. At this point, our setup leverages the highfrequency phase variation from Fig. 2H . The oscillation guarantees adequate phase sampling over at least 1.5\u03c0 within a sufficiently small window size of only 10 projections. If the intrinsic vibrations of the setup would not be in the required range, either an actuator or further stabilization of the setup would be required. Since this approach combines multiple projections to one, the resolution of the tomographic reconstruction is reduced because particularly sharp edges are difficult to recover in this process without any artifacts. However, this drawback is accepted as the loss in resolution is insignificant and spatial resolution is currently not the primary objective. From a computational perspective, the method is advantageous because it is an extremely fast signal extraction method as it is a linear problem, which can be solved analytically.",

The dark-field signal strength depends on the feature size of the small-angle scattering structures as well as on several system-specific parameters, like the interferometer sensitivity or the X-ray spectrum (9) . Essentially, the reconstructed values can be calibrated to what we refer to as HUd. Similar to the attenuation Hounsfield scale, this should ensure a quantitative consistency between different dark-field CT systems (4). We select neoprene foam and air as reference calibration materials. The neoprene is a suitable material to model the microstructure of lung alveoli (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ) (38) , featuring a very weak attenuation but strong dark-field signal. However, further evaluation on long-term stability is required by future work. The HUd scale is defined by a value of 1,000 for neoprene as a strongly scattering material and a value of 0 for air and every other nonscattering material. This gives a similar image impression as attenuation images since regions with lower scattering density are darker. Especially for imaging of the lung, the use of positive numbers for HUd ensures a clear differentiation to the attenuation Hounsfield units, which are mostly negative for lung tissue. In contrast to radiography dark-field systems, the presented CT implementation and subsequent signal calibration enable quantitative imaging. While radiography systems come with image obstruction from the ribs and varying anatomical shape of the chest or lung, which can make evaluation difficult, this problem is solved by our system. The tomographic reconstruction and proposed calibration make sure that the signal strength is reproducible and free of overlapping structures.",

The presented implementation uses 32 detector lines and covers more than 90% of the original detector columns. This results in a reconstruction volume that is 450 mm in diameter. Extending the setup to 64 and more detector lines is possible by upgrading to G 2 gratings with more coverage.",

Here, we introduce local intensity fluctuation corrections and information compression using PCA. (B) Interferometer performance and correction array results from reference processing. (C) The sample processing pipeline based on sliding window processing. As the high-frequency oscillations differ from the reference scan, we use an optimization step to identify the optimal linear combination of the correction arrays to estimate the current sample free fringe parameters and thus, to suppress vibration artifacts. (D) Results of the correction coefficient optimization using prior knowledge from the reference scan. (E) Coefficients of the three intensity correction arrays. The angular positiondependent drift (orange) is scan-to-scan consistent and can be utilized as prior knowledge in the correction optimization step. (F) Threedimensional scatterplot of the three intensity correction coefficients after subtraction of the low-frequency component shown in E. A correlation can be observed, which can also be used during the optimization step as prior knowledge. (G and H) Attenuation and dark-field FBP reconstructions after conventional sliding window processing, respectively. Both modalities suffer from vibration artifacts, as the high frequency is not corrected during processing. (I and J) Attenuation and dark-field FBP reconstruction after extended processing, respectively, which successfully removes vibration artifacts, giving a clearer reconstruction in both modalities.
