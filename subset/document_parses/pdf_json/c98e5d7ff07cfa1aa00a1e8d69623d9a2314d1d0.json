Identification of risk factors for predicting the mental health is capable of reducing psychological distress among medical graduate students. Therefore, the aim of the study was to identify potential risk factors relating to mental health and further create a novel prediction model to calculate the risk of mental distress among medical graduate students. Methods: This study collected and analyzed 1079 medical graduate students via an online questionnaire. Included participants were randomly classified into a training group and a validation group. A model was developed in the training group and validation of the model was performed in the validation group. The predictive performance of the model was assessed using the discrimination and calibration.",

The model was developed using the six variables, including the year of study, type of student, daily research time, monthly income, scientific learning style, and feeling of time stress. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and calibration slope for the model were 0.70 and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.65~1.15) in the training group, respectively, and 0.66 and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.51~1.09) in the validation group, respectively. Conclusions: The study identified six risk factors for predicting anxiety and depression and successfully created a prediction model. The model may be a useful tool that can identify the mental status among medical graduate students.",

A global prevalence of depression among medical students was up to 28.0% [2] and the prevalence of anxiety was 33.8% among medical students, which is significantly higher than the general population [3] . Moreover, a recent study reported a high prevalence of depression (29%) and anxiety (21%) among Chinese medical students [4] . All these data alarmed that a large number of medical students around the world were experiencing severe mental distress which could impair their psychosocial functioning, physical health, professional and academic performance, and ultimately cause serious consequences including divorce, crime, self-harm, and suicide tendency [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Meanwhile, a large body of literature revealed that mental distress was the largest cost driver of the global economic burden of non-communicable diseases [10] . Therefore, it is an urgent issue to find causes, preventions, and solutions to mental distress.",

As it indicated in recent studies, medical students were at high risks of mental distress, which were contributed to severe academic, psychological, and emotional stress, including academic demands, workload, pressure from teachers and parents, financial burden and worry about the future [11] [12] [13] . Mental distress, including depression and anxiety, can be evaluated by the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), to name just a few. However, the above scales were primarily used to evaluate the mental status of the general population by professional medical workers. In addition, although these scales were beneficial in measuring and diagnosing mental distress, they cannot predict the occurrence of unhealthy mental status in advance. Notably, a previous study indicated that the role of inadequate self-awareness about one's mental health concerns was a barrier to reaching out for professional help [14] . It highlighted the importance of expanding the range of factors beyond commonly studied concepts like the demand-control model and the effort-reward imbalance model [15] .",

After discussion, we revised and further improved the questionnaire based on valuable suggestions. The online questionnaire was distributed through the instant communication tools, including telephone messages, emails, Opening I CQ [Seek You] (OICQ) software, and WeChat software, via a nonprobability snowball sampling strategy [16] focusing on recruiting medical graduate students all around China. The initial participants (seeds) in this snowball sampling were medical graduate and postgraduate students with good academic performance. In detail, the majority of them were working and studying in the Peking Union Medical College, Xiangya School of Medicine, and West China Medical Center, all of which had a great reputation in the medical field of China. Besides, they had long-term scientific contacts with the researchers. We stopped the survey a month later after collecting enough participants since the sample was not increasing at that time and enough participants were collected. Moreover, during the investigation, notably, we did not take financial compensation strategies to attract participants to take part in the survey because this might contribute to selection bias. Participants were totally voluntarily to take part in the survey. Informed consents were obtained from all participants before completing the questionnaire.",

An AUROC of more than 0.7 indicates good predictive performance and 0.8 or above indicates excellent predictive performance. Furthermore, the discrimination ability of the formula was evaluated by the discrimination slope that was defined as the difference between the mean predicted risk probability with and without mental distress among medical students. We plotted deciles of the predicted probability of severe mental distress against the observed risk of severe mental distress in each decile and fitted a smooth line. Ideally, the slope of the fitted smooth line would be close to 1 and intercepts close to 0. Besides, the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used to evaluate the formula's calibration ability.

To better understand the sample characteristics, we compared the age and other basic characteristics of the sample with the general populations of medical students in China [23, 24] and there were no significant difference. The 1015 participants were used to develop and internally validate the formula which was simple and convenient since it consisted of six variables, including the year of study, type of student, daily research time, monthly income, scientific learning style, and feeling of time stress. All these included variables were readily available and accessible. After internal validation, the formula's good discrimination and calibration ability was confirmed according to the results. The P-value of the Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test was 0.97, which showed that the formula could be a relatively reliable prediction model among medical graduate students. We further divided participants into the low risk (0.00%~9.99%), the moderate risk (10.00%~19.99%), and the high risk (20.00%~) groups based on the predicted probability of the developed model. Participants in the high-risk group had an actual probability of severe mental distress of 29.19%, thus psychological counseling was recommended in those participants. The LASSO method was used to select potential risk factors in this study. Compared with other logistic regression models, it is a popular modelbuilding procedure that shrinks a subset of coefficients to zero and could perform variable selection and estimation simultaneously [25] . Over the past decades, it was not uncommon to see that medical graduate students committed suicide due to mental distress, causing much grief and loss to society and their families. Studies have attempted to explore normative or specific (ideographic) prediction models that are available for individuals. Allen et al. [26] developed a short-term prediction model of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, but it was applied to adolescents. Kyron et al. [27] found that short-term fluctuations in selfreported mental health may indicate when an individual is at risk of self-harm. However, the final model in that study only showed acceptable predictive performance when standard logistic regression was performed, with slightly lower sensitivity (71.4%), specificity (77.8%), and positive predictive value (23.9%) statistics. Khazanov et al. [28] conducted a study on the role of distress in predicting treatment outcomes of depression and found that assessing distress before treatment may help determine which patients would benefit most from adding cognitive therapy to antidepressant medications.",

If a professional-oriented student (2 points) was in the third year (3 points), spent 6 to 10 h (2 points) on scientific research daily with a monthly income of less than 1000 CNY (1 point), and had a mild feelings of time stress (2 points), and his or her scientific learning style was guiding by others (1 point), then the predicted probability of severe mental distress was: P(Y = 1) = e x / (1+ e x )= e \u22121.76 / (1+ e \u22121.76 ) =10.00%, (x = \u2212 5.06 + 0.20* 3 + 0.44*2 + 0.51*2-0.28* 1 + 0.30*1 + 0.39*2 = \u22121.76). It meant that there was a 10% probability that the student might suffer from severe mental distress and this student can be regarded as a moderate risk of severe mental distress according to our classifications.",

The snowball sampling, widely used in crosssectional studies, is a chain-referral method where initial participants (seeds) recruit others from their social network. But the snowball sampling and the media coverage cannot provide the actual number of the total participants that the survey reached and thus the response rate was not clear to us. Both the Cronbach's \u03b1 of the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 revealed the psychological evaluation was reliable in this study, but the reliability of the other parts of the questionnaire still needs to be improved by a deliberate selection of more comprehensive potential predictors of mental distress. As previous researches indicated, mental distress might be affected by gender [32] . Moreover, the influence of personality traits also played an important role in mental health among medical staff [33] . All these variables warranted further consideration and exploration in the future. In addition, the formula still needs external validation while an internal validation was performed in this study. Finally, we surveyed during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the study has shown that the pandemic may also affect individuals' mental health [34] , thus the formula's applicability in non-pandemic time needs further investigations.",
