It was organized and hosted by the International Association for Intelligent Biology and Medicine (IAIBM), the University of Pennsylvania, and the Temple University on August 9-10, 2020. The conference was originally scheduled to be located in Philadelphia and was eventually transformed into a virtual conference held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The conference received seventy-five full-length original manuscript submissions. Each manuscript went through a rigorous review process and was peer-reviewed by at least three technical program committee members. Forty-one submissions were accepted and presented in four live sessions over Zoom, and the conference attracted ~ 300 attendees. In this special issue, ten high-quality manuscripts were selected to represent the medical informatics and decision making aspect of the conference. These ten articles went through the second round of peer-review and revision in the BMC Supplement submission system before their final acceptance to this ICIBM 2020 supplement issue. Of note, eight articles [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] are included here (Part I of the special issue), while the other two articles [9, 10] will be included in the Part II of the special issue scheduled to appear in 2021. Below we briefly summarize these ten selected manuscripts.",

Specifically, the authors proposed to use Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) resources, coupled with machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) approaches, to predict the risk of mortality. They implemented rule-based feature engineering and knowledge-guided deep learning approaches and trained a knowledge-guided convolutional neural network (CNN) model with word embeddings and UMLS Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) entity embeddings. The comparative study with a few competing methods was performed on the data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and demonstrated the promise of the proposed method. The results indicate that machine learning models along with NLP of clinical notes provide powerful tools to help doctors predict mortality in critically ill diabetic patients.",

This study compared three NLP software tools CLAMP, cTAKES, and MetaMap, which are among the most widely used tools in the field. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was used as a case study for the comparison. In the test bed, the authors collected 821 ASD-related terms from the literature as the benchmark for evaluation, and then extracted ASD-specific vocabulary from 544 full-text articles and 20,408 abstracts of PubMed and followed by semantic type filtering. For F1 measure, CLAMP performed the best and followed by cTAKES and then Meta-Map. In addition, CLAMP yielded much higher precision than cTAKES and MetaMap, while cTAKES and Meta-Map had higher recall than CLAMP. The findings provide valuable guideline for future application of these tools.",

First, the authors expanded the ShARe Semantic Schema to support the representation of age, temporal and family history information. Second, they applied this annotation schema on the 2014 ShARe eHealth Challenge corpus, and captured valuable new information under the new age and temporal information classes. Third, they developed a prototype rule-based NLP system to extract clinical events with age and temporal mentions, which yielded promising results. An interesting future direction is to develop a hybrid rule-based and deep learning NLP system. In short, the proposed annotation schema and NLP system is able to encode historical events from clinical notes, which is expected to provide valuable information to support clinical and translational research studies.",

They presented a conceptual framework to analyze the needs for rapid response and the involved users as well as their workflow. To match the user and the Automated External Debrillators (AEDs), they used Bipartite Matching and Integer Linear Programming. Given the high time complexity of these two methods, they further proposed a new method called Preprocessed Integer Linear Programming. Empirical studies were performed on the simulated data, and demonstrated greatly improved efficiency of the proposed method, which indicated its potential to allow matching of users with AEDs in real-time during cardiac emergency.",

This model is named as Pattern Attention model with Value Embedding (PAVE), which has the following strengths. First, it takes into account real-value medical events by embedding the values into vectors, without needing to impute the missing values. Second, based on attention mechanisms, PAVE can use the attention weights to interpret the model's clinical outputs at both the event pattern level and the single event level. Extensive empirical studies on two real-world electronic health record (EHR) datasets demonstrated the improved prediction performance of PAVE over the state-of-the-art competing methods, as well as its capability for detection of many medical event patterns with high contribution rates to mortality and sepsis onset. In short, PAVE provides a promising method for interpretable clinical risk prediction from the EHR data.",

ECG signals are often corrupted by low-frequency baseline wander (BW) artifact, which may lead to faulty interpretations. Wavelet transform has been shown to be among the most effective method for BW removals. This paper went one step further and performed a comparative study of different wavelets in their ability to remove the baseline errors and preserve the original signal. Daubechies-3 and Sym-3 wavelets were found to have the best performance. These findings could facilitate future real-time processing of streaming ECG signals for clinical decision support systems.",
