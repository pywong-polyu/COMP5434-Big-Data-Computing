Lots of efforts and resources have been devoted in the last year to develop vaccines and new therapeutics in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection [2, 3] . Several vaccines such as mRNA-1273 [4] , BNT162b2 [5] , AZD1222 [6] , Sputnik V [7] , Ad26 [8] and NVX-CoV2373 [9] have proven to be safe and efficacious against the viral agent and have recently been approved by the regulatory agencies for emergency use. Thanks to these developments, large-scale vaccine administration is now ongoing throughout the world.",

We performed in silico mutagenesis experiments and predicted the impacts of mutations in the spike protein on its stability and on its affinity for nAbs and for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), known to be the SARS-CoV-2 entry point into the cells. We validated these predictions on viral variants for which experimental, epidemiological or clinical data have been obtained, and especially on the variants that are emerging and rapidly spreading to become prevalent genotypes. Our predictions are of utmost importance to help monitor the future evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and to identify the emergent strains whose spread will have to be limited via either the design of new vaccines or new mitigation measures.",

To quantitatively describe the viral fitness landscape, we developed a simplified model in which we focused on the spike protein. This protein, which protrudes from the virus surface, is a crucial component of the infection, as its binding to the ACE2 receptor of the host mediates the entry of the virus into the host's cells. The binding affinity of the spike protein for ACE2 has thus been related to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity [41] . The stability properties of the spike protein itself are another key element in the viral infection which has been related to the viral transmissibility between hosts [40] .",

We mimicked the effect of the immune system on the SARS-CoV-2 virus through a set of 31 nAb/spike protein complexes contained in the dataset D nAb (see Section 2.1). We observed that these nAbs target exclusively the RBD of the spike protein and that the epitopes cover almost the entire RBD surface, as shown in Figure 1 . It is interesting to note that the epitopes targeted by the majority of these nAbs are situated in or close to the RBD region that binds to ACE2, as seen from comparing Figure 1a and Figure 1b ; these epitopes are thus likely to be immunodominant. A recent investigation suggests that RBD-binding antibodies are the major contributors of the neutralizing activity in convalescent human plasma [19, 27] . This justifies our approximation of considering the nAbs of the set D nAb as representative of the immune response. The ensemble of epitope residues targeted by at least one nAb and less then ten nAbs of the D nAb set are in light pink spheres, those targeted by ten or more nAbs are in dark pink spheres and the other, non-epitope, residues are in blue. The list of epitope residues and ACE2 binding sites can be found in our GitHub repository (https: //github.com/3BioCompBio/SpikeProSARS-CoV-2/blob/main/Structures/Epitope.dat, accessed on 10 April 2021). The SARS-CoV-2 fitness, defined qualitatively on the basis of its efficiency to produce infectious progeny [37] , is complicated to define quantitatively [38] . It depends in a complex manner on a series of features, among which the transmissibility of the virus between hosts, the infectivity of the host and the ability of the virus to escape from the host's immune response [39] . We thus approximated the global SARS-CoV-2 fitness \u03a6 as a product of three fitness contributions \u03c6 S , \u03c6 ACE2 and \u03c6 nAb , which describe the transmissibility, infectivity and escape features, respectively (Equations (1)-(4)). In addition, we focused exclusively on the impact of variants of the spike protein. We estimated the three fitness contributions \u03c6 S , \u03c6 ACE2 and \u03c6 nAb in terms of the change in folding free energy upon mutation of the spike protein (\u2206\u2206G S ), the change of its binding affinity for ACE2 (\u2206\u2206G ACE2 ) and the change of its binding affinity for a set of nAbs (\u2206\u2206G nAb ), using statistical physics-based approaches and more specifically the PoPMuSiC [34] and BeAtMuSiC [35] algorithms, as detailed in Sections 2.2-2.4. Note that the effect of multiple mutations on the fitness were considered as independent and thus simply multiplied (Equation (4)).",

Thus, this prediction as well as all the predictions presented in the following sections are truly blind predictions. It is instructive to analyze the localization of the variants fixed through viral evolution in the 3D structure of the spike protein. The mean values of R i in the core (solvent accessibility <20%), in partially buried regions (20-50%) and at the surface (>50%) are equal to 0.06, 0.06 and 0.23, respectively. This indicates that variants that became fixed are mainly situated in solvent-exposed regions, where they can play a key role in modulating binding with other biomolecules. Variants in buried or partially buried regions are less We also compared our stability predictions with results of molecular dynamics and nanomechanical simulations, which identified three protein segments as strongly contributing to the RBD stability, i.e., (A348-A352), (F400-R403) and (N450-R454) [47] . We found that the value of \u2206\u2206G S i averaged over all possible point mutations inserted in these three segments is equal to (1.0, 2.1, 1.4 ) kcal/mol, respectively, and the corresponding fitness contribution \u03c6 S i to (0.7, 0.5, 0.6). The strongly destabilizing effects of mutations predicted in these three regions indicate that they are particularly optimized for stability, in agreement with [47] . This result further supports the ability of our approach to properly capture the stability properties of the spike protein.",

Low percentages identify variants that escape much more from nAbs than the wild type virus and high percentages, variants that only weakly affect the wild-type spike protein/nAbs affinity. We predicted correctly 18 out of the 22 variants as having \u03c6 nAb fitness values greater than one; the last four variants have \u03c6 nAb \u223c 0.9. Detailed results are reported in Table 1 for the five variants shown to have the broadest in vitro neutralizing spectrum [17] . Our results reproduce quite well the in vitro trends: variants that are likely to escape from at least some nAbs tend to have fitness values larger than one. Note, moreover, that the antibodies tested in [17] are different from the nAbs of our D nAb set. Because of that, we did not expect such a good match between the experiments and our predictions.

This variant quickly became dominant after its appearance in early 2020 [40, 54] . We correctly predicted a substantial increase in fitness for this variant with respect to wild type, which is driven by an increased stability of the spike protein (\u03c6 S D614G = 3.7). We hypothesize that this stabilization leads to a higher person-to-person viral transmissibility, as also suggested in [40, 54, 55] and observed in vivo [55] . In the latter study, a stabilization of the spike protein was measured upon D614G substitution via a strengthening of the S1-S2 subunit interactions, where S1 is the receptor binding subunit containing the RBD and S2 is the membrane fusion subunit. In contrast, this variant was shown to alter neither the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 nor the antibody neutralization, as it is situated outside the RBD [55] . We also correctly reproduced this result, with fitness values of \u03c6 ACE2 D614G = 1.0 = \u03c6 nAb D614G ( Table 2 ). The overall predicted fitness is thus \u03a6 D614G = 3.7.",

Our results predict an increase in transmissibility (\u03c6 S A222V \u2248 \u03c6 S P681H \u2248 2.0), but to a lesser extent than D614G. Experimental data are in agreement with the weaker impacts of these variants on the spike protein fitness and the viral transmissibility compared to D614G [56, 57] . The A222V variant has been related to the large outbreaks in Europe in early summer 2020, while P681H is associated to the so-called UK lineage (B.1.1.7) that appeared in UK in late 2020 and is now becoming dominant in Europe in the current outbreaks. Finally, N501Y is also a widely spread variant appearing in all major lineages, i.e., UK (B.1.1.7), Brazilian (P.1) and South African (B.1.351) lineages. We predicted this variant as having a high overall fitness \u03a6 due to a combination of increased fitness contributions \u03c6 S N501Y and \u03c6 ACE2 N501Y , but a \u03c6 nAb N501Y =1. In other words, we predicted this variant to be more transmissible and infectious than the wild type but to have no impact on the response of the human immune system. More precisely, we predicted N501Y as improving the stability of the spike protein RBD and its binding affinity for ACE2; the latter property is also suggested by another computational study [58] . No clinical data suggest that N501Y is able to evade the post-vaccination immune response [59] ; this tends to support our prediction results. Table 2 .

Indeed, such bias could potentially cause a trivial increase in fitness upon evolution and lead to erroneous interpretations. To check this, we created 2 \u00d7 10 6 viral strains by inserting either three or five random mutations in the wild-type spike protein and assumed that they became fixed with probability one independently of their fitness value; the number of random mutations was chosen based on the average number of single variants per strain in the GISAID database [46] which is between three and four. We then computed the fitness \u03a6 for all these random variant strains. On the other hand, we plotted the \u03a6 distribution of the real variant strains observed in the GISAID database. The fitness distribution of the two simulated strains and of the real viral strain are completely different, as shown in Figure 7 . Indeed, when three or five random mutations are inserted in the spike protein, the \u03a6 distributions have a median value of 0.32 and 0.12, respectively; moreover, 79% and 86% of the mutated strains have a lower overall fitness \u03a6 than the wild-type virus. In contrast, the distribution of real strains has a median of 4.8 and basically all the strains (99.5%) have a predicted fitness higher than the wild type. In summary, random strains show a fitness distribution that peaks at a value of zero, in contrast to the real viral strains whose fitness distribution is much more extended, reaching values of more than 10. This confirms that the high fitness values that we predict are not due to unwanted biases of any kind, and that one cannot obtain fitness values as high as those of variants observed in real strains just by considering random mutations. This last analysis further supports the unbiased nature and validity of our computational approach. Table 2 : List of the five most widely observed variants with their predicted fitnesses. In the first column there is the variants, in the second their occurrences in the GISAID database, in the third, fourth and fifth column the fitness related to the stability, binding and escaping from the host immune systems and in the last column the total fitness values of the variants.

In particular, we did not take into account possible amino acid deletions or insertions in the spike protein, although they have been proven to influence viral fitness. For example, the deletions \u220669-70 and \u2206144-145 in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, found in different lineages, have been associated to an increase in human-to-human viral transmission and to altered antigenicity [21, 64] . It would also be interesting to take into account epistatic effects. Indeed, while more and more variants become fixed, interactions between them are expected to become non-negligible. The model should also be extended to other proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus such as the non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) which also contributes to immune evasion [65] , rather than considering the spike protein only. Finally, when more nAbs/spike protein complexes will be resolved at high resolution, they will enrich our set D nAb and better describe the B-cell receptor repertoire. Considering a weighted combination of the effects of RBD variants on all nAbs depending on different factors such as time and vaccination status would further improve our method in mimicking the immune response and its temporal evolution.",

Predicting viral evolution trough S-protein fitness244 h i In this section we apply our prediction method to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We start by predicting with SpikePro the viral fitness for all the about 6.7 \u21e510 5 SARS-CoV-2 strains collected in GISAID from December 2019 till March 2021. We then divided them according to their month of collection and compute their averaged predicted fitnesses.",
