With various negative economic and financial effects (see References [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ), COVID-19 also has several other consequences in people's lives, such as fear and depression [11, 12] , suicide trends [13] or in mental health [14, 15] .",

Until this day, Portugal has had a total of 805,140 cases. Intending to analyze the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 in the different Portuguese districts, we considered only the information which is registered in Portuguese mainland districts due to the availability of data about mobility. In total, the number of cases of the districts is 775,954. All the data were transformed in daily incidence for each district to perform the correlational analysis with the information from Google CMR. In these reports, it is possible to retrieve information about six distinct mobility indices: (i) retail and recreation (I1); (ii) groceries and pharmacies (I2), (iii) parks (I3), (iv) transit stations (I4), (v) workplaces (I5) and (vi) residential areas (I6).

The information about the number of cases and the number of observations for each district are identified in Table 1 . Moreover, as some districts present missing information for some indices, the correlations were calculated for the remainder, where data are available. To perform our correlational analysis, we use the detrended cross-correlation analysis coefficient (\u03c1DCCA), proposed by Reference [33] and derived from the work of Reference [34] .

Considering the multiscale feature of the measure and the temporal dynamics, a tri-dimensional analysis could be made. The information could be represented in different dimensions, as we can see in Figure A1 , Appendix A. There, the results for Portugal as a whole are available, considering the correlation between the retail and recreation index and new COVID-19 cases, in three panels.

In the very short run (lower timescales) the correlation coefficients are relatively high, meaning that mobility has a positive correlation with the number of new cases. However, there is a time-varying behavior, with a significant increase at the beginning of 2021, more marked in the case of groceries and pharmacies. Despite the continuous increase in the correlation, a peak can clearly be noticed after Christmas, probably related to the lifting of mobility restrictions in the country (in a season when environmental conditions could be more conducive to the development of respiratory problems). In the middle of January 2021, the Portuguese government took severe restrictive measures. Immediately afterwards, the correlation levels remained high, meaning that the mandatory restrictions to the mobility probably had a significant correlation with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases. Over time, those measures could have had result on a progressive decline of the correlation levels, in agreement with References [20, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Another important feature is that the peak of the correlation is about the 7th/8th day, although in the groceries and pharmacies index it seems to be a little bit more, but it is remarkable that the duration of the correlations (red ones) is higher during the peak of the beginning of 2021. This means that lifting mobility restrictions or imposing new mobility restrictions could have an expected impact in about a week, which is consistent, for example, with the incubation period of the virus [47] [48] [49] .

Despite this similar pattern, it is important to mention districts such as Beja, Bragan\u00e7a, \u00c9vora, Faro, Guarda and Portalegre, in which the correlation intensity is lower than that found for Portugal, as seen in Figure 2 . Excepting Faro, these districts are located in inland (and more rural) regions which have lower population density levels, in line with Reference [30] . Another district that we consider relevant to include is the Lisbon district. Between mid-November and early February, high correlation levels are observed for the different timescales. This evidence contrasts with that observed at the national level, which shows higher correlation levels for the same period, mainly for short timescales. This behavior may reflect the greater confluence of people in this type of space, not only in the period leading up to Christmas and New Year (for the traditional festive season shopping) but also in the period that followed (taking advantage, for example, of the traditional sales season). The fact that high levels of correlation are observed for longer timescales may indicate the need for restrictive measures to be adopted earlier.",

For Beja, \u00c9vora and Portalegre, until nearly the end of 2020, this index presented a low correlation, close to zero, lower than that found for Portugal, indicating a lesser correlation between this type of mobility on the number of new cases for these districts. This empirical evidence may be justified by the smaller number of spaces available in these districts, which are still sufficiently available to serve the needs of their populations. From the beginning of 2021 and for short timescales, these correlations have increased, which may show that the frequency of these spaces could have a positive correlation with the emergence of new cases.

The whole sample under consideration was Taking the different patterns found for the correlations between some of the six indices and the spread of new COVID-19 cases, we would like to highlight that confinement measures do not have the same effect on all districts, which could indicate that the adoption of different measures in different districts could be desirable. We also highlight that there are locations that seem to present more risk of contagion (the ones related to retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies and transit stations), while residential areas seem to present a lower risk factor of contagion, as expected.

The whole sample under consideration was Portugal and its respective districts, with daily data on the variables under analysis. It should be noted that, despite Portugal being an interesting case study, as it was considered exemplary in the first phase of the pandemic crisis and was catalogued as the \"worst country in the world\" in January 2021, the truth is that the approach is robust and valid and can be successfully applied to any country or region.",

In addition to the considerations already taken, regarding the effectiveness of confinement to contain contagions, we can infer that some of these mobility factors may imply the non-use of a mask in certain situations, which may justify the values found for the retail and recreation and groceries and pharmacies indices. Take as an example recreation (cafes and restaurants) in which the consumption of food and drink goods prevents the use of a mask. In the case of public transport (I4), it could also be related to the fact that people may touch the same surfaces sequentially, with the respective risk of contagion.",

However, there are some distinct behaviors during the period under analysis and for different mobility risk factors. These differences may be related to the low population densities of some districts, especially those inland. Note that, for all the indices except residential areas, in general, the least densely populated districts were the ones showing lower correlations than those of the country as a whole, in line with the results found in Reference [31] . Regarding residential areas, Lisbon has a higher level of correlation than the average for Portugal, which may indicate that, in large cities, with a high population density and possibly weaker habitational conditions, residential mobility may be a significant contagion factor. Once again, it is the districts with the lowest population density that stand out (due to the lowest correlation) in this factor, also related to the difference between urban and rural areas, as identified by Reference [30] .",

In addition to this, we also concluded that population density might affect the correlation level of mobility indices with the new confirmed cases of COVID-19. It appears that districts with lower population density have lower correlations, which indicates that a different definition of confinement policies may be more appropriate for controlling the pandemic and simultaneously minimizing its effects in economic and social terms. Blindly imposing confinements leads to population revolt and the growth of states of anxiety and general impoverishment. It is increasingly important to understand which risk factors related to mobility most potentiate contagion and which regions and moments tougher measures are justified in terms of containment. These results are in line, for example, with the conclusions of Reference [28] , where it is stated that re-arranging local restrictions can be much more effective in controlling the number of COVID-19 cases without causing unnecessary economic costs than local or country-wide mobility restrictions.",

Given this, we believe that there is a high probability that the increased mobility had a strong impact on the increase in numbers of people infected with COVID-19, given the tendency for breaking social distancing, especially in the Christmas period.
