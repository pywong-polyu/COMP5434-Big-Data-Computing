Epidemiological parameters such as contagiousness (virus transmission rate), initial number of infected people, and probability of being tested depend on the region's demographic and geographical features, the containment measures introduced; they are calibrated to data about COVID-19 spread in the region of interest. At the first stage of our study, epidemiological data (numbers of people tested, diagnoses, critical cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) for each of the mentioned regions were analyzed. The data were characterized in terms of seasonality, stationarity, and dependency spaces, and were extrapolated using machine learning techniques to specify unknown epidemiological parameters of the model. At the second stage, the Optuna optimizer based on the tree Parzen estimation method for objective function minimization was applied to determine the model's unknown parameters.",

In compart-10 mental models, a population is divided into groups sharing similar features and interacting with one another following the mass action law. Agent-based models (ABMs), on the other hand, give each agent (people, social institutes, the state, etc.) a set of features and determines the way the agents interact from random graphs following disease spread principles. In other words, an agent's 15 behavior is determined individually, and their joint behavior is described as the interaction of multiple agents (bottom-top approach). Unlike compartmental models, ABMs are capable of providing a detailed description of an epidemio-logical situation, especially in a case of inaccurate and insufficient data. ABMs account for the stochastic nature of epidemic spread, makes it possible to esti- 20 mate the likelihood of different epidemic scenarios, and allows one to evaluate the risks of unfavorable events occurring due to policy changes. The resulted data enable one to make conclusions about the duration, severity and scale of an epidemic, evaluate the efficacy of the preventive and quarantine measures, and assess its economic consequences. 25 During 2020, many models were developed to predict COVID-19 spread.",

In this paper, agents are initialized in a 2D space (socalled mesh) to consider a distance between different agents, so such a factor as social distancing can be explicitly accounted for. However, this approach leads to excessive computation complexity, and for that reason, these models 35 consider a small number of agents (up to 500).",

This package had been utilized to predict the number of infected, dead and hospitalized people in the State of Oregon and become one of the tools to make decisions about whether to relax or escalate COVID-19 containment measures[21,22]. This library is written in Python 355 to study non-trivial COVID-19 dynamics. Its general algorithm is as follows: after all necessary parameters and statistical data are uploaded, the package creates an artificial population with account for age distribution. The model's agent is a person in a particular region. Then, the agents are united into contact networks and the integration loop begins. At every time step (1 day), an360 agent's status is updated in relation to its contact network and the containment measures relevant for this interval (self-isolation; closed access to public places; wearing face masks, etc.). The agents can interact with one another in particular networks. Depending on the network's structure, both full and random connectivity graphs are built for an agent to figure out how the infection 365 spreads. The average number of daily contacts is different for every agent and every network. At any time moment, the agents distributed by their age (bins of 0-9, 10-19, . . . , 90+) are found in their given state (see fig. 16). Our ABM also accounted for tested agents according to the data on COVID-19 tests performed in the Novosibirsk region. More details about the structure of Covasim-based 370 ABMs, their parameters and realization methods can be found in [23].Every agent has their set of properties and characteristics that can be divided into 2 groups: constant (belong to each particular agent and do not change while modeling) and time-dependent.3.1.1.

This paper provides a detailed analysis of the statistical data, including 540 the number of tested, positive, mortality, hospitalization and critical cases, on COVID-19 spread in NY State, the UK and the Novosibirsk region and presents a solution to the problem of identification of unknown epidemiological parameters (transmissibility; the initial number of infected individuals; probability of being tested, etc.) in an ABM. The problem has been considered as the mini-545 mization of a target functional in relation to daily numbers of tested, positive and mortality cases in the studied regions and become an important modification of the Covasim package [21].

It worth noting that some countries have their own rules of statistical analysis that have to be accounted for when carrying out modeling, e.g. in 560 the USA, the New Diagnoses indicator contains a certain percentage of probable cases, while New Deaths in the UK accounts for all the deaths that have occurred within 28 days since a positive COVID-19 test, even if such death has not been provoked by the virus. Due to the high sensitivity of the transmissibility parameter , the accuracy 565 of its identification becomes crucial for uncovering the pattern of COVID-19 spread in an investigated region. However, not all containment measures affect the pattern. For that reason, when developing an ABM calibration algorithm based on epidemiological data, we paid special attention to transmissibility and the times this parameter changed while modeling. These character-570 istics were determined from solving the minimization problem as a piecewise -constant function, while solving the inverse problem restored the parameter together with its times of change. The devised ABM has been validated with historical data from 2020. The modeling results for the three regions in question have demonstrated that pre-575 serving the introduced containment measures would have sustained New Diagnoses in NY State and the Novosibirsk region during March 2021 and would have reduced them in the UK. Due to the specific features of the observed data in the Novosibirsk region, where two time series are stationary with probability of 1, the model's forecast 580 accuracy has been lower for new cases of infection and more accurate for cases of hospitalization, e.g., the confidence interval values for the new case of infection registered daily was [70; 270] individuals and for hospitalizations -[90;",
