The aim of this study is to examine their attitudes confronting death awareness during the Covid-19 outbreak. Moreover, Personality was also considered. Different sociodemographic, in situ questions related to attitudes and the brief Big Five of Personality were employed in a cross-sectional design. The main results suggested that Personality traits were stable across countries. A relationship was found between Fear to contagious diseases and Neuroticism and other attitudes during the Covid-19 outbreak, and two different clusters were identified with regards to attitudes, however these did not differ on Personality. Finally, a Cluster group, Neuroticism, Age and Sense of belonging to the Country did predict Fear to contagious diseases. Of note, no differences were found across countries during grief.",

However, natural disasters such as the current Covid-19 outbreak might cause people to see their normalcy completely altered by not being able to socialize as we are used to, as well as, losing contact with our relatives or, even in extremes cases, losing someone they love (1, 2) . In this way, it seems important to remark that people have been exposed to death at close quarters during the Covid-19 outbreak, whether it be from a family member, a neighbor, an acquaintance, including children who may not understand what happens to those people or health workers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders (3) . Given that different or common country measures were applied worldwide, studies across different nations allow, not only the understanding of our own nation externally, but also other internal processes, where, to some extent, the country in which they are born (4) and therefore the human expression of pain is influenced by the product of culture, customs or symbols among others (5, 6) .",

Crosscultural studies of grief can be applied to many levels of human life: from a biological level (8) to a linguistic ones (9) , into of a vast range of possibilities that involve the meanings and the use of words that West countries use as grief and mourning. However, the current situation might be surely accompanied by other variables, most of them attitudes and fears into a scenario full of uncertainties. First, the fear on an economic crisis of greater impact than the one occurred in 2008 (10) . Other variables such as social media misinformation, political polarization, country measures, and social inequities or vulnerabilities, among others, are of interest to shed light on both internal and external anxiety states (11) (12) (13) . Not surprisingly, the pandemic has raised many issues of debate that involves a large body of disciplines in our society.",

However, little is known in relation to the attitudes developed in those who has directly suffered the loss of a loved one and close to them, during the pandemic onset. According to the literature (16) , circumstances surrounding death in the era of Covid-19 outbreak incorporate multiple and indirect traumatic characteristics, such as multiple deaths in families, social restrictions that prohibit visiting relatives in hospitals or intensive care units causing feelings of guilt, feelings of isolation and precarious socio-economic and living conditions as a result of the pandemic which will in turn be linked to mourning complications.",

Moreover, a mediational study was carried out on Personality and fear of death among young adults, being neuroticism positively correlated to death anxiety (20) . However, authors did not report if participants were if they had been closed to someone's death because of Covid-19 virus. In this way, the aim of this study is to focus in this profile, in order to examine their attitudes confronting death awareness during the Covid-19 outbreak. Moreover, to examine different profiles according to country of origin and residence, attitudes confronting mourning processes, and Personality. Focusing on mortality rates in Europe, two representative examples, who have also suffered strict lockdown last March 2020, are Italy and Spain (21, 22) . For this reason, these populations were selected. We hypothesis that Personality is stable across countries in the mourning process. For previous results, we expect that Neuroticism predict fear to contagious diseases in participants who have experienced a loss. Lastly, we hypothesized that different profiles can be identified regarding attitudes during grief, and these are independent to country of origin and residence.",

One main limitation over this attitude is related to a self-perception, as the real exposure to media coverage of the Covid-19 crisis was not measured.
