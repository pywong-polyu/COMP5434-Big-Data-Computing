Rapid advancements in technology over the past number of decades [1] has seen a rise in the use of digital technologies to enhance teaching [2] . In its simplest form, this includes the digitisation of teaching content (i.e. PowerPoint presentations, the use of virtual teaching platforms, e.g. Blackboard), whilst also expanding to more complex forms of technological integration involving virtual realities and digitally enhanced teaching props [2] . In this paper, digitally enhanced practical skill teaching will be defined as any use of technology, both simple and complex, to support the acquisition of a practical skill.",

This approach was employed because of its flexibility [23] and suitability in synthesising mixed research designs [24] . Data familiarisation was achieved by reading and re-reading articles. During the systematic coding process, qualitative and quantitative data was tagged with a code label; similar codes were clustered together to identify coherent patterns in the data. These clusters were colour coded and mapped under two overarching themes (barriers and opportunities). An example of this mapping process is illustrated in Figure 2 . Preliminary candidate themes [25] were generated and continuously reviewed and refined during the reflective process. Candidate themes that did not have adequate data to support them were either eliminated or combined with similar preliminary themes [22] until 7 key themes per overarching theme were consolidated. Thematic overlapping was difficult to avoid due to the multifaceted nature of themes, however, consolidation of key themes ensured meaningful framing of the data [22] . When formulating the recommendations, a process was followed which primarily considered the evidence collected. This was then further informed and influenced by the authors' lived experience in the area of online education in health science. An effort was made to ensure recommendations were applicable to a breadth of pedagogical situations reflecting the diversity of health science educational needs. The generalisability of recommendations can be seen as a strength of this research, which strives to be mindful of the diversity in those who teach, those who learn and the resources they engage with. Examples given alongside recommendations enable them to be more specific and actionable.",

When students arrive to practical skills classes without engaging with the preparatory online materials, there is a discrepancy in student ability from the class onset [38] . This issue raises safety concerns, while placing an increased burden on the students who come to the class prepared, as well as on educators who must revisit the preparatory materials with unprepared students [38] . Lack of pre-class preparation results in a slower class pace, hinders critical discussion, and challenges learning opportunities [30, 39] . The flipped classroom approach can also result in students struggling with the responsibility of selfdirected study [39] . A hybrid health assessment module required nursing students to engage with video and text-based learning materials prior to a practical skills class [39] . The students reported difficulty engaging with preparatory materials independently, lacked confidence in their understanding of key information, and required educators to place a greater emphasis on the importance of engaging with the pre-class material [39] . Health-care students also reported difficulty with time-management and organisation [36] , low motivation for engaging with online learning materials, and difficulty with attention when studying remotely during Covid-19 [28, 29] . Research suggests that postgraduate students tend to be highly self-motivated and more likely to engage with online resources for independent study when compared to undergraduate students [6] .",

Although online learning was satisfactory for theoretical teaching [30] , teaching staff and nursing students believed learning practical skills and competencies online was an 'inappropriate' replacement for traditional hands-on learning [29, 30] . Of 1,328 health-care students, approximately 75% reported practical learning was best suited to clinical or laboratory environments and felt ill-prepared tending to patients without in-person practical skills sessions [31] . Medical students believed in-person practical learning alongside an experienced doctor was invaluable [43] . Lack of experience with online learning may also drive negative attitudes [30, 43] .",

However, nursing students described reduced anxiety and greater selfawareness when provided with an opportunity to practice their theoretical learning with a manikin [32] . For example, a virtual simulation of a preterm labour provided nursing students with a unique opportunity to critically appraise an emerging situation as it progressed and make decisions without the fear of real-life consequences [47] Digital technologies can also provide students with opportunities not readily available or accessible in clinical environments to build skill competency. For example, dentistry students were provided with a unique opportunity to develop communication skills when interacting with a virtual patient specifically designed to mimic a young child with an intellectual disability [49] . The virtual patient was designed and developed with input from the parents of a child with Down syndrome, as well as with educators, to ensure realism. Following interaction with the virtual patient using a video-based simulation, students' perceived difficulty of handling a similar situation in real-life was significantly reduced.

The creation of open educational resources (OERs) and supporting those developing teaching resources to use creative commons licences will enable more widespread use of high-quality relevant teaching material and enable those with limited resources to reap the benefits of online education, tackling the barrier of inequality. Many courses share learning outcomes but do not share teaching and learning materials. The numerous reasons for this include geographical and time constraints-both of which are potentially overcome with online learning. Where those who teach are supported to create high-quality online educational material, the ability to share that material should be addressed at an early stage in resource development. Using creative commons licencing will enable others to learn from, and if appropriate, use parts of or all of resources created by others, maximising the impact of online teaching and avoiding duplication of work. The creation and widespread use of high-quality OERs in this field could also help those who teach and those who learn in institutions without the means to develop learning resources (for example, those who teach in developing countries) and should be developed, within reason, with this in mind.",

There is therefore scope for investigating attributes of practical skills and their suitability to being taught and assessed with the support of digital technologies. It is important that as health science education continues to integrate digital technologies into practical skill teaching that educators can make evidence-based decisions on whether specific skills, or aspects of a skill, may be supported using digitally enhanced technologies.

Educators can develop realistic and diverse virtual patient simulations to provide students with a range of possible patients, facilitating immersive learning, critical thinking, and collaborative problem solving [37] .

However, some students struggle with adjusting to independent learning, requiring greater guidance and support from educators [39] .

Firstly, the included articles were heterogeneous in their methodological design that can be deemed as negatively influencing the quality of the review. However, including a wide range of methodological frameworks enabled an integrated approach to addressing the aim of the current literature review. Secondly, it is recommended that two or more researchers carry out an independent search strategy in parallel for quality assessment [57] ; the absence of moderation in the screening process can be seen as a limitation of the methodological rigor of the review. Finally, it can be potentially seen as a limitation that the final themes are multifaceted with slight theme overlapping. For example, although negative attitudes and inaccessibility and inequity of online learning are two separate themes, there are interconnections; the researcher identified negative attitudes towards digital technologies can arise when students lack access to essential learning equipment. The researcher explored the meaning assigned to the data across varied contexts throughout data familiarisation and the coding process to differentiate conceptual theme patterns, leading to decisions on theme merging or distinction whereby independent themes are not absolutely discrete. One final limitation in this area of medical education is the divergent nature of educational design and delivery across the health sciences and across the globe. While an effort was made to ensure recommendations were general enough to apply to several contexts, it was also necessary to provide actionable examples. As such examples given purposefully vary from tasks which would require little resources and local effort to more capital projects requiring input from several stakeholders.",
