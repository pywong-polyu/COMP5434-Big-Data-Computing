In this report, we describe impaired consciousness caused by cefepime hydrochloride (CFPM) in a patient with cognitive sequalae of COVID-19. A 56-year-old male patient was diagnosed with penile abscess after COVID-19 infection, and a blood culture detected two drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Therefore, CFPM 2 g \u00d7 twice/ day was administered on day 71 after intensive care unit admission. Approximately 48 h after CFPM administration, the patient showed disturbances in consciousness. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and spinal fluid examination revealed no obvious abnormalities. Therefore, CFPM-induced neurotoxicity was suspected. CFPM was discontinued and ceftazidime 2 g \u00d7 three times/day was initiated. The patient's consciousness improved 30 h after the final administration of CFPM. Serum CFPM concentrations were 14.2, 21.7, 21.7, and 11.9 \u03bcg/mL on days 1, 2, and 3 after the initiation of CFPM and on the day after CFPM was discontinued, respectively. In conclusion, intensivists should pay attention to new neurological symptoms such as CFPM-induced encephalopathy in patients with prolonged neurological symptoms after COVID-19 infection.",

He developed fever, sore throat, and headache 6 days prior to admission. He was referred to our hospital and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was diagnosed with pneumonia at another hospital. On admission, his consciousness was lucid, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of E4V5M6. The patient's oxygenation capacity deteriorated rapidly, and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was introduced after tracheal intubation on day 2 of admission. Pharmacological therapy for COVID-19 included administration of remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation with continuous heparin administration. On day 15, the patient was weaned off VV-ECMO and extubated on day 19. On days 36 and 38, PCR confirmed the patient was negative for SARS-CoV2. However, ICU management was continued due to prolonged kidney injury, cytomegalovirus enteritis, bacteremia, and penile abscess. Intermittent renal replacement therapy was required twice a week for prolonged kidney injury. Although cognitive deficits improved until day 57, fatigue, mood disorder, and memory impairment were prolonged.",

On day 74, the GCS score was E3V2M5 and the ICDSC score was 8. The patient opened his eyes with upward rolling of the eyeballs in response to a call but was unable to follow orders. In addition, the patient occasionally shouted loudly. The cause of the altered consciousness could not be determined using contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The efficiency of blood purification was increased due to the possibility of worsening sepsis (hemodiafiltration; blood flow rate, 150 mL/min; dialysate flow rate, 500 mL/min; filtrate flow rate; 1500 mL/h; and PMMA membrane). Spinal fluid examination revealed no obvious abnormal findings, including herpes simplex virus, Cryptococcus, or tuberculosis. C-reactive protein decreased from 10.3 mg/dL on day 70 to 2.5 mg/dL on day 74. In addition, the patient's hemodynamics were stable without the need for catecholamines, and hypoglycemia and hypoxemia did not occur after CFPM administration. Therefore, CFPM-induced neurotoxicity was suspected. On day 75, CFPM was discontinued and ceftazidime 2 g \u00d7 three times/day was initiated. On day 76, the patient's consciousness improved 30 h after the final administration of CFPM. Communication was possible on day 77, and his consciousness was lucid without delirium (GCS score of E4V5M6 and ICDSC score of 0). Furthermore, bicycle ergometer exercises in bed and training for sitting upright could be performed. On day 78, the patient underwent self-propulsion training in a wheelchair. The patient was discharged from the ICU on day 106. At this time, the GCS, ICDSC, and MRC scores were E4V5M6, 0 points, and 50 points, respectively, and standing training and wheelchair transfer were possible during rehabilitation.

In a previous report, 84% of patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome had neurological signs [7] . The pathogenic mechanism has been attributed to direct or indirect damage to the central nervous system (CNS) by COVID-19 [8] . It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS via the neuronal and/or hematogenous route [9] . In addition, the cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 may disrupt the BBB [10] . Several reports have described that neurological symptoms, such as meningitis and encephalopathy, occur after COVID-19 infection, even with a negative spinal fluid SARS-CoV-2 PCR test [11] [12] [13] . In fact, a case of pupil dilatation caused by the muscle relaxant rocuronium has been reported in a patient with COVID-19 [14] . Normally, rocuronium does not pass through the BBB. This report suggests that muscle relaxants may cause CNS effects by impairing the BBB due to inflammation and oxidative stress caused by COVID-19.",

Because of its low molecular weight, low protein-binding rate, and low volume of distribution, 70% of CFPM can be removed by dialysis within 3 h, and continuous renal replacement therapy is useful, although less efficient than dialysis [17] . In our case, blood purification therapy was performed for sepsis, and the blood concentration of CFPM decreased to 11.9 \u03bcg/mL the following day. The patient showed improvement in consciousness 30 h after the discontinuation of CFPM and was able to undergo rehabilitation after 2 days. Blood purification therapy may have contributed to the rapid improvement in CFPM-induced encephalopathy in this case.",
