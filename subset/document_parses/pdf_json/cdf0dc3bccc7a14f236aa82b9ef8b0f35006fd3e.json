This would be particularly useful in coping with the reduced GA access and managing extensive carious lesions atraumatically, particularly in uncooperative patients. Considering all of the benefits, it begs the following questions -why is it still unlicensed as a caries-arresting agent in the UK? Where is the official guidance on its use? And finally, why has it not become a prevalent form of treatment considering its efficacy and appropriateness in the current climate?",

            "text": "Sir, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, patients undergoing invasive procedures were subject to confirming their consent through written means, a process which is considered common within surgical fields. 1 The guidance issued by the FGDP on 1 June suggested a move towards provision of 'digital packs' and it seems many standard operating procedures (SOPs) being issued by practices include the provision of digital information packs with consent forms to patients. 2 Patients being issued consent forms to complete on their own may require additional support in order to ensure their validity so that consent is maintained and not overlooked, in light of the new working protocols the profession faces. Furthermore, in cases where patients are being triaged remotely, a complete exam may not be possible prior to execution of treatment: a key difference which has to be considered when exploring the options for consultation and delivery of clinical information. 3 There is a risk due to patients' comprehension of the intended procedure and the lack of opportunity to fully appreciate or discuss the risks and benefits. Additionally, the change from a face-to-face consultation and 'cooling-off ' period, as is the case with the gold-standard two stage consent, is likely to be affected. There is also a risk of clinicians not engaging with such measures which could be viewed as a noncompliant attitude to SOPs and guidelines, which although essential to good practice have come to be a burden to many.",

In experiencing such difficulties in the UDC hubs, I have become a huge proponent of the often underused and overlooked use of oral sedation techniques in the management of dentally anxious patients who have previously relied on IHS or IV sedation. Via anecdotal feedback, many patients are realising that they would be content to accept future treatment under such measures. With dental practices now resuming a limited level of practice and possibly experiencing the level of frustrations with lack of treatment provisions for anxious patients, oral sedation with Diazepam is an invaluable tool in enabling patients the access to care they require. Increasing confidence in the use of Diazepam pre-medication is paramount for the changing face of dentistry, especially for those of us who have, in the past, become overly reliant on the GA, especially in polypharmacy patients. Careful case selection is of course key to its successful use, and requires the triaging clinician to be thorough in ascertaining dental history and indication of sedation need.",
