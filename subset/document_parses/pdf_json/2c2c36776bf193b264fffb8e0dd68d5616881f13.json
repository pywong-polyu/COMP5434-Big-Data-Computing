An increasing proportion of young adults are presenting with signs and symptoms of excessive time spent sedentary including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome [4, 5] . Any waking behaviour with low energy expenditure (\u22641.5 METs), including sitting at a desk, is classified as sedentary behaviour [6] . As university students may need to spend large amounts of their weekdays sitting in class and studying, they appear to be particularly sedentary compared to other young adults [7] . Based on objective assessment (accelerometry), university students spend an average of 9.8 to 10.7 waking hours each day in sedentary activities [7, 8] . health of university students. In addition to increasing physical activity, national guidelines now recommend regular breaks to interrupt sedentary time [9] [10] [11] . One such innovative opportunity may be in the university setting and specifically during seated classes.",

There is limited research on classroom movement breaks in the university setting, but initial research indicates university students had a positive attitude to movement breaks of three to five minutes duration conducted every 20 min during classes [13] . In another study, results indicated exercise breaks increased vigor and decreased fatigue levels for 20 min compared to no breaks [14] . A four-minute movement break conducted once in a 2-h lecture was perceived to be feasible and acceptable to students [15] .

This design was chosen for triangulation [17] and mutual enhancement as the survey provided raw data on alertness, concentration and enjoyment, accelerometer data provided information on fidelity and efficacy, and focus group data provided participants' experiences of movement breaks from the perspective of university students and tutors. Focus groups can generate rich, detailed data in the participants' own words to explore their experiences of the movement breaks and were chosen over individual interviews as they assist participants to explore and clarify their views relative to other participants. The less formal nature of a focus group also allows participants to express their views candidly and spontaneously, while participant interactions within a focus group can also generate new ideas [18] . The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist [19] and the Strengthening Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement [20] were used to ensure the rigor of reporting. University Human Research Ethics Committee approval (HEC19527) was obtained prior to commencement of the study. Participation was voluntary and all participants provided written informed consent.",

To be eligible, students needed to be concurrently enrolled in two subjects ('chronic disease management' (CLASS A) and 'evidence-based practice' (CLASS B)) in 2020 and be able to participate in physical activity as assessed by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [21] . It was anticipated that 9 groups of 20 students would be enrolled in these classes at different times across one semester (n = 180).

Classroom movement breaks were 5-10 min long [13, 23] and consisted of whole-body movements (see Box 1) . Tutors aimed to complete one movement break outside the classroom (walking) and two inside per class. Classroom movement breaks were incorporated after approximately 20 min of sedentary classroom time in one two-hour class per study day so that a total of 15-30 min of movement was incorporated into the two-hour class ( Figure 1 ). Two-hour classes with no scheduled movement breaks were used as a comparison. Attempts were made to tailor the class structure to fit the breaks by modifying learning activities to be completed whilst moving, by utilizing walking discussions or by having changes in topic planned for movement break times. Movement breaks conducted in the classroom were led by the tutor or a student volunteer. Outside walking discussions were unsupervised. Participation in each movement break was voluntary and all students were invited to participate in the movement breaks regardless of study enrolment. ",

For this study, three domains of feasibility were selected to determine if movement breaks were feasible in university classes: acceptability (levels of disruption, engagement and satisfaction), practicality (safety, ease of scheduling and conducting breaks) and limited efficacy testing of movement breaks. Engagement, ease of scheduling and conducting movement breaks and the perceived amount of disruption to the class were explored through qualitative focus group interviews with tutors and students. Safety was determined by recording adverse events such as injuries, muscle soreness, trips or falls. Limited efficacy was determined by measuring perceived concentration, alertness and enjoyment as previous research in university students has mentioned these concepts in students' feedback on movement breaks and physically active learning [13, 14, 26] .

If this increased effort cannot be achieved or sustained, performance deteriorates [33] . The effort-recovery model [32] proposes that stress and fatigue are reversible with rest.

One laboratory-based randomised controlled trial [34] designed to replicate a university learning environment used 5-min exercise breaks approximately every 15-20 min. They found students who completed exercise breaks were more attentive and focused toward the end of the lecture and performed better on a quiz than students who had no break or a non-exercise break [34] . In addition, a classroom-based study reported subjective benefits to enjoyment and alertness following breaks every 20 min [13] . However, results from our feasibility study indicate students and tutors felt movement breaks every 20 min were too frequent. Another classroom-based study conducted a movement break after 45 min of sedentary time and reported benefits remained present upon testing 20 min later [14] . These results are promising and suggest that less frequent breaks may still be effective due to a lasting influence while also being more practical. However, Niedermeier and colleagues [35] evaluated the effect of a 10-min outdoor running break 45 min into a 2-h study course. They found the running break improved visual attention, perceived attention and alertness immediately following the break compared to the control group but there were no differences in enjoyment, and effects on attention and alertness were not maintained 30 min later. Perhaps the less intense movement breaks conducted in our feasibility study allowed more interaction and increased enjoyment and therefore may have longer-lasting effects. Considering the results of our feasibility study and previous studies with university students [13, 14, 34, 35] , future research may like to focus on the effects of breaks after 30-45 min sedentary time and monitor the duration of the benefit.",

As student satisfaction is increasingly important to universities because of its impact on student recruitment and retention [36] , anything that can help with this is a positive. In addition, enjoyment may be related to academic outcomes as Pekrun's three-dimension emotional taxonomy categorises enjoyment of an activity as a positive activating emotion which is associated with better student outcomes [37] . An unintended consequence of movement breaks being enjoyable was that they enhanced comradery between students and increased rapport between students and tutors. As a result, students expressed feeling more able to speak up and engage in classes. Through enjoyment and engagement, movement breaks may further enhance learning and university outcomes.",

The negative effect of high-volume sedentary behaviour (such as that seen on weekdays in university students) may be independent of physical inactivity levels [38] , however, those who participate in moderate-vigorous intensity exercise may mitigate some risk [39] . Students in this study did report that they changed their study habits following participation in class which may increase the potential for reducing risks related to high volume sedentary time. Future research could involve advice and education on breaking up sedentary time outside the classroom and assess carry-over to determine the overall impact on physical activity and sedentary behaviour.",

University educators should consider incorporating movement breaks after 30-45 min of sedentary time in classes of more than 1-h duration. The benefits of these movement breaks have the potential to translate into improved academic performance, enhanced student satisfaction and may improve the health and wellbeing of university students. Possible barriers to implementation that need to be considered include having adequate space, considering safety, structuring breaks around class content so they do not disrupt the flow and having tutors/lecturers who are comfortable leading movement breaks. To facilitate implementation, university educators can refer to existing movement break options [24] , consider natural breaks in the classes where there is a change in topic or focus and consider opportunities for walking small group discussions when students are asked to brainstorm or discuss a topic.",

Although most students participated in the classroom movement breaks, results are only generalisable to physiotherapy students who volunteered to participate and complete the outcomes which may have introduced participation bias. In addition, the study needed to be stopped early due to COVID-19 restrictions which limited recruitment. The reliability and validity of the VAS in relation to alertness, concentration and enjoyment have not been established in university students and, therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution. However, the performance properties of VAS scales, in general, are well established and our results were triangulated with qualitative interviews to increase the trustworthiness and consistency of the findings. Although not a randomised controlled trial, this feasibility study did include control classes for comparison. Another strength of the study was that it was conducted pragmatically during usual university classes so that results are relevant to those wanting to implement movement breaks in their classes.",
