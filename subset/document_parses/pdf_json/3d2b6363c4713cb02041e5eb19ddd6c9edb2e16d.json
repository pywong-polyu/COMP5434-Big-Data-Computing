In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach to schedule PPE orders among healthcare facilities. In this PPE game, each independent healthcare facility optimises its own storage utilisation in order to keep its PPE cost at a minimum. Such a model can reduce peak demand considerably when applied to a variable PPE consumption profile. Experiments conducted for NHS England regions using actual data confirm that the challenge of securing PPE supply during disasters such as COVID-19 can be eased if proper stock management procedures are adopted. These procedures can include early stockpiling, increasing storage capacities and implementing measures that can prolong the time period between successive infection waves, such as social distancing measures. Simulation results suggest that the provision of PPE dedicated storage space can be a viable solution to avoid straining PPE supply chains in case a second wave of COVID-19 infections occurs.",

            "text": "Novel infectious diseases pose a serious challenge to policy makers and healthcare systems. Emerging from Wuhan, China, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic, caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has wreaked havoc globally. This is due to its rapid rate of transmission, its virulence and the inability of most countries to adequately prepare for such a disease [1] . Identified in December 2019, the disease now has a global distribution with over 30 million confirmed cases and almost one million confirmed deaths as of September 2020 according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) [2] . COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and the WHO has identified two principal routes through which these are carried between people. The first mode of transmission involves a person being in direct, close contact with someone who carries the virus (within one metre) where they become directly exposed to potentially infectious respiratory droplets. The second mode of transmission involves contact with fomites in the immediate vicinity of the infected person [3] . Nguyen et al. estimated that frontline healthcare professionals (HCPs) had a 3.4 times higher risk than non-healthcare workers of contracting COVID-19, even when adjusting for the probability of being tested [4] . Indeed, approximately 10% of the confirmed cases in China [5] and up to 9% of all cases in Italy have been among healthcare professionals [6] as of the date of publication of these studies. This increased risk does not only pose a problem for the HCPs themselves, but also poses a major threat to the elderly and vulnerable populations they care for, since outbreaks within healthcare settings are important amplifiers of infection [7] . One of the most crucial ways by which transmission of this virus (and other infectious diseases) is reduced is the use of proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) [7] : the WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown, and gloves to be worn as PPE in their COVID-19 PPE guidelines. If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2/3 respirator which provides a greater level of filtration than surgical masks [8] . These guidelines are replicated globally with minor differences. In the United Kingdom (the case study reported in this paper), the most recent Public Health England guidelines are essentially the same [9] . Globally, medical resources, particularly PPE have come under unprecedented demand. This has led to shortages in many countries with some rationing their use of PPE and in some cases reusing disposable material [10] . The natural consequence of this has been the disproportionately high rate of infection amongst HCPs which in turn contributes to disease spread. This may not necessarily result from a national shortage of PPE but rather local shortages resulting from inefficient distribution of resources in timely manner [11] .",

Single-and multi-objective optimisation methods have been used frequently to address problems of resource allocation and scheduling of purchase orders for medical supplies (see [13] for a comprehensive survey and taxonomy). Such methods are centralised in the sense that a central planner seeks to optimally coordinate supply activities for the entire system, e.g. minimise overall costs for the central planner. In contrast to this, game theory is a tool that allows decentralised decision-making. That means, different entities in the system can make decisions based on their individual preferences. For instance, they can schedule their orders to minimise their own costs. The decentralised approach leaves the actors more freedom and is the more applicable direction for our scenario.",

In general, game theory is used to mathematically model systems of competing agents. Usually these individuals act in a selfish and rational manner. In this context, selfish can be understood as being only interested in their own good, i.e. an agent strives to maximise its outcome irrespective of the outcome of others. Furthermore, rational means that there is a clear logical reasoning behind every decision. The most widely used solution concept for a non-cooperative game is the Nash equilibrium [19] .

In their model, the authors propose a non-cooperative game where hospitals stockpile critical medical resources in preparation for disasters. It is proposed that these hospitals determine their individual stockpile levels strategically in a way that minimises their expected total spend.

Unlike in [25] where the authors propose a similar resource competition among countries, their model imitates the stochasticity of infection transmission parameters. The resulting comparison between this selfish allocation scheme and a utilitarian division scheme, where a central planner (e.g. WHO) makes all of the allocation decisions, shows that having a central planner reduces the total number of worldwide infections considerably. Although their proposed model can aid in understanding how countries, acting in their own self interest, would behave in an epidemic, it does not address the problem of resource distribution within a given country. [26] compares selfish vaccination coverage, which the authors call the 'Nash vaccination', with group optimal coverage, which they call the 'utilitarian vaccination'. The authors find that the cost of vaccination would be a pivotal factor in determining the effectiveness of Nash vs. utilitarian coverage. However, this can result in different outcomes depending on the level of disease severity according to age, such as in the case of chickenpox.",

Given the actions of all game participants, healthcare facilities optimise their PPE orders by making stockpiling decisions individually. Our approach is centralised in the sense that cost and supply is controlled by a central entity. It is also decentralised because healthcare facilities make their stockpiling decisions independently. By adapting the model developed in [28] and applying it to COVID-19 related PPE demand in England, we study the effects of early stockpiling as well as increasing storage capacities on PPE supply in challenging circumstances. Additionally, we examine the impact of a putative second wave on PPE supply and investigate whether delaying this putative second wave can ease the challenge of fulfilling the PPE demand of healthcare facilities. Finally, insights and conclusions from this study are drawn and suggestions regarding PPE supply in disaster management are discussed.",

We consider the case study of England as it was one of the countries severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and where shortages in medical resources, especially PPE, were reported [10] . The players in this game structure are assumed to report their demand and are committed to paying their respective invoices. The players are also assumed to have the financial independence that inspires their selfish behaviour. Although this game is intended for independent healthcare providers, such as NHS Trusts in England, only region-level COVID-19 data are publicly available. Therefore, in this experiment, we assume that each of the seven NHS England regions can act selfishly in a way that represents the interests of its accommodated Trusts.

Fig 2 shows the peak and total (up to 01 Aug) COVID-19 occupied hospital beds for each of the seven NHS England regions. We assume this information can represent the extent of the regions' response to the pandemic. Therefore, we assume that the PPE consumption that is related to all COVID-19 activities within these regions can be estimated from their daily COVID-19 occupied hospital beds data. On 15 Apr, the UK government published its estimated PPE deliveries in England since the start of the outbreak in the country: \"Since 25 February 2020, at least 654 million items of PPE have been supplied in this way\" [37] . As this number counts a pair of hand gloves as two items and includes consumables that are not considered for this study as mentioned in Section 1, e.g. body bags and swabs, we used the number of delivered aprons (135 M) as our reference for consumed PPE kits. However, only 86% of these items were delivered to the NHS Trusts, whereas the rest were distributed to primary care providers (GPs), pharmacies, dentists and social care providers, as well as to other sectors [37] . Additionally, although these deliveries took place during the period between 25 Feb to 15 Apr, the first COVID-19 hospitalization only took place on 20 Mar. Also, given that PPE supply chains were heavily burdened at the beginning of the outbreak, the UK government was led to change PPE usage guidance that health and social care workers should use in different settings when caring for people with COVID-19. The most notable of these was on 02 Apr when a single kit of PPE was advised to be used per session rather than per patient [38] . This change of guidance along with the fact that our model is only concerned with COVID-19 related PPE consumption have led us to assume that 50% of the PPE kits delivered to NHS Trusts between 25 Feb to 15 Apr were consumed for COVID-19 related activities in the period between 20 Mar and 15 Apr. This results in an estimated PPE consumption of 58 M kits for COVID-19 related hospitalisation cases. Dividing this number by the aggregated daily COVID-19 occupied beds in England for the aforementioned period results in a rough estimate of 195 PPE kits daily consumption per occupied hospital bed. Taking this into consideration, along with the mentioned change in guidance, we were able to extrapolate the publicly available daily COVID-19 occupied beds region data into PPE consumption by using a factor randomised between 210 and 240 kits per bed until 02 Apr, and between 150 and 180 from then onwards.",

Our extrapolation in m 3 to the storage capacity of the seven NHS England regions is listed in Table 4 . Moreover, using the volumes supplied by PPE suppliers for bulk orders [39] [40] [41] [42] , the volume of a thousand of PPE kits, each consisting of a face shield (visor), a face mask, an apron and a pair of gloves, can be approximated to 1.35 m 3 .

Those simulations rely on the model proposed by [44] , where the authors predict that a second surge of COVID-19 cases happening in England can be of a lesser magnitude than the first wave, depending on the control measures in place (e.g. lockdown and social distancing measures), but will most likely last longer than the first wave. Therefore, a second surge in PPE demand was introduced to the regions' demand profiles from 01 Aug. Fig 3 shows an examples of a second wave PPE demand profile expected to peak in mid October 2020. As the time of occurrence of a putative second wave is largely unknown, we considered in our experiments waves peaking at five different dates, i.e. mid October, mid November, mid December 2020 and mid January and mid February 2021. As can be shown from [44] , it is highly unlikely that a putative second wave would last longer than 100 days after peaking. This has led us to assume that PPE demand for the second wave would come to an end 100 days after the second peak.",

Since our proposed cost function does not have any cost terms other than the cost of ordering PPE, scheduling decisions are fairly independent of the cost parameters. In fact, the authors in [28] showed that the sensitivity of similar scheduling games in relation to cost parameters is quite low. In the experiments conducted in this study, we use 8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 as the quadratic term parameter and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 as the linear term parameter. Usage of these parameters has resulted in a 300% increase in PPE cost between peak and average demand.

In the first stage, we considered the overall period using five different stockpiling start dates (as stated above), to the end of a putative second wave, which also has five different peak dates. Additionally, we used five different storage capacities for each region in order to analyse the effects of adding extra PPE storage space. This means that 125 games were played in the first stage, the results of which will be discussed in the following sections. In the second stage of this experiment, we only examined the effects of running the game for the duration of the second wave; with the simulation starting from 01 Aug, (i.e. the cut-off date of the data used to simulate demand), and ending 100 days after the peak of the second wave. We have simulated five different dates for the peak of the second wave. Furthermore, we used the same five storage capacities for this stage as already employed before. The results of the 25 games that were simulated in the second stage will be discussed in the following sections. In both stages, we assume that regions start the scheduling game with an empty store. A Python code was written to find the Nash equilibrium of this game, where players sequentially update their PPE orders to minimise their costs. The optimisation package scipy.optimize was used for each player to find their optimal scheduling decisions at each game iteration. The game converges once the mean squared error (MSE) between successive game iterations drop below a threshold. Given that peak PPE demand is in the order of millions of sets, we used a maximum value of 10 for the MSE to obtain accurate results.",

The outcome of the game is a series of daily decisions that each English NHS region should take regarding their PPE requirements: order PPE, use PPE from their storage or stockpile PPE in their storage. The result of those decisions can be visualised by monitoring the status of their storage levels. Fig 3 displays the amount of PPE sets available in the storage for each region (coloured areas), the PPE demand (dotted line) and PPE orders (bold line). From the stockpiling date, a constant set of PPE is ordered daily, leading to storage reaching full capacity at the start of the first wave that triggers PPE demand. However, as storage capacity becomes rapidly insufficient to meet the daily demand, available (stored) PPE decreases rapidly and daily ordering increases until reaching a plateau around the period of the peak of the first wave. Eventually, storage becomes depleted and the daily order equals the daily demand of a receding wave. Finally, when the daily demand is sufficiently low, storage is repleted allowing English regions to face the putative second wave with full PPE storage capacity. From then, patterns observed in terms of order and storage levels are similar to that already described for the first wave. Here, stockpiling started on 28 Feb, standard storage capacity was multiplied by five and the peak of the second wave is expected to happen in mid October. Stored PPE sets for each region is stacked on top of each other in order to show the cumulative PPE stock of all regions to illustrate the game mechanism. Note that the areas are scaled down by a factor of five in order to make the figure more readable.",

Deviations from this ideal scenario generate additional costs which corresponds in the proposed model to an increased challenge for the NHS at delivering required PPE. This challenge is visible in Fig 4 where a comparison between three different scenarios is shown. The first scenario can be considered as a reference scenario where NHS regions report their PPE demand to NHS without scheduling their storage usage. The second and third scenarios are outcomes from the game when regions start stockpiling on 11 Mar and 07 Feb, respectively. One should also note that storage capacity in the third scenario is multiplied by 10. In this figure, the cumulative cost for the second and third scenarios is shown with reference to the first. As shown, a 9% saving resulted from the second scenario at the end of the scheduling period while the third scenario resulted in a 38% saving. Since a higher cost saving means that less fluctuations occur in demand, these figures can be directly used as a method to quantify the challenge of securing PPE. In Fig 4, as in the remaining figures, colours have been used to illustrate that level of challenge. The associated colour grading goes from dark red to dark green, where dark red expresses a high challenge and dark green indicates a relatively low challenge. ",

In total, 125 scenarios were conducted by considering five different values for each of the three parameters (see subsections above). Fig 5 summarises the outcomes of these experiments. The figure reveals that in a two-wave pandemic, the two most critical parameters are the stockpiling date and storage capacity. With the peak of the first wave being estimated at 08 Apr [51] , and the second wave taking place at least six months after the first one, the timing of the second wave thereafter would have only a moderate impact on easing the PPE challenge. On one hand, Fig 5 highlights that if the storage capacity is low, an early stockpiling starting date hardly alleviates the PPE challenge and has minimal, if not negligible, cost savings (leftmost column). On the other hand, a high storage capacity only slightly mitigates a late stockpiling date (bottom row). Indeed, only early stockpiling and a sizeable increase in storage (top right area) would provide the right conditions to lower the PPE challenge overall and indeed would result in considerable cost savings.",

The results of these 25 scenarios are shown in Fig 6. As shown, while the storage capacity remains a key parameter, the impact of the date of the peak of the second wave has become apparent. Indeed, as the period of study is shorter than in the previous set of simulations and only a single wave of infection is considered, its timing substantially affects the PPE challenge. Consequently, even if a large amount of storage is available (two rightmost columns), only a late 2020 peak or later would be handled well in terms of cost savings.",

The two key parameters involved in saving costs by reducing the demand for PPE in the context of a pandemic that were identified using this approach are: (i) the storage capacity (for PPE) available to the health system. We have shown that increasing the storage capacity enhances the ability to stockpile which in turn helps flatten the demand curve (making it easier for suppliers to meet this demand in a cost-effective way) ; and (ii) the date when stockpiling of PPE commences. We have shown that earlier stockpiling would have saved costs and ensured adequate provision of PPE for the first peak of the pandemic. These two factors will also prove crucial when planning for a second wave. Of secondary importance is the ability to predict the date of the second wave. This is because, providing the second wave occurs after the new year, the degree of cost saving that occurs diminishes to negligible levels beyond this point in time. Using our game-theoretic approach, we have found that the NHS would be able to achieve all the cost-saving advantages if the second wave was to occur in 2021. A practical implication of this is that policymakers may need to keep some of the restricting measures that are in place to control the pandemic until beyond this point in time.",

In this figure, the aggregate demand profile for all NHS England regions is shown both with and without storage scheduling for a second wave of PPE demand that peaks in mid November. As shown, there is a substantial improvement in cost savings between the different storage capacities, especially when it is amplified by a factor of five and 10, resulting in an improvement in cost saving of 15.9% and 7.7% respectively. This means that the challenge of securing PPE during a second wave can be eased by a considerable amount when additional storage space is provided for stockpiling PPE. The figure also shows that further storage enhancement beyond this would result in less cost-saving improvements and would therefore have little impact on the challenge of securing sufficient PPE. This is especially visible when storage is expanded from 15 times to 20 times the standard storage space. Indeed, enhancing the PPE storage capacity by 15 times, perhaps by using temporary storage facilities as an interim solution, results in a relatively steady demand profile as shown in Fig 7.   Fig 7.

Based on publicly available COVID-19 hospitalisation data for NHS England regions, we performed simulations to investigate the impact of three key factors on PPE security of supply. These factors comprise: (i) the stockpiling start date, (ii) the time of the peak of a putative second wave, and (iii) the amount of storage available for medical PPE. The two most critical parameters were found to be the storage capacity and the stockpiling start date, while the timing of the second wave has only had a moderate impact on the challenge of securing PPE.

Access to such data would provide further insights into demand patterns which can potentially influence the game. Extensions to our work can include introducing supply constraints where demand cannot always be fulfilled, perhaps by adding a shortage penalty to the cost function. Also, our model assumes that healthcare facilities can predict their demand without forecasting errors. This can be enhanced by adding stochastic elements that capture the uncertainty in demand [28] . The model can also be extended by investigating scenarios where hospitals can share their resources by having mutual agreements or using the selfish sharing approach proposed in [53] . This could be via using a scheme to incentivise matching scheduled regional demand with the production of the supplier. Another possible extension of this research is to propose a model that finds the optimal storage capacity for each game player.",
