The HAI titre correlates with in vitro neutralization of matched-strain influenza viruses 42 , and early work using this assay demonstrated a serum titre of 1:18-1:36 correlated with 50% protection from infection in humans 43 . Seasonal influenza vaccines are predominantly produced by propagation of influenza virus in chicken eggs, followed by inactivation, which is a time-consuming and labour-intensive process (see Table 1 for further details). Adaptation to growth in eggs has been noted to result in occasional mutations in HA that may impact the immune response 44 . This finding has been confirmed by a recent report comparing viruses grown in eggs versus in mammalian cells, which showed that mutations generated in the egg adaption process may hinder the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies 45 .

Antigen dose, regimen and optimization. Even though the development of a 'true' universal influenza vaccine remains a challenging goal, strategic plans have been proposed by field experts and government agencies 4 . Many steps have been taken towards improving current seasonal vaccines by expanding the breadth of protection within a subtype or across a group. They have shown progressive but incremental degrees of efficacy (Fig. 1c) . For example, a high-dose, quadrivalent, inactivated vaccine is more effective than a standard dose vaccine at reducing the clinical outcomes associated with influenza infection 46 and is now recommended for routine use in healthy elderly adults 47 , showing the benefits of a more highly effective, matched seasonal vaccine (Fig. 1c , strain-specific). An increase in protection against confirmed influenza-like illness has also been observed with a recombinant protein-based vaccine (FluBlok) and an adjuvanted vaccine (Fluad) in older adults 38,48,49 , likely through enhanced coverage of divergent subtypes beyond the matched vaccine strains (Fig. 1c , subtype-specific). In animal models, combinations of rationally selected H1 HA immunogens have been used to elicit broad and effective antibody responses, including one multivalent vaccine candidate that induced antibodies that neutralize diverse H1N1 viruses 50 , providing broader H1 or subtype-specific coverage (Fig. 1c , subtype-specific). Another approach to generate broader subtype-specific immune responses is to design 'consensus' sequences using computational algorithms 51-56 . One such antigen, termed 'computationally optimized, broadly reactive antigen' (COBRA), induces some cross-reactive antibodies within subtypes, such as H1, H3 or H5, in preclinical studies 51,53,55 . Another informatics approach involves computational analysis of influenza virus sequences and in silico design of synthetic HA antigens. Delivery of such 'mosaic' HA antigens in a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector conferred protection against diverse influenza viruses 57, 58 . These studies suggest that development of a supra-seasonal vaccine that could cover multiple strains within each circulating subtype, and thereby protect against drifted influenza virus strains, is feasible. Coverage can be further expanded to include different subtypes within group 1 or group 2 HA (Fig. 1c , multi-subtype), especially the subtypes with pandemic potential, such as H2N2, H5N1 and H7N9. For example, vaccination with a DNA prime followed by seasonal influenza vaccine boost not only improved HA antibody responses but also induced protective immunity against divergent H1N1 and H5N1 in mouse and ferret challenge models 59 . This prime-boost immunization strategy has shown similar immunogenicity in clinical trials 60 , and together with a H2N2 vaccine can constitute the first generation of a 'pan-group 1 HA' pre-pandemic vaccine. Analogous prime/boost strategies can also be used to improve both B cell and T cell responses with other novel antigens, such as synthetic polypeptides 61 . New classes of immunogens that target the common viral structures among all HA antigens have also been designed and evaluated, and antibodies that react broadly with all HA antigens within group 1, group 2 or influenza B have been isolated 9-36 , further paving a pathway to a vaccine to cover most influenza A and influenza B strains (Fig. 1c , pangroup/lineage; universal flu A; universal flu A and B). A true universal vaccine, however, should protect against all influenza strains and should be durable for multiple years in a single product (Fig. 1c , \"TRUE\" universal). (Table 2) . A nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine encoding HA from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus formulated with lipid nanoparticles induced HA stem-directed antibodies in rabbits and mice and protected mice from a heterosubtypic virus challenge 78 . Virus-like particle influenza vaccines have also been evaluated in various clinical trials, and some have elicited long-lasting immunity and induced cross-reactive HAI responses against heterologous strains [79] [80] [81] [82] . Recombinant protein-based vaccines consist of peptides from conserved viral structures 61,83-85 , and modified live influenza viruses 86, 87 are also being evaluated in late-stage clinical trials (Table 2) . Influenza virus HA has also been rationally designed for presentation on a bacterial-based ferritin nanoparticle 88 . These particles allow HA to retain its native trimeric conformation while displayed in an ordered array, to increase valency that may facilitate cross-linking of B cell receptors. In animal models, this nanoparticle vaccine improved HA antibody responses and conferred protection against heterologous virus challenge 88 , and it is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (Table 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 29, "end": 34, "text": "(Hai)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2382, "text": "57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2385, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3026, "end": 3028, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3122, "end": 3124, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3392, "end": 3394, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 4427, "end": 4431, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 4432, "end": 4436, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 4437, "end": 4441, "text": "[81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4442, "end": 4446, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4583, "end": 4586, "text": "86,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 4587, "end": 4589, "text": "87", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4770, "end": 4772, "text": "88", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 742, "end": 751, "text": "(Fig. 1c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1086, "text": "(Fig. 1c", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1407, "text": "(Fig. 1c", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1733, "text": "(Fig. 1c", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2688, "end": 2696, "text": "(Fig. 1c", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3732, "end": 3740, "text": "(Fig. 1c", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3943, "end": 3951, "text": "(Fig. 1c", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3973, "end": 3982, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 4645, "end": 4654, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 5161, "end": 5170, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Nucleoprotein"}, {"text": "Novel HA-based vaccines Antibodies against HA are a major component of the human immune response to both natural influenza virus infection and influenza vaccination, and measurement of antibody responses against HA by the HAI assay is the recognized correlate of protection from influenza virus infection. As a result, HA is a target for both current seasonal vaccines and many candidates in development for universal influenza vaccines. Seasonal vaccine manufacturers characterize their vaccine products, in part, by measuring and standardizing the quantity of each HA component of their vaccines. Recent advances in structural biology, including crystallography, electron microscopy and bioinformatics, have enabled a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the structure of HA, which has subsequently provided opportunity for vaccinologists to employ structure-guided vaccine design. HA is a type I membrane glycoprotein that forms a homotrimer that is typically glycosylated at between five and seven sites per monomer (Fig. 2a, left) and is the major target of neutralizing antibodies [89] [90] [91] . HA mediates viral entry by binding to its receptor, terminal sialic acids on glycoproteins or glycolipids of host respiratory epithelial cells, and mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell in the endosome 92 . The mole cular structures of HA from different subtypes have been determined. The overall architecture of HA from different strains is conserved, although the surface sequence composition and glycosylation patterns differ among influenza virus subtypes and types, especially in regions near or at the receptor binding site (RBS) localized in the globular head 92 . The RBS itself is a shallow pocket surrounded by three secondary elements, the 130-loop, 190-helix and 220-loop, with a base consisting of four highly conserved amino acid residues. In both H1 and H3 viruses, the number of N-linked glycosylation sites on the HA head increased after they entered the human population, and these modifications can contribute to 'antigenic drift' of the virus 93, 94 . One example is the evolution of a pandemic H1N1 strain into a seasonal strain, during which it acquired two additional glycans near the RBS which effectively masked the respective antigenic regions from recognition by antibodies. Humoral responses to HA have been associated with protective immunity 95 . Antibodies directed to the head region of HA can be routinely elicited by viral infection and seasonal vaccination 10,11,13,14,16-18,20,96,97 . These antibodies provide immunity by blocking viral entry to host cells or preventing receptor-mediated endocytosis. Memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells are often found following infection or immunization to provide durable protection against matched or closely-related viruses. However, these antibodies tend to be strain-specific and do not neutralize drifted variants mainly due to the high mutation rate of the HA globular head, especially in regions around the RBS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1091, "end": 1095, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1100, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1105, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1331, "text": "92", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1696, "text": "92", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2090, "end": 2093, "text": "93,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2096, "text": "94", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2401, "text": "95", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1024, "end": 1039, "text": "(Fig. 2a, left)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Delivery and display."}, {"text": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies against the more conserved stem region of HA were identified as early as the 1990s (reFs 21-31,33-35 ).

Unlike most HA antibodies that recognize the highly variable HA head region, C179 binds to a conserved stem region of the HA. A followup study has also shown that heterosubtypic protective immunity can be induced by vaccination with an immunogen lacking the head domain 99 , suggesting that an HA stem-only immunogen could induce antibodies with more breadth. Subsequently, this class of antibodies was isolated from humans, and structures of several have been extensively characterized 21-31,33-35 .

Most stem-directed antibodies neutralize influenza strains within group 1 or group 2, but a few have been shown to neutralize across both groups within influenza A and at least one, CR9114, protects mice from both influenza A and influenza B virus challenge, although it binds but does not neutralize influenza B in vitro 21-31,33-35 . The generation of these broadly neutralizing antibodies by different vaccination platforms or immunogens in various animal models and in clinical trials has been demonstra ted 59, 60, 88, [104] [105] [106] [107] . Although these stem-directed antibodies are present in humans, most appear to be less prevalent in human sera and less potent neutralizers than those directed to the HA head region 108, 109 . Several different approaches have been taken to overcome these challenges. Immunization of human subjects with preexisting immunity to H1N1 and H3N2 viruses with pandemic vaccines that contain divergent head but conserved stem domains, such as H5N1 or H7N1, have been shown to induce stem-binding antibodies with limited neutralizing activity 104, 106 . Priming with a novel pandemic H5N1 or H7N9 DNA vaccine followed by matched-strain monovalent inactivated virus vaccine boost has improved the breadth of immune response in animals and in clinical trials over monovalent inactivated virus vaccine alone 59, 60 . Broadly neutralizing antibodies that neutralize both group 1 and group 2 influenza virus have indeed been isolated from vaccinees who received this regimen 28,103 . Another approach is sequential immunization with synthetic, chimeric HA in which the HA1 domain is derived from different, novel subtypes while the stem remains the same. Prime/boost immunization with chimeric HA generates cross-neutralizing antibodies and protects animals from heterologous viral challenge [110] [111] [112] [113] . These chimeric HA vaccines have been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial, and the interim analysis suggested that stem binding antibodies that react with select group 1 HA subtypes (H1, H2, H9 and H18), measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, can be boosted in subjects with pre-existing anti-stem antibody titres, although neutralization was not evaluated 114 . Additionally, chimeric HA vaccines can also be constructed with exotic head domain sequences from avian species, allowing the potential for sequential immunization and repeated boosting of crossreactive, stem-directed antibodies [115] [116] [117] . More recently, two groups independently designed and engineered a 'headless' HA construct in which only the NH 2 -terminal and COOH-terminal regions of HA1 and entire HA2 were presented 118, 119 (Fig. 2b) . In one design, the HA stem was stabilized by a trimerization domain 119 , and in the .

Right: HA structural model showing a broadly neutralizing H1 subtype-specific (CH65) antibody bound to the receptor binding site and a pan-group 1 (CR6261) antibody targeting the stem (adapted from Nabel and Fauci 5 ). CH65 is isolated from an adult donor and neutralizes various H1N1 viruses by preventing viral attachment to its sialic acid-containing receptor. CR6261 also comes from a human subject and neutralizes a broad range of viruses within group 1 HA. It recognizes a highly conserved helical region in the HA stem and blocks viral entry by preventing membrane fusion. b | Structural models of novel immunogens that target the conserved HA stem region: stabilized stem HA-ferritin and trimeric mini-HA. Stabilized stem HA-ferritin is generated by fusion of the stem region of HA to a self-assembling ferritin nanoparticle. This immunogen lacks the immunodominant head domain and elicits only stem-specific immune responses. The mini-HA is another 'headless' antigen that preserves the structural and antigenic integrity of the HA stem and has been shown to provide heterosubtypic immunity. www.nature.com/nrd other, the stem was fused and presented on a bacterial ferritin nanoparticle 118, 120 .

As for HAI in the past, immune correlates using more modern reagents and assays can be assessed in experimentally infected humans 207 , and human challenge can also be used to test efficacy of vaccines and passively administered antibody. A major limitation of the human influenza challenge model is that the infection, by intent, is largely restricted to the upper airway. Prevention of lower airway disease is one major objective for vaccine development, so vaccine efficacy cannot be directly assessed for the clinical end point of primary interest. In addition, the numbers and diversity of influenza viruses available for human challenge study are limited so it will be difficult to show vaccine efficacy against multiple viruses. In general, higher doses of virus are used for challenge than are seen in natural infection.

Structural and functional bases for broadspectrum neutralization of avian and human influenza A viruses. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 16, 265-273 (2009). This study isolates a family of broadly neutralizing antibodies, including F10, that recognize a highly conserved epitope within the HA stem and shows that these antibodies are protective against both highly pathogenic H1N1 and H5N1 viruses in animal models. 34.
