In German-speaking countries, the field has been gaining significance as well, but respective efforts in building capacity and advancing the research infrastructure are still rare. The present study investigates barriers and facilitators for conducting implementation science in German-speaking countries with the goal of formulating recommendations for creating a more supportive research infrastructure. We conducted an interview study with nine well-established implementation researchers affiliated with universities in Austria, Germany, or Switzerland. The interviews were held via Zoom or phone in November and December 2020, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Barriers that relate to characteristics of the discipline were difficulties in building a common understanding of the field and the complexity of implementation research projects. Although supportive scientific networks were important facilitators, interviewees mentioned challenges in connecting with likeminded researchers. A further barrier was the lack of opportunities for education and training in implementation science, especially in the German language. Also, participants reported a missing readiness in academia for establishing implementation science that should be addressed by advocacy of the discipline toward academic decision makers. Moreover, since most national funding agencies prioritize basic research over applied research, some interviewees named flexibility in handling research funds as a facilitator for implementation research. The results inform an agenda for promoting implementation science in German-speaking countries and can be beneficial to other countries that are currently advancing their implementation research capacity and infrastructure.",

At their core has been a concern about considerable delays with which research has been translated and used in routine practice. Implementation science offers evidence-based strategies on how to close the research to practice gap in a variety of fields, such as health, education, and social welfare (Albers et al., 2020) . However, establishing implementation science requires a paradigm shift from traditional research infrastructures that commonly focus on clinical or basic research to the application of scientific knowledge in practice.",

Moreover, implementation scientists propose strategies for building national and international public health capacity and help to better understand the role and relevance of different implementation contexts in these efforts (Pfadenhauer et al., 2017) , highlighting that implementation research needs to consider the socio-cultural, socio-economic, and political circumstances (Shelton et al., 2020) .

However, researchers also have described it as challenging to form collaborations with other implementation researchers and community partners (Stevens et al., 2020b) . In a concept mapping study on international collaborations in implementation research, participants rated joint funding as one of the most important, though not very feasible, facilitators (Aarons et al., 2019) .

These courses and training programs not only serve educational purposes, but also provide implementation researchers with valuable networking opportunities . However, in general there is a higher demand than supply of implementation training, which becomes apparent in highly selective eligibility criteria and low acceptance rates in training initiatives (Davis & D'Lima, 2020) . Moreover, the lack of training opportunities has been reported as a barrier for engaging in implementation science (Koorts et al., 2020; Stevens et al., 2020b) .",

For establishing institutional support for implementation science, essential factors include promoting a transdisciplinary dialogue by facilitating meetings across departments and building networks with other universities and community partners (Brownson et al., 2017) . Transdisciplinary exchanges in implementation research also are fostered by the increasing number of international implementation science conferences available to researchers (e.g., Bawab et al., 2020; Landes et al., 2020) . Moreover, there is a multitude of national and international implementation science networks (Shelton et al., 2020) .

An institution could only be represented by one implementation researcher in the sample.

In contrast to other countries, where the field has a longer tradition, there are only few funding streams where such projects would fit the respective scope (for example, the National Research Programme \"Smarter Health Care\" of the Swiss National Science Foundation). Receiving funding was reported to be even more difficult for projects in education and social work than for projects targeting topics in health care. Here, it is difficult to determine whether the problem concerns implementation science in particular or receiving funds for applied research in these fields in general.",

A certain flexibility in using research funds was a reported facilitator, which may also be helpful for handling the unpredictability that comes with studying complex implementation processes in real-world settings. The missing readiness in academia for establishing implementation science as a distinct discipline should be addressed through substantial advocacy such that academic decision makers, for example in funding agencies, get to know the field and understand its importance.",

Hence, a strength of the present study is that it can inform the building of implementation science capacity in countries that are similarly just beginning to establish implementation science as a discipline. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of the infrastructure available to build such a discipline-in the form of education and training, academic roles, research funding, and publication opportunities. It is of additional importance to examine how to best differentiate implementation science from other disciplines attending to similar research questions in a region or country, such as health services research in German-speaking countries. The results of our study might particularly appeal to groups who work on building capacity for implementation research and practice in other languages than English. For this intention, developing resources in the local language, especially for education and training, but also for collaboration with practice partners, is a particularly important facilitator.",

At the same time, due to the small sample, our study might not be generalizable to the whole German-speaking implementation community. In particular, our study lacks the diverse perspectives of implementation researchers whose work is not as visible to the scientific community and who might be able to provide more information on barriers for engaging in the field. Further research also could include the perspective of funders and their impressions of whether implementation research questions have gained relevance in recent years.",

To gain a wider perspective on the topic, we are going to conduct a survey study with a larger sample of respondents to investigate barriers and facilitators for engaging in implementation science to better understand how to promote implementation science in German-speaking countries. This will allow us to study differences in barriers and facilitators between various disciplines and to generate a more differentiated agenda for building a supportive implementation research infrastructure.",

Simultaneously, implementation researchers should seize opportunities to advance their discipline, for example by advocacy and working toward a common understanding of what implementation science entails and offers. The results inform an agenda for the German-speaking implementation community and can be beneficial to other countries, especially those that are in the process of advancing their implementation research capacity and infrastructure.",
