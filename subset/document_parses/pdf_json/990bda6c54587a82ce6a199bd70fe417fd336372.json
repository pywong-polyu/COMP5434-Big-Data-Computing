This may in turn help to avoid the associated risks far, the use of HFNO has been limited, despite the fact it may represent an appropriate initial therapy [12, 13] . Conversely, several studies have shown that the use of invasive mechanical ventilation remains high in this population, and patients usually receive it for prolonged periods of time [14] [15] [16] . In daily clinical practice, the decision to intubate is usually based on several clinical markers, including blood oxygenation [17] , and may differ across institutions [18] . Furthermore, based on experimental [19, 20] and observational data [5, 6] , a so-called \"early approach\" to invasive mechanical ventilation has been advocated for patients with non-COVID related ARDS [5] . Critically ill patients with COVID-19 often have profound hypoxemia which may partially explain the extremely high use of invasive ventilatory support in this patient population. This scenario, combined with the sharp rise in the incidence of COVID-19, has led to an unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems [14, 15, [21] [22] [23] .",

We considered that, in these patients, the HFNO use may have been too short to have a meaningful effect in a patient's outcome [6] . The decision to intubate was left at the discretion of the treating physicians at each participating centre. The primary outcome of interest was VFDs at day 28, calculated as 28 minus the days that a particular patient remained mechanically ventilated [32] . To account for the competing risk of death, deceased patients were considered to have 0 VFDs. Secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay, intubation rate and all-cause in-hospital mortality (and up to 60 days).

The criteria to include variables in this model were based on those potentially affecting the likelihood of outcome occurrence and receipt of study treatments [34] and were performed based on subject matter knowledge with the help of a direct acyclic graph (DAG) (e- Fig. 1 in Additional file 1) [35, 36] . Selected variables included gender, APACHE II, SOFA, Glasgow Coma Scale, systolic blood pressure, pH, respiratory rate, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ), body mass index (BMI), creatinine, bilirubin, platelet, leucocyte and lymphocyte count, lactate, immunosuppression and hospital group (divided into quartiles based on the proportion of patients receiving intubation from the total). The matching procedure was conducted on a 1:1 fashion without replacement and with the calliper of the logit (propensity score) set at 0.2 [33] . Proper adjustment was assessed with standardized mean differences (SMD) in the matched population, and covariate imbalance defined using a SMD > 0.2 threshold [33] . Missing data on important confounders were handled using multiple imputations with a Monte Carlo Markov chain method (details in Additional file 1) [37] .",

Third, given that treatment assignment was not random, both residual and unmeasured confounding remain possible. Hence, we estimated the E-value as a way to determine the association between an unmeasured confounder with both the exposure (HFNO) and outcome that would fully explain the estimated effect (see details in Additional file 1). Fourth, we changed our exposure classification, keeping patients who initially received HFNO and switched within the 24-h window to invasive mechanical ventilation as part of the conservative strategy (HFNO). This was done to evaluate whether the initial classification yielded optimistic estimates by assigning sicker patients with early HFNO failure to the early intubation group. Finally, we assessed the modification of the effect of HFNO on the primary outcome of interest according to baseline severity measured by the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio.

Importantly, the benefits of the use of non-invasive oxygenation/ventilation strategies in the context of acute respiratory failure need to be balanced against the risk of treatment failure, given its potential association with worse clinical outcomes in non-COVID-19 populations [6, 7] .

This study provides additional evidence that in a population with similar baseline characteristics and a potential to be randomized to any of these interventions, the use of HFNO may be associated with an increase in VFDs and shorter duration of ICU length of stay without any significant difference in mortality. Of note, on average, patients receiving early intubation in our cohort were sicker at baseline, as assessed by higher SOFA and APACHE II scores. However, matching achieved good balance in most of the covariates assessed and our results were robust to a variety of sensitivity analysis, including a secondary analysis in which adjustment by imbalanced variables was performed. Further, in the matched population, hypoxemia was profound despite the use of high FiO 2 and the benefit spanned across the entire spectrum of PaO 2 /FiO 2 values, as shown by our sensitivity analysis stratifying by oxygenation levels. This finding suggests that moderate-to-severely hypoxemic patients affected by COVID-19 may benefit from HFNO and that HFNO could potentially decrease the need and duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay without a negative impact in hospital mortality.",

Results for ventilator-free days and intensive care unit length of stay were rounded up or down to the closest whole number treatment was not randomly allocated, both residual and unmeasured confounding are likely even after careful covariate adjustment. Nonetheless, the moderately robust E-value, together with a pre-planned emulation of a target trial increase the confidence in our study findings. Second, the use of VFDs as the primary outcome could be considered to favour upfront the HFNO group, given that a significant proportion of patients on HFNO was not subsequently intubated. As reported elsewhere, this endpoint encompasses both the time spent on mechanical ventilation as well as mortality and, for any given value in a population, both components should be provided to avoid misleading conclusions [32] . Given the similar mortality risk in both groups, the observed differences in VFDs between groups may be mostly driven by a reduction in the need for intubation among those initially treated with HFNO or, as previously stated, may also be due to unmeasured or residual confounding (e.g., patients who are sicker at baseline predominantly receive early invasive mechanical ventilation and have lower VFDs than those who have less severe disease and initially receive HFNO). Although an untestable assumption, our E-value and robustness to a variety of sensitivity analysis may point towards a potential causal effect rather than confounding as the main explanation for this finding. Explicitly, if both the HFNO and early invasive mechanical ventilation groups are considered comparable at baseline (e.g., regarding their initial severity), then the reduction in VFDs remains informative as it points towards a reduction in intubation as the likely mechanistic pathway-something that has been shown elsewhere in the broad population of critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. Third, sample size was limited due to the inability to match a significant proportion of patients. This has to be understood in the context of populations differing significantly (the overall group of patients receiving early intubation was sicker) and the choice of very strict adjustment criteria to improve the precision of the estimates. In light of this fact, clinicians should keep in mind that the potential benefit of the treatment might be limited to patients with similar characteristics to the matched cohort (moderate-to-severe hypoxemic patients without concomitant non-pulmonary organ dysfunction) although two additional sensitivity analysis using the whole population also favoured HFNO. Fourth, missing information was present for several covariates of interest possibly resulting in both information bias and residual confounding. However, our multiple imputation-based results were consistent with the complete case analysis. Fifth, misclassification of relevant covariates and potential predictors is also likely. However, a concise operational manual was provided to all researchers at the study initiation, and two investigators checked for the accuracy of the data and unreliable values for all included patients. Sixth, criteria for intubation were not uniformly defined, and hence, the reported rate of failure and the effect of HFNO may not be generalizable to other settings with distinct clinical practice patterns. Sixth, code status at admission was not recorded and this might have impacted the rate of intubation in the conservative group. Indeed, despite achieving good balance between groups after matching, the presence of cancer was still more common in the conservative group. However, the mortality risk was similar across groups, our results were robust across sensitivity analysis adjusting for imbalanced covariates, and the intubation risk in the conservative group was 38%, which is in line with previous reports [27] . Finally, this study cannot offer any information regarding a potential increased risk of COVID-19 infection in healthcare professionals with HFNO use although studies have not been able to show an increase risk with this therapy [44] .",

However, caution is warranted before drawing definite conclusions since, in the whole population, those intubated early were sicker, and even the most thorough statistical adjustment cannot eliminate confounding entirely. Future studies should corroborate our findings, as a way of optimizing the ventilation strategy for patients with COVID-19 associated acute respiratory failure.",
