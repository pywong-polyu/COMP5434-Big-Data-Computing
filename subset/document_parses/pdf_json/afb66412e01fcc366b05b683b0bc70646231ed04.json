While this has been a long-recognised possibility in a variety of medical specialties including stroke care (2) , it was the rapidity of this transition which has been particularly striking. A close, arguably less discussed parallel to the delivery of clinical care using remote platforms, is the training of healthcare staff utilising similar technologies. Digital transformation of information and knowledge is the most recent paradigm shift (3) in our society, increasingly embraced by healthcare and academic institutions. Here we consider the possibility of leveraging such technologies to address a common, treatable clinical presentation.",

Its incidence is conservatively estimated at 64 per 100 000 population per year (4) and is more common among the elderly population (its prevalence approaching 9% in those >65 years of age) (5) . Diagnosing BPPV is important because the symptoms can be disabling and yet the disorder is easily treated. In most instances, it is thought to be caused by calcium carbonate crystals (from the otolith organs) that settle within the endolymphatic fluid of one or more semicircular canals, where they do not belong. A history of recurrent brief episodes of spinning vertigo triggered by head movement suggests BPPV, but a definitive diagnosis lies on a positional manoeuvre which will elicit positional nystagmus in patients with the disorder. Box 1 highlights the main indications for a positional manoeuvre.",

A manoeuvre such as the Dix-Hallpike should arguably be performed on every patient presenting with dizziness or imbalance because BPPV is common, carries an excellent treatment success rate, and dizzy symptoms are difficult for patients to describe (making history alone insufficient to make a confident diagnosis). Despite being an established procedure for the diagnosis and management of BPPV, positional manoeuvre are still substantially under-performed, mostly where it matters most: general practice and emergency settings, as this is where many patients with BPPV present (7) . As such, there is an unmet need to improve training in positional manoeuvres across emergency, community, and primary care settings.",

We suggest the acceptance of web-based learning as convention provides the opportunity to develop comparative resources, scrutinised for rigour much the same way that a peer review process provides a degree of probity to the reader. Constraints imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic saw clinical services pivot to digital technologies for a number of aspects of patient care. Here we consider if this accelerated implementation of telemedicine could meaningfully extend to training for BPPV, addressing a recognised shortfall of suitably trained healthcare staff. We describe some of the pitfalls to such telemedicine approaches, but also highlight practical factors that will increase the chances of a successful training programme and how existing technology may support this. We focus on the components which should comprise the training package for key positional manoeuvres for the diagnosis and treatment of common types of BPPV, namely Dix-Hallpike for the diagnosis of posterior semi-circular canal BPPV, and the Epley treatment manoeuvre.",

The practical training poses perhaps the most overt challenge given the relative paucity of specialists with training expertise, and the need to cover a wide geographical distribution for sufficient uptake to make a tangible clinical difference at a population level. Remote learning in fact may offer a practical solution by pooling the scant resource of expert educators from almost any geographical location to provide training to a widely distributed audience of learners.",

            "text": "The Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre is a simple bedside examination for the diagnosis of BPPV and can be performed with the patient placed longitudinally on the couch (Figures 1A-C) . If BPPV is diagnosed on the Dix-Hallpike this lends itself to an Epley treatment manoeuvre (Figures 1D-H) . If the history strongly suggests a symptomatic side, it may be best to test the non-symptomatic side first (and then do the manoeuvre on the other side) as it prepares the patient for the manoeuvre without inducing vertigo. The Epley manoeuvre is one standard treatment approach for posterior canal BPPV and involves 5 steps through which the patient's head (and body) is rotated on the couch. It requires space around the couch, but can be performed at a gentle pace, using gravity to guide movement of the offending inner ear crystals through the semicircular canal. These manoeuvres could be taught through remote teaching approaches, using video material and voice-over to guide the learner through the manoeuvre and identify common areas of difficulty or concern that learners may report. Such material could be complemented with virtual or online resources, such as a question-and-answer forum and guidance pertaining to pearls and common pitfalls for the novice non-specialist (Box 3). FIGURE 1 | The first manoeuvre is the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre exploring the right ear (A-C). The patient begins seated in the couch, with the feet longitudinally. The head is then turned towards the ear being explored (right ear in this case). The patient is then lowered backwards such that the head is hyperextended by approximately 30 \u2022 , and overhangs the end of the couch. In the presence of BPPV, there is upbeat and torsional nystagmus beating toward the ground with vertigo, usually lasting only 5-10 s. It may be necessary to open the eyes lightly using your thumb and index fingers to see the nystagmus more clearly. Epley manoeuvre for treating right ear posterior canal BPPV (D-H). After 30 s, the patient's head is rotated toward the other side [leftwards here, (D)], and held in this position for a further 30 s. During this time, the patient is asked to rotate the body so that he/she is lying on their left shoulder (E). It is important to hold onto the head while the patient is instructed to turn, so that it does not change position. The patient's head is rotated by a further 90 \u2022 to the left, to face the ground (F), and held for 30 s. The patient is now sat up, with the head still looking over the right shoulder (G), for 30 s. Finally, the patient's head is brought toward the midline, and the neck flexed, chin down through 45 \u2022 for a final 30 s (H). The procedure is reversed for left posterior canal-BPPV.

However, several approaches might be considered in combination. The use of high quality well produced video content, correctly narrated can provide repeatable demonstration of the correct techniques, to be revisited by the learner as required. Video sessions, with the instructor demonstrating manoeuvres in real-time using a healthy volunteer or mannequin would allow for immediate dialogue and clarification between students and instructor. Similarly, utilising supervised remote practice, where novice learners demonstrate the manoeuvres through real-time video sessions would allow for skilled experts to observe and provide feedback on technique. Another useful tool, easily adopted by remote approaches would be to provide video examples of patients during actual assessment and treatment. While such videos typically focus on interpreting eye movements (which we outline below), an equally important component is providing learning materials which developing an understanding of the heterogenous responses patients may have, particularly to testing. For instance, when patients develop intense symptomatic responses, the specialist will typically be well positioned and able to reassure patient sufficiently to complete the assessment, while having the experience to reassure them and remain unperturbed if the patient becomes nauseous or the assessment results in emesis. Similarly, many patients respond to testing by instinctively reaching to stop themselves being lowered to a plinth or may shut their eyes to alleviate dizziness. Videos which highlight such responses are likely to better prepare nonspecialists and increase the likelihood of a successful manoeuvre.",

We consider two aspects-the first would be any associated risk to the patient, for example, the theoretical risk of arterial dissection in the neck, or perhaps displacing of crystals to adjacent semicircular canals. The second is incorrect diagnosis, both in terms of false positive and negative interpretation of results from the assessment manoeuvre. In both such instances however, this is not a problem exclusive to remote training, rather a consideration for all positional manoeuvre training. Moreover, theoretical risks of injury to the patient through neck \"manipulation\" are not evidenced in the reallife clinical setting, largely because these manoeuvres involve neck movements that lie well within physiological limits. Pillows can used for both the Dix-Hallpike and Epley manoeuvres that further mitigate this theoretical risk and such practical advice could be easily incorporated into remote learning sessions (15) .",

As with many bedside assessments and interventions undertaken by non-specialist staff, the positional manoeuvres we describe here involve a component of patient manual handling.

In any case, the constituent program we outline here focuses on training for the non-specialist with the aim of such training to enhance the assessment and identification and treatment of BPPV. We anticipate such a program would reduce the need for specialist review in many instances, however there will remain many occurrences which necessitate specialist referral. Box 4 provides examples when onward referral may be indicated, such guidance should form a central component of any non-specialist training, and should be adapted based on the setting and staff being trained.",
