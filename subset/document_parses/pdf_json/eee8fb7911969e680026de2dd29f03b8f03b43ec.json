As a result, vaccination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines produces high levels of plasma neutralizing activity against all variants tested 1,2 . Here we examine memory B cell evolution five months after vaccination with either Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals. Between prime and boost, memory B cells produce antibodies that evolve increased neutralizing activity, but there is no further increase in potency or breadth thereafter. Instead, memory B cells that emerge five months after vaccination of naive individuals express antibodies that are similar to those that dominate the initial response. While individual memory antibodies selected over time by natural infection have greater potency and breadth than antibodies elicited by vaccination, the overall neutralizing potency of plasma is greater following vaccination. These results suggest that boosting vaccinated individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines will increase plasma neutralizing activity but may not produce antibodies with equivalent breadth to those obtained by vaccinating convalescent individuals.",

By contrast, the memory B cell compartment contains long-lived antigen-specific B cells that mediate rapid recall responses that contribute to long-term protection 18 . To examine the nature of the memory compartment elicited by one or two mRNA vaccine doses and its evolution after 5 months, we used flow cytometry to enumerate B cells expressing receptors that bind to Wuhan-Hu-1 (WT) and B.1.351 (K417N/ E484K/N501Y) RBDs (Fig. 2a , b, and Extended Data Fig. 2 ). Although neutralizing antibodies develop to other parts of the spike protein, we focused on the RBD because it is the dominant target of the memory antibody neutralizing response 19, 20 . Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD-specific memory B cells developed after the prime in all volunteers examined, and their numbers increased for up to 5 months after vaccination (Fig. 2a) . Memory B cells binding to the B.1.351 (K417N/E484K/N501Y) variant RBD were detectable but in lower numbers than B cells binding WT RBD in all samples examined (Fig. 2b) . Whereas IgG-expressing memory cells increased in number after the boost, IgM-expressing memory B cells that made up 23% of the memory compartment after the prime were nearly absent after boosting (Extended Data Fig. 3a) . Finally, circulating RBD-specific plasmablasts were readily detected after the prime but were infrequent after the boost (Extended Data Figs. 2d and 3b).",

Notably, unique clones appearing after 1.3 and 5 months represented a greater or equal fraction of the total memory B cell pool relative to persisting clones (16% versus 9.6% and 5.1% versus 4.7%, respectively) ( Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3d , e, g). Finally, memory B cells emerging after the boost showed significantly higher levels of somatic mutations than plasmablasts or memory B cells isolated after the prime, and they continued to accumulate mutations up to 5 months after the boost ( Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3h , i). In conclusion, the memory B cell compartment continues to evolve for up to 5 months after mRNA vaccination.",

The improvement was reflected in all clones (IC 50 Fig. 7b ). The increase in neutralizing activity between the first and second vaccine doses was associated with a decrease in the percentage of non-neutralizing antibodies (defined as having IC 50 >1,000 ng ml -1 ) and increased representation of neutralizing antibodies (P = 0.003) (Fig. 3a) . In conclusion, memory B cells recruited after the second dose account for most of the improvement in neutralizing activity in this compartment when comparing the two vaccine doses. Thus, in addition to the quantitative improvement in serum neutralizing activity, there is also an improvement in the neutralizing activity of the antibodies expressed in the memory compartment after boosting.",

These were compared to seven previously reported 25 individuals exhibited an increase in potency (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4c-e) . Moreover, only 4 of the 19 (21%) antibody pairs from vaccinated individuals showed improved potency against pseudotypes carrying B.1.617.2 (Delta variant)-specific RBD amino acid substitutions (L452R/T478K), while 11 of 16 (69%) of the convalescent antibody pairs showed improved activity against this virus (P = 0.007) (Fig. 4c-e) . We conclude that there is less increase in breadth in the months after mRNA vaccination than there is in a similar interval in naturally infected individuals.",

Notably, neutralization titres elicited by vaccination exceed those in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 at all comparable time points assayed. Nevertheless, neutralizing potency against variants is significantly lower than against Wuhan-Hu-1, with up to 5-to 10-fold-reduced activity against the B.1.351 variant 5, 6, 13, 14, 35 . Taken together with the overall decay in neutralizing activity, there can be a decrease of 1-2 orders of magnitude in serum neutralizing activity against variants after 5 or 6 months when compared with the peak neutralizing activity against Wuhan-Hu-1. Thus, antibody-mediated protection against variants is expected to wane significantly over a period of months, consistent with reports of re-infection in convalescent individuals and breakthrough infection by variants in fully vaccinated individuals [36] [37] [38] [39] .",

Notably, the difference between the memory compartments that develop in response to natural infection versus mRNA vaccination reported above is consistent with the higher level of protection from variants conferred by natural infection 39 . There are innumerable differences between natural infection and mRNA vaccination that could account for the differences in antibody evolution over time. These include, but are not limited to, (1) route of antigen delivery (respiratory tract versus intramuscular injection) 44,45 ; (2) the physical nature of the antigen (intact virus versus conformationally stabilized pre-fusion spike protein) 46 ; and (3) antigen persistence (weeks in the case of natural infection 7 versus hours to days for mRNA vaccination) 47 .

The majority of participants (n = 28) were de novo recruited for this study, while a subgroup of individuals (n = 4) were from a long-term study cohort 13 . Eligible participants were healthy adults with no history of infection with SARS-CoV-2, as determined by clinical history and confirmed through serology testing, receiving one of the two Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines according to current dosing and interval guidelines. Exclusion criteria included incomplete vaccination status, presence of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva or positive COVID-19 serology. Seronegativity for COVID-19 was established through the absence of serological activity towards the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Participants presented to the Rockefeller University Hospital for blood sample collection and were asked to provide details of their vaccination regimen, possible side effects, comorbidities and possible COVID-19 history. Clinical data collection and management were carried out using the software iRIS by iMedRIS (v.11.02). All participants provided written informed consent before participation in the study, and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice principles.

Plates were washed six times with washing buffer (1\u00d7 PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich)) and incubated with 170 \u03bcl per well of blocking buffer (1\u00d7 PBS with 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma)) for 1 h at room temperature. Immediately after blocking, monoclonal antibodies or plasma samples were added in PBS and plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plasma samples were assayed at a 1:66 starting dilution with 10 additional threefold serial dilutions. Monoclonal antibodies were tested at a 10 \u03bcg ml -1 starting concentration with 10 additional fourfold serial dilutions. Plates were washed six times with washing buffer and then incubated with anti-human IgG, IgM or IgA secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) ( Jackson Immuno Research, 109-036-088 and 109-035-129; Sigma, A0295) in blocking buffer at a 1:5,000 dilution (IgM and IgG) or a 1:3,000 dilution (IgA). Plates were developed by addition of the HRP substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (ThermoFisher) for 10 min (plasma samples) or 4 min (monoclonal antibodies). The developing reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcl of 1 M H 2 SO 4 , and absorbance was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA microplate reader (FluoStar Omega, BMG Labtech) with Omega and Omega MARS software for analysis. For plasma samples, a positive control (plasma from participant COV72, diluted 66.6-fold with 10 additional threefold serial dilutions in PBS) was added to every assay plate for normalization. The average of its signal was used for normalization of all other values on the same plate with Excel software before calculating the AUC using Prism v9.1(GraphPad). Negative controls of pre-pandemic plasma samples from healthy donors were used for validation (for more details, see ref. 3 ). For monoclonal antibodies, the ELISA EC 50 was determined using four-parameter nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism v9.1). EC 50 values above 2,000 ng ml -1 were considered to correspond to non-binders.",

Pie charts showing only IgG memory B cells from 8 individuals (in additional to the 3 vaccinees shown in Fig. 2c) after d, prime and 1.3-months post-boost and e, 1.3-and 5-months post-boost. The number inside the circle indicates the number of sequences analyzed for the individual denoted above the circle, with Pfizer vaccinees indicated by (P) and Moderna by (M). Pie slice size is proportional to the number of clonally related sequences. The black outline and associated numbers indicate the percentage of clonally expanded sequences detected at each time point. Colored slices indicate persisting clones (same IGHV and IGLV genes, with highly similar CDR3s) found at more than one timepoint within the same individual. Grey slices indicate clones unique to the timepoint. White slices indicate repeating sequences isolated only once per time point. f, Graph shows the relative percentage of clonal sequences of IgG memory B cells at each time point from n=11 vaccinated inviduals illustrated in",
