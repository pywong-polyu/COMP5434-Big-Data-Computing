This increases the number of known P.3 infections in the United States to eleven and highlights the importance of genomic surveillance within industries that are prone to rapidly spread the infection.",

These individuals were employed by a contractor to the oil and gas company, and all had recently traveled from the Philippines. Reconstruction of their timeline showed they tested negative in the Philippines, immediately prior to boarding a USA flight. Upon arrival in the USA, the workers went into a 14-day quarantine. They were retested after 9 days, at which point they were all qPCR+ and serology negative. None reported COVID-19 symptoms. The expected time interval between exposure and test positivity (3-4 days post-exposure for qPCR, >1 week postexposure for serology), as well as the workers' testing timeline (Figure 1a) , suggest a recent exposure after their flight to the United States.",

Fortunately, due the testing policies implemented, this particular variant was identified prior to deployment so that the workers continued quarantine until they were no longer considered a risk. Other employees have not contracted P.3 and are thought not to have been exposed.

            "text": "likely emerged from the Central Visayas region in the Philippines[3] , the location of the earliest sampled sequence in this lineage in GISAID (January 2021). The majority of sequences assigned to this comparatively rare lineage are from the Philippines, although it has also been detected in the United States (n=8), Europe (n=24), and Oceania (n=4). The earliestidentified P.3 infection in the United States was at the end of March in California (n=3), with additional cases detected in Washington (n=3), Virginia (n=1), and West Virginia (n=1).To address a potential outbreak, we downloaded the masked alignment of all sequences submitted to GISAID (www.gisaid.org), extracted all sequences assigned to the P3 lineage (n=189), and inferred a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using IQTREE v2[4] (Figure 1b; Table S1). The four Louisiana cases are clearly derived from a single origin and are separated from the most related P.3 sequences by a long branch, which likely resulted from the substantial time separating the Louisiana samples from the rest (2+ months). The sequences are part of a well-supported clade whose basal members are all from the Philippines. Elsewhere on the tree, well-supported clades of P.3 sequences from Europe, USA, Oceania, and/or Asia indicate multiple introductions to those locations. Interestingly, the most basal sequence of the entire P.3 clade (closest to the root of the tree) is from Europe, although it is separated from the rest of the P.3 tree by a long branch.P.3 is a considered a VariantUnder Investigation (VUI) by Public Health England (PHE) [5] and was formerly considered a Variant of Interest by the World Health Organization, as all P.3 viruses contain multiple concerning mutations shared with other Variants of Concern as denoted by PHE (VOCs; B.1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351) in the spike protein, including E484K, N501Y, and P681H [6],",
