This finding highlights the difficulties in interpreting the significance of a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 result without concomitant antibody testing after the epidemic wave. Indeed, children positive on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and positive for IgG probably had little or no infectivity [22] . In a study of 9 patients, attempts to isolate the virus in culture were not successful beyond day 8 of illness onset, which relates to the decreased infectivity beyond the first week [23] . .

In a region strongly affected by the epidemic (Paris area) but during the lockdown, very few children (1.8%) were positive on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, but the rate of children positive on serology (10.7%) was higher. Despite the relatively large number of children included (>600), we did not find a significant difference in the rate of positive RT-PCR or serology results between asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic children.This fact supports that it is unlikely the cluster screening of symptomatic children in the community will be relevant.Among asymptomatic children, those with history of symptoms during the preceding weeks accounted for one third of children with positive serology results (13/41), which supports that asymptomatic infections are frequent in children. In contrast, history of symptoms during the preceding weeks increased significantly the risk of positive serology.However, on multivariate analysis, the only factor influencing the positivity of RT-PCR or serology was the household contact who has previously presented symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. This was noted whether this infection was proven by RT-PCR or unproven due to the absence of availability of the test. Of note, the number of siblings in the family did not significantly increase the probability of a positive RT-PCR or serology result. This finding suggests that children were usually infected by an adult in the family[11].Without contact with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case, the frequency of positivity on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 or serology was extremely low: 0.7% for RT-PCR and 2.9% for serology. Of the children positive on RT-PCR (n=11), only 3 had no antibody response, and 8 were positive for IgG with or without IgM positivity. This finding supports that for these 3 patients, contamination had occurred during the 2 weeks before enrollment.",

The low infectivity is also supported in our study by the fact that only 5 children had positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 result for all 3 amplified genes, among which only two children presented C t between 27 and 30, suggesting not very high viral load. Our study has several limitations. First, the role of assumed household transmission probably has been over-estimated because of the well-followed lockdown in France [25]. Indeed, more than 86.5% of children with positive SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or serology have had a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 household contact. Second, our rate of positive serology possibly does not reflect the epidemiologic situation in the Paris area for children. Probably because COVID-19 families already affected were more likely to consult and agree to participate in the study, the population of parents of enrolled children were possibly overrepresented of COVID-19-affected families as compared with the general population. Indeed, we found, 17.1% of the children included had a confirmed infected close relative and 32.3% had contact with a person household with suspected infection (without testing). Estimates of the rate of patients who were infected with SARS-Cov-2 in the Paris area was lower, close to 12% [26].",
