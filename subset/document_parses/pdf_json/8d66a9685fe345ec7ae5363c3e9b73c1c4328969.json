            "text": "Purpose of Review Cardiovascular toxicity is a leading cause of mortality among cancer survivors and has become increasingly prevalent due to improved cancer survival rates. In this review, we synthesize evidence illustrating how common cancer therapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines, human epidermal growth factors receptors (HER2) monoclonal antibodies, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have been evaluated in cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to understand the underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity. We place this in the context of precision cardio-oncology, an emerging concept for personalizing the prevention and management of cardiovascular toxicities from cancer therapies, accounting for each individual patient's unique factors. We outline steps that will need to be addressed by multidisciplinary teams of cardiologists and oncologists in partnership with regulators to implement future applications of hiPSCs in precision cardio-oncology. Recent Findings Current prevention of cardiovascular toxicity involves routine screenings and management of modifiable risk factors for cancer patients, as well as the initiation of cardioprotective medications. Despite recent advancements in precision cardio-oncology, knowledge gaps remain and limit our ability to appropriately predict with precision which patients will develop cardiovascular toxicity. Investigations using patient-specific CMs facilitate pharmacological discovery, mechanistic toxicity studies, and the identification of cardioprotective pathways. Studies with hiPSCs demonstrate that patients with comorbidities have more frequent adverse responses, compared to their counterparts without cardiac disease. Further studies utilizing hiPSC modeling should be considered, to evaluate the impact and mitigation of known cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, diabetes, and physical activity in their role in cardiovascular toxicity after cancer therapy. Future real-world applications will depend on understanding the current use of hiPSC modeling in order for oncologists and cardiologists together to inform their potential to improve our clinical collaborative practice in cardio-oncology.",

            "text": "The prediction of cardiovascular toxicity for the goal of prevention includes identifying risk factors, comorbid conditions, and regular screening through echocardiography, electrocardiography (ECG), serum biomarkers, and other methods as applicable [3] . Predicting risk for toxicities has always been difficult, with the prediction of risk for targeted therapies proving especially challenging. There are no proven methods of precisely predicting which particular individuals are most likely to develop cardiovascular toxicity from cancer therapies. Drug classification, clinical, and host variables can provide some insight into who may be at risk, but alone, these methods are inadequate. The benefits of accurate risk prediction are obvious, e.g., guiding treatment decisions before the first dose is given. This can be particularly important for agents with a lengthy half-life and high potential to cause life-threatening cardiac complications, e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors and their association with myocarditis. A personalized approach for each patient may help optimize efforts at prediction and prevention. Such an approach may integrate clinical factors, treatment plans, and individual characteristics such as those elucidated by genomics (assessing the individual's entire complement of genes), proteomics (assessing the individual's entire complement of proteins), and other \"omics.\" The integration of such a personalized medicine (or \"precision medicine\" approach) may present an opportunity to address these needs for better prediction and prevention in cardio-oncology. Therefore, to pinpoint individuals at risk and modify their care in response, precision medicine may prove especially beneficial. This integration may allow for novel insights into pathomechanisms and the development of more precise and cost-effective risk prediction tools, with the overall objective of better therapy decisions before, during, and after cancer treatment.",

HiPSCs have the potential to revolutionize the care of patients by offering an individualized assessment of cardiovascular risk regarding short-term and long-term side effects of cancer therapies. HiPSCs can be used to offer in vitro screening which can potentially be used to develop and assign a precise and personal safety score that could be developed in the future to help oncologists and cardiologists anticipate and prevent cardiotoxicity. HiPSCs may thereby play a role in predictive and preventive personalized medicine. HiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are starting to play a critical role in cardio-oncology, specifically in disease modeling, researching new cancer therapies, and investigating the toxicity of current therapies [3] . The advantages of using hiPSCs over animal models are the elimination of interspecies variability and preventing many of the ethical or legal restrictions associated with investigations using human embryonic stem cells. Further, hiPSCs can be patient-specific, diminishing interindividual variability and biases, which can be particularly beneficial for population-based studies.",

We ultimately describe current basic research and potential translation to future clinical practice in precision cardio-oncology. toxicity in each patient, with the eventual goal of reducing morbidity and mortality for all oncology patients. Precision cardio-oncology can allow for a patient-centered treatment approach for cardiovascular toxicity, aiming for a personalized cancer treatment regimen based on personalized tumor characteristics of each patient. Precision cardio-oncology may help us advance the understanding of the disease phenotype in cancer patients exposed to common oncology therapies. One way in which this can be accomplished is using hiPSCS to dissect how a patient's cardiovascular risk, cancer type, and cancer treatments play a role in the potential development of cardiovascular toxicity. Research is also being pursued using hiPSCs to further understand the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular toxicity, in order to reduce the mortality and morbidity in cancer patients.",

Incorporating data from different perspectives (e.g., proteomics, kinomics, genomics, and metabolomics) can offer mechanistic insight, uncover important risk factors, and may pinpoint new treatment options [4, 5] .

This provides opportunities to apply precision medicine to increase the understanding, management, and prevention of cardiovascular toxicity caused by cancer therapies. Yet, the effect on clinical practice is yet to be determined. To consider the context in which precision cardio-oncology involving hiPSCs will ultimately be practiced, cardiovascular risk factors, risk stratification, potential for modeling individualized cardiotoxic patient responses to therapy, opportunities for prevention, and the future of using hiPSCs for prevention, prediction, and precision must be considered.

The American Heart Association (AHA) recognizes blood pressure, BMI, smoking status, fasting glucose, diet, total cholesterol, and physical activity as risk factors in the development of both cardiovascular risk factors and cancer [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Furthermore, it is hypothesized that cardiometabolic risk worsens in patients with cancer even prior to treatment due to metabolic derangement [12, 13] . Additionally, treatment modalities for cancer, such as pharmacologic cancer therapy, radiation therapy, and less so surgery, can also lead to further worsening of cardiac disease [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

The hiPSCs are typically generated by acquiring primary human cells for reprogramming by key transcription factors, termed \"Yamanaka\" factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc [38] . The Yamanaka factors induce the pluripotent cells to exhibit the states of lineage plasticity that are capable of differentiation into many cell types [38] . Oct3/4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin28 (Thomson factors) were also described as being sufficient for reprogramming human cells [39] . Multiple reprogramming methods are in use today, the most common being Sendai retroviral transduction, with episomal iPSCs being used more often in recent years, eliminating mutations caused by viral integrations [40] . Other methods involve mRNAs, microRNA/mRNA transfection, minicircle vectors, and lentiviral transduction. Some of these methods are capable of reprogramming primary cells and generating transgene-free and virus-free iPSCs. Transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of the resultant hiPSCs indicated that reprogramming of human primary fibroblasts did not differ significantly among the methods used, with standardized protocols [41] .",

The selected donor primary cell type is important since molecular profiles may be distinct and cell-typespecific. An example study involved hiPSCs derived from umbilical cord blood cells and neonatal keratinocytes, which had discrete patterns of epigenetic markers that aid in transcriptional regulation (i.e., DNA methylation) [42, 43] . Inconsistencies were seen in DNA methylation profiles upon differentiation to six different cell types representing all three germ layers. The differentiated cells retained some DNA methylation patterns of the parental cell types, although the functional implications of such residual epigenetic marks remain unclear [44\u2022\u2022] . Consequently, many factors play a role in variations seen among hiPSC lines, such as primary human source cell type, viral load, passage number, and growth and sub-culturing techniques. The key molecular signatures or biomarkers retained during this process may be important for imminent modeling strategies. Time is also an issue as some primary cells require culturing and expansion before reprogramming.",

The likely range of time it takes to start seeing the initiation of beating is approximately 8-10 days [46] . There are numerous individual protocols for the differentiation of hiPSCs into CMs, and although most are analogous, there are still many researchers that are \"fine-tuning\" the protocols by further optimizing media, growth conditions, and nutrient supplementation, as well as creating more specific and detailed differentiation timelines. Reported by multiple groups, the effects of various methods of optimization for hiPSCderived CMs specifically lead to increased cell mass and cellular expansion capabilities, improved contractility and force generation, enhanced calcium (Ca 2+ ) kinetics and cycling, and increased membrane capacitance and activation or suppression of specific metabolic pathways, which eventually yield high numbers of mature hiPSC-CMs [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] .",

A research group imaged and characterized action potentials (APs) in subtype-specific hiPSC-CMs [58] .

The ratio of RFP/GFP is equal to the AP, and these data closely match the accompanying gene expression data, verifying the method [58] .",

Such components of more complete molecular and phenotypic maps of human physiology and pathophysiology will likely enhance modeling of cardiotoxicity.

To date, hiPSCs have primarily been used for retrospective studies, given the timeline needed for the process of deriving specific cells from hiPSCs while patients undergo cancer therapy. Various intricate details of differentiation protocols are important for cell maturity, production, and integrity, whether in culture or cryofrozen waiting to be cultured again when the patient may need them the most.

The most commonly used anthracyclines are doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, and idarubicin. The mechanisms of action include the creation of free radicals, interference with macromolecular biosynthesis, DNA adduct formation, and interference with topoisomerase II activity [61] . Despite their effectiveness in cancer treatment, anthracyclines can cause cardiovascular toxicity that negatively affects patients' outcomes and seriously limits their oncological therapeutic opportunities. The effect of anthracyclines on topoisomerase II\u03b1 (TOP2\u03b1) is generally considered the molecular basis of anthracycline activity as this isoform has the main chemotherapeutic role during replication and cell proliferation [62, 63] . In contrast, topoisomerase II beta (Top2\u03b2) has been associated with side effects of anthracyclines such as cardiovascular toxicity. It was shown that most hiPSC-CMs do not express TOP2\u03b1 and that TOP2\u03b2 was expressed in all CMs, which is also true for adult terminally differentiated CMs. TOP2\u03b2 inhibition leads to the activation of protein kinase B, inhibition of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and more pronounced phosphorylation of further downstream elements such as glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 [64] . The resulting impaired energy signaling by AMPK inhibition likely initiates a negative feedback loop that potentiates doxorubicin-induced energy deficits and seriously compromises heart resistance to additional energy stress. The resulting cellular changes lead to the generation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS; i.e., superoxide, O 2 \u2212 ; and hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2 ), impaired Ca 2+ homeostasis, mitochondrial damage, and induction of cell apoptosis [65] . ROS contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction by an effect on NADH dehydrogenase of the electron transport chain in the presence of molecular oxygen [66] . Topoisomerases are important enzymes required to create necessary chromatin remodeling to enable DNA replication and transcription. Topoisomerase II, which creates doublestranded breaks to enable this remodeling, is expressed as isoenzymes Top2\u03b1 and Top2\u03b2. Top2\u03b1 is expressed in actively dividing cells, while Top2\u03b2 is present in quiescent cells such as CMs [66] . In CMs, anthracyclines bind Top2\u03b2, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and activating \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, p53, and apoptosis [67] . In animal studies, the absence of Top2\u03b2 has protected subjects against anthracyclineinduced cardiovascular toxicity [68, 69] .",

This endeavor is difficult due to the inability to accurately represent human heart tissue for drug safety screening methodologies [70] . HiPSCs have become a novel tool to mimic the attributes of CMs and effectively test their reactions to various drug candidates (e.g., anthracyclines) to predict cardiovascular toxicity [70] (Table 1 ). In current clinical practice, the prediction of anthracycline-induced cardiovascular toxicity remains imprecise. The use of hiPSC-CMs could help reveal a patient's susceptibility to cardiovascular toxicity at the level of a single cell [72] . The investigators described a powerful approach that uses CMs from patient-specific hiPSCs to investigate the differential sensitivity of individuals with breast cancer to doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. They used hiPSCs from individuals with breast cancer who were treated with doxorubicin and either did or did not develop doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. To study doxorubicin cardiovascular toxicity, the authors used current state-of-the art methods to generate high-purity preparations of CMs from the hiPSCs. Remarkably, in an extensive array of in vitro assays, the hiPSC-CMs from individuals who experienced doxorubicin-induced cardiovascular toxicity reproducibly showed greater sensitivity to doxorubicin toxicity than did hiPSC-CMs from treated patients who did not exhibit toxicity.",

Lentiviral plasmid or adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated overexpression and knockout experiments of the QKI gene, Qki5, in multiple mouse cell types and lines lead to the conclusion that QKI regulated specific circular RNAs (circRNAs) which demonstrated anti-apoptotic effects and mediated doxorubicin-induced cardiovascular toxicity [78] . The future will continue to yield more effector molecules and potential therapeutic candidates. Another group described an engineered, multi-chamber tissue chip complete with a 3D human micro-organ system consisting of colon cancer tumor spheroids in a fibrin gel, hiPSC-CM spheroids in a separate compartment in fibrin gel, and hiPSC-ECs in a microfluidic channel compartment in between. The chip was used to evaluate cardiotoxicity within 48 h of doxorubicin administration to gauge the drug effects on beat frequency and conduction velocity of hiPSC-CMs, as measured by electrodes within the chip and intracellular Ca 2+ concentration. The group observed that doxorubicin reduced both the beating rate and conduction velocity at or near the half inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ; drug efficacy), consistent with previous in vivo literature [79] . GWAS indicated that a variant in the retinoic acid receptor gamma gene, RARG, was associated with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, but follow-up replication and functional analyses were lacking. Other investigators accumulated case (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 55%) and control patients with and without doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Patient-specific hiPSC-CMs from cases retained that sensitivity in vitro, whereas the wild-type (WT) hiPSC-CMs remained insensitive. When the mutation of RARG-S427L was genetically corrected in cases, hiPSC-CMs had a reduced cardiotoxic effects upon doxorubicin exposure, whereas the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity increased when the RARG gene was knocked out using genetic editing technologies in controls [80] . These studies highlight how patient-derived hiPSCs can be used to infer direct or causal roles in the toxic effects of a common chemotherapy agent. Using hiPSCs in ways like these to investigate and facilitate the prevention of cardiovascular toxicity is a rapidly progressing area, and there are a growing number of research articles highlighting hiPSCs in the modeling of anthracyclines, specifically.",

            "text": "HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that regulates intracellular signaling pathways within various cell types. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are HER2 monoclonal antibodies that are commonly used to treat breast cancer. RTKs are enzymes that activate proteins via transfer of a phosphate group to a tyrosine residue in a signal transduction cascade. Cancers can overexpress RTKs on their cell surfaces, leading to amplified intracellular signaling, cell proliferation, and tumor initiation [81] . HER2 overexpression is a hallmark of breast cancer and is found in approximately 15 to 20% of all invasive breast cancers [82] . Its proliferation on tumor cells has led to targeted drug therapeutics, including trastuzumab and pertuzumab [83] . Though from the same drug class, these two antibodies (HER2-mAbs) differ in their epitope binding site on the receptor, but their mechanistic action to downregulate intracellular signaling and stimulate a type 1 immune (Th1) response through Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIIa activation of cytotoxic cells is similar [84] . In addition, margetuximab, another HER2-mAb with a higher affinity for activating a Th1 response, is also being investigated to treat HER2-positive breast cancer in addition to HER2-positive gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma [85] . Cardiovascular toxicity, especially cardiac dysfunction defined as reduced LVEF, manifests as congestive heart failure (CHF) and is a common side effect of trastuzumab. Underlying mechanisms are still being investigated [86] . The hiPSC models are a promising development in this space that will allow study groups to more clearly identify specific cardiotoxic mechanisms of HER2-mAb therapies and could enable the prediction of susceptibility to cardiotoxicity or offer potential therapies for cardioprotection [87] . Toxicity and adverse effects of margetuximab are still under investigation, though promising clinical trials in patients report little to no adverse effects with the most serious being anemia or infusion-related reactions [88] . Table 1 provides a summary of studies that attempt to identify specific cardiotoxic mechanisms of trastuzumab and predict susceptibility to cardiovascular toxicity. One group evaluated underlying cellular mechanisms of trastuzumab cellular toxicity using hiPSC-CMs [89] . In the study, patient-specific hiPSC-CM models were created for patients on trastuzumab therapy, independent of the development of cardiac dysfunction. The study investigators demonstrated that patientspecific hiPSC-CM models can effectively predict a patient's risk of trastuzumab-induced cardiovascular toxicity [89] . Another group discovered that clinically relevant doses of trastuzumab impaired contractility, Ca 2+ handling, mitochondrial function, and energy metabolism pathways [90\u2022] . These findings expanded the previously proposed mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity, e.g., activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways [91, 92] , gene alteration of mitochondrial function, and DNA repair [89, 90\u2022] . Hence, hiPSC-CM models can be used in vitro to recapitulate the cardiotoxic responses of individual patients, predict patient outcomes related to drug safety and efficacy, and further help identify the mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity [72] .",

The most common TKIs include imatinib, erlotinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, crizotinib, gefitinib, and dasatinib. These drugs are a widely used chemotherapeutics that are used to treat various malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. TKIs selectively prevent phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases without interfering with other serine or threonine kinases. TKIs were shown to competitively inhibit 57 of 317 human kinases tested at the clinically relevant dose of 0.1\u03bcM [93] . Selective inhibition of RTKs prevents signaling cascades that lead to over-proliferation, angiogenesis, and growth particularly by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [94] [95] [96] . These targeted agents have improved antitumor efficacy and fewer toxic side effects than earlier chemotherapeutic agents. Crizotinib is a TKI primarily used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [34] . It is an inhibitor of the RTK anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and the proto-oncogene c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET/HGFR) [57] . Erlotinib is generally used for therapy in advanced or metastatic pancreatic or NSCLC and works by inhibiting the activation of EGFR [57] . Nilotinib (a bcr-Abl inhibitor commonly used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia) increases ROS generation and caspase activation and induces arrhythmic beating [34] .",

Different TKIs show cytotoxicity in hiPSC-CMs, endothelial cells (EC), and fibroblasts (FB), which suggests that TKIs differently affect cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular cell types [93] . Crizotinib induces cholesterol and ROS accumulation and increases caspase activity and in turn increases the S-T interval [34] . Erlotinib generally has more minor effects and does not directly change ROS generation or heart rhythm [34] . When the effects of four different TKIs (erlotinib, lapatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib) were studied on hiPSC-CMs, each showed slightly different physiology and gene and protein expression. Sorafenib was shown to inhibit mitochondrial ATP production, shifting hiPSCs to rely on glycolysis for energy. This showed that adaptive drug resistance and cardiotoxicity associated with the drug is a consequence of metabolic remodeling instead of inhibition of signal transduction [97] .",

The most well-known side effect is hypertension, mainly caused by disruption of the VEGF signaling pathway (VSP) which modulates vasodilation [60] . Up to 47% of patients taking sunitinib and 40% of patients taking sorafenib developed hypertension [60] . TKIs are also documented to cause cardiac left ventricular systolic dysfunction and CHF; 11% of patients taking sunitinib develop CHF or significantly decreased LVEF [96] . Cardiovascular toxicity of TKIs varies widely and depends on the selectivity of the TKIs to certain tissues; sunitinib bound over 15% of kinases included in the human kinase assay [93, 98] . Sunitinib decreased hiPSC-CM viability, increased lipid accumulation, and induced arrhythmic events [34] . Although sunitinib targets multiple RTKs, it was reported that cardiac-specific activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) could be an effective therapeutic approach to treat sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity [99] . The VEGF2/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-inhibiting TKIs can induce cardiovascular toxicities in hiPSCs at clinically relevant concentrations [74] , although different TKIs have distinct toxicity profiles; not all TKIs induce cardiovascular toxicity [98] . The pathophysiology of toxicity includes decreased nitric oxide signaling, increased endothelin-1 production, and increased capillary refraction in the endothelium [96] . A long-ranging goal for TKI development should be tissue-or cell-type-specific selectivity and targeting specific kinases in order to reduce cardiovascular toxicity and other global side effects which could be investigated using hiPSCs.",

Advancements have come with the continuous infusion of a limited dose of liposomal doxorubicin [6] . Anthracycline analogs are being investigated for the treatment of anthracyclineinduced toxicity, with hopes of producing less cardiotoxic effects, as well as fine-tuning administration schedules [100] . However, the success of these analogs varies by clinical setting and malignancy, where reductions in cardiovascular toxicity were not always achieved [1] . Many of the cardiotoxic molecular and cellular mechanisms are linked to the highly conserved intracellular kinase: AMPK. It is apparent that this highly conserved intracellular AMPK is at the crucial point of many mechanisms shown to be involved in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, and cardiac AMPK signaling itself has been shown to be impaired by anthracyclines [77] . In a key study, doxorubicin reduced AMPK levels, and AMPK phosphorylation was observed in the heart even before the onset of cardiac dysfunction [101] . Cardioprotection via AMPK activation was achieved in preclinical studies with AMPK-activating agents, such as metformin and sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) [102] . HER2 activation triggered by exogenous neuregulin-1 could also possibly be used to reduce doxorubicin toxicity [77] . Similar to anthracyclines, trastuzumab toxicity could also be rescued using metabolism-stimulating agents, such as AMPK [90\u2022] . Dexrazoxane is the only FDA-approved agent specifically used to prevent anthracycline-induced cardiovascular toxicity. Though an iron chelator used as a cardioprotective agent when administering anthracyclines, its cancer-related outcomes remain controversial and remain under FDA restrictions for use with patients with metastatic or advanced breast cancer [103] .",

The task of acquiring cells from a patient in a minimally invasive manner, reprogramming the cells into hiPSCs, differentiating them into desired cell type(s) of interest, performing toxicity screens, and extrapolating a patient's risk of developing cardiotoxicity using defined biological and molecular methodologies ( Fig. 1) is where the field of precision cardio-oncology is heading. The future will encompass the identification of biochemical markers and validation studies to confirm current mechanisms of disease and toxicity and identify new mechanisms, screening therapeutic drugs in patient hiPSC-derived cells, and use of cell therapy, grafting, or transplant without the immunological, acute, or chronic adverse effects. It may be plausible that tissue and cell banking will become a routine of every patient where hiPSCs, hiPSC-CMs, or EHT, for example, are readily available when needed by the patient themselves or in massive toxicity screens [112] . Scaling of these types of tissues and cells for population retrospective or prospective studies using forward or reverse genetics and molecular profiling will likely require a global agreement of sorts. It will be imperative to agree on standardized operating procedures, quality assurance, and quality control of many aspects of the reprogramming, culturing, and differentiation methods to ensure maximal reproducibility, purity, and safety, all while doing so in a cost-efficient and timesaving manner. Precise control and regulation of hiPSC-based in vivo therapies will be necessary to prevent tumor formation by overactive cells. A great example will be of hiPSCs with engineered artificial receptors and surrogate antigens (low cost) that can trigger endogenous signal transduction pathways in a dose-dependent manner. STAT3 was activated through signal cascade by an engineered artificial receptor which prevented heart failure and guided hiPSC-CMs into more mature CMs upon doxorubicin administration [113] .",

While there are many limitations to this trial, the ongoing study elucidates the possibility of a similar system being used in cardiooncology. To date, there is one clinical trial using hiPSCs as a platform to investigate the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines and trastuzumab (NCT03199300).
