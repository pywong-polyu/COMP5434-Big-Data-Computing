With a quarter of the world's population infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), conservative models have forecasted a 20% increase in TB deaths in the five years after COVID-19 has waned compared to pre-pandemic mortality, in large part due to interruptions in TB diagnostic and therapeutic services [2] . Identifying and managing comorbidities is critical to diagnostic services, including diabetes mellitus (DM) [1, 3] . DM is projected to affect up to 700 million individuals by 2045 [4] . Patients with DM-TB have a higher MTB bacillary burden than patients without DM, leading to a delayed bacillary clearance from the sputum, and subsequently, an increased risk of poor treatment outcomes: death, drug resistance, and relapse [4, 5] . Despite consistent reports that people with DM are three times more likely to develop active TB than people without DM, laboratory diagnostics for DM are rarely performed among people with TB in endemic settings [3] .",

Such transient hyperglycemia may be driven by inflammation and progressive immune response to disrupted MTB containment, with the release of tumour necrosis factoralpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) causing both low insulin production and increased resistance and possible correlates with severity of TB disease [11] [12] [13] .",

Notably, 14% had diabetic range hyperglycemia despite normal RBS readings. If Table 3 . Binary logistic regression model for predictors of the development of diabetic range hyperglycemia (HbA1c \ufffd 6.5%) at treatment completion in the normoglycemia and prediabetes groups. including patients that developed DM range hyperglycemia at TB treatment completion, a remarkable 39% of the total population had a prior history of DM or DM range hyperglycemia at some point during the treatment interval. Yet, a considerable proportion of hyperglycemia was transient and normalized with TB therapy alone and without other hypoglycemic medication. Hence, the NNS to diagnose one new case of DM at TB treatment initiation was 5.7 but increased to 16 if performing POC HbA1c only at treatment completion. Notably, among those with normoglycemia or prediabetes at treatment initiation, weight gain > 5% during TB treatment significantly increased the risk of developing diabetic range hyperglycemia at treatment completion and maybe a target population for repeat screening. Our findings demonstrate the limitations of using RBS to screen DM among people with active TB disease and undernutrition and the potential misclassification of DM at TB diagnosis even when using HbA1c levels. Our cohort in Bangladesh may have differed from others performing DM testing at TB diagnosis, which have found a varying prevalence of undiagnosed DM in relative proportion to community DM prevalence [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Instead, this cohort from urban Dhaka may be more representative of the younger, \"lean\" phenotype with active TB and hyperglycemia that has been described from the Indian subcontinent [21] . Although patients with TB-DM are usually > 35 years compared to TB patients without DM in other cohorts and in considering classification at treatment initiation in this cohort [4, 16, 18] , patients with persistent hyperglycemia at treatment completion were younger with a mean age of <35 years. Besides age, higher BMI (\ufffd25 kg/m 2 ) has been identified as a risk factor for DM [22] ; however, this threshold may underestimate risk in patients with specific dietary habits, and certainly among wasting diseases such as active TB, where the mean BMI for the DM group in our cohort was only 22\u00b14 [21, 23, 24] . Other markers of body fat distribution, such as waist to hip ratios or mean upper arm circumference, while not measured in this cohort, maybe more correlative with DM disease risk than weight or BMI.",

            "text": "In addition to anthropometrics, insulin levels may help classify the DM disease spectrum more accurately. It has been shown that chronic hyperglycemia impairs the initiation of adaptive immunity and increases susceptibility to TB infection in a murine model of diabetes induced by streptozotocin [25] . The therapeutic effect of anti-TB drugs depends on both adaptive and innate immunity. A drastically upregulated immune system during anti-TB treatment could substantially increase the levels of TNF\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and interleukin-17, which could lead to insulin resistance and DM [26] . These changes could be transient, and follow-up studies are needed to examine the link between inflammatory cytokines, hyperglycemia, and anti-TB drug efficiency. More importantly, along with HbA1c levels, fasting glucose and insulin levels may be monitored during treatment. In this cohort, we identified a further 35% of all TB patients with prediabetes at treatment initiation but were otherwise clinically similar to the normoglycemia group. Prediabetes range hyperglycemia was also transient and normalized for the majority at treatment completion, similar to the few other TB cohorts where blood sugar has been prospectively measured [8, 9, 27] . However, long-term studies would be needed to determine if DM or prediabetes range hyperglycemia at TB treatment initiation that normalizes with TB treatment is associated with a higher likelihood of DM disease and DM complications later in life.",

Weight change had been reported in prior studies to be one of the predictors of treatment response in TB infected patients [29, 30] . In our cohort, weight gain of >5% of body weight was also significantly associated with the development in diabetic range HbA1c in patients not known to have DM. Prior case reports have argued for medication-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance from the extensive hepatic metabolization of rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide [13, [31] [32] [33] [34] , which usually disappears after two weeks of stopping TB treatment [13] . Further research measuring glycemia and insulin dynamics beyond TB treatment is ultimately needed to determine if the post-TB DM phenotype is more akin to gestational diabetes [34] or if those patients carry a different risk of developing relapse of TB disease [35, 36] .",

However, there were several limitations. We could not confirm the POC HbA1c simultaneously with serum HbA1c levels considering that POC HbA1c results may be influenced by the presence of hemoglobinopathies, history of recent blood loss, or transfusions [16, 37] . Yet, these conditions, as well as underlying chronic medical conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, asthma or chronic kidney diseases) were not reported and are otherwise less common in this setting and age group. A recent study in Ontario showed a strong positive correlation between serum HbA1c and POC HbA1c [38]; however, in some patients with severe anaemia, POC testing may overestimate HbA1c values by 1.1% [37] . Although patients' outcomes were mainly favourable, we did not collect more precise time measurements to sputum culture conversion to negative (microbiological cure) as one could with regular sputa collection. Instead, we relied on the programmatic routine, which uses the less frequent smear microscopy during follow-up, a much less sensitive technique for detecting viable bacilli. A larger study with a more rigorous sputum culture may better determine differences between the persistent and transient hyperglycemia groups and their microbiological outcomes.",

However, limiting testing for DM to only TB diagnosis potentially misclassified the majority of DM range hyperglycemia, which was instead transient and normalized with TB treatment completion. We suggest a re-testing strategy at treatment completion for patients with DM range hyperglycemia identified at TB diagnosis and those with normoglycemia and prediabetes that gain >5% of weight during treatment. Further longitudinal research is needed to characterize biomarkers that differentiate the transient from the persistent hyperglycemic phenotypes and their correlation with longer-term DM disease and late manifestations of TB infection, including relapse.
