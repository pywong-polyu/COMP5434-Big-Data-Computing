            "text": "The impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns on air quality around the world have received wide attention. In comparison, assessments of the implications for water quality are relatively rare. As the first country impacted by COVID-19, China implemented local and national lockdowns that shut down industries and businesses between January and May 2020. Based on monthly field measurements (N = 1693) and daily automonitoring (N = 65), this study analyzed the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on river water quality in China. The results showed significant improvements in river water quality during the lockdown period but out-of-step improvements for different indicators. Reductions in ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 + -N) began relatively soon after the lockdown; chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) showed improvements beginning in late January/early February and mid-March, respectively, while increases in pH were more temporally concentrated in the period from mid-March to early May. Compared to April 2019, the Water Quality Index increased at 67.4% of the stations in April 2020, with 75.9% of increases being significant. Changes in water quality parameters also varied spatially for different sites and were mainly determined by the locations and levels of economic development. After the lifting of the lockdown in June, all water quality parameters returned to pre-COVID-19 lockdown conditions. Our results clearly demonstrate the impacts of human activities on water quality and the potential for reversing ecosystem degradation by better management of wastewater discharges to replicate the beneficial impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown. Capsule summary: River water quality improved during China's COVID-19 lockdown, but returned to normal conditions after the lockdown.",

According to the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard (https:// covid19.who.int/), as of 6 August 2021, 199.5 million people have been infected with the coronavirus leading to over 4.2 million deaths worldwide. COVID-19 can spread rapidly via primary modes of transmission that include droplets, direct contact, and faecal-oral pathways (Chen et al., 2020) . To slow down the diffusion of the virus, more than 170 countries have implemented localised or national lockdown measures (https:// www.theigc.org/blog/a-policy-trade-off-the-impacts-of-stringent-covid-19-lockdowns/). These included shutting down industries and businesses, closing international and provincial borders, and moving education online (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52103747).",

            "text": "COVID-19 lockdowns have had significant impacts on economic activities with implications for national and regional economies. COVID-19 led to an economic recession, with a projected negative global economic growth rate of -4.9% in 2020 (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/ WEO). The pandemic has also been linked to an increase in some pollutants, in particular those associated with single-use plastic items and equipment (Haque et al., 2021) , considerable social tension and confusion, and negative attitudes towards public transportation (Sharifi and Khavarian-Garmsir, 2020) . Conversely, positive environmental impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns have been reported by numerous studies (Braga et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2021; Paital, 2020; Saadat et al., 2020; Yunus et al., 2020) . In particular, many studies across the world have suggested that COVID-19 lockdowns improved air quality by reducing nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and particulate matter (PM 2.5 or PM 10 ), as well as noise (Bar, 2020; Khan et al., 2021; Saadat et al., 2020; Tadano et al., 2021; Tob\u00edas et al., 2020) . Sudden reductions in human activities also impacted wildlife enabling them to move into normally human-dominated zones (Bar, 2020; Khan et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2020) . Paital (2020) even suggested that the COVID-19 lockdown was a self-regenerating nurture strategy of the environment in a global context. Some studies have reported positive impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns on water quality (Khan et al., 2021; Saadat et al., 2020; Sharifi and Khavarian-Garmsir, 2020) . For example, reduced discharges of industrial effluent and vessel traffic improved water transparency in Venice Lagoon, Italy (Braga et al., 2020) . Yunus et al. (2020) reported that within Lake Vembanad, the longest freshwater lake in India, the concentration of suspended particulate matter decreased by an average of 15.9% during a period of lockdown in April 2020. Elsewhere in India, the impacts of lockdown have been identified in both chemical and biological water quality parameters within groundwater samples from the city of Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) (Selvam et al., 2020) . However, to our knowledge, analyses of the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on water quality across an entire nation have not been investigated.",

Human activities, including the rapid pace of urbanization and agricultural intensification, have seriously impacted water quality throughout parts of China (Ho et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018) . For example, human-induced eutrophication has exacerbated algal bloom conditions in many lakes (Ho et al., 2019) and is clearly reflected in the quantity and composition of organic matter in lakes along the Yangtze River (Liu et al., 2020a) . Heavy metal pollution in China's lakes and reservoirs also displayed an increasing trend during the period 2005-2017 . In tackling the nation's water pollution problems, China implemented \"Detailed Rules for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution of the People's Republic of China\" in 2000 (http://www.gov.cn/flfg/2005-08/06/content_21045. htm). These rules focus mainly on establishing wastewater discharge standards and controlling pollutant discharges to improve the quality of freshwater environments (Qin et al., 2007; Tong et al., 2017) . The temporary closure of many sources of these discharges during China's COVID-19 lockdown provides a unique opportunity to investigate both the impacts of pollution reduction on water quality and the potential benefits from more stringent discharge standards.",

Based on environmental monitoring data from January to June of the years 2018-2020, this study quantifies the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on river water quality across China with the following specific objectives: (1) to statistically analyse the influence of the lockdown on water quality indicators; (2) to explore the possible reasons for water quality improvements; and (3) to offer policy suggestions to alleviate water pollution in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the impacts of COVID-19 on water quality across an entire nation during and immediately after lockdown.",

Taking April 2020 as an example, 78.3% of the monitored rivers with poor water quality were placed in this class due to high COD and NH 4 + -N, low DO, or inappropriate pH.

The numbers continually declined to only 1.04 million on 19 February (Fig. 2a) . Subsequently, because of the removal of lockdown restrictions in some provinces (Table S1 ), passenger numbers increased gradually until the end of the period (Fig. 2a) . The beneficial impact of the lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 was evident in the declining numbers of newly confirmed cases in China. Table S2 , the water quality standards are shown on the right axis. After peaking at 15,153 on 12 February, the daily number of new cases declined, and by 19 April, it was consistently less than 50 (Fig. 2a) . On 2 May, Wuhan's emergency response level was adjusted to Level II, marking the end of COVID-19 lockdowns across China. The COVID-19 lockdown also shut down many industries. These closures are indicated by the negative CGoIAV values for most provinces between February and May 2020 (Fig. S1 ). Compared to the industrial added values in 2019 (Section 2.4), all provinces/regions across China had negative CGoIAV values in February 2020, and most were still negative in May; the mean CGoIAV was -13.5% in February, gradually rising to -2.8% in May. Most of the largest declines in CGoIAV were for provinces in eastern China. In Hubei, the province most hard-hit by COVID-19, the CGoIAV was as low as -46.2% in February, increasing to -26.2% in May (Fig. S1) .",

Many studies have suggested that the COVID-19 lockdown reduced atmospheric pollution (Bauwens et al., 2020; Shi and Brasseur, 2020; Wang and Su, 2020) . Atmospheric deposition is an important source of water nutrients, which can further increase COD by enhancing primary production (Pandey et al., 2014) . Although the COVID-19 lockdown had limited impacts on the relatively small economic activities in western China (Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Tibet) (Fig. S1 ), the available data suggested improving air quality (Wang and Su, 2020 ) did lead to some improvements in water quality within this part of China. Mean NH 4 + -N of in-situ snow samples in January 2020 (0.9 mg/L) was close to that in December 2019 (0.87 mg/L) (Fig. S4a) . However, it declined to 0.48 mg/L in February 2020, with reductions of 45.3% and 46.9% from December 2019 and January 2020, respectively. The largest decline at an individual site was 81.4%, and the average across the five sites with lower NH 4 + -N concentrations was 62.7% (Fig. S4b) . The water quality improvements across different monitoring sites were mainly determined by the site locations and the levels of economic development.

Although the responses of different water quality indicators to pollutant reduction during the COVID-19 lockdown were out-of-step, pH, DO, NH 4 + -N, and COD returned to normal levels after the lockdown in June 2020 (Section 3.3). Explanations for the relatively quick return to these levels include the fact that some provinces ended their lockdowns before May, in some cases as early as late February (Table S1 ). Another reason is that the economy rebounded rapidly, leading to the discharge of large volumes of wastewater as lockdowns were lifted. CGoIAV across China as a whole was -13.5% in February 2020, but increased to -1.3% in June. By December of the same year, CGoIAV was positive at 2.8% (https://data.stats.gov.cn/).

First, the mean values of water quality indicators across all stations indicated improvements (Section 3.2), although some stations showed water quality deterioration (COD at a station in Shandong Province for example; Fig. S5 ). In addition, water quality indicators at some stations fluctuated much more than at others (Figs. S5 and S6), which might reflect the influence of local changes in wastewater discharges or precipitation causing changes in river discharge. For example, the sudden rise and subsequent decline in COD in June 2020 (Fig. S6 ) on sites along the Yangtze River is most likely to be the result of summer flooding (Zhou et al., 2021) .",

Conversely, the dominant trend was for a decline in NH 4 + -N and COD concentrations. Changes across the four water quality parameters investigated in detail were concentrated during the period of February-May but were out-of-step. Moreover, changes in these water quality parameters at different sites varied according to spatial location and economic development. After China's lockdown, water quality returned to levels experienced in the two previous years that were not subject to lockdown. These results demonstrate the influence of human activities on China's water quality and the potential for addressing the nation's water quality problems by reducing wastewater discharges. Sustained and targeted strategies will, however, be required if the short-term improvements in China's river water quality exhibited during the unprecedented conditions in 2020 are to be replicated in the long term.
