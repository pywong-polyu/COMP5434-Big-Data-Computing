Prior to infection, we determined negative serologic status toward SARS-CoV-2 of the breeding colony by an indirect receptor-binding domain (RBD)-ELISA (1) . All animals used in the trial tested RT-qPCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 on the day before infection by rhinarium, oral, and rectal swabs. For the duration of the study the animals were kept in individually ventilated cages (IVCs) with a light regime of 12 hours illumination and 12 hours darkness. Drinking water and a rodent diet were provided ad libitum. All handling procedures were performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions.",
