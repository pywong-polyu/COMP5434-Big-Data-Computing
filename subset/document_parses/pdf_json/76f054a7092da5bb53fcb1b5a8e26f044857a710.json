However, it is higher than the study conducted in St Peter hospital, Addis Ababa (21.2%) [63] , St Paul Hospital (21.9%) [64] , multinational multicenter study (8.7%) [65] , Middle East country (23.6%) [66] , Iran (25.8%) [67] , China 8.5% [68] (14.3%) [69] , India (17.7%) [47] , Italy (19.8%) [70] , Malaysia (29.7%) [71] , and Australia (21%). This discrepancy may be due to differences in workload, socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors, variation in the availability of personal protective equipment and resources, the difference in emotional response related to previous experience/exposure with SARS, MERS, and H1N1 epidemics, and also it may be related to the different cut-off scores used to define levels of clinically significant anxiety. According to this study being older than 40 years is significantly associated with anxiety. The finding is also supported by a study reported from Debre tabor [49] , Saudi Arabia [72, 73] . South Korea [74] and India [75] . This may be due to older health care providers are among the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of illness severity and mortality, increased risk of transmission more prone to complications, and they could also live with young children and/or have older people in their extended family, which could cause them to worry about bringing the virus home to their family members as well as older health care workers tend to have lower stress reactivity, poor emotional regulation and well-being than younger HCPs. Moreover, they are also more likely to suffer psychological impacts such as anxiety due to isolation, heavy workload, and facts about the COVID-19 pandemic which is complicated by pre-existing physical health problems, medical comorbidities, and existing mental health symptoms.",

This finding is supported by research findings in St Paul, Ethiopia [64] , Saudi Arabia [55] , India [75, 84] , and the United Kingdom [87] . which states that HCWs who were either married or married with children were more depressed than those among unmarried HCWs/ living alone [84] . The possible explanation could be primary worry of all HCPs was the safety of their families during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was regarded as a major depressive factor. Furthermore, married HCPs were found to be more hopeless, concern for family members and their wellbeing could contribute to their feeling of hopelessness.",

Besides these in a study conducted in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) showed that Nurses and other HCPs in non-physician roles experienced greater depressive symptom severity compared to HCPs in physician roles [82] .
