Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) are a recognized effective psychological practice characterized by attention control, awareness, acceptance, non-reactivity, and non-judgmental thinking obtained through the practice of meditation [2] . In this research, we will evaluate the effectiveness of an MBI applied through a mobile application. We want to know if variables such as positive affect, forgiveness, character strengths or satisfaction with life improve thanks to the intervention in a context of confinement produced by the COVID- 19. In recent years, MBI have experienced a great boom and have shown their effectiveness in different contexts, especially in the field of health, both as complementary therapy to treatment and as therapy to improve well-being [3] . Recent studies point out the beneficial effects of mindfulness practice on mental health, reducing stress, anxiety-depressive symptoms and improving sleep quality, among others [4] [5] [6] .",

During the early stages of the pandemic, many researchers reported the need to provide interventions to support the mental health of people affected by the COVID-19 crisis [7] , highlighting the use of MBIs [8] [9] [10] . For example, Matiz et al. [7] found that mindfulness improved resilience and well-being during the COVID-19 confinement in Italy. Similarly, Jim\u00e9nez et al. [11] studied the role of mindfulness practice as a protective factor in the confinement situation, by fostering emotional resilience. They found that self-compassion, which increased with mindfulness practice, was associated with better coexistence during confinement. Thus, the practice of mindfulness has been associated with greater resilience and, therefore, better coping strategies.",

In the workplace, previous studies show that mindfulness is effective in managing workrelated stress [16] , reducing social anxiety and aggression [17] , as well as to increase happiness in employees [14] . Similarly, mindfulness has been positively associated with a number of strengths that are important for successful job performance; such as emotional intelligence [18] , self-compassion and tolerance of ambiguity [19] , coping skills [16] , and management self-efficacy [20] . Regarding the above, the scientific literature raises the importance of some psychological variables such as satisfaction with life, affects and various aspects of personality in promoting positive job performance [21] .",

Technological advances have made it possible to conduct interventions via mobile phones in a cost-effective and flexible manner and to adapt them to users' needs [31] . Currently, it is estimated that there are more than 31,000 health-related applications and they have been used in many areas such as the promotion of healthy habits, the control of chronic diseases, the follow-up and control of vital signs and the monitoring of fitness, among others [32] . Mobile health (mHealth) is an emerging field that has created new opportunities [33] . It offers advantages such as constant availability, greater access, equity of resources, immediate support, anonymity, personalized content, lower cost and increased capacity and efficiency of the service, the suppression of geographical barriers to treatment, and the ability to involve traditionally hard-to-reach groups [34] . With the increase in the number of people with access to smartphones, the complexity and potential of health applications will grow and have an increasing impact on the population [32] . Despite this, there is little information available on the quality of such applications, beyond subjective reviews published in providers' online markets. As a result, the selection of these applications is based more on their popularity than on objective information about their effectiveness [35] .",

Many of these applications are based on the theory of mindfulness [31] . In this sense, mindfulness applications have shown to decrease perceived stress, depressive symptomatology and to improve sleep quality [31, [38] [39] [40] . Similarly, they have proven effective in improving emotional well-being, increasing satisfaction with life and promoting positive mental health [41] . Such is the efficacy of these mobile applications that some studies suggest that interventions using mindfulness-based applications may show more benefit than traditional interventions [31, 42] . Thus, Morrison-Wylde et al. [42] compared the effectiveness of two mindfulness interventions, one traditional and the other using a mobile application, on job satisfaction and burnout in a sample of novice nurses. The results showed that the intervention with mobile application provided more benefits compared to the traditional intervention in nurses without symptoms of post-traumatic stress, showing more compassion and job satisfaction, and less burnout.",

Regarding gender, the CG consisted of 54 women (72.0%) and 21 men (28.0%), and the EG of 82 women (92.1%) and 7 men (7.9%). Although there is a pronounced bias towards the female population, this proportion is similar to the university population in the field of studies analyzed. Furthermore, the OECD [43] indicators on higher education indicate that there are large gender differences according to the field of study. For example, the percentage of women in the area of education in the United Kingdom is 74%, in Ireland it is 68% and in Spain it is 81%, and with regard to the area of health and social services in the United Kingdom it is 79%, in Ireland it is 75% and in Spain it is 72%. Furthermore, in other recent studies on mindfulness, the gender distributions are similar to those in our research [3, 44, 45] . Finally, according to a recent review that analyzed the gender distribution of all published peer-reviewed trials on mindfulness [46] , men accounted for less than 29% of nearly 10,000 participants. Table 1 shows a summary of the main information of each of the assessment scales used in the study. FFMQ was created by Baer et al. [47] from the five most commonly used questionnaires to measure mindfulness trait. It consists of 39 items which are answered according to a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = never o very rarely true, 5 = very often or always true) that are grouped into five factors: (1) observe (ability to perceive internal or external stimuli), (2) describe (label the experience through words), (3) act with awareness (explicit attention to one's own present activities), (4) non-judgment of the inner experience (not establishing a value judgment in the face of perceived thoughts, sensations or emotions) and (5) non-reactivity to the inner experience (distancing and period of time without reaction to the experience). These factors are grouped into a general factor that contemplates the traits of mindfulness. The questionnaire has adequate psychometric guarantees of reliability and validity, and has good sensitivity to differences in mindfulness practice [3, 44, 51] . It has been validated in different languages and cultures, in countries such as Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, China, Norway and Chile [52] . Cronbach's alpha in the pre-test and post-test for FFMQ were 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. The Cronbach alphas for each factor in the pre-test and post-test can be found in the diagonal of Table 2 .

These three factors are grouped into an overall factor called Total Strengths (total BSS). This strengths model has been shown to be highly effective clinically in improving well-being, increasing resilience and reducing distress [49] and has been shown to be invariant with respect to gender, age, education levels and marital status [54] . Cronbach's alpha in the pre-test and post-test for total BBS were 0.85 and 0.89, respectively.

It can therefore be concluded that the intervention was effective in increasing the mindfulness trait. It should be noted that this occurred even when in the pre-test the CG achieved significantly higher scores on the mindfulness trait than the EG. Previous literature suggests that the benefits of this increase in mindfulness would extend to both the professional and personal domains [61] . In a recent meta-analysis by Mesmer-Magnus et al. [61] of 270 studies (n = 58592) on the implications of mindfulness trait in the workplace, positive correlations were found with confidence, job satisfaction, job performance, mental health, emotional regulation, satisfaction with life and interpersonal relationships, while mindfulness trait was found to reduce burnout, perceived life stress, negative emotions, anxiety and depression. According to Glomb et al. [62] MBI has the power to improve self-regulation, making it easier to improve social relationships in the workplace, make employees more resilient to challenges and increase task performance.",

It should also be noted that the participants were quarantined because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so it would be necessary to replicate the research in normal situations to see if the intervention through the mobile application maintains (or increases) its effectiveness. However, this has shown that mindfulness can be an effective technique for dealing with stressful life situations such as confinement. The intervention was carried out when the participants were in quarantine in Spain for 31 days, and during that time they were not allowed to leave their homes except for reasons of force majeure. This meant that people could not, for example, go for walks or play sports, unlike in other surrounding countries where they could.
