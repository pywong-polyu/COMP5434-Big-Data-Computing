For the applicants, the fellowship interview allows them to assess the training environment and culture, become acquainted with the program faculty members, and present themselves in the best light to future mentors. For the training program faculties, the interview allows assessment of the applicants' maturity and self-con dence, and their ability to articulate thoughts, listen well, and ask relevant questions. [1] The interview was found to be the single most important factor used in resident selection within the eld of ophthalmology and other specialties of medicine. [2, 3] Similarly, prior surveys of program directors identi ed the interview and communication skills as criteria weighed most heavily in the selection of fellows in oculoplastics, retina, glaucoma, cornea, and oculoplastics. [4, 5] The interview was often the most important factor in ranking fellowship candidates in other medical specialties. [6, 7] In 2020, the coronavirus disease pandemic and related travel restrictions made in-person interviews infeasible for most ophthalmology fellowship programs. As a result, most programs adopted virtual interviews via videoconferencing, as well as other changes in format such as switching from the one-to-one interview format to multiple faculty-on-one interviews to economize the interview time periods. The impact of these changes on candidate ranking is not well understood.",

Furthermore, the year 2020 agreement may be signi cantly better than the years 2018 and 2019 agreement due to limited ability to assess body language as a result of virtual interview. To test these hypotheses, we performed a comparison of ranking variabilities between different interviewer-pairs for the 2020 interviews, and compare the candidate ranking categories between 2018, 2019 and 2020 interviews.",

The ranking range spanned between 0 (no difference in ranking range) to 17 (widest possible range), with the most common ranking difference being \"2\" amongst all WSR (n = 28, 22.2%) and NWSR (n = 114, 13.2%) pairs. Overall, the mean difference in the ranks between NWSR and WSR was 1.33 (95% con dence interval [CI] difference 0.61 to 2.04, p = 0.0003), with the NWSR pairs having a greater variability (greater difference in the ranks of the 2 interviewers) than the WSR pairs. This implies that WSR interviewers, on average, ranked candidates 1.33 places closer to each other than NWSR interviewers. Furthermore, when comparing the rank range of each of the 7 WSR pairs to the 48 NWSR pairs, WSR pairs ranked candidates closer to each other than NSWR pairs, although this difference is only signi cant or marginally signi cant in 3 of the 7 comparisons (Table 1) . Effect of in-person versus virtual interviews on ranking variability A 3-way comparison of variability between 2018/2019 (in-person interviews) and 2020 (virtual interviews) ranking variabilities amongst interviewers who were present at all three years showed no signi cant differences between inperson and virtual interviews (Table 3) . When comparing agreement of candidates being in \"accept,\" \"alternate\" and \"pass\" categories, the weighted Kappa statistic was 0.086 for 2018, 0.158 for 2019, and 0.101 for 2020 (p < 0.05 for all years). Since the weighted Kappa statistic for 2020 is within the 95% CI of the weighted Kappa statistic for both 2018 and 2019, the 2020 virtual interviews did not result in a greater degree of disagreement in the categorization of candidates when compared to the in-person interviews in 2018 and/or 2019 (Table 4) . Mean diff. (beta) = mean difference resulted from subtracting the rank range from one year to another. Candidates with the least and greatest ranking variabilities For 2020, we assessed the variability of rank ranges for the overall most and the least attractive candidates. The overall least attractive candidate has the lowest variability (indicating a high degree of agreement amongst the interviewers), while the most attractive candidate has the second lowest variability. The greatest discordances were with the candidate ranked 8th (GLM estimated average difference = 5.93) and the candidate ranked 5th (GLM estimated average difference = 5.31). However, a candidate's overall composite ranking (1 to 18) was not signi cantly associated with the variability in the individual pair's rankings (p = 0.8597).",

In our institution, a change from one-to-one interviews to multiple-on-one produced less variabilities in candidate rankings amongst interviewers who shared the same virtual room. This is likely due to the decreased variabilities of the candidates' presentation due to decreased variety of questions, although cognitive biases due to groupthink and herd effects may allow the more in uential member of the interview team to overshadow dissenting opinions.",

While the limits of videoconferencing on nonverbal body language perception may present a barrier to adequate care in telemedicine, [9, 10] it does not seem to affect candidate rankings when compared to in-person interviews. This is supported by two prior surveys in which candidates to surgical fellowships felt that they were able to present themselves satisfactorily to the training program through a videoconferencing format when compared to in-person interviews. [11, 12] In our clinical training program, the candidates with the least and second least variabilities were the least and most desired candidates, suggesting that individual opinions converge at the most and least quali ed applicants. However, the candidates with the most variabilities (thus with the most disagreement) were ranked 5th and 8th, which are on the cusps of being from the \"alternate\" to either the \"accepted\" or \"pass\" categories, and perhaps the interview committee's greatest deliberation effort would be spent on adjudicating these two positions.",

First, we do not know whether the nding of decreased ranking variabilities of WSR interviewers would have occurred if they were in the same physical rooms. Second, our results relate to fellowship selection in one subspecialty at a single academic institution, which may limit its generalizability to other disciplines. Third, we could not gather data on the candidates' ranking variabilities of glaucoma fellowship programs to assess whether the effects we have observed applies to the candidates. Despite the lack of differences in variabilities in virtual interviews compared to-in person interviews, prior studies showed that most candidates consider the in-person interview experience to be better than virtual interview experience, and in-person interview candidates felt better acquainted with the faculty and current trainees compared to virtual interview candidates. [13] Furthermore, in-person interview candidates were also more likely to agree that the interview experience was su cient to allow them to make a ranking decision, [14] while many virtual interview candidates felt that they did not get an adequate understanding of the program. [15] In summary, in our clinical glaucoma fellowship program, a change from one-to-one interview resulted in less candidate ranking variabilities between interviewers paired in the rooms, which may decrease the candidates' opportunities to represent themselves satisfactorily. A change from in-person to virtual interviews did not result in greater candidate ranking variability, while greatest agreement occurred with the least and most attractive candidates. However, prior studies showed that candidates in general prefer in-person interviews, a factor that should be weighed substantially when deciding whether to substitute in-person fellowship interviews with virtual interviews.",

In 2018 and 2019, the interviews were conducted in-person and one-to-one, whereas in 2020, the interviews were conducted virtually using a Zoom platform (Zoom Video Communications Inc., San Jose, CA) and two-on-one (faculty to applicant) or three-on-one. For each year, all interviews were completed in the same day. As the interview day progressed, each faculty interviewer was asked to individually rank the candidates from 1 (the most attractive candidate) to the highest number (the least attractive candidate). It was required that all ranking start with 1, be consecutive, and no two candidates may share the same rank. Following the interviews, these individual interviewers' preliminary candidate rankings were pooled, and a composite rank list was generated, with the candidate with the rank closest to 1 being the most attractive, and the one farthest from 1 being the least attractive. The committee then adjusted the rankings in a structured discussion. More than one discussion meeting may have occurred before a nalized rank list is submitted to SF Match.",

In all years, each interview was allotted a 15-minute time slot. Two warnings were given when there were threeand one-minute remaining.

Once the internal candidates were removed from the data sets, each interviewer's rankings were adjusted by collapsing the removed rank. For example, if an interviewer had ranked the internal candidate as 3, then all subsequent rankings were reduced by 1 (so the person ranked faculty member was paired with all other included faculty members (except those with which he/she was WSR in 2020), and the ranges were determined for each year. However, since a different number of candidates were interviewed each year, this resulted in different rank ranges for each year, and analyses across different years based on the range of ranks could be confounded. To avoid this problem, when comparing across different years, we translated the rankings into 3 categories: accept, alternate, and pass.
