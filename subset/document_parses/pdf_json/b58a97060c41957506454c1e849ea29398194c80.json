Singer built on the long-standing observation that communities most impacted by new epidemics often are already facing other threats to their health. In the case of HIV among marginalized people in the U.S., those threats included \"a set of closely interrelated endemic and epidemic conditions (eg, HIV, TB, STDs, hepatitis, cirrhosis, infant mortality, drug abuse, suicide, homicide, etc.), all of which are strongly influenced and sustained by a broader set of political-economic and social factors\" (Singer, 1996) .

Attention to disease concentration is a common feature of most frameworks for population health, including fundamental cause theory (Link & Phelan, 1995) , ecosocial theory (Krieger, 2001) , and the concepts of structural violence (Farmer, 2003) and structural vulnerability (Leatherman, 2005; Quesada, Hart, & Bourgois, 2011) . Indeed, more than half a century ago, Cassel (1964) argued for the relevance of social-science theory to epidemiology by highlighting social processes that lead to the clustering of seemingly unrelated diseases (in his case, tuberculosis and schizophrenia). However, like Cassel, most models of population health frame the co-occurrence of epidemics in terms of the cumulative burden of disease. What the syndemic framework adds is the prediction that overlapping epidemics are more than the sum of the parts. Both (a) biological interactions between epidemics and (b) biosocial ones between epidemics and the social conditions that shape them can result in more suffering and death than would be expected in models that treat each disease in isolation.",

Disease interaction is usually described in terms of comorbidity and multimorbidity (van den Akker, Buntinx, & Knottnerus, 1996) . These concepts, which have gained wider currency in the context of COVID-19, draw attention to common etiological pathways across disease states and to the complexity of care for patients with more than one chronic disease. Comorbidity and multimorbidity are most salient in clinical medicine but are also relevant to epidemiology and health services research (Valderas, Starfield, Sibbald, Salisbury, & Roland, 2009 ). Even when invoked in epidemiology, however, the focus is on the distribution of comorbid conditions (and predisposing social conditions or risk factors) at the level of the individual (Barnett et al., 2012) . If syndemic theory were concerned only with biological interactions at the individual level (eg, for people who were infected with both HIV and TB), it is not clear what value it would add beyond the framework of multimorbidity. The promise of the theory lies in raising questions across levels of analysis about interactions among clustered epidemics and the underlying social conditions that drive them. This unique perspective is what makes syndemic theory relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Days later Time predicted that people with low incomesdisproportionately Black, Indigenous, or other people of color-would face higher exposure to the virus (because they are less likely to be able to work from home, more likely to work in service sectors where contact with strangers is routine, more likely to live in multi-family apartment buildings) and had less access to sick leave and medical care if they did become sick (Vesoulis, 2020) . In mid-May, when the New York City Health Department first released data on COVID-19 deaths by ZIP code, the prediction had borne out: the highest death rates were in low-income neighborhoods with disproportionate numbers of Black and Latinx people (Schwirtz & Cook, 2020) .",

In early April, The Atlantic ran a story about the demographic distinctiveness of COVID-19 mortality in the American South (Newkirk, 2020) , suggesting that younger people were dying there at higher rates than in other hard-hit regions because of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. The suspected pathway was a higher burden of chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes, which followed from social and political-economic factors such as poverty, limited government investment in health care, and mass incarceration, among others. 1 These accounts by journalists and others paint a compelling picture. The challenge for researchers is to incorporate such observations into a theory that generates testable propositions about the links between systemic racism, chronic disease, and risk of mortality from COVID-19. That work has already begun. Social scientists and public health researchers have drawn attention to the structural conditions that shape the concentration of COVID-19 in communities already facing higher burdens of poverty, racial inequity, and disease (Khazanchi et al., 2020; Laster Pirtle, 2020; Williams & Cooper, 2020) . Medical scientists and clinicians have emphasized the interactions among comorbid conditions that are overrepresented among COVID-19 hospitalizations and deathsparticularly hypertension (Pranata, Lim, Huang, Raharjo, & Lukito, 2020) , diabetes (Kreutz et al., 2020) , and obesity (Akoumianakis & Filippatos, 2020) . Syndemic theory draws together both approaches, bridging the population-and individual-level perspectives of the social and medical sciences, and it adds new questions about possible interactions between COVID-19 and preexisting social inequities that may exacerbate suffering from chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. Figure 1 offers a tentative syndemic model to guide research in this area. The right side of the model highlights the concentration of and possible interactions among COVID-19 and two chronic conditions that seem to pose particular risks for people infected with SARS-CoV-2: hypertension and diabetes (Richardson et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . We do not yet understand why these conditions make COVID-19 more dangerous-or even, for certain, if they do 2 -but suspected pathways for disease interactions include the renin-angiotensin system (Kreutz et al., 2020) , the endothelium (Sardu et al., 2020) , and inflammatory dysregulation (Mahmudpour, Roozbeh, Keshavarz, Farrokhi, & Nabipour, 2020) . Because these systems are also involved in diabetes and hypertension, researchers are pursuing the hypothesis that those conditions interact with COVID-19 to make infection with SARS-CoV-2 more deadly.",

Indeed, the same physiological systems that are the focus of interactions among hypertension, diabetes, and COVID-19 are also involved in the pathways that link neighborhood disadvantage, racial discrimination, and poverty to racial inequities in hypertension and diabetes (Cobb, Parker, & Thorpe, 2020; Dolezsar, McGrath, Herzig, & Miller, 2014; Dusendang et al., 2019; Panza et al., 2019; Simons et al., 2018) . It is plausible, therefore, that the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. involves both kinds of interactions put forward by syndemic theory: (a) biological interactions between overlapping diseases (ie, diabetes, hypertension, and COVID-19) and (b) biosocial ones between noxious social conditions and the biological processes involved in progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19 risk.",

Building on such work links syndemic theory to allied strategies for explaining racial health inequities-before, during, and likely after COVID-19-and clarifies what syndemic thinking adds to interdisciplinary efforts. The unique contribution of syndemic theory is the integrative focus on disease concentration and disease interaction in the context of large-scale, long-term, political-economic forces. Figure 1 identifies systemic racism (Feagin, 2006 ) as a fundamental cause of racial inequities in disease concentration. This perspective sees the social patterning of hypertension, diabetes, and now COVID-19 as culminating from a system of racial oppression that has developed and morphed over four centuries-from settler-colonialism and chattel slavery to race-based residential segregation and mass incarceration. Systemic racism constitutes a fundamental cause (Phelan & Link, 2015) in the sense that it shapes the risk of risk through multiple, interchangeable pathways (see also Laster Pirtle, 2020). Some of those pathways lead to increased risk of diabetes, some to hypertension, some to COVID-19-and some to combinations of the three.",

Incarcerated people face both greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (Akiyama, Spaulding, & Rich, 2020) and elevated risk of hypertension and heart disease (Wang et al., 2009) , and nonincarcerated Black people living in neighborhoods with high rates of incarceration have higher rates of cardiometabolic disease, independent of individual-and neighborhood-level factors like poverty and rates of crime (Topel et al., 2018) .",

The value added by a syndemic perspective is that it also highlights how biosocial interactions move in both directions. Not only do social inequities shape the risk of COVID-19; COVID-19 is also likely to exacerbate social inequities, further harming health. For example, devastating job losses during the pandemic have disproportionately affected Black Americans (Gould & Wilson, 2020) , and the economic fallout from COVID-19 has magnified racial inequities in income and housing (Greene & McCargo, 2020) . Likewise, the online transition of K-12 and university teaching threatens to widen racial inequities in educational opportunities, given that federal policies subsidize internet access in disproportionately white, rural contexts but not in cities where residents are disproportionately Black and other people of color (Siefer & Callahan, 2020) . Further, in regions where COVID-19 is concentrated, the strain on healthcare systems may compound pre-existing inequities in access to care (Williams & Rucker, 2000) . Already we see evidence of racial inequities in COVID-19 treatment (Eligon & Burch, 2020) , and we know that discrimination in healthcare settings adversely affects management of chronic conditions like diabetes (Peek, Wagner, Tang, Baker, & Chin, 2011) .",

Syndemic theory alerts us, in addition, to the possibility that the pandemic could intensify racial inequities in the social and economic conditions that increase risk for hypertension and diabetes to begin with, exacerbating the toll those diseases already take on Black people and communities.

A key conceptual issue, which has methodological implications, is the distinction between syndemics and overlapping epidemics that merely co-occur or are mutually causal (Tsai et al., 2017) . The defining feature of a syndemic is disease interaction in addition to disease concentration. That is, true syndemics have synergistic effects that can be traced to biological interactions between disease processes (biobio) or between biological processes and social conditions that harm health (biosocial). Such interactions, which need to be tested explicitly, are thought to exacerbate the toll of epidemics through multiplicative, not just additive, effects.",

Tsai and colleagues (Tsai, 2018; Tsai & Venkataramani, 2015) identified the analytical problems, and Mendenhall and Singer (2020) outlined research strategies that researchers are beginning to adopt to measure synergistic effects.

            "text": "A related conceptual challenge, which again has methodological implications, concerns the level of analysis at which interactions take place. Like other frameworks for population health, syndemic theory is inherently multilevel. It proposes that large-scale, political-economic forces, which often play out over centuries, have embodied consequences for individual health (cf. Gravlee, 2009 ). This proposition makes syndemic theory a logical fit for multilevel analyses, which incorporate population-level and contextual effects, but existing syndemic studies have measured only individual-level factors (Tsai, 2018) . This focus may result, in part, from the emphasis on biological interactions between disease states. After all, to borrow an example from Singer et al. (2020) , the pathogen-pathogen interaction that makes co-infection with HIV and Hepatitis C more lethal than infection with Hepatitis C alone occurs in individual bodies. These interactions matter, but they are also captured by the concepts of co-or multimorbidity. The utility of syndemic theory is that it directs attention to possible interactions not only between diseases (at the individual level) but also between epidemics (at the population level), taking social context and political-economic inequities into account. The tentative syndemic model of COVID-19 I offer here addresses these challenges by outlining causal pathways from large-scale social forces to individual biology and positing synergistic interactions at the individual and population level. The intersection of systemic racism, chronic health inequities, and COVID-19-apparent to journalists and other commentators-puts the onus on researchers to refine and test the syndemic model and develop public health and policy responses that account for potential synergistic effects.",
