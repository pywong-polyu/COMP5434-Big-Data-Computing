            "text": "The rapid growth in cases of COVID-19 has threatened to overwhelm healthcare systems in multiple countries. In response, severely affected countries have had to consider a range of public health strategies achieved by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: i) \"mitigation\", which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and ii) \"suppression\", aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterised to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK, we assessed the prospects of success using both of these approaches. We simulated a range of different nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups. We found that it is possible to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission if social distancing measures are sustained at a sufficient level for a period of months. Our modelling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly-defined forces. Specifically, we found that: i) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, ii) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be vary over time in a precise but unfeasible way, and iii) social distancing must be maintained for a long duration (over 6 months).",

While older individuals and those with underlying conditions are most at risk [4] , infection has been seen across age-groups [5, 6] . Worryingly, detection of viral loads in the upper respiratory tract suggests potential for pre-and ogliosymptomatic transmission [7, 8, 9] . Due to the absence of a vaccine, current attempts at controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread are focused on social measures that reduce rates of viral transmission: social distancing (a generalised reduction of contact rates between individuals in the population) and self-isolation by symptomatic individuals [10] .",

            "text": "Broadly speaking, two distinct approaches to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have received much attention. The first aims to suppress transmission in the target population (referred hereafter as \"suppression\") [10] . Under this objective, control measures reduce viral transmission to such a degree that sustained endogenous transmission is no longer possible. By maintaining control measures in place for a sufficient period of time, the virus will be eliminated in the focal population. The focus will then shift to preventing subsequent reintroduction. The second approach aims to manage or mitigate the negative health impacts (referred hereafter as mitigation) [10] . While suppression aims to ultimately halt local transmission, mitigation aims to reduce the growth rate of the epidemic to ensure disease burden does not overwhelm healthcare systems [3] . In practice, achieving both objectives requires the roll out of the same types of control measures (social distancing and self-isolation), though the necessary intensities and durations vary. At the time of writing, many countries have adopted extensive social distancing measures (including, after some prevarication, the UK [11] ) to either mitigate or suppress SARS-CoV-2 spread [3] . However the severe economic costs and acute social pressures associated with social distancing measures inevitably lead to a push for their relaxation [10] . Due to the potentially long wait until a vaccine is available, the UK government has proposed to attempt to achieve herd immunity in the country by allowing a sufficient section of the population to develop natural immunity via exposure to the disease [11] .",

To reduce the complexity of the model, and to understand their differential impacts, we assume that individuals are only affected by one of these measures, dependent on their age. Individuals aged 0-24 years are affected by school closures (included in this are university closures). School closures were assumed to result in a 70% reduction in contacts among school aged individuals (qY Y ) and 20 % reduction in their contacts with individuals aged 25-59 years (qY A). Work and social place closures were assumed to reduce contacts among adults (qAA) by 50%. Finally, older individuals distancing reduced contacts by 60+ aged individuals with 0-24 year-olds by 90% (qY O ), with 25-59 years by 70% (qAO) and among one-another by 50% (qOO). The effectiveness of symptomatic individuals self-isolating is dependent on two factors: i) the engagement by symptomatic individuals, k and ii) the proportion of transmission due to individuals who are symptomatic, ps. b) We modelled five distinct combinations of social distancing measures, assuming that older individuals social distancing will always be prioritised.",

Simulated results generated using the age-structured SEIR model. a) Inclusion of social distancing by 0-59 year-olds (e.g. due to school and workplace closures) reduces peak hospital burden. The more gradually social distancing by these age groups is relaxed, the greater the reduction. b) More gradual relaxation in controls results in a slightly smaller final number of fatalities. c) The overall reduction in the susceptible population below the herd immunity threshold is less the longer controls are applied. Simulated results assumed control measures are initiated when there is a total of 10 thousand infectious individuals in the population and that social distancing measures affecting 0-59 year-olds (school and work place closures) are gradually relaxed. For all results shown (apart from where there was no intervention) self-isolation effectiveness was assumed to be maintained at 20%. Similarly, 60+ aged individuals were assumed not to relax their social distancing.",

There is a narrow window of reproductive number values (shaded) where either i) the number of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalisation does not overwhelm hospital capacity (modelled at 100 thousand beds) or ii) circulation is suppressed. b) None of the simulated control scenarios shown in Figs 3 and 4 achieved herd immunity while keeping cases below hospital capacity. c) To achieve herd immunity in the minimum time requires control measures that fix the rate of new hospitalised cases to ensure hospital beds are continually full. This time depends on the available hospital capacity, with the i) total and ii) unoccupied general and acute hospital beds in the UK National Health System pre-COVID-19 indicated.",

Gradually linearly decreasing social distancing was found to be inadequate. Given the estimated proportion of cases that need hospitalisation [15] , achieving herd immunity requires finely tuning social distancing over an extended period of time that depends on available hospital capacity. If 100 thousand beds are available for COVID-19 patients (1.52 beds per 1000 people) then at a minimum it will take around 6 months to achieve herd immunity. This is longer than the necessary duration of control measures to achieve disease suppression for almost all control strengths where suppression is possible. We highlight that the different strengths of social distancing were chosen to be plausible values for the UK, erring on the side of caution (underestimating effectiveness). The apparent rapid suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Wuhan is concordant with greater levels of social distancing than modelled here.",

Here, we made the pragmatic assumption that, over the time scales under consideration, infection confers perfect long-lasting immunity (the best case scenario for mitigation strategies). If immunity is not perfect, and there is a moderate to high chance of reinfection, then prospects for achieving herd immunity via natural infection are slim [19] . To shed light on the kinetics of immunity, mass longitudinal antibody testing is necessary. This would both permit the identification of previously infected individuals, and provide information regarding immunity through time [20] . We submit models such as the one explored here provide a powerful means of integrating parallel serological and epidemiological data streams to quantify population-level immunity. Further, such models can be central to the development of efficient age-stratified serological testing schemes.",
