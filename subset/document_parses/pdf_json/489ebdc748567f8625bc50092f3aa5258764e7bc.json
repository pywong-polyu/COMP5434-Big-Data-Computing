            "text": "with higher frequency of alcohol use in autistic individuals. 9 However, expectancies among autistic individuals for other substances have been understudied. One such group of substances is compounds derived from the cannabis plant, called cannabinoids. The two most abundant of these are cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating cannabinoid, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is intoxicating. Cannabinoids may help mitigate several difficulties that can be associated with ASD. Epilepsy has been regarded as a frequent comorbidity and exacerbator of behavioural difficulties in autistic individuals. 10 Recently, CBD was approved as an effective treatment for certain forms of epilepsy. Additionally, some evidence suggests that there may be a more substantial effect when CBD is combined with THC. 11 Autistic individuals may also face difficulties with recognising emotions. 12 A randomised placebocontrolled trial found that a single dose of CBD improved emotional face recognition, whereas THC impaired performance on the same task. 13 Animal studies have further shown CBD to exert agonist effects on 5-HT1a serotonin receptors similarly to antidepressants, and so CBD may produce benefits to mood and anxiety. 14 THC may also have benefits for autistic individuals by reducing locomotor activity 15 and in tandem with CBD, improve on hyperactivity and impulsivity. 16 Most recently, a doubleblinded randomised controlled trial of CBD and THC in a 20:1 ratio found significant improvements to social responsiveness and disruptive behaviours compared with placebo, among 150 autistic children and adolescents. 17 While some research indicates potential medicinal uses of cannabinoids for autistic individuals, current research on efficacy and safety is limited 18 . Therefore, cannabinoids are currently not approved as pharmacological interventions for ASD. In the absence of prescribed cannabinoids, or any pharmacological intervention for autistic individuals, 19 some may turn to non-prescribed cannabinoid use. A growing public interest in the use of cannabinoids for medicinal or wellness purposes may facilitate such behaviours. 20 Within the UK, nonprescribed use of cannabinoids largely takes the form of CBD products, which are legally available in health food shops and online, and of non-prescribed cannabis, which is currently illegal. 21 Overall, CBD has been regarded as a well-tolerated drug with few side effects. 22 23 However, levels of CBD in available CBD products are typically far lower than those administered in clinical trials; 24 hence, the effectiveness of these products remains unknown. Moreover, THC levels in these products are often variable and have been found at times to exceed legal limits in some jurisdictions. 25 Thus, CBD products may currently lack quality assurance and data on their safety or efficacy. It is notable that the recent classification of CBD as a novel food by the European Food Standards Agency has facilitated tightened safety regulations within the UK since March 2021, which may influence these issues with CBD products in the future. 26 Conversely, cannabis use has been associated with increased risk of developing cannabis use disorder and psychosis. 27 28 These effects are attributable to THC, which has been shown during acute administration to produce transient psychotic symptoms and impaired memory in a dose-dependent manner. 29 Despite the potential risks of cannabis and the lack of quality assurance for CBD products as well as the potential benefits of cannabinoids for ASD, there is a current lack of data on the prevalence and characteristics of their use, across autistic and non-autistic individuals. Current data are limited to diagnosis rates of substance use disorders among autistic adults, 30 31 which fails to capture subclinical cannabinoid use, and how and why autistic individuals use these products. Without this information, the extent of potential benefits or harms caused by unregulated cannabis use among autistic people remains unknown. Moreover, this precludes understanding the aetiological factors of cannabinoid use for autistic individuals, which impedes the development of evidencebased support programmes. 32 To address this gap in the literature, we sought to provide a comprehensive survey of cannabinoid-related behaviours in autistic versus nonautistic individuals, including prevalence and frequency of use, expectancies regarding cannabis and CBD, cannabinoid-use support-seeking behaviours and whether cannabis/CBD use is associated with use of other drugs.",

In order to account for the likelihood that autistic participants differed on key demographic variables to control participants, propensity score matching on age, gender and ethnicity was conducted to obtain groups with similar demographics. This allows differences between groups to be likelier attributable to ASD. Following recommendations, 1:1 nearest neighbour logistic regression matching with replacement, with a tolerance level of 0.03, was chosen. 38 39 Several authors have noted matching with or without replacement is generally comparable, and, indeed, this produced the same sample size in the current study. 40 41 Given the reduction in confounding by demographic factors in the matched sample, this method is more conservative than the full-sample analysis and was chosen as the primary method for analysis. Elimination of data to obtain matched samples may, however, introduce exclusion bias. Therefore, to ensure that any case-control differences were robust to different analytical methods, propensity score matching results were triangulated with full-sample analysis results. Group differences were only considered robust if supported by triangulation between propensity score matching and full sample analysis results. 42 Differences between autistic and control groups were assessed using \u03c7 2 independence tests, Fisher's exact tests, independent-sample t tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests as appropriate with an alpha level of 0.05. Effect sizes were computed as ORs or r (Z/(\u221aN) for \u03c7 2 independence tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively. Post-hoc Spearman's Rho correlations were used to assess within-group associations between autism-related difficulties (social communication difficulties and restricted, repetitive Open access behaviours) and frequency of cannabis/CBD use, using Bonferroni-adjusted alpha levels of 0.025 (0.05/2). Post-hoc Spearman's Rho correlations were also used to assess within-group associations between expectancies of cannabis/CBD use and frequency of cannabis/CBD use, using Bonferroni-adjusted alpha levels of 0.0125 (0.05/4).

However, current findings are unable to confirm the reasons autistic participants used CBD, and this may represent an area for further inquiry.

Recreational drug use expectancies were associated with frequency of cannabis use for both autistic and non-autistic participants. Medical expectancies were also associated with frequency of cannabis and CBD use in both groups. However, autismspecific expectancies were not associated with frequency of cannabis or CBD use, and recreational drug use expectancies were not associated with frequency of CBD use. This contrasts a previous study, which found autismspecific expectancies to be associated with more frequent alcohol use among autistic individuals. 9 Since alcohol is readily available for purchase by adults, expectancies may be the dominant factor determining alcohol use, while cannabis and CBD use may be determined by additional factors such as illegality and high prices. 21 51 Implications These findings indicate appropriate avenues to disseminate cannabinoid-related information and support to autistic individuals. Compared with non-autistic participants, autistic participants trusted the news and doctors less as sources of information regarding cannabinoids. Scientific journals and National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) were rated as the most trusted sources by autistic individuals. Current NICE guidelines on medicinal cannabinoids do not mention its relevance to ASD, 52 although these findings indicate this information could positively inform cannabinoid use for autistic individuals. Additionally, our findings corroborate previous work 9 that the internet is among the most popular sources for substance-related support, reiterating ORs are presented followed by 95% CIs in parentheses. *p < 0.05.

Autistic participants endorsed that not being understood, being somewhere unfamiliar and going to a crowded, chaotic place were potential barriers to cannabinoidrelated support seeking, more so than non-autistic participants. These potential barriers were also identified by previous work 9 as highly prevalent for autistic individuals in relation to alcohol-related support seeking and together suggests targets to improve accessibility of care. Notably, a transition to remote services due to the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic may lessen these barriers, and it will be pertinent to investigate how these changing services are experienced by autistic individuals. 53 Furthermore, future research may wish to assess how autistic individuals access cannabis, as these barriers may potentially suggest a preference away from approaching cannabis dealers in-person if this involves unfamiliar or chaotic environments.",
