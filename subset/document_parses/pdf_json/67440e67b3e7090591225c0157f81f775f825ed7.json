Findings from the early period of the pandemic indicated that there were significant sex and age differences, with females and younger people scoring significantly higher on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 [9, 10] , and there is also some evidence of variation in the estimated prevalence rates of depression and generalised anxiety disorder across countries, including European countries [11] . The ability to make valid sex, age, and country comparisons of depression and anxiety scores (derived from the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) is predicated on the assumption that the items contained within these scales operate equivalently for these different groups of interest. This assumption is also known as 'measurement invariance' [12] .",

Using data from a European-wide (8 countries) sample of patients after traumatic brain injury and three different methods to detect invariance, they found that the scale items performed equally well across groups based on gender, patient type, and linguistic background. This adds to the research that has shown invariance of GAD-7 scores based on gender in a clinical sample [14] and age, gender, education, and urbanicity in Chinese medical students [15] . Similarly, PHQ-9 scores have been shown to be invariant across age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, and health conditions [16] and time [17] . These studies have used a variety of techniques to assess invariance.",

DIF is assessed by identifying if there are differences in individual item scores across groups (e.g., sex, countries) or levels of a variable (e.g., age) whilst controlling for the overall construct (latent variable) being measured. Within the literature there are different statistical methods to assess DIF, each with their own advantages and disadvantages (see [19, 20] for reviews). In this study, we opted to use the multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) approach [21, 22] as it (1) allows the specification and estimation of a multidimensional latent variable model with the grouping variables, (2) provides a range of absolute and relative fit statistics, (3) employs maximum likelihood estimation to deal with non-normality, and (4) has greater statistical power than multiple-group models.",

This study adds to the extant research literature as there is a relative dearth of invariance studies based on large community or nationally representative population-based samples. In addition, many previous studies have analysed either the GAD-7 or the PHQ-9 alone, or tested invariance for the two scales separately; our study tests for invariance using a combined twofactor model using the GAD-7 and the PHQ-9 items in the same model. Finally, data collection for this study was conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic when the population levels of anxiety and depression were likely to be elevated [10] thereby capturing a wide range of scores on the GAD-7 and the PHQ-9.",

Quota sampling was used to ensure that the sample characteristics of gender, age, household income, and region (Campania, Lazio, Lombardia, and Veneto) matched the Italian population. Participants were required to be an adult (18 years or older) and a resident in one of these regions. Participants completed the survey online from 13th -28th July 2020.

In total, N = 1,048 valid respondents were recruited, however, for the purposes of the current study, a small number of cases with missing data on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were removed, resulting in a final sample of N = 1039.

Both scales instruct participants to indicate how often they have been bothered by each symptom over the last two weeks using a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). Examples items are \"Feeling down, depressed or hopeless\" (PHQ) and \"Not being able to stop or control worrying?\" (GAD). Possible scores on the PHQ-9 range from 0 to 27, and on the GAD-7 from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression and anxiety. Scale scores of 10 or greater are typically used to indicate probable diagnostic status on each of these measures [1, 2] . The psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 [26] and GAD-7 [27] scores have been widely supported in other studies. In each country, the internal reliability estimates, as assessed by Cronbach's alpha (\u03b1), of the PHQ-9 scores (UK \u03b1 = 0.921; Ireland \u03b1 = 0.905; Spain \u03b1 = 0.889; Italy \u03b1 = 0.918) and the GAD-7 scores (UK \u03b1 = 0.921; Ireland \u03b1 = 0.905; Spain \u03b1 = 0.889; Italy \u03b1 = 0.918) were high.

MIs indicate which path could be added to the model that would significantly improve model fit if freely estimated, that is, reduce the chi-square by 3.84 or more (which is the critical value for the chi-square for one degree of freedom, p < .05). In practice, a more conservative value of 10 was used to ensure that small inconsequential parameters were not added, and this is reflected in Mplus only reporting MIs greater than 10. The SEPC indicates the estimated value of a fixed parameter (in this case fixed to zero) if it were estimated, that is, the expected standardised regression coefficient. The MIs are influenced by sample size [32] , and with a very large sample this is likely to indicate that parameters with very small absolute values should be added to the model. On this basis, Kaplan [33] proposed that a combination of MIs and SEPCs should be used to determine which parameters should be added to the model. Thus, in this study, a direct effect from the predictor to a PHQ-9/ GAD-7 item would be added if the MI was greater than 10 and the SEPC was greater than 0.20. A process followed whereby the path with the largest MI/SEPC was freely estimated in the model and the model was re-estimated. This continued until there were no MIs/SEPCs greater than 10/0.20.

A nonsignificant chi-square and values greater than 0.90 for the CFI and TLI were considered to reflect acceptable model fit. Additionally, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) [38] was reported, where a value less than 0.05 indicated close fit and values up to 0.08 indicated reasonable errors of approximation. The same cutoff values can be used for the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) [39] .

Initial CFA analyses indicated a model with two correlated latent variables -the PHQ-9 items loaded on a 'Depression' latent variable, and the GAD-7 items loaded on an ' Anxiety' latent variable -was an acceptable description of the data. There were country differences on the summed scales, with UK and Ireland scoring significantly lower than Spain and Italy, though the effect size was very small. Initial analyses indicated that the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 items were good indictors of the depression and anxiety latent variables, respectively. For all countries, the factor loadings were high, positive and statistically significant. The estimates of internal consistency were high for both scales for all countries. These positive psychometric characteristics of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scale scores have been reported previously [16] .",

Similarly, after controlling for the overall level of anxiety the participants from Spain (compared to UK) scored higher on the second GAD item ('Not being able to stop or control worrying'); again, the size of this effect was small and unlikely to contribute to problematic DIF. Overall, these findings support the use of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 in the general population to make comparisons based on age, gender and country. Our findings are consistent with a recent systematic review of 10 invariance studies, largely among clinical samples, of the PHQ-9 that concluded that the results \"\u2026established measurement invariance of the PHQ-9 across sociodemographic variables\" (p.223) [16] , and a comprehensive analysis of the GAD-7 concluded that the scores were \"\u2026invariant across sociodemographic groups and over time\" [42] .

This provides further support for the effectiveness of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 as screening instruments for depression and anxiety [43] .
