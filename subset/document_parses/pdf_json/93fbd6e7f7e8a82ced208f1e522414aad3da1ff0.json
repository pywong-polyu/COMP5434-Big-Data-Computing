The potential of NPIs to curtail the pandemic case rates has been studied in multiple countries in Europe. 1 These studies provide evidence of the impact of NPIs on sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission dynamics at the national level. However, the use of aggregated data on NPIs may result in ecological bias when assessing the efficacy of restrictive public health measures for the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in each country. In particular, local mobility restrictions are a source of heterogeneity in COVID-19 transmission dynamics across subnational areas that can be hidden when aggregating data across an entire country. Moreover, mobility can be a highly sensitive but underutilized indicator of interpersonal contact.",

Mobility data were obtained from the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, collected and published by Google. 4 The analysed period was 27 February 2020-31 January 2021. These reports include six indexes of mobility (related to retail commerce, grocery shopping, parks, transit, work and home) and estimate the mobility reduction compared with a baseline period (3 January-6 February 2020). We chose the retail mobility as the closer proxy of the reduction in contacts resulting from local lockdowns in each city. All other indicators are either related to excepted types of mobility (groceries, home, work or transit) or are considered leisure activities (parks). Missing data were imputed using Kalman filtering and state-space analyses.",

We then meta-analysed the results of the ARIMA coefficients across cities and reported the summary estimator along with the p-value and heterogeneity (Supplementary Figure 1, panel A) .
