The performance, counts of predominant microorganisms, and bioaerosol emissions of a full-scale TSIBF system were studied. High and stable removal efficiencies of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and VOCs could be achieved with the TSIBF system, and the emissions of culturable heterotrophic bacteria, fungi and acidophilic sulfur bacteria were relatively low. The removal efficiencies of different odors and VOCs, emissions of culturable microorganisms, and types of predominant microorganisms were different in the ABRS, FRS and HBRS due to the differences in reaction conditions and mass transfer in each segment. The emissions of bioaerosols from the TSIBF depended on the capture of microorganisms and their volatilization from the packing. The rational segmentation, filling of high-density packings and the accumulation of the predominant functional microorganisms in each segment enhanced the capture effect of the bioaerosols, thus reducing the emissions of microorganisms from the bioreactor.",

Compared with other facilities, such as municipal wastewater treatment plants, the MSW comprehensive treatment plants produce odors and VOCs with higher concentrations and more varied compositions, which include hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, mercaptan, low molecular weight fatty acids, chlorides, linear alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons (alkanes and aromatics) (Liu et al., 2009 ). Most of these odors and VOCs are volatile and corrosive irritants, and their concentrations are much higher than those specified in the Emission standards for odor pollutants of China (GB-14544-93) . Therefore, these substances have a great impact on human health and atmospheric environment (Han et al., 2020b) .",

Torretta et al.

These pollutants are hydrophobic and nonbiodegradable. However, the mycelium of the fungi grown in the FRS was well developed, and the enzyme activity was high, resulting in a certain advantage for treating refractory substances (Khatami et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019) . Other hydrophilic and biodegradable odors and VOCs had higher REs in the HBRS: 78.18AE4.26% for methanol, 74.23AE5.05% for ethanol, 75.34AE5.84% for acetic acid, 76.02AE5.59% for acetone, 71.35AE4.86% for ethyl acetate and 70.4AE4.75% for butyl acetate. The significant differences in the odors and VOCs removal characteristics in the different reaction segments can be attributed to the differences in environmental conditions and the resulting differences in number and activities of dominant microorganisms. Previous studies have shown that the mass transfer of pollutants and the formation of efficient microbial populations are closely related to the variations in removal characteristics (Sun et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019) . The gas-liquid mass transfer and biodegradation processes in the different segments of the TSIBF are relatively independent. The environmental conditions in each reaction segment are controlled to make strongly acidic, weakly acidic, and neutral in the ABRS, FRS and HBRS, respectively. The gas-liquid mass transfer of pollutants with different acid-base properties and solubilities is quite different, and the number and activity of microorganisms also varies. The solubility and biodegradability of various odors and VOCs as well as the types of microorganisms suitable for degradation in the different segments are quite different. Therefore, the different reaction segments exhibit different removal performances for the odors and VOCs. Due to the complementarity of the three segments, the simultaneous and efficient removal of all kinds of pollutants can be achieved in the THIBF system.",

In the different operation periods of the THIBF, the concentrations of culturable heterotrophic bacteria, fungi and acidophilic sulfur bacteria in each reaction segment were analyzed.

Table 4 shows that the concentrations of acidophilic sulfur bacteria in the ABRS, fungi in the FRS and heterotrophic bacteria in the HBRS had values of 2.92 \u00c2 10 7 CFU/g packing, 9.14 \u00c2 10 7 CFU/g packing and 8.44 \u00c2 10 7 CFU/g packing, respectively, in the early stage of operation (15 d).

The concentrations of acidophilic sulfur bacteria in the ABRS, fungi in the FRS and heterotrophic bacteria in the HBRS increased during the start-up operation of the reactor.

The strongly acidic environment in the ABRS makes it difficult for heterotrophic bacteria and fungi to grow, but it is suitable for the growth of acidophilic sulfur bacteria. The FRS had a weakly acidic environment and low packing humidity, which are beneficial to the growth of fungi instead of heterotrophic bacteria and acidophilic sulfur bacteria; therefore, the concentration of fungi in this reaction segment was significantly higher (\u00c2 10 8 CFU/g) (Rene et al., 2012) . In the HBRS, the concentration of heterotrophic bacteria was 10 8 CFU/g, whereas the concentrations of acidophilic sulfur bacteria and fungi were relatively low (\u00c2 10 3 CFU/g and \u00c2 10 5 CFU/g, respectively). Combined with the segmented REs of the pollutants, it can be concluded that the variations in the segmented REs of different types of odors and VOCs might be due to differences in the types of the predominant microorganisms, the reaction conditions and the mass transfer. The predominant microorganisms in the ABRS segment are acidophilic sulfur bacteria, and the pollutants removed are mainly hydrogen sulfide and sulfurcontaining organic substances. The predominant microorganisms in the FRS are fungi, and the main pollutants removed are hydrophobic pollutants. The predominant microorganisms in the HBRS segment are heterotrophic bacteria, which mainly remove hydrophilic organic pollutants. The results indicated that the removal of different odors and VOCs was related to the predominant microbial populations formed in the different segments. Therefore, through reasonable process design and control of reaction conditions, the acidophilic sulfur bacteria, fungi and heterotrophic bacteria that were initially inoculated into the three different reaction segments of the THIBF can always be predominant in terms of quantity. By designing different reaction segments in which different types of microorganisms were predominant, the distribution of different types of microorganisms in ABRS, FRS and HBRS was achieved, enabling the effective removal of different types of odors and VOCs, respectively.",

The results are shown in Fig. 3 . Figure 3 shows that during 216 d of operation, the concentrations of culturable heterotrophic bacteria, fungi and acidophilic sulfur bacteria in the outlet were 249-1389 CFU/m 3 , 277-940 CFU/m 3 and 32-104 CFU/m 3 , respectively.

The concentrations of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and fungi in the inlet of the THIBF were 1248-6327 CFU/m 3 and 876-3129 CFU/m 3 , respectively. Compared to the inlet concentrations of the THIBF, the concentrations of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and fungi released from the THIBF were reduced by 74.37%-83.45% and 67.77%-78.62%, respectively. As also demonstrated, the concentrations of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and fungi in the outlet of the THIBF fluctuated greatly, but the REs were relatively stable, and no significant differences were observed between the stable operation and start-up period. Additionally, the concentration of culturable acidophilic sulfur bacteria in the inlet was relatively low. The outlet concentration of culturable acidophilic sulfur bacteria in the TSIBF was higher than or close to the inlet concentration, indicating that the efficiency of the THIBF to remove the culturable acidophilic sulfur bacteria is limited.",

Therefore, in the TSIBF, rational segmentation, filling of high-density packings and the accumulation of the predominant functional microorganisms in each segment enhanced the capture effect of the packings on bioaerosols, thus reducing the concentrations emitted from the TSIBF.",

Each segment of the TSIBF can effectively remove different types of odors and VOCs. Sulfur-containing pollutants, hydrophobic pollutants and hydrophilic pollu- tants are mainly removed in the ABRS, FRS and HBRS, respectively. The types and distribution of the predominant microorganisms in the different reaction segments of the TSIBF were different: acidophilic sulfur bacteria in the ABRS, fungi in the FRS and heterotrophic bacteria in the HBRS. The emission concentrations of culturable heterotrophic bacteria, fungi and acidophilic sulfur bacteria were 249-1296 CFU/m 3 , 277-940 CFU/m 3 and 36-104 CFU/ m 3 , respectively. In the TSIBF, the emission of bioaerosols depends on volatilization from the packing and the capture of microorganisms from the inlet, and the extent of capture was greater than that of volatilization from the packings. The rational segmentation of the TSIBF, filling of highdensity packings and the accumulation of the predominant functional microorganisms in each segment enhance the capture of bioaerosols and reduce the emission of microorganisms in the outlet.",
