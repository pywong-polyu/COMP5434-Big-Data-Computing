            "text": "COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a new enveloped virus that belongs to the Beta coronavirus genus. SARS-CoV-2 particles are generally polymorphic, with a diameter of 60-140 nm. The genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 vary significantly from those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with 79 % and 50 % homology, respectively [1] . Lu et al. constructed a structural homology model and found that the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV [2] . Hoffmann et al. showed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV, is also the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and that the cellular protease TMPRSS2 is required for SARS-CoV-2 invasion to be completed. SARS-CoV-2 and Bat CoV RaTG13 have 96.3 % homology, which suggests that bats may be the natural host of SARS-CoV-2 [3-5. Since the first confirmed case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, the number of global infections has continued to grow, and the disease is often transmitted to patients' family members and medical staff. Specific and effective antiviral treatment drugs and measures are therefore urgently needed. Therefore, while conducting emergency testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages of the pandemic, we have also followed the progress of antiviral drug development. Although patients with COVID-19 at our hospital are mainly treated by the Department of Infectious Diseases, Respiratory Medicine and Intensive Medicine, the Blood Transfusion department also provides related treatments. This article discusses the blood transfusion-related technologies used in COVID-19 treatment and what this treatment approach may reveal regarding its possible pathogenic mechanisms.",

This reaction is generally regulated and controlled to avoid producing excessive cytokines, so that viral killing can be achieved without causing severe cell damage to the host's own tissues. However, the regulatory mechanism sometimes malfunctions, which results in uncontrolled mass production of cytokines, which creates a cytokine storm [7] . This is a severe inflammatory reaction that causes serious damage to tissues and organs, and can manifest as acute lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome [8] . Additionally, cytokine storms can also damage other tissues and organs such as the blood vessels, liver, kidney and heart, leading to bleeding, impaired coagulation, liver and kidney dysfunction and acid-base balance disorders [9] . Patients with severe cases of cytokine storm ultimately die of respiratory failure, hypoxia, cardiac arrest, shock, and so on. The magnitude of the immune response is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 [10] .",

Lipid peroxidation mediated by oxygen free radicals destroys the structure and function of various membranes, destroys mitochondria, abolishes the cell's energy supply, destroys lysosomes and induces cell autolysis [11, 12] . Free radicals can cause acute lung injury through various mechanisms. They can also seriously damage the myocardial cell membrane. The production of large amounts of ions by myocardial cells can disrupt the electrical signal that controls the heartbeat and cause ventricular fibrillation, resulting in death. Free radical accumulation in the body also causes tumors and aging.",

Patient needs include strengthening supportive treatment, paying attention to the water-electrolyte balance and maintaining homeostasis. Oxygen therapy is required for patients with hypoxemia. Mechanical ventilation is often required for patients who do not respond to oxygen therapy and experience respiratory distress. High-flow nasal catheters and non-invasive ventilation are both useful options and invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be required [13] . Antibacterial drugs are used to prevent and treat secondary bacterial infections. Attention should be paid to avoiding blind use or misuse of antibacterial drugs, especially in combination with broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs. Bacteriological monitoring should be strengthened for elderly, immunocompromised and severely affected patients. Hormone use is currently controversial, and improper use will increase patient mortality. According to COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines, glucocorticoids can be used for a short time in patients with severe disease, depending on their condition. No drug that specifically treats SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently available. Immunotherapy, including convalescent plasma therapy and the administration of human monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies, is an important part of comprehensive therapy. However, the available evidence for COVID-19 is limited, and the safety and effectiveness of immunotherapy for COVID-19 treatment still need basic and clinical testing. The development of a vaccine is one of the main measures needed to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several domestic and foreign companies are using various technologies to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as soon as possible.",

Convalescent plasma may aggravate lung injury in patients with multiple organ failure, and they may experience severe adverse reactions to blood transfusion, so they should not be infused. Patients should be infused with convalescent plasma early in the course of the disease when the body has not yet produced IgG antibodies.

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus and H1N1 infections have all been treated with convalescent plasma [14] [15] [16] [17] . In 2009, a study in Hong Kong, China showed that treating patients with severe H1N1 infection with convalescent plasma containing antibody titers \u22651:160 can significantly reduce respiratory viral load and mortality [18] . During the Ebola outbreak, convalescent plasma was used to treat two infected American medical personnel [19] . Ko et al. showed that convalescent plasma containing antibody titers \u22651:80 is effective in treating MERS-CoV infection [20] . A retrospective meta-analysis of 32 cases of SARS-CoV infection showed that early use of convalescent plasma therapy after symptom onset can reduce mortality [21] . Convalescent plasma treatment of COVID-19 requires attention to plasma donation standards, timing of infusion and evaluation of efficacy. Convalescent plasma donation standards are as follows: (1) The donor must have recovered completely and have no residual SARS-CoV-2 in the body; pharyngeal swabs, sputum, alveolar lavage fluid, blood and stools must all be negative by nucleic acid test; (2) Donors have produced high titers of protective antibodies, namely SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies. Convalescent plasma with an antibody titer\u22651:160 or \u22651:320, if possible, has the best effect. The presence of IgM antibodies indicates recent viral infection, viral replication or residual virus, so convalescent plasma that is strongly positive for or has high titers of IgM antibodies should not be used for clinical infusion; (3) The donor's physical condition must meet basic blood donation standards and tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies, AIDS antibodies and Treponema pallidum antigens must be negative; (4) Donors must provide informed consent indicating that they are willing to donate plasma.",

When the immune insult is repeated, high-affinity IgG antibodies are quickly produced. Theoretically, the best time to infuse patients with convalescent plasma is in the early stage of the disease, when IgG antibodies have not been produced, the nucleic acid test is strongly positive, and the viral load is high. Given that the antigen-antibody reaction time is approximately 24 h, 24-48 h after infusion of convalescent plasma is likely the best time to evaluate treatment efficacy. The indicators used to evaluate efficacy include clinical symptoms, laboratory indicators, lung imaging, and nucleic acid detection.",

Using plasmapheresis to treat patients with COVID-19 removes excessive cytokines and prevents the \"cytokine storm,\" thereby reducing damage to the body.

Treating COVID-19 with mesenchymal stem cells has achieved good results [28] .
