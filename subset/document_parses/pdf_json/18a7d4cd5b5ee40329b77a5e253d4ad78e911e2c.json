            "text": "Diminished volumes of habitual physical activity and increased sedentary levels have been observed as a result of COVID-19 home-confinement. Consequences of inactivity, including a higher mortality rate and poorer general health and fitness, have been reported. This systematic review aimed to provide practical recommendations for maintaining active lifestyles during pandemics. In May 2020, two electronic databases (PubMed; Web of Science) were used to search for relevant studies. A total of 1206 records were screened by two researchers. Thirty-one relevant studies were included in this systematic review, in which the methodological quality was assessed. With regard to six studies, which explicitly dealt with physical activity during COVID-19, the evidence level is classified by three articles to level II, and in the other three to level VI. Regarding the physical activity recommendations in these papers, three of them were classified to a medium, and the same number to a weak evidence base. Of the 25 papers which refer to other pandemics and/or isolation situations, one was classified to evidence level I, four were ranged to level II, three to level III, one to level V, and the others to level VI. This systematic review revealed that reduced physical activity levels are of serious concern during home confinement in pandemic times. The recommendations provided by many international organizations to maintain active lifestyles during these times mainly target the general population, with less consideration for vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults, people with health issues). Therefore, personalized and supervised physical activity programs are urgently needed, with the option to group-play physical activity programs (e.g., exergames). These can be assisted, delivered, and disseminated worldwide through information and communication technology solutions. If it is permitted and safe, being active outside in daylight is advised, with an effort level of mild to moderate using the rating of perceived exertion scale. Relaxation techniques should be integrated into the daily routine to reduce stress levels. On the evidence base and levels of the included articles in this review, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Given that policies are different across regions and countries, further research is needed to categorize recommendations according to different social-distancing scenarios.",

On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 disease as a global health emergency and on 11 March, the disease was proclaimed a global pandemic [2] . Due to the ever-growing number of confirmed cases, and to avoid overwhelming health systems, lockdowns with home-confinement and social distancing were implemented [3] . Practically, this meant gyms, public parks, sports grounds, outdoor playing areas, and schools were closed, among other facilities [4] . This situation has negatively affected children and youth, who normally have an active lifestyle through active transport, school-related activities, and sport participation [5] . The resulting reduction in social participation and physical activity (PA) during this home confinement is of serious concern for older adults too, as they are typically more inactive compared to younger aged individuals and more prone to chronic diseases [6] . A quantitative measurement of one-week's average steps for 30 million users of the Fitbit\u00a9 device, comparing March 2020 to March 2019, showed a fundamental reduction in average steps in almost all countries [7] .",

A large-scale, prospective study demonstrated that 30 min per day of light-intensity PA, which replaces sitting for the same duration, is able to reduce the mortality risk from cardiovascular disease by 24% [9] . According to the WHO, regular PA has multiple health benefits as evidenced by reducing high blood pressure, weight management, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart disease, and various cancers, which are all variables that can increase susceptibility to the Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) pandemic [10] . Importantly, a recent systematic review reported that exercise reduced the severity of ARI symptoms among 373 participants and the number of symptom days (\u22122.24 days) during the follow-up period measured on the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) [11] .",

These topics highlighted the potential of digital community exercise programs in motivating individuals and reducing their feeling of loneliness, even if they train from their home [45] . These topics reported that the first step of creating a PA program is to explain the benefits of the exercise, and to define realistic individual goals adapted to each group's health status [34] . It is suggested that best case scenarios would integrate family members, because this leads to more motivation and an increased effort time for conducting PA [48] .

The proposed PA by WHO includes dancing to music, playing active video games, body-weight strength and balance training, and joining exercise classes online [69] . Additional practical ideas such as regular standing breaks [70] , walking up and down the stairs [71] , as well as the use of skipping ropes [72] , are represented on the WHO exercise list, to ensure diversity in the content of the crisis-oriented PA programs. The AHA invites people to join a virtual workshop for different workouts (e.g., full-body workout, lower body tone workout, stretch workout). In addition, they offer useful exercises and explanations in their videos, such as a sofa stretch or chair dips [73] .

A more detailed analysis of these articles with regard to referred studies of the topic PA recommendation resulted in classifying three of them to medium and three of them to weak evidence base. It is important to point out that none of the authors have conducted an empirical study. This medium-to-low quality of the six studies which explicitly deal with COVID-19 is not surprising, because at the time of publication, the pandemic was novel. It was not possible to generate and conduct RCT's or systematic reviews with meta-analysis in such a limited time. In relation to the 25 studies which address other pandemics and/or isolation situations, we identified that most of these were classified to the evidence level VI, which presents a low methodological quality. Eight papers were rated between I and III, and one was categorized to level V. This analysis shows that the results need to be interpreted with caution.",

Further, consequences of closed fitness centers (e.g., mental health, potential weight gain) need to be analyzed. It is important for researchers to differentiate between different living and working conditions, as well as for different home confinement, social distancing policies and practices across regions and countries. This approach will be integrated into the wider research plan outlined in the introduction; the survey, the review, and the intervention branches of the research program. By increments, the research could progress from feasibility studies, formative evaluation of ongoing interventions, and case-studies to randomized controlled trials.
