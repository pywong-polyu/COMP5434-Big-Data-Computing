The green tea component epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG) is particularly promising because it reportedly inhibits viral replication and viral entry in vitro. However, conclusive evidence for its predominant activity is needed. We tested EGCG effects on the native virus isolated from COVID-19 patients in two independent series of experiments using VERO cells and two different treatment schemes in each series. The results confirmed modest cytotoxicity of EGCG and its substantial antiviral activity. The preincubation scheme aimed at infection prevention has proven particularly beneficial. We complemented that finding with a detailed investigation of EGCG interactions with viral S-protein subunits, including S2, RBD, and the RBD mutant harboring the N501Y mutation. Molecular modeling experiments revealed N501Y-specific stacking interactions in the RBD-ACE2 complex and provided insight into EGCG interference with the complex formation. Together, these findings provide a molecular basis for the observed EGCG effects and reinforce its prospects in COVID-19 prevention therapy.",

In the search for new antiviral agents, particular attention is paid to native compounds due to their availability and safety. Epigallocatechin-3-gallat (EGCG, Fig. 1A) , a major component of the green tea extract, is currently in the limelight, as it shows pronounced inhibitory activity against various types of viruses, especially with positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes [1] . Discussions on EGCG applicability for SARS-CoV-2 treatment or prevention are mostly grounded by the results of lentiviral systembased assays [2] . Direct evidence for EGCG activity against SARS-CoV-2 is limited [3] , and detailed experiments with the live virus and various treatment schemes are much needed.",

We evaluated EGCG effects on SARS-CoV-2induced plaque and CPE formation using Vero cells and live viruses isolated from COVID-19 patients. In scheme A1, cells were first preincubated with EGCG for 2 h, and then treated with a virus-EGCG mixture. In scheme A2, cells were incubated with EGCG for 2 h after the infection. Plaque formation was analyzed 3 days after the infection (Fig. 1B) . Hydroxychloroquine (hydroxychloroquine sulphate) was used as a positive control. Although Hydroxychloroquine efficiency in vivo is a controversial point [4, 5] , it has proven to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [6] . The experiments were performed for a series of EGCG dilutions, and fitting of the resulting curves to the dose-response equation gave IC 50 values of 4 \u00b1 1 mM (scheme A1) and 10 \u00b1 2 mM (scheme A2). This result indicates that inhibition of viral entry, rather than replication blockage, likely underlies EGCG activity. Moderate effects on viral replication are attributable to EGCG affinity for 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL)-protease and/or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. Both of these proteins have been predicted as EGCG targets based on docking experiments [7, 8] , and EGCG interaction with 3CL-protase binding has been confirmed in vitro [9] .",

Reported molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided some insight into the observed effect of this mutation: it has been attributed to more efficient electrostatic interactions between RBDm and ACE2 [15] or hydrophobic interactions that predetermine positioning of RBDm Y501 residue between Y41 and K353 in hACE2 [16] . The latter variant agrees with the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the complex [17] , but suggests only slightly increased RBDm binding affinity for ACE2 [16] .

These findings were further confirmed by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2D) : the structured protein-specific CD band shifted from 210 to 215 nm upon titration with EGCG.

Two best conformations of the complexes obtained by docking (EGCG bound to sites 1 and 2, both at the RBD/ ACE2 interface, Fig. 3A ) were optimized and further analyzed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the case of RBD (Fig. 3B) , the EGCG-site 1 complex was stable throughout the simulation. EGCG formed h-bonds with Ser494 and Glu484 (Fig. S2A) , as well as stacking contacts with Tyr449 and Phe490 residues (Fig. S2B) . Evolution of the stacking interactions was visualized as time plots of the distances between centers of mass of EGCG and Tyr/Phe rings and the angles between the normal to the respective planes. The EGCG-site 2 complex fell apart by 80 ns, despite multiple contacts in the starting conformation (Fig. S2) , suggesting transient interactions.",
