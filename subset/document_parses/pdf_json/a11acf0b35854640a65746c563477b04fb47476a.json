According to our observation, vaccination appears to be the greatest protective factor towards COVID-19. Unlike previous reports in the context of rheumatic diseases [5] , no major or fatal COVID-19-related complications were reported in our patients receiving rituximab: our therapeutic scheme is limited to a single infusion of 375 mg/m 2 and this strategy may protect against severe complications.",

Two patients reported SARS-CoV-2 infection a few days after their last infusion of rituximab. The clinical outcome was good in all cases and no patient required hospitalization: 5/24 on rituximab and 1/5 on MMF had mild symptoms, including fever (> 37 \u00b0C), cough, fatigue or gastrointestinal disorders. Median time to achieve negative swab test was 24 (7-38) and 23 (14-32) days in the rituximab and MMF groups, respectively.",
