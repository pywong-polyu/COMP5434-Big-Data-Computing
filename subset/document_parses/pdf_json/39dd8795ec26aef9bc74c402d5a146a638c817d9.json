They were requested to wear face masks whenever possible. There were 943 healthcare workers sent to support Wuhan from hospitals located in Guangzhou. When they came back to Guangzhou (on 20 March 2020), they were required to undergo 14 days of quarantine.

These results were then compared with data from local healthcare workers from Wuhan and Jingzhou of Hubei Province. All RT-PCR and serology tests were performed in government-approved laboratories using protocols approved by the Chinese FDA as previously described. 5 This study identifies two important points. First, prior training on use of Level 2/3 PPE, in conjunction with standard infection control practice, was very effective in protecting healthcare personnel from SARS-CoV-2 infection even though they were in direct contact with patients and were actively involved in management of patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19.
