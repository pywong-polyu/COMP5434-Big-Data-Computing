Cryo-electron tomography suggests that each virion contains 35-40 viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes, or ribonucleosomes, arrayed along the genome. There is, however, little mechanistic understanding of the vRNP complex. Here, we show that N protein, when combined with viral RNA fragments in vitro, forms cylindrical 15-nm particles similar to the vRNP structures observed within coronavirus virions. These vRNPs form in the presence of stem-loop-containing RNA and depend on regions of N protein that promote protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions.",

The ~30kb single-stranded RNA genome is packed inside the virus in a structure called the nucleocapsid (2, 3) . Following infection and genomic RNA unpackaging, the first twothirds of the genome is translated to produce numerous non-structural proteins (Nsps) that rearrange host cell membranes to establish the replication-transcription complex (RTC), a network of double-membrane vesicles that scaffolds viral genome replication and transcription (4-7). The final third of the genome then serves as a template for generation of the four structural proteins that form the mature virus (8-10).",

The S, M, and E proteins all contain transmembrane domains that insert into the ER, while the N protein localizes in the cytosol at the RTC and at nearby sites of viral assembly (4, 6, (11) (12) (13) (14) . N protein is the most abundant viral protein in an infected cell (15) and serves two essential functions in the coronavirus life cycle: 1) regulation of viral transcription at the RTC, where it facilitates transcriptional template switching required for production of structural protein transcripts; and 2) compaction of the viral RNA genome into the nucleocapsid structure within the virion (16-18).",

In solution, N protein exists predominantly as a dimer due to a high-affinity dimerization interface on the CTD but also forms tetramers and higher-order oligomers that are modulated by the disordered N-terminal extension (NTE) and C-terminal extension (CTE, Fig. 1a ) (20, 22,(25)(26)(27)(28).

N protein mixed with 5'-800 RNA formed two broad peaks: one smaller peak that appears similar in size to the 5'-600 species (both ~750-800 kDa), and a second larger peak roughly twice as large as the first (~1400 kDa).

Analysis of the GraFix-purified fractions by native gel electrophoresis revealed sharper, more discrete bands compared to the non-crosslinked sample (Fig. 1D, bottom) . The distribution of vRNP complexes across the gradient was similar between the two conditions. The GraFix purified sample (fractions 7 + 8) was analyzed by mass photometry, revealing one peak with an approximate mass of 727 \u00b1 4 kDa (Fig. 1E , bottom and table S1).

Based on the similar molecular mass of the smaller peak in the crosslinked sample (737 \u00b1 11 kDa) to the noncrosslinked sample (736 \u00b1 27 kDa), we suspect that the larger crosslinked complex of 840 \u00b1 12 kDa contains 14 N proteins.

These lower bands might represent subcomplexes in which the 5'-600 RNA is bound to fewer N proteins, presumably due to defects in vRNP assembly or stability. Deletion of the CTE resulted in a small shift that was considerably lower than the fully shifted vRNP.

We performed fluorescence anisotropy to quantitatively measure the affinity of a 10-nt RNA (of random sequence) for mutant N proteins, which likely reflects RNA binding to the highaffinity RNA-binding site on the NTD ( fig. S2C ) (51). Wild-type N protein had an affinity of 28 \u00b1 6 nM for the 10 nt RNA oligo, which is consistent with previous measurements of RNA binding to the NTD (51). All mutant N proteins, except the SR deletion, had similar affinities for RNA. Deletion of the SR region resulted in a modest ~5-fold decrease in affinity, consistent with previous reports that the SR region makes a slight contribution to RNA binding at the NTD (51). The increase in free SL8 RNA in native gel electrophoresis is therefore likely caused by defects in lower-affinity RNA binding at other sites in the N protein, which might be necessary for proper ribonucleosome formation.",

We mixed 5'-600 RNA with the 10D mutant Negative stain EM and two-dimensional class average analysis of the GraFixpurified 10D ribonucleoprotein complex, however, revealed a markedly different structure compared to the wild-type vRNPs ( Fig. 4C and Fig. 1F ). The 10D complex appears extended and heterogeneous, unlike the compact structure of the wild-type vRNP, and does not average into discrete, recognizable two-dimensional classifications. We therefore speculate that the 600 nt RNA provides sufficient binding sites for twelve 10D N proteins, but the 10D mutant is unable to condense into the ring structure observed with the wild-type N protein. We note that there was no defect in RNA binding to the NTD of the 10D mutant (Kd = 31 \u00b1 7 nM) ( fig. S2C ).",

Consistent with this model, we observed maximal phosphorylation of N in the presence of all three kinases (Fig. 5B) . Phosphorylation was greatly reduced when both SRPK priming sites were mutated to alanine (S188A + S206A mutant) (Fig. 5B ). We mixed kinase-treated wild-type or S188A + S206A N proteins with SL8 RNA and purified the resulting vRNP complexes by GraFix (Fig. 5C ). Wild-type phosphorylated N protein migrated as a low molecular weight ribonucleoprotein complex across the gradient, similar to the 10D mutant. The poorly phosphorylated S188A + S206A mutant, however, formed an appropriately sized vRNP across the gradient, similar to wild type unphosphorylated N protein (Fig. 5C ). Mass photometry of the GraFix-purified samples further substantiated the defect in wild-type phospho-N vRNP assembly (Fig. 5D, top) , which is rescued by mutation of the two priming phosphorylation sites (the S188A + S206A mutant) (Fig. 5D , bottom).",

These interactions might involve SR binding to the CTD (52), LH binding to other regions of the N protein, helical stacking of the CBP (22), and tetramerization driven by the CTE (20, 50, 54, 55) . All of these binding interfaces contribute to the stability of the vRNP, but the CTE seems particularly critical for ribonucleosome formation. Coronavirus genomic RNA is structurally heterogeneous (45, 46) , and it remains unclear how ribonucleosomes accommodate variable RNA sequence and structure to package RNA in the virion. We find that the vRNP assembles in the presence of 600-nt RNA fragments from multiple genomic regions, suggesting that no specific sequences are required for vRNP formation. Furthermore, the ability of short stem-loop RNAs to trigger vRNP formation suggests that ribonucleosome formation does not require 600 continuous bases of RNA. Inside the virion, it is not known whether each ribonucleosome forms on a continuous stretch of RNA in a nucleosome-like fashion or instead acts as a hub that binds stem-loops distributed across the genome, creating a web of condensed, interlinked protein-RNA interactions with 'nodes' at the ~38 vRNPs.",

Our data suggest that the most stable form of the vRNP is 12 N proteins in complex with ~600 nt of RNA, but we also observed complexes that contain fewer or more N protein dimers. Given the iterative assembly of the vRNP, the multitude of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, and the high concentrations of N protein and RNA in the nucleocapsid, it seems reasonable to expect that the vRNP can expand to expose binding sites that allow additional N protein dimers to insert themselves into, or dissociate from, the cylindrical vRNP complex.",

It has been estimated that there are ~1000 N proteins per virus (56), while the viral genome is 30,000 nt in length, suggesting that some N proteins and RNA in the virion are not incorporated into vRNPs. Cryo-electron tomography studies indicate that most vRNPs are associated with the inner face of the membrane envelope, with a structurefree center in every virus (40, 43, 57) . Based on previous studies from our lab and others, this central region in the virion might contain a gel-like condensate of N protein bound heterogeneously to viral RNA (35, 37, 38) . N protein is highly phosphorylated in infected cells, and numerous kinases have been implicated in this phosphorylation (15, 16, 29, 30, 38) . (66) . Thus, inhibition of N protein phosphorylation represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention that has the potential to reduce mortality in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and could serve as an early treatment in the event of future coronavirus outbreaks.",

These results suggest that vRNPs assembled with 600-nt RNAs are more stable than those formed with multiple copies of a single short stem-loop RNA, potentially because a single long RNA provides binding sites for all twelve N proteins in the vRNP. This multivalent RNA scaffold stabilizes low-affinity protein-protein interactions within the vRNP and reflects the more physiologically relevant state of RNA compaction by N protein in the virion. Phosphorylation of N protein in its disordered SR region by host kinases inhibits vRNP formation, perhaps by inhibiting SR-dependent protein-protein interactions, lending further mechanistic insight into the functions of N protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during coronavirus infection. Despite the high level of N protein phosphorylation in the infected cell, mechanisms must exist to generate a poorly phosphorylated N protein population at sites of viral assembly.",

            "text": "During viral assembly, one copy of the ~30 kb viral genome is packaged per virus, while cellular and subgenomic viral RNA are excluded from the virion (58). In murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a 94 nt stem-loop in the genomic RNA is necessary for exclusion of subgenomic RNA from the virus, suggesting that an analogous sequence or structure exists in SARS-CoV-2 (59). Our results demonstrate that the vRNP of SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to possess strict sequence or structure specificities, suggesting that another mechanism ensures specific incorporation of genomic RNA into the mature virus. TheMembrane (M) protein likely functions in this capacity.M protein is a 25 kDa structural protein containing three transmembrane helices followed by a ~100 aa C-terminal domain that faces the interior of the virion and is thought to interact with the C-terminus of N protein (58, 60-63). This interaction is required for maintaining packaging specificity in MHV(64,65). The soluble CTD of M protein triggers RNA-independent phase separation when mixed with N protein(35), suggesting that M protein binding promotes a conformational change in N protein that leads to multivalent protein-protein interactions. Additionally, vRNPs in coronavirus virions appear to interact directly with the inner face of the virus membrane, with the circular 'base' of each vRNP cylinder proximal to the membrane(43,44, 57). With these lines of evidence in mind, it seems likely that M protein binds ribonucleosomes, through the CTD and CTE of N, and tethers them to the viral membrane. Studies in MHV-infected cells have shown that N protein interacts with all coronavirus subgenomic RNAs, while M protein interacts only with full length genomic RNA(63). The interaction of M with the vRNP might therefore promote binding of specific sequences or structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA that allows for exclusive packaging of the coronavirus genome. Further biochemical and genetic studies will be necessary to clarify the precise role of each protein in this process and to see if any specific sequences promote packaging specificity in SARS-CoV-2.",

Phosphorylation of N is required for transcription of subgenomic RNAs that encode the four structural proteins (16, 30). We and others have previously shown that phosphorylated N forms liquid-like biomolecular condensates in the presence of viral RNA (35, 38). These condensates likely form at the RTC in infected cells and serve in part as a compartment to concentrate and protect viral replication and transcriptional machinery. N protein function at the RTC is also likely to depend, at least in part, on an interaction with Nsp3 on double membrane vesicles (11, 32-34). Our current results show that phosphorylated N protein cannot form ribonucleosomes, and instead forms elongated, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein structures when mixed with longer viral RNA. These heterogeneous structures might serve as the foundation of the condensate compartment at the RTC and maintain RNA in an uncompacted state that is necessary for transcription of structural protein RNAs. Chemical inhibition of SRPK with the FDA-approved drug Alectinib severely reduces replication of SARS-CoV-2 in multiple cell types (29). Additionally, inhibition of GSK3 with lithium reduces coronavirus replication in cultured cells, and analysis of clinical data of patients taking lithium revealed a ~50% reduction in COVID-19 infection compared to those not on lithium",
