SRM has never been tested 51 outdoors, but large volcanic eruptions are evidence that increasing stratospheric aerosols would 52 cool the planet (2,3). While responses of temperature and precipitation to SRM have been studied 53 in detail, very little is known about possible consequences for humans or ecosystems (4,5). 54 Although there is high confidence in the adverse impacts of global warming-and therefore, 55 motivation to avoid unmitigated warming-the climate of a world with SRM would still differ in 56 notable ways from the current or preindustrial climates. As a result, there is no a priori reason to 57 think that geoengineering would necessarily improve health outcomes uniformly across regions or 58 health burdens. One study has examined the potential impact of SRM on skin cancer and pollution-59 related illness (6), while another has explored health impacts of urban heat stress (7). However, 60 very little is known about possible impacts on infectious diseases, which account for a much higher 61 proportion of global mortality (especially in low-and middle-income countries). This constitutes 62 a major research gap (8), especially given increased attention on SRM and the critical need to 63 consider risks to health in policymaking on climate change.",

For both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, substantial increases in populations at risk from malaria 215 are projected in east Africa and to a lesser degree central Africa, particularly in high elevation 216 regions where colder temperatures have previously limited malaria transmission. In west Africa, 217 malaria risk also increases, but is dependent on the amount of warming; in RCP 8.5, population 218 exposed to stable transmission risk peaks mid-century and then declines, as much of the region 219 becomes too warm. South and southeast Asia show a similar trend, where warming temperatures 220 in RCP 8.5 lead to massive declines in population at risk (~200 million people in each region), 221 including some populations shifting from stable into unstable risk. In the rest of the tropics, 222 warming temperatures lead to little change or mild declines in total risk, again with shifts from 223 stable to unstable transmission risk. 224 We find that solar geoengineering to stabilize planetary temperatures at 2020 levels despite 225 moderate greenhouse gas emissions (the G3 scenario) is projected to initially mitigate population 226 at risk of malaria very slightly, but this effect is short-lived and uncertain, and the total population 227 at risk converges on climate change without geoengineering (RCP 4.5) by mid-century (Figure 3) . 228 This largely holds across regions (Extended Data Figures 1 and 2) ; the most pronounced (Figure 3) . We also find strong regional patterns for these projected impacts. For Finally, we observed that uncertainty about both baseline climate change impacts and 249 geoengineering impacts showed a tremendous degree of regional variation, which was largely 250 consistent between mid-and high-emissions scenarios. In Latin America and central Africa, 251 changes were highly consistent across climate model runs, and differences between scenarios were 252 minimal. In east and west Africa, we found that differences between climate scenarios were 253 pronounced, but again largely consistent across runs by the end of the century. However, we found 254 that southern Asia-a hotspot of projected changes, and the global hotspot of vivax malaria 255 .

This matters particularly 309 for the health sector, where tradeoffs may emerge between the priorities of developing countries 310 and of those with the greatest influence in climate policy. Vector-borne diseases are largely 311 projected to shift from the tropics to higher latitudes, especially into more affluent countries with 312 stronger health systems, and that increased risk has dominated conversations about their climate 313 change impacts as compared to trends in the rest of the world. For example, dengue incursion into 314 Europe regularly gathers almost as much attention as the record-setting 2019 dengue epidemics in 315 at least a dozen developing countries. Previous work in this space has cautioned against framing 316 the health impacts of climate change around the encroachment of tropical diseases into less 317 vulnerable Global North countries, but this remains a dominant talking point for climate change 318 impacts on vector-borne disease. 319 Debate around solar geoengineering could readily fall into similar traps. While geoengineering 320 might reverse the incursion of tropical diseases into higher latitudes, this framing is oblivious to 321 the reality that the global burden of infectious disease falls disproportionately on the same poorer, 322 tropical and subtropical countries (including small island states) that are syndemically vulnerable 323 to future climate impacts and climate injustice. Framing geoengineering around the health impacts 324 of the \"climate emergency\" may therefore be undesirable (43), compared to a strategy that 325 meaningfully engages developing countries in terms of their priorities, and develops a 326 comprehensive evidence base of how proposed scenarios will redistribute disease burden between 327 regions.

In Africa, deaths from yellow fever could increase by 10% to 25%, depending on warming trajectories and vaccination program coverage (14). But none of these viral infections have a remotely comparable burden to malaria. For comparison, dengue fever is the highest-burden mosquito-borne virus (15). In 2019, the Americas experienced a world-record 3 million reported cases, including at least 1,200 reported deaths. In contrast, the global annual case total of malaria exceeds 200 million, with at least 400,000 deaths almost all caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria remains the sixth largest cause of death in low income countries; though highly effective control efforts have reduced falciparum malaria prevalence in Africa by half since the turn of the century (16)-making elimination plausible within a generation (17) -the impacts of COVID-19 might jeopardize this progress(18,19). Most available evidence suggests that climate change will favor the expansion of falciparum malaria into southern Africa and highelevation regions of east Africa, and possibly reduce transmission in central Africa and the west African Sahel, though less certainty exists on the second point (20-25).Comparatively less attention has been paid to Plasmodium vivax malaria, which is responsible for at most 1% of the total global deaths from malaria, but is responsible for 42% of all malaria cases outside Africa, and is likely underreported globally (26). In the Americas, P. vivax is predominant 100 in most malaria reporting countries, and cases are increasing, including co-infections, according101 to recent work (27). The collapse of Venezuela's economy, and resulting migration of populations 102 in its wake, following a rapid rise in malaria cases reported from Venezuela, have led to 103 resurgences of both strains of malaria in elimination regions in Latin America (28). This signals 104 that suitable conditions can give rise to re-seeding and re-establishment of transmission in the 105 absence of strict surveillance and control programs (perhaps a bellwether for the importance of climate shifts). The prospect of encroachment of vivax malaria into new areas is particularly troubling, as elimination strategies have largely focused on P. falciparum, and basic surveillance may therefore overlook the need to anticipate P. vivax, or may simply not have the required testing capacity. Despite these looming risks, vivax malaria is often under-represented in climate work, as comparatively less has been known about its ecology.Two aspects of malaria transmission make this disease a high priority for risk assessment in solar 112 geoengineering research. First, malaria's burden is measurable enough that it impacts economic 113 growth and population-level mortality; if geoengineering is intended to reduce the health risks of climate change in developing countries, perhaps one of the greatest reductions could be 115 experienced through impacts on malaria. Second, for a pathogen with a mostly tropical burden, malaria is unusually adapted to cooler temperatures, with peak transmission around 25\u00b0C (29). It has been hypothesized that malaria transmission could be inadvertently facilitated by SRM (8), especially given that SRM may cool tropical latitudes relatively more (30).

Following (45), we used daily gridded climate data and mapped the number of days in each pixel that were fully within the thermal bounds of transmission based on R0(T). Adapting the approach used by previous studies, we masked out deserts based on the most commonly used definition in the geosciences 401 (250 mm annual precipitation or less). This step accounts for the possibility that some areas are too arid for mosquitoes to complete their reproductive cycle in some areas (though some species, like An. stephensi, are container breeders like the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, and may persist in areas with the help of human structures). Beyond this masking step, the presence or absence of Anopheles vectors only minimally limit this approach; roughly a hundred species of Anopheles are capable of transmitting malaria on every inhabited continent, and competent vectors occurred throughout the regions we were considering (46). However, it remains possible that mosquito range shifts-or possible coevolution between mosquitoes and parasites in the futurecould change the reliability of this first order proxy, as could the expansion of P. vivax and An. stephensi mosquitoes in eastern Africa, or any other state shifts in malaria control.To reflect differences in vector-pathogen systems across landscapes, we used three separate transmission models by region (see below). In sub-Saharan Africa, we used the canonical estimates of Plasmodium falciparum transmission by An. gambiae (17 to 34\u00b0C), based on (29). Several 414 .

For Plasmodium vivax in southern Asia, we used a more recent estimate by (44), which assumes that transmission 419 by An. stephensi occurs between 15.7\u00b0C and 32.5\u00b0C. For P. vivax in the Americas, where at least ten Anopheles vectors have been identified as transmitters of malaria (47), as there is little published thermal ecology for individual vector-parasite pairs, we assumed based that local vectors were comparable to An. gambiae in their thermal ecology, and that the bounds of vivax transmission were 19.4\u00b0C to 31.6\u00b0C.",
