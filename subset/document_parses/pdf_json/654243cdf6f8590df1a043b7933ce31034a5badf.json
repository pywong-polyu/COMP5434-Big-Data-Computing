The decrease in the number of autophagosomes, downregulation of LC3b expression and upregulation of p62 expression indicated that MgIG significantly inhibited ConA-induced autophagy in the liver. Reactivation of autophagy by rapamycin (RAPA) reversed the protective effect of MgIG against ConAinduced liver injury. Compared with MgIG treatment, activation of autophagy by RAPA also promoted the expression of liver inflammation markers (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CXCL-1, CXCL-2, CXCL-10, etc.) and hepatocyte death. In vitro experiments also showed that MgIG reduced ConA-induced hepatocyte death but did not decrease hepatocyte apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy.",

Studies have shown that a variety of extracts have many pharmacological activities, such as antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and other activities (Richard, 2021) . Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) is a magnesium salt mainly composed of 18\u03b1-glycyrrhizic acid stereoisomers ( Figure 1A ) and belongs to the fourth generation of glycyrrhizic acid preparations. As a novel glycyrrhizic acid extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine licorice, MgIG has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, immunoregulatory and hepatocellular protective effects (Tang et al., 2021) . MgIG can protect the liver by regulating lipid metabolism in a mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Jiang et al., 2020) , and MgIG can inhibit hepatotoxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in a mouse model of arsenic trioxide induced acute liver injury (Liu et al., 2021) . Therefore, MgIG is widely used as a hepatoprotective agent to ameliorate liver injury and improve liver function. However, there has been little research on the mechanism underlying the effect of MgIG against concanavalin A (ConA)induced immune liver injury.",

Autophagy, a physiological process in which cells degrade harmful components and recycle them to achieve the needs of cell metabolism and the renewal of some organelles, plays different roles in various models of severe hepatitis-related liver failure. In D-GalN/LPS induced liver injury in mice, an increase in the level of autophagy may play a protective role in the liver. In contrast, autophagy tends to promote injury in ConAinduced liver injury in mice (Tian et al., 2021) . Studies have shown that ConA induces dendritic cell activation by enhancing autophagy, which exacerbates autoimmune hepatitis . Furthermore, it is worth noting that ConA can mediate hepatocyte death through mitochondrial autophagy; thus, ConA is the focus of many antitumor studies, especially those involving the inhibition of hepatoma cells Lai et al., 2015) . Thus, abnormal autophagic flux may be detrimental either via its pro-survival effects (such as in cancer progression) or its possible cell death-promoting effects (Levine and Kroemer, 2019) . Inhibition of aberrant autophagic flux may be a new therapeutic approach for ConA-induced immune liver injury.",

Furthermore, in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) in which the inflammatory response was induced by LPS, MgIG effectively inhibited the expression of inflammatory factor genes and inflammation-related proteins (Supplementary Figure S2, 3) . Therefore, we further investigated whether MgIG regulates inflammation by inhibiting autophagy. Analysis of cytokine levels in the sera of mice showed that the expression of some inflammation-related cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, KC, MIP-2, IP-10, GM-CSF, LIF, and IL-12 (p40), was significantly increased in the ConA model group and decreased in the MgIG treatment group. RAPA-induced activation of autophagy successfully reversed the protective effect of MgIG. IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, KC, MIP-2, IP-10, GM-CSF, LIF, IL-12 (p40) expression was increased in the RAPA intervention group compared with the MgIG treatment group ( Figure 3A) . The results of mRNA expression of corresponding inflammation-related cytokines in liver tissues showed that the trend in the expression of cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, KC, MIP-2, and IP-10 was consistent with that in peripheral blood ( Figure 3B ). However, there was no significant difference in the expression of GM-CSF, LIF, or IL-12 (p40) in the liver tissues between any groups. Moreover, we measured the levels of 20 cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b1, in the peripheral blood of mice, and the results showed that the expression of some cytokines was not regulated by autophagy or was not significantly regulated (Supplementary Figure S4) . The above results indicate that MgIG regulates inflammatory factors by inhibiting autophagy to play a protective role but that this is not the main pathway underlying the effect of MgIG.",

MgIG at different concentrations treatment had no cytotoxicity effect on mouse primary hepatocytes, and MgIG significantly decreased hepatocyte cytotoxicity after ConA exposure (Supplementary Figure S6) . Furthermore, hepatocytes were pretreated with various concentrations of MgIG 1 hour before ConA administration, and the results showed that as the MgIG concentration gradually increased, autophagy was gradually inhibited, as manifested by a gradual decrease in the level of LC3 and a gradual increase in the level of p62. However, the difference in caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 levels was not obvious after MgIG treatment ( Figure 5A ). When the autophagy activator RAPA was administered, the change in autophagy level was successfully reversed, the LC3 level increased and the p62 level decreased. The level of the apoptosis-related protein caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 was no significant difference ( Figure 5B ). Importantly, we determined the number of dead hepatocytes using flow cytometry. The number of dead hepatocytes was significantly reduced in the MgIG treatment group compared with the ConA model group, but RAPA intervention reversed the reduction in hepatocyte death ( Figure 5C ). Moreover, we measured the number of hepatocytes stained by apoptotic reagents using flow cytometry, and the results showed that there was no significant difference in the level of apoptosis between any of the groups (Supplementary Figure S7) . The above results show that MgIG reduces hepatocyte death but does not decrease hepatocyte apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy in vitro.",

Autophagy is inextricably linked with hepatocyte metabolism and the occurrence and development of liver diseases. It not only regulates hepatocyte function but also affects nonparenchymal cells such as macrophages and endothelial and hepatic stellate cells. Additionally, the abnormal regulation of autophagy is closely related to many liver diseases (Allaire et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020b) . Studies have shown that the loss of autophagy can promote spontaneous hepatomegaly and liver injury in an Atg5-shRNA mouse model but that liver damage can be significantly alleviated after intervention with autophagy activators (Cassidy et al., 2018) . Moreover, autophagy plays a key role in restricting various types of stress-related liver injury and even hepatocyte death caused by hepatotoxic drugs, ischemia-reperfusion and so on (Xue et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . However, every coin has two sides: autophagy can act as a temporary protective mechanism during transient stress but can also promote cell death, especially in the case of prolonged autophagy or excessive autophagy. A robust autophagy response is usually harmful, especially when the circulation of cellular components in the cell pool is disrupted (Brunk and Terman, 2002; Pattingre et al., 2005) , or enhances harmful side effects such as the formation of pathogenic \u03b2-amyloid (Yu et al., 2005) . Studies have found that promoting autophagy seems to make neurons and glial cells more likely to die (Eskelinen et al., 2003; Shacka et al., 2006) . Regulating autophagy has emerged as a potential new therapeutic strategy when autophagy itself becomes a risk factor. In our study, the main mechanism of ConA-induced liver injury in mice was increased autophagic flux. MgIG significantly reduced liver injury while also inhibiting autophagy, and the protective effect of MgIG was reversed by inhibiting the kinase mTOR to activate autophagy.",

In fact, the role of autophagy in inflammatory regulation has received increasing attention as the understanding of the mechanism of autophagy and inflammation has improved (Jin and Zhang, 2020) . A recent study showed that autophagy promoted by the inactivation of mTOR is the main mechanism of injury in airway inflammation induced by particulate matter (Wu et al., 2020) . In addition, researchers studied the function of autophagy and its related proteins in inflammation and concluded that autophagy-related proteins are involved in the functions of almost all cell types involved in inflammation and that inhibiting or augmenting autophagy has dramatic effects in a multitude of cell culture and animal models of inflammatory disorders (Matsuzawa-Ishimoto et al., 2018) . Hence, increased attention has been paid to strategies that target autophagy to decrease the inflammatory response. In this study, MgIG reduced inflammation by inhibiting autophagy, which was mainly manifested by a reduction in the expression of inflammatory factors in the sera of mice and of the expression of corresponding inflammatory genes in liver tissue. When autophagy is activated, the effect of MgIG on reducing inflammation is reversed, which further explains the regulatory effect of autophagy on inflammation. However, in our analysis of the levels of various inflammation-related cytokines in the mouse serum, not all inflammation-related cytokines were affected by autophagy regulation. This may have been because the regulation of inflammation by autophagy is only part of the molecular (5, 20, 80 , 320 \u03bcg/ml) on protein (caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, P62 and LC3b) expression levels in vitro were determined by western blotting, with \u03b2-actin as a control ( ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05).

            "text": "MgIG mainly exerts its protective effect against ConA-induced autophagic cell death (ACD) by inhibiting autophagy. ConA can induce T cell mitogens in autoimmune hepatitis to cause immune damage (Kaneko et al., 2000) ; moreover, it exhibits a certain level of cytotoxicity: ConA is internalized into the cell after binding to the mannose residues of polysaccharides or glycoproteins on the cell membrane and then preferentially aggregates on mitochondria to cause changes in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. Although it is possible that ConA induces apoptosis, this was not the main molecular mechanism. Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE)/7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) double staining, there was little difference between the groups. Conversely, the level of autophagy increases after hepatocytes exposed to ConA, leading to lysosomal degradation of the affected mitochondria and cell death . We used SYTOX Green Nucleic Acid Stain to stain dead cells (Roth et al., 1997) and then performed flow cytometric analysis, and we found that cells exposed to ConA exhibited autophagydependent death. It's worth noting the role MgIG plays in this process. MgIG reduced cell death and inhibited autophagy under ConA exposure and activation of autophagy reversed this result. However, MgIG does not affect apoptosis in vitro. Meanwhile, we analyzed apoptosis in vivo mouse liver tissues. The results showed that cell apoptosis was significantly enhanced after ConA treatment and that the expression of apoptosis-related proteins was significantly changed in the ConA group compared with the control group. MgIG also affected tissue apoptosis and had a significant inhibitory effect. However, the activation of autophagy did not change this outcome. The activity and expression level of the apoptosisrelated protein Caspase-3 showed no difference with the level of apoptosis in mouse liver tissues, but this does not mean that cells did not die. This further demonstrates the role of abnormal autophagy flux in promoting injury, and indicates that MgIG reduces liver injury by inhibiting autophagy. In fact, some studies have proposed that ACD, which is due to the accumulation of autophagosomes in dying cells, occurs, especially when autophagy is the key mechanism determining cell fate (Amelio et al., 2011) . Research has also shown that Atg gene products are necessary for cell death (Bursch, 2001) . Although autophagy is prominent in non-apoptotic forms of cell death, changes in necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy often occur simultaneously, especially in vivo (Clarke et al., 1998; Lemasters et al., 2002) . This also explains the inconsistency in MgIG anti-apoptotic levels between the in vivo experiments and in vitro experiments.",

Whether metabolites of MgIG are more active in inhibition of autophagy and anti-inflammatory is worthy of further study. Moreover, the pathway still needs to make it further about MgIG inhibiting autophagy. In summary, we clarified the mechanism by which MgIG reduces hepatocyte death and the inflammatory response by inhibiting autophagy to ameliorate liver injury. This study provides proof that strategies that target autophagy can be used to treat diseases and a solid theoretical basis for the treatment of liver disease with MgIG.",
