As part of the strategy to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, on April 27th 2020, several regions in Germany introduced a provision of mouth-nose protection in public places. Facemasks differ in their effectiveness, depending on the grade of droplet deposition and are one of the most effective intervention strategies against COVID-19 [5] .

Forty-five percent of the subjects reported missing their regular doctor appointment in the first half of the year 2020 due to the pandemic. The appointments were cancelled in equal parts by the patient and by their doctor or clinic. Only 5.5-8.5% of the appointments were substituted by a telephone visit-a proportion that did not differ across age-groups. At the time point of this assessment only 3. 8% (in children > 6 years) to 12.3% (in adults) wore FFP2 masks. The percentage of surgical masks (35.4-41.7%) and self-made masks (100% < 6 years old, but 50-60% in older children and adults) were similar between age-groups.

Interestingly, almost a third (32%) of parents of the preschool children reported improved course of disease since the beginning of the pandemic (Fig. 1d) . No infection with SARS-CoV-2 was reported among asthmatics. The prevalence of asthma among SARS-CoV-2 patients reported differed between children (< 5%) [8] and adults (5-17.9%) [9] . Large variations in prevalence were observed across countries and between age-groups among adults. Notably, data on asthma prevalence among children with SARS-CoV-2 is rare. Even with the relatively low sample size, our data supports findings of marginally lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among asthmatics compared to the general population [10] . These results overall may suggest that asthmatics are not at increased risk of COVID-19. However, a sizeable proportion of adult patients (20%) reported worsening of disease which was strongly associated with symptoms of depression (p = 0.002)-but unrelated to limited access to health care. Other authors reported the risk of health deterioration especially in patients with chronic diseases due to missed or postponed appointments during the current pandemic [11] . Our data support the urgent need to investigate alternative care options for patients with chronic diseases, especially during the pandemic era. The World Health Organization states that wearing a mask of breathable material is safe, and the protective effect for the wearer is supposed to be a result of the reduced risk of virus load in case of exposure to an infectious individual [12] . However, wearing a facemask resulted in a feeling of difficult breathing across all age ranges in one-third to two-thirds of asthma patients in this survey. We did not examine the extent of discomfort in healthy control subjects, thus, disease-related differences cannot be asserted. We, therefore, cannot assess the additional asthma-specific contribution to breathing difficulties associated with the facemask. Since the type of mask (self-made, surgical, FFP) was unrelated to the reported subjective symptoms, these may be rather general discomfort than lung function impairment. Since the use of FFP2 masks has increased significantly in the population, future data will provide more differentiated insight into the impact on subjective and objective outcomes in asthma patients. An intriguing observation is the high percentage of preschool-aged children with reported improvement in symptoms (32%, Fig. 1d ). No worsening of symptoms was reported for any child. In this age-group, viral infections, mostly with rhinovirus, are the predominant trigger of the disease. While some improvements in preschool wheezers are seen in the summer months, the extent of change in this survey seems astonishing. Social distancing, the closing of daycare and kindergarden during lockdown have certainly contributed to a significant reduction in exposure to viral infections. However, since we do not have a direct comparison with data before the lockdown, we cannot quantify the impact of reduced exposure. In essence, the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered a natural experimentallowing the assessment of the relative contribution of viral infections to asthma and pre-school morbidity at a young age.",

While we observed a high rate of problems caused by facemasks and a significant reduction in the use of routine medical care regardless of the age of our asthma patient, the impact on psychological health and asthma control was completely contrary. The corona related side effects on adults in terms of depression and disease progression is worrying. However, children hardly seem to suffer from the measures and sometimes even experience an improvement regarding their asthma control. This improvement might be contributed to a significant reduction in exposure to viral infections. Long-term follow-up may provide us with a better understanding of the influence of viral infections on the development of asthma in early childhood. ",
