            "text": "Objectives The aim of this study was to identify and characterise the health and social care membership of the British Computer Society (BCS), an international informatics professional organisation, and to determine their ongoing development needs. Methods A prepiloted online survey included items on professional regulatory body, job role, work sector, qualifications, career stage, BCS membership (type, specialist group/branch activity (committees, event attendance)), use of BCS. org career planning/continuing professional development (CPD) tools, self-reported digital literacy and other professional registrations. The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics in JASP V.0.9.2 to report frequencies and correlations. Results Responses were received from 152 participants. Most were male (n=103; 68%), aged 50-59 years (n=41; 28%), working in England (n=107; 71%) with master's or honours degrees (n=80; 53%). Most were either new (5 years or less; n=61; 40%) or long-term members (21 years or more; n=43; 28%) of BCS. Most were not interested in health specialist groups (n=57; 38%) preferring non-health specialist groups such as information management (n=54; 37%) and project management (n=52; 34%). Discussion This is the first paper to characterise the health and social care membership of an IT-focused professional body and to start to determine their CPD needs. There are further challenges ahead in curating the content and delivery. Conclusion This study is the starting point from which members' CPD needs, and ongoing interest, in being recognised as health and social care professional members, can be acknowledged and explored. Further research is planned with the participants who volunteered to be part of designing future CPD content and delivery.",

Built on five pillars of: (1) sharing expertise, (2) improving education, (3) influencing practice, (4) driving standards and (5) supporting careers, its membership is now drawn from professions as diverse as the technologies which underpin society including health and social care. 2 During the COVID-19 pandemic, BCS ran a campaign to celebrate IT professionals as 'val workers' keeping society connected and informed. 3 Efforts to manage COVID-19 outbreaks relied on advanced coordinated technologies; the health data scientists and bioinformaticians used digital analytics tools; ordinary citizens relied on digital tools and connectivity for work and education and the health and social care professionals Summary What is already known? \u25ba British Computer Society (BCS), The Chartered",

            "text": "Open access transformed their practice while honing their digital literacy to continue and offer optimal (digital) healthcare services. 4 The Topol Review, published in 2019, focused on 'preparing the healthcare workforce to deliver the digital future'. 5 Building a digitally ready workforce (BDRW) has been an ongoing strategy for the National Health Services (NHS) across the devolved home nations of the UK (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) and increasingly considered for social and care workers too. The review proposed three principles: (1) that patients should be partners in decisions about their health aided by health technologies; (2) that the healthcare workforce needs expertise and guidance to evaluate new technologies and (3) that adoption of new technologies should give health and care professionals 'the gift of time to care'. 5 Three technologies were specifically mentioned: (1) artificial intelligence (AI); (2) genomics and (3) digital medicine . The review emphasised the importance of a digitally competent health and social care workforce which understands data-driven technologies and is 'digitally confident, digitally aware and digitally literate'. It described new disciplines that were likely to emerge such as higher specialist scientists, knowledge management, AI and robotics engineering, digital health technicians, bioinformaticians and digital technologists. 5 In anticipation of, and catering for, the learning needs of an emerging workforce, the BCS planned an internal audit to articulate the provision and needs of current members who work in the health and social care arena. The main objective was to identify appropriate learning scaffolding frameworks and provision of 'in house' continuing professional development (CPD) content, which fit the lifelong learning ethos. However, it became clear at an early stage that the organisation does not have, nor is it set to retrospectively collect, data on professional roles or sectors of its membership. It is, therefore, unaware which of their members identify as health and social care professionals. These data are critical in understanding professional learning needs and how to address them.",

            "text": "A 2020 scoping review of 1.5 million registrants identified 32 healthcare professional job titles in the UK. 6 Each associated with one of the nine regulatory bodies each of which has a different length of CPD cycle (General Optical Council refers to continuing education and training (CET) rather than CPD) ranging from 1 year to 5 years. 6 An earlier 2019 report, prepared by 'The Interprofessional CPD and Lifelong Learning UK Working Group', identified five principles for CPD and lifelong learning for the health and social care sector. 7 Principle 1 stated that it would be each person's responsibility and be made possible and supported by their employer; principle 2 stated that it would benefit service users; principle 3 stated that it would improve the quality of service delivery; principle 4 stated that it would be balanced and relevant and finally, principle 5 stated that it would be recorded and show the effect on each person's area of practice. However, little is included regarding digital (n=0) or informatics (n=0) or technology (n=2) but it calls on professional bodies and trade unions, employers and 'the wider system' to promote CPD to improve the quality of service delivery. 7 In contrast, a most recent commissioned report published in The Lancet considered the future of health and care service post-COVID-19, although 64 pages in length, featured many of these key terms numerous times: digital (n=74), informatics (n=0), technology (n=86) and health (n=1539), social (n=251) and care (n=954). 8 The report names: Health Education England and the Department of Health and Care; National Health Service Education for Scotland; Health Education and Improvement Wales and Northern Ireland Department of Health responsible for health workforce planning. 8 There are key skills and competencies frameworks for health and care [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] which have started to include variations on technical efficiency, informatics competence or similar. It may still take a leap of faith to compare, combine or critically appraise such frameworks against the BCS SFIAplus V.7, a task which is outwith the scope of this study. 16 17 The Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) which, being generic, may lack alignment given health (n=0), social (n=0) and care (n=0) do not feature in SFIAplus. 16 17 Given reports that the health and social care professions account for almost 1 in 10 jobs in the UK 18 and in the aftermath of COVID-19 the rapid digitisation of the sector, the BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, needs to act now. BCS has a responsibility to identify and engage those working with digital health or ehealth or technology enabled care or with health informatics interests and recognise the potential for hybrid career paths which may have specialised CPD needs. 19 Aim of study Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterise the health and social care membership of BCS and to determine their CPD needs.",

This highlights further opportunities for meaningful collaboration to grow the range of CPD on offer. Globally, the challenge has been highlighted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in their 2021 report into 'Empowering the Health Workforce'. 16 The OECD states that, 'To meet the current demand for digital upskilling, the CPD and other professional training schemes should become a shared responsibility between employers, professional organisations, and ministries of health'. 16 It may still take a leap of faith to compare, combine or critically appraise the many frameworks 9-15 against the BCS SFIAplus V.7 17 18 but this task is outwith the scope of this study. There are many other players in the CPD arena, such as the NHS Digital Academy 24 25 and, for this mainly highly educated group of professionals, wider options provided by over 80 MSc courses in health data sciences, analytics and informatics. 20 Certainly, OECD notes that 'the pace of changes has been particularly slow with regard to whether and how the CPD and other on the job training include digital health content'. 16 But, the obstacle is that BCS currently do not know how to meaningfully identify and support their health and social care professional membership with their CPD, CET or lifelong learning needs. It was interesting to note and useful for people organising events and content that participants from all career stages showed commonality in the webinar topics which most and least appealed to them. It is also unclear from the results whether the health and social care professional really understands who and what the BCS is, the purpose of BCS, how BCS can support the breadth of health and social care professionals and what it can offer. If BCS is to support the hybrid careers of health and social care professionals by providing relevant CPD, it must first identify the segment of the membership.",
