While many platforms overseas allow users to pay to subscribe to streamers, e.g., Twitch, Chinese live-streaming platforms, such as YY, Huya, and Douyin, provide a new way for streamers to earn money by receiving virtual gifts from the audience. This is a mechanism different from the subscription system. Sending virtual gifts is a function during live-stream sessions. The audience can send an arbitrary value of virtual gifts multiple times throughout a live-stream session. By now, the only way for content creators to directly earn money through Chinese live-streaming platforms is via the mechanism of the virtual gift (Kaye 2020) . This mechanism makes livestreamer a new and popular occupation.",

While there are several exploratory studies on why people send virtual gifts, they treat all kinds of live streams as a whole. We argue that such a coarse-grain approach misses out on the diversity of live stream contents. For example, there are live streams for small businesses, chatting, singing, or games. There are live streams done by streamers of different gender or age groups. These different types of live streams aim at different audience groups, who have different psychology and financial backgrounds. The content of the live stream also affects how people send virtual gifts. For example, it is unlikely that people will send tons of virtual gifts to live streams done by small businesses because these streamers earn money by selling products.",

Firstly, while the male gaze has been around for a long while, the female gaze is on the rise. There are more female commodities that use young male idols in their advertisements (Li 2020) . Female audiences watching a young man's live stream is an example of this reversed gender relationship. Moreover, the presence of a large number of female audiences who are willing to spend a lot of money on a young man reflects Chinese women's increasing financial power. Furthermore, while these female audiences may enjoy themselves when watching live streams, these virtual events may not have challenged the patriarchal structure. Are these women using these online platforms as a utopia?",

(Li 2018) attempted to use the flow theory 1 to analyze the psychological factors of sending virtual gifts and found that interactions and social presence are associated with the intention of sending virtual gifts. They also found that, when the flow is high, men have higher consumption intentions than women. Zhu et al. (2017) used trace data to unearth several behavior patterns of the audience sending virtual gifts. For example, a longer viewing time is associated with a higher intention of sending virtual gifts. Also, seeing others sending virtual gifts may stimulate viewers to send gifts. They also found that Zhang et al. (2019) described the relationships between streamers, especially the ones with more followers, and their audience as \"commodified virtual relationships.\" From their interviews and observations, on one hand, Zhang et al. found that as streamers gain more followers, they feel less emotionally attached to them, rather, they may consider the audience as possesseble, a source of revenue, and their relationships are \"not an experience of affinity and closeness, but work that is frustratingly soulless and impersonal.\" On the other hand, some audiences consider sending virtual gifts as a way to enhance their social status among the fans and some even may treat streamers, especially female streamers, as \"objects of the gaze, desire, and consumption.\"",

A survey on live stream audiences on other platforms revealed that 66% of the audience have sent virtual gifts (Lu et al. 2018) . Therefore, it is not surprising that the most common answer we found was that they \"send virtual gifts as a reward\" (P11).
