            "text": "Introduction Sciatica is one of the most common reasons for seeking healthcare for musculoskeletal pain. Sciatica is primarily considered as neuropathic in nature when neural tissue in the low back is compromised, but sometimes other non-neural structures may be involved. Appropriate assessment and management are important for patients with sciatica. Therapists use several outcome measures to assess patients to inform selection of the most suitable treatment. There is limited evidence for the best treatment of sciatica, and this is likely contributed to by having no reliable algorithm to categorise patients based on their clinical characteristics to inform physiotherapy treatment. The purpose of this study is to develop a clinical prediction model to categorise patients with sciatica, in terms of early clinical outcome, based on their initial clinical characteristics. Methods and analysis A prospective observational multicentre design will recruit consecutive patients (n=467) with sciatica referred for physiotherapy. Each patient will be evaluated to determine whether or not they will be accepted into the study by answering some questions that will confirm the study's eligibility criteria. Patients' basic characteristics, patient-reported outcome measures and performance-based measures will be collected at baseline from multiple sites in the Greek territory using this same protocol, prior to commencement of treatment. The main researcher of this study will be responsible for data collection in all sites. On completion of the standard referred physiotherapy treatment after 3 weeks' time, participants will be asked by telephone to evaluate their outcome using the Global Perceived Effect Scale. For the descriptive statistical analysis, the continuous variables will be expressed in the form of 'mean' and 'SD'. In order to assess the prognostic value of each predictor, in terms of the level of improvement or worsening of the symptoms, multiple variable regression analysis will be used.",

            "text": "Open access also report low back-related leg pain (LBLP). 1 This pain is commonly referred to as sciatica and is often described as pain radiating to the buttocks, thighs and below the knee, foot and/or toes. LBLP is generally clinically diagnosed as sciatica (lumbar radicular) or referred pain (involving non-neural structures); sciatica is considered neuropathic in nature whereas referred pain is considered nociceptive. 2 It may be accompanied by physical findings of nerve root entrapment, such as decreased sensitivity, alteration in reflex and/or muscle weakness in entrapped nerve root distribution. 3 However, there is evidence to suggest the coexistence of both pain mechanisms in LBLP, 4 and evidence for sciatica presenting without neuropathic pain and referred pain presenting with neuropathic pain. 5 The prevalence of neuropathic pain reported in a recent study by Harrisson et al 2 estimates of neuropathic pain in LBLP ranged from 19% to 80%, although these findings must be observed with caution as the review itself is at moderate risk of bias. LBLP compared with LBP alone is associated with increased disability, pain and poorer quality of life. 6 Sciatica is a relatively common and often a persistent 'nuisance' 7 that leads to the use of health services, 8 prolonged sick leave 9 and has considerable economic consequence in terms of healthcare resources and lost productivity. 10 Although prognosis is good for most patients, a significant proportion (up to 30%) still have pain for a year or more. 11 The aetiology of sciatica varies as described above, as well as lumbar radiculopathy and referred pain. It may be due to severe vertebral pathology as well as other non-vertebral diseases. 12 In a large proportion of cases, it is caused by an intervertebral disc herniation resulting in nerve root irritation, 3 but yet in these cases the management is not straight forward. Sciatica is, therefore, a broad term encompassing multiple diagnoses that require different management. 3 Evaluation of aetiology often involves the use of expensive imaging methods (MRI) which can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the causes of pain. 12 The diagnosis and management of sciatica varies considerably within and between countries, 3 which may reflect treatment availability, clinician preference and socioeconomic variables rather than evidence-based practice. Previous systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) have evaluated the effectiveness of various individual treatment approaches for sciatica, including conservative treatments, 11 13-15 epidural steroid injections 11 14 16 17 and surgical procedures. 18 However, numerous treatments have not been directly compared with other interventions and the results have not been statistically or clinically significant. In order to compare interventions, it would be helpful if study populations had the same clinical characteristics. Populations in the studies are commonly heterogeneous owing to the multiple diagnoses and aetiopathological parameters within sciatica. It is thus easily understood that research interest is increasingly focused on exploring more effective evaluation tools to categorise these patients based on their clinical characteristics with the aim of prediction the outcome of the patients after physiotherapy treatment.",

In the international physiotherapy community, some evaluation tools for sciatica have been proposed with sometimes poor, controversial and/or conflicting results. 12 Although the sample of these research was sufficient the results cannot be generalised to other health systems such as the Greek. There are psychosocial differences in patients of different nationalities in terms of pain and its treatment. 19 and international systems may not be appropriate. Culture across countries also varies. Culture according to Helman 20 is a set of guidelines that individuals inherit as members of a particular society that tells them how to see the world, how to experience it emotionally and how to behave in relation to other people. There is evidence that there are cultural differences in medical, physical and psychosocial findings among patients with pain in the low lumbar region. 19 21 and research based on intracultural comparisons could provide valuable information on the development of features to be included in a classification system. 22 In Greece, no study has yet investigated the evaluation and categorisation of patients with sciatica in terms of early clinical outcome, based on their initial clinical characteristics.",

The regression model with included predictive factors will be fitted to the cohort data to obtain a final set of parameter estimates (ie, alpha and beta terms) which will be used to form the model. Cross-validation will be used for internal validation of the model. Cross-validation can be seen as an extension of the split-sample approach. In a 10-fold cross-validation, the model is developed on 90% of the population and tested in the remaining 10%. This is repeated 10 times, each time using another 10% of the population for testing so that all patients have been included in the test group once. Internal validation will provide estimates of the ability of the model to discriminate between patients with different outcomes as well as the agreement between the observed and predicted risks (calibration). External validation of the derived model is not a focus of this study, because this clinical prediction model targets to patients with sciatica treating with physiotherapy in the Greek heath system. External validation would be very useful if this model was targeted in other patient samples; other physiotherapy settings; wider range of therapists; other rehabilitations techniques and other populations. Also, a new bigger sample is needed for this analysis. Due to COVID-19 restrictions unfortunately, this sample cannot be gathered.

            "text": "Many treatments have been investigated to treat people with sciatica, but none have proven statistically or clinically significant. 42 An explanation for this unsuccessful treatment may be related to the inability to differentiate the problem clinically, which in turn contributes to the lack of classification of these patients into subgroups according to their clinical characteristics. Individual remarkable efforts highlight the necessity of this issue and offer the first relevant information limited to a specific health system and population. 34 The categorisation of Stynes et al 34 was limited to the English public health system and in particular to the primary healthcare setting. This study will be the first in Greece, and aims to categorise patients with sciatica in terms of early clinical outcome based on their initial clinical characteristics in the Greek health system. Data analysis and expert opinion from the field will be taken into consideration for potential classification of patients as low/high or low/medium/ high-risk probability to have a successful outcome with physiotherapy. As a limitation of this study is that the outcome will be dichotomised and that maybe will lead to loss of information and risk of misclassification. Data will be collected from multiple physiotherapy clinics across Greece. The main researcher of this study will be responsible for data collection in all sites and to gain reliability of all the PBOs maybe there is a bias in performing them. For that reason, this is a limitation of this study. Another limitation is that due to COVID-19 restrictions during the planned period of the study, this may create difficulties for gathering a larger sample. Despite these accepted limitations, this study will enable important insights into this important subject. Procedures are already in place to enable data collection through physiotherapy clinics.",

That will happen through classification of these patients based on their clinical characteristics and will enable initial decision making in primary care of the Greek health system. The predictive model that will be developed will be fully adapted to the Greek reality and will lead to the selection of the most useful predictors for improving the clinical effectiveness of daily specialised physiotherapeutic practice in patients with sciatica. Future implementation of the prediction model will enable patients' classification based on their clinical characteristics that may predict the outcome of the patients after physiotherapy treatment. The clinical application of the prediction model will be easy to use, fast and will provide a sufficient way of assessing this population. It will also promote communication between health professionals (especially doctors and physiotherapists) managing populations with sciatica.",
