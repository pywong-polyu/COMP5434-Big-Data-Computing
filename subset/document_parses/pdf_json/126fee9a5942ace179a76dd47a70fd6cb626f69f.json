Here, we show that these conclusions are unsupported and that policies therefore should not be based on these studies.",

Efforts to elucidate the impact of interventions through computational modelling have been made [2] [3] [4] . Still the actual effects of these interventions are hard to differentiate from each other, as many interventions were introduced almost simultaneously. This communication focuses mainly on the deficiencies with a recent Bayesian model used to estimate the effect of five different interventions across 11 European countries 2 . Still, it is also relevant for other modelling attempts, including our own, where we try to use mobility in various sectors of society to estimate their effects 5 .",

From the estimated R 0 , the number of daily cases is predicted, which then through an infection-to-death distribution, is used to infer the number of daily deaths. The model fits the number of daily deaths to the observed number of deaths 8 using a Bayesian posterior distribution. The paper reports that current interventions have been sufficient to drive R 0 below 1 (which is necessary for the number of infected people to decrease) for all 11 European considered countries. They \"show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown, in particular, have had a large effect on reducing transmission\" . The authors conclude that lockdown accounts for 81% [75% -87%] of the reduction in R 0 , i.e. that all other interventions only have minimal effects on the decline of R 0 .",

To solve this problem, as compared with the authors' earlier work 9 , which showed a significantly higher R 0 for Sweden, they invoke a country-specific last intervention parameter, which is only implemented for Sweden 10 (see equation i ). The \"last intervention\" parameter is multiplied with R 0 , and can therefore be seen as a parameter adjusting the model for Sweden independently. As can be seen, when analysing the posterior distributions of the intervention parameters, the \"last intervention\" parameter for Sweden results in 73.5 % of Sweden's reduction in R 0 ( Figure 1 ). The last intervention impact on R 0 is not reported or discussed in the Nature publication, possibly misleading decision-makers on the importance of lockdowns. where I m, 1-7 states if country m has introduced the following interventions, on the given day, (1) closing of schools and universities, (2) Self-isolating if ill, (3) banning of public events, (4) the first intervention introduced, (5) lockdown, (6) social distancing encouraged and (7) last intervention. The additional country-specific parameters added for the lockdown (here referred to as \"extra lockdown\") and last intervention are sampled from the following distributions:",

Given the importance the initial report had on government policies and the fact that we show here that the conclusions made about the significance of the lockdown are not entirely correct, we do think that we should pinpoint this to readers and policymakers. Correct assumptions on the effects of NPIs are becoming even more urgent as many nations still are imposing different NPIs, and that these might go on for an extended period ( https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249 , last accessed 20200811).",
