The subjects were practically healthy and had no chronic and/or recurrent diseases. Blood was taken on an empty stomach in the morning from 8:00 to 10:00 AM. All studies were performed with informed consent and carried out in compliance with the ethical standards set forth in the Helsinki Declaration and European Community Directives (8/609ES).

In the peripheral blood, a leukogram was determined on an XS-1000i hematology analyzer (Sysmex, Japan). In blood smears stained according to Romanovsky-Giemsa, a lymphocytogram was counted (according to the method of IA Kassirsky, 1970), 20 and a monocytogram (according to the method of ON Grigorova, 1956). 21 By ELISA, serum nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) (Cusabio), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (eBioscience), and sL-selectin (eBioscience) were determined on Multiscan MS. Using ELISA, lymphocyte lysate was used to determine NFATc1 (Cusabio) on Multiscan MS. The research results were processed using the software package Statistica 6 .

Thus, three comparison groups were distinguished ( Table 1) . As can be seen from the data presented, lymphopenia in healthy people is associated with a decrease in the content of monocytes. This decrease occurs due to functionally active mature cells, while the concentrations of promonocytes and polymorphonuclear cells do not change. It is likely that such a decrease in peripheral blood monocytes is associated with the need to increase the activity of tissue monocytes and increase their migration. In people with normal lymphocyte counts, as well as in individuals with lymphocytosis, the levels of monocytes in the peripheral blood do not actually differ and monocytosis is detected in 46.8% and 50.2%, respectively.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 364, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| RESULTS AND DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Lymphopenia is combined with a lower neutrophil content, which is ensured by a reduction in the circulation of mature segmented cells, while the levels of stab forms are not significantly different (Table 1 ). Against the background of an increase in the level of neutrophilic granulocytes, the concentration of G-CSF in the peripheral blood is reduced by a factor of 2.8 ( Table 2) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 206, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 374, "end": 382, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| RESULTS AND DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The concentration of mature neutrophils at the periphery and the level of G-CSF is regulated by the feedback principle; an increase in the content of neutrophils at the periphery leads to accelerated decay of G-CSF and, accordingly, a decrease in its concentration. G-CSF effectively stimulates colony formation from a more mature population of neutrophil precursor cells in the bone marrow. It is possible that the role of G-CSF in the formation of lymphocytosis is not limited to the action of this growth factor on neutrophils. The function of G-CSF in peripheral blood is not completely determined, although it is known that virtually any cell in the body is capable of synthesizing this growth factor; the largest number of G-CSF receptors is found in mature neutrophils and their number increases with the level of cell maturation. 22 The effect on various types of cells is also mixed. In neutrophils, G-CSF does not cause a significant change in the intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ or pH, 23 while, when acting on endothelial cells, it is able to dramatically increase intracellular pH and activate Na + / H + metabolism. 24 The decrease in lymphocyte count is associated with the accumulation of NFATc1 in serum. The appearance of this nuclear activation factor outside of the cell is probably a consequence of the activation of lymphocyte apoptosis, which is confirmed by a higher content of cells with the CD95 marker for lymphopenia (0.53 \u00b1 0.05 \u00d7 10 9 cl/L) compared with the state of lymphocytosis (0.45 \u00b1 0.04 \u00d7 10 9 cl/L) ( Table 3 ). In parallel with the increase in lymphocyte count, the accumulation of intracellular NFATc1 is recorded, which indicates the inclusion of intracellular activation mechanisms. Proteins of the NFAT family affect lymphocyte activation processes, regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as cytokine expression. 25 NFATc1 controls the expression of transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 4, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 regulating glycolysis, and mitochondrial respiration in T cells. In this way, NFATc1 can control the differentiation of T cells through their metabolic reprogramming. [26] [27] [28] This is consistent with our earlier data showing that the ATP level decreases with an increase in the content of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (2.38 \u00b1 0.44 \u03bcmol/ million.cL with lymphopenia and 0.58 \u00b1 0.81 \u03bcmol/million.cL with lymphocytosis; \u0420 < .001). 29 This is probably due to its increased consumption in the process of the activation and differentiation of cells with the participation of NFATc1. On the other hand, as a result of prolonged chronic stimulation, the accumulation of NFATc1 in the cell can lead to the formation of anergic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. [30] [31] [32] A change in the level of the content of adhesive molecules can affect the content of cells in the circulation. Therefore, at low concentrations of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, higher concentrations of sL-selectin are detected (Table 4 ). Elevated levels of sL-selectin are recorded in various pathologies (ulcerative colitis, insulindependent diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, etc). The effect of sL-selectin is to activate and attract white blood cells to the site of inflammation, while acting as an intercellular signaling molecule, sL-selectin activates other adhesion molecules-integrins, peptides of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Thus, registered lymphopenia may be the result of an increase in the activity of adhesive molecules, in particular sL-selectin, which triggers the activation mechanism of leukocyte adhesion and their advancement in tissue.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 838, "end": 840, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1004, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1137, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1877, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2160, "end": 2164, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2165, "end": 2169, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2174, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2434, "end": 2436, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2751, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2752, "end": 2756, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2757, "end": 2761, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1545, "end": 1552, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2996, "end": 3004, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| RESULTS AND DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "with a decrease in the number of mature monocytes and neutrophils in the peripheral blood.
