            "text": "Despite efforts to better understand the disease behavior, there are still unknown societal and economic costs. Disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) are a metric quantifying and combining premature death and disability resulting from the disease to estimate its impact on the population (24) . DALYs represent a tool to determine both the burden of disease and the intervention effects such as mass vaccination. Estimates of DALYs from Italy, Korea, and Japan have been released. However, those for Latin America, and specifically for Mexico (24) (25) (26) , are missing. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the DALYs due to COVID-19 in Mexico.",

For death, the period from the onset of symptoms to death date was counted as the time of disability, regardless of health care received (ambulatory or inpatient). The dataset does not include information on the disease remission date or discharge date for those alive. However, the average time from the onset of symptoms to seeking medical attention is reported. Based on this information, the time between seeking care and discharge was estimated by a linear extrapolation, assuming that the disease had the same time course in dead and surviving patients. Finally, a ponderation by type of health care received (outpatient or hospitalization) was conducted. This estimation was done as follows: Although long-term effects of COVID-19 have been described (37, 38) , the dataset does not include data on post-COVID-19 signs and symptoms. Therefore, disability time was counted as the period of limitation and not that for sequels. A disability weight of one during the disease period was assumed. No reference reports this weight, so we took into account some elements to support this decision. First, for patients who needed to be hospitalized, who needed mechanical ventilation machine, and who were entered to ICU, we considered that the weight is very close to the unit due to the severity of the disease. For the outpatient cases, regardless of whether they were suspected or confirmed cases, the majority have to be in quarantine or total isolation, and as a result, the period of disability corresponds to those days in quarantine. Additionally, it was considered that those individuals who survived recovered their full health when the quarantine period ends.",

This disagreement can be explained by the lack of information about the disability caused by the COVID-19. In this respect, it should be considered that some sequelae of the disease could appear long after having suffered it and for a prolonged period; consequently, we need to have more accurate data in this regard.

For example, it is well-known that the chronological age is not the condition that increases the risk of severe disease and death but the multimorbidity and frailty associated with a person. Thus, prioritizing vaccination in this group (46) could reduce the burden of COVID-19 and the high costs of its care.",

The global production of medicines has been affected by social distancing and quarantines, decreasing medical treatments supply worldwide. Consequently, changes in the trend of the burden of other diseases will be observed in the following months, when complications from neglected diseases, including disability and death, appear more evident. As a reflective exercise, we consider that the burden of the disease can also measure the effectiveness of public health policies and commitment of society to them. Up to this point in the pandemic, it is possible to say that there have been some contradictions in the official discourse of political and health leaders. The social commitment to adherence of basic norms of social distancing and hygiene and the use of face masks have not been as strong as desired, likely because of the lack of clear messages from policymakers. This lack of adherence has significantly determined the continuity in the virus transmission rate and the incidence of severe cases and mortality. Notwithstanding, as stated by the United Nations, the virus does not discriminate; but its impacts do (47) . In this sense, it is necessary to reconsider that, in low and mideconomic counties, the effect of a total restriction in mobility also implies inequalities in access to resources, healthcare, education, social protection, and an exacerbation of discrimination, gender inequality, xenophobia, and domestic violence (48) . Therefore, the pandemic response must come from different sectors so that the vaccination campaigns allow the transmission of the virus to cease to decrease the impact of YLDs and YLLs.",

That is why we decided to approach the phenomenon of disability through a coefficient of 1. Nevertheless, we suggest carefully analyzing the results on YLDs and consider that probabilities can change depending on other factors. For example, a coefficient <1 can be observed in those positive cases that, despite being in quarantine, carry out activities close to normal at home. Another consideration would be mild cases of illness that did not contact health providers and continued their normal activities outside the home, and asymptomatic cases that would not have sequelae. Despite these limitations, our results advanced in the phenomenon of disability secondary to COVID-19 and could give birth to new estimation strategies.",
