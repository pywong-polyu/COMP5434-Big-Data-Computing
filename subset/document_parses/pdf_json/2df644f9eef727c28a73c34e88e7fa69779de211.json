The quality of different methods developed to solve these problems on classical computers have been collected and compared in various benchmark repositories. Recently, quantum annealing has appeared as promising approach to solve some scheduling problems. The goal of this paper is to check experimentally if and how this approach can be applied for solving a wellknown benchmark of the classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem. We present the existing capabilities provided by the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing system in the light of this benchmark. We have tested the quantum annealing system features experimentally, and proposed a new heuristic method as a proof-of-concept. In our approach we decompose the considered scheduling problem into a set of smaller optimization problems which fit better into a limited quantum hardware capacity. We have tuned experimentally various parameters of limited fullyconnected graphs of qubits available in the quantum annealing system for the heuristic. We also indicate how new improvements in the upcoming D-Wave quantum processor might potentially impact the performance of our approach.",

Moreover, quantum computers are starting to approach the limit of classical simulation, and consequently entering an era of unprecedented ways to explore quantum algorithms [1] . There are many ongoing efforts to run new experiments and benchmarks with quantum computing to discover new applications and solve real-world problems. Many researchers have been trying to find efficient ways of approaching NP-hard scheduling problems over the last decades. A comprehensive study to the theory and applications of scheduling in advanced planning and computer systems as well as various practical industrial, real-time engineering, management science, business administration and information systems use cases were presented in [3] . Recently, there has been much interest in the possibility of using quantum annealing, which is a derivative of adiabatic quantum optimization, e.g. in [4, 5, 7, 9] . In general, the main assumption in adiabatic quantum optimization is that there is a quantum Hamiltonian H P whose ground state encodes the solution to a considered problem, and another Hamiltonian H 0 , whose ground state is easy-to-implement. We first prepare a quantum system to be in the ground state of a known H 0 , and then adiabatically change the Hamiltonian for a time T by the following formula:",

In this paper, however, we have limited our experiments to solve only a certain class of scheduling problems. We wanted to validate experimentally a new quantum annealing heuristic applied for solving a well-known benchmark of the classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). In terms of computational complexity, the JSSP is NP-hard in the strong sense [2] . Consequently, in practice optimal solutions can not be found within a reasonable time. Thus, several polynomial-time heuristics have been developed for finding suboptimal solutions and tested experimentally [16] . Various heuristics have been proposed based on traditional models of computing to find the bestknown solutions for JSSP benchmark instances. According to the recent comprehensive literature study in [10] , half of them have been based on tabu search algorithms, followed by local search, shifting bottleneck, and branch and bound, and also simulated annealing techniques. The simulated annealing metaheuristic is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function, successfully applied for solving various scheduling problems, including the JSSP [12] and the MRCPSP (Multi-mode Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem) [13] . In principle, the classical simulated annealing metaheuristic has much in common with a physical process of heating a material and then slowly lowering the temperature to decrease defects, thus minimizing the system energy. There is also a mathematical analogy to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics adopted in quantum annealing processes implemented in the existing quantum hardware.",

However, it can be easily transformed into a decision problem, which is limited to decide whether there exists a feasible solution (schedule) with a makespan smaller than or equal to a given time. The JSSP can be easily mapped to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), and the existence of a solution to a CSP can be viewed as a decision problem. The decision version of the JSSP, together with its formulation suitable for a quantum annealing solver was presented in detail in [14] . The obtained results have encouraged us to perform further empirical investigations. We have followed the proposed time-indexed decision version of the JSSP to implement basic steps in our quantum annealing heuristic. However, we have added new conditions and extensions to be able to potentially apply it for practical use. Among many existing JSSP test instances we have decided to focus on the first benchmark set proposed in [15] to analyse various capabilities and properties supported by the D-Wave 2000Q quantum chip. In our preliminary studies, as a proof-of-concept, we have selected a small JSSP test instance denoted as ft06 (6 jobs and 6 machines), but large enough to investigate several schedule variables and properties relevant in a quantum annealing process aiming at the next generation of D-Wave QPU [17] .",

From the QUBO problem formulation perspective, it is essential to note that the QPU is a hardware implementation of an undirected graph with qubits as vertices and couplers as edges among them. For instance, in the D-Wave 2000Q QPU there are 2048 qubits logically mapped into a 16 \u00d7 16 matrix of unit cells of eight qubits. Each qubit is connected to at most six other qubits. The D-Wave 2000Q has been designed to solve QUBO problems, where each qubit represents a variable, and couplers between qubits represent the cost associated with qubit pairs. The limited qubits connectivity in the D-Wave 2000Q QPU is a fundamental quantum hardware property which affected the quality of obtained results and in various experiments reduced scheduling problem instances solved by quantum annealing based heuristic methods. However, according to recent publicly available technical specifications, the limited qubits connectivity will be significantly improved in the upcoming D-Wave Pegasus QPU. Therefore, while designing our new heuristic quantum annealing heuristic we have taken this upcoming feature into account.",

However, the next challenge in our experimental studies was the embedding procedure of QUBO structures onto the quantum hardware with limited fully-connected graphs of qubits. The graph configuration implemented in the existing D-Wave hardware is called a Chimera structure. In fact, the tested D-Wave 2000Q QPU is a lattice of interconnected qubits. While some qubits connect to others via couplers, the D-Wave QPU is not fully connected, and qubits are arranged in sparsely connected groups of at most six other qubits. Currently, D-Wave provides a set of automated programming tools and APIs to find and perform an embedding automatically. Nevertheless, many quits must be chained together, so the chain is used as a single qubit. The chain strength value c must be set up carefully, as there is no methodology for choosing an optimal value [18] . To evaluate the embedding procedure we designed the following experiment: we randomly generated a set of schedules consisting of 4 jobs, each job consisted of 4 operations, and we assigned relatively short execution times to all operations, so the makespan was T \u2264 7, and we solved the JSSP problem 100 times. Note that long schedules impose a large number of variables for the JSSP time-indexed QUBO formulation, and then the embedding procedure. Thus, we used different values of the chain strength c to discover what is optimal for our problem, see Fig. 5 . Based on the obtained results, we were able to assign the strength value c = 3, but we observed a significant impact of its different values on the number of error solutions generated by the D-Wave quantum annealer. To quantify the quality of a generated solution, we simply counted the number of feasible schedules after the quantum optimization procedure.",

Naturally, we can reduce this value and try to squeeze more problem information onto the QPU, but consequently it will also reduce the accuracy of results. In our case, the biggest constraint is a number of possible variables within a processing window. Therefore, by decreasing the minimum classical gap = 1.0 we had an opportunity to increase the processing window to 6 time-units, and further decreasing of the minimum classical gap = 0.5 value increased the processing window to 7 time-units. However, minimum classical gap values below 2.0 gave more and more unacceptable solutions and had a negative impact onto the overall quality of obtained solutions.",

            "text": "The existing Chimera D-Wave QPU architecture and available APIs give developers a lot of flexibility to implement and improve strategies by increasing the gap between ground and excited states during the quantum annealing process. A set of interesting error suppression techniques using quantum annealing correction with auxiliary qubits and the energy gap were discussed for instance in [11] . Technically speaking, the D-Wave QPU minimizes the energy of an Ising spin configuration whose pairwise interactions lie on the edges of the Chimera graph. To automatically minor-embed our problem into a structured sampler we used the EmbeddingComposite method. However, there are other dimod composites with various parameters during pre-and post-processing phases worth considering in our future work. One should note, that the range of coupling strengths available in the D-Wave QPU is finite, so chaining is typically accomplished by setting the coupling strength to the largest allowed negative value and scaling down the input couplings relative to that. Thus, we have also checked various values of the another controlling extended j range parameter to increase the strength of minor embedding coupling. Typically, using the available larger negative values of J increases the dynamic J range. According to technical specifications of the existing D-Wave 2000Q QPU, strong negative couplings can bias a chain and therefore flux-bias offsets must be applied to recalibrate it to compensate for this effect. However, we have not noticed a significant impact on the quality of obtained solutions by changing the extended j range parameter. Nevertheless, we argue that additional tests and techniques will be required, in particular the spin-reversal transform can improve results by reducing the impact of possible analog and systematic errors. We plan to compare all the presented controlling parameters on the new Pegasus QPU architecture and explore more precisely the JSSP problem structure and solution space. We will apply new techniques for encoding discrete variables into Ising model qubits, e.g. [6] , and try to take advantage of new and more connected Pegasus QPU graph for more efficient embedding of the considered problem. Finally, our hybrid heuristic method improved the quality of solutions by reducing the makespan of randomly generated schedules down to 60, see Fig. 6 . Nevertheless, it is clear that even simple classical heuristics proposed for the JSSP outperform our quantum annealing-based approach reaching a set of many schedules with optimal makespan 55. We expect to use a much bigger processing windows in our heuristic tailored for the upcoming D-Wave Pegasus QPU architecture. The Pegasus graph will allow each qubit to couple to 15 other qubits instead of 6 qubits, so we expect to run the same heuristic successfully for bigger JSSP instances. Our proof-of-concept implementation, including the heuristic source code, has been published in the GitHub repository for reusing and external testing [19] .",
