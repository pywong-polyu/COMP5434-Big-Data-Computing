The thematic range that addresses it, as well as the different methodologies used, are of a very different nature-physical, psychological, technical, tactical-enriching every day the knowledge, and understanding of the game itself. The objective of this study has been to identify the differences between the different styles of play that lead to becoming the champion of the UEFA Champions League in the last 3 years of the pre-COVID stage, by analyzing the spatial performance developed, the association between the players that make up the different lines of the game system and the analysis of the various technical actions that are developed to carry out the offensive phase of each team. For this, the Observational Methodology and two types of analysis have been used: quantitative, by calculating X 2 , and qualitative, by applying the Polar Coordinates technique. The results obtained show the relationship that is established between the different lines that make up the offensive systems of the champion teams of this competition, as well as the relationship of significance that is established between the use of space-width and depth-and the technical means used to achieve success, the goal.",

Specifically, the study by Yi et al. (2018) , analyzed the technical differences between the different players, finding that the greatest differences were found between defenders and attackers. Specifically, the former achieved better performance in variables related to the pass, and the latter in variables related to the goal and offensive organization. On the other hand, Garc\u00eda-Rubio et al. (2015) , analyzed the UEFA Champions League competitions between the years 2009 to 2013, they found significant differences in the place of the match, the effect of the first goal and the quality of the rival in this competition, depending on the stage in which it is (group stage or elimination). Along the same lines, the study Yi et al. (2020) , also analyze the technical differences depending on the phase in which the teams are, also concluding that the situational variables such as quality of the team and the opponent and the result of the match show variations depending on the technical performance of the players. Likewise, Almeida et al. (2014) , also analyze these situational variables and their relationship with the ball's recovery in 28 UFL games. In their work, they conclude that local and unsuccessful teams defend in more advanced areas of the field, and that the defensive strategies of the best teams involve more intense, organized collective processes that are further from the goal itself.",

(2017) , through the use of social networks, analyze 12 matches of the UFC 2015/2016, and observe a negative relationship between the density and the success of offensive action. The reduced density was associated with a greater number of offensive actions, although these have not been successful. Finally, the work of Yi et al.

This analysis was carried out both prospectively (+1 to +5) and retrospectively (\u22121 to \u22125), obtaining as a result a vector for each behavior related to the focal behavior, with a specific angle and radius. Considering the angle obtained from the analysis, the vector occupies one of the four sectors or quadrants that make up the graphical representation of the Polar Coordinate. For the representation of the vector map, the R program has been used (Rodr\u00edguez-Medina et al., 2019) .",

These results show a highly developed use of the amplitude, causing the rival team to perform complete defensive swings (from one side of the field to the other) trying to cause defensive imbalances and taking advantage of favorable numerical-spatial situations. Likewise, it is appreciated how the change of orientation stands as an essential tool to carry out this spatial and numerical use, using this resource in more than 27% of offensive actions, that is, 1 in 4, an aspect that ratifies the Garganta's theory (1997) and the use of Orientation Changes as a strategic resource to avoid defensive density in the central areas of the field and in the side lanes where the ball is located.",

These results are not in line with those obtained by Franks (2005) and Lago et al. (2012) , although there is a manifest trend toward a high intervention of players (6-8) to reach the shot and send the ball to finishing situations, this type of density-high densityis reflected in the second highest percentages of the first two finals (16-17 and 17-18) , not being the case in the final of the 2018-2019 season. The results are in line with those of Tenga et al. (2010) and Maneiro et al. (2019) . These results could be explained by the style of play of the finalist teams in terms of the elaboration of the plays (Hewitt et al., 2016) , with fast attacks or counterattacks being the ones that occur the most in the three seasons, but in the first two, it alternates with densities that show a more complex development and elaboration of the play, where teams try to play with time and space, and try to overcome a positioned and organized defense. While in the case of the 2018-2019 season, the highest percentages of density of the champion team respond to a game model closely related to the counterattack, reaching, between the Low and Very Low density levels, a percentage close to 70% of the offensive actions. If we identify the teams studied, Real Madrid (champion in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons) and Liverpool (champion in the 2018-2019 season), the data corroborate the premise accepted and established by Lago-Pe\u00f1as and Dellal (2010) which states that successful Spanish teams are the ones with the highest associative percentage, unlike teams of other nationalities (Bradley et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "When performing the same analysis in the 2017-2018 season, we can see that there is no significant relationship between any of the lines established as focal behavior and the rest of the lines as mating behaviors. These results, which at first glance can be misleading, are clarified by the previous statistical analysis. This is because significant results are not appreciated, not because of the lack of relationship between the lines, but because of the variability that is established between them, the permeability and the high degree of connection between the players of the champion team is so high that the relationship between all the lines is similar and consequently there are no significant results. This shows the great capacity for association and the versatility and reading of the players during the development of the game, appearing and participating in the offensive action in areas that, due to their demarcation with stereotyped and pre-established functions, do not correspond which makes the relationship between the players of the different lines constant. Despite this, a relationship of mutual activation-quadrant I-is appreciated, by taking as focal behavior the front line-DEL-and establishing the rest of the lines as conditioned, also compared to itself. This indicates that, although there is great participation by all the players that make up the team in the development of the offensive action, when the ball reaches the front line, they end the action either individually, in which the player receives and ends himself, or by interacting with a partner on the same line, but not with colleagues from farther lines. These data are consistent with what was presented in the previous analysis when studying the density of players, as well as the spatial use of the offensive game by this season's champion, Real Madrid CF. Finally, when analyzing the different lines and their interrelation, in reference to the 2018-2019 season, establishing the demarcation of the goalkeeper-PORT-as focal behavior, there are reciprocal activation relationships with the category JR-Rival Player-in the quadrant I. This shows how the Liverpool goalkeeper chooses in his interventions to move the ball away from his goal, generating divided balls, and creating duels where the dispute of the same and the intervention of the rival player occurs more frequently, as it is not an action where the control of the ball is maintained.",

This is indicated by the scarce elaboration of the actions and the underdeveloped game by Liverpool in this final, where the defenders relate to each other, without evaluating the possibility of combining with the other lines of the team to develop their offensive action. The same occurs when taking as focal behavior the front line-DEL-and the rest of the lines as conditioned behaviors, where a behavior of mutual excitement with itself is appreciated, this again indicates that when the front line intervenes, they only relate with themselves and not with the different lines of the team. In this sense, if we relate these results with the previous ones presented in the quantitative analysis, we see that when studying both from the global perspective, a direct game and against it is manifested, where the player belonging to the indicated line takes the ball and is that same player or another on his line who ends the offensive action.",

On the other hand, in the last season a much less elaborate and direct style of play is seen, where the depth of the game is very present but the use of the amplitude is not very high, starting and ending the plays in the same lane, an aspect that influences the lack of presence of orientation changes, and developing low or very low levels of processing, where the type of contact that occurs the most is in the C1, a single touch. These marked characteristics respond to the archetype of English football, an aspect that fits in with the champion team of that edition, Liverpool CF.",
