Here, we examined the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in the human respiratory epithelium in the presence or absence of rhinovirus. We show that human rhinovirus triggers an interferon response that blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication. Mathematical simulations show that this virus-virus interaction is likely to have a population-wide effect as an increasing prevalence of rhinovirus will reduce the number of new COVID-19 cases.",

Here, we examined the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of HRV in the human respiratory epithelium. HRV was selected due to i) its high prevalence in the human population [7] ; ii) its negative interaction with IAV at the host and population level [3, 4] ; iii) its ability to induce a strong IFN response [4] ; and iv) the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN [8] .

In contrast, HRV titers displayed the same kinetics in single and coinfections: they increased rapidly during the first 24 hours, followed by a gradual and sustained decline ( Figure 1B) . As simultaneous coinfections might not occur frequently during natural infection, we performed staggered coinfections of ALIcultures of HBECs as follows: cells were infected with HRV, and 24 hours later they were infected with SARS-CoV-2. This experiment was also repeated in the reverse order (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 first, followed by HRV). As observed in simultaneous coinfections, SARS-CoV-2 growth was severely impaired in both staggered coinfections: when SARS-CoV-2 inoculation was followed by HRV infection (p= 0.0260) SARS-CoV-2 replication increased between 24 and 48 hpi as seen in SARS-CoV-2 single infection, but a subsequent sharp decrease was observed between 48 and 96 hpi (Fig, 1C) . When HRV inoculation was followed by SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 replication did not exceed the inoculum titer and viral titers quickly declined (p= 0.0063) ( Figure 1D ). In contrast, the growth of HRV was unaffected by SARS-CoV-2 (p= 0.2027) regardless of the sequence order of infections ( Figure 1C and 1D) . When SARS-CoV-2 was inoculated first, the growth curve of HRV shifted and peaked at 72 hpi ( Figure 1C ), reflecting the delay in HRV inoculation. We tested if the observed reduction of SARS-CoV-2 titers was due to a block in virus entry due to HRV-A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 induced downregulation of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2 [15] . To this end, we used immunohistochemistry to detect ACE2 in HRV or SARS-CoV-2 single infected and coinfected epithelial cells. We observed high levels of ACE2 expression on the apical surface of the epithelium regardless of the infection status of the cells ( Figure S1 ) suggesting that HRV blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection via mechanisms that are independent of virus entry.",

As HRV induces an interferon-mediated innate immune response that blocks IAV in ALI-cultures [4] we hypothesized that the observed block in SARS-CoV-2 replication was due to an HRV-triggered IFN response. To test this, we used fluorescence microscopy to examine the IFN-mediated innate immune activation induced by each virus. Specifically, we compared the in situ expression of MxA, a protein encoded by an IFN-stimulated gene that is highly upregulated upon IFN production [11] . Figure 4A ). This confirms that the observed block in SARS-CoV-2 replication in coinfections with HRV was the result of negative interactions driven by the innate immune response induced by HRV. Interestingly, HRV replication was also increased in the presence of BX795 and titers plateau between 48 and 96 hpi, rather than declining as observed in the DMSO control coinfection and HRV single infection (Fig 4B) . This indicates that virus-induced innate immune signaling also hampers HRV replication in HBECs.",

We performed mathematical simulations using the moment generating function equation [16] to derive the change in the growth rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections as a result from having a fraction of the population refractory to COVID-19 due to an episode of HRV infection (Data analysis S1 in Supplementary Material). Our results show that the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections decreases as the number of HRV infections increase, and this reduction increases with higher HRV prevalences and longer duration of the interference effect ( Figure   5 ).

Our study shows that HRV exerts an indirect negative interaction, with a dominant inhibitory phenotype against SARS-CoV-2.

The susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to the IFN response is illustrated by the number of genes present in its genome that are devoted to overcome the innate immune response (reviewed in [18] ). We also showed that HRV hampers SARS-CoV-2 replication even when the former was inoculated 24 hours after SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results demonstrate that viral interference interactions induced by HRV infection can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in the respiratory epithelium and builds on previous epidemiological, modelling, and experimental work on virus-virus interactions [3] [4] [5] 19] . Future studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of viral interference could enable us to wield virus-virus interactions to our advantage and use them as control strategies or therapeutic measures. For example, screening for HRV-induced genes with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity might constitute a future research avenue to develop antiviral therapies against coronaviruses.",

HBEC cultures were infected at \u2265 35 days post ALI initiation. The apical surface of the cultures was washed twice with serum free DMEM before infection (24 hours prior to infection and immediately before infection). Cells were inoculated with 10 4 PFU of either SARS-CoV-2 or HRV-A16, or a mixture containing 10 4 PFU of each virus and incubated at 37 o C for 120 minutes. Previous experiments showed that inoculation of ALI cultures with 10,000 plaque forming units (PFU) resulted in consistent replication of HRV and SARS-CoV-2 [9]. The inoculum was removed, and cultures were washed once. This wash was titrated by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay and served as the 0hour time point for growth curves. Cells were incubated at 37 o C with 5% CO 2 . At each time point, serum free DMEM was added apically to each culture and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 o C. This was removed, aliquoted and stored at -80 o C prior to subsequent titration. Each infection was carried out in two independent experiments and each experiment consisted of at least three technical replicates. Titrations of SARS-CoV-2 and HRV-A16 were performed on Vero E6 6F5 and HeLa OH cells, respectively. Virus samples were titrated in ten-fold serial dilutions in DMEM with 2% FBS and 1% NEAA on confluent monolayers of cells. Each sample was titrated in triplicate. SARS-CoV-2 TCID 50 plates were incubated at 37 o C and HRV-A16 plates were incubated at 33 o C. Plates were incubated for approximately 72 hours and fixed in 8% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Cytopathic effect was recorded, and a TCID50/ml titre determined as calculated by the Spearman andK\u00e4rber algorithm[10]. For BX795 experiments, ALI cultures were transferred to in 8% formaldehyde for 16-24 hours, HBEC cultures were processed overnight for paraffin-embedding, sectioned to 2-3 \u00b5m-thick sections and mounted on glass slides.Two sections for each condition were sectioned and processed using pH 8 EDTA antigen retrieval and permeabilized with 1% triton. DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# P36392) was included in the mounting medium, and slides were stained with primary sheep anti-N (nucleocapsid) IgG antibody (DA114, mrcppu-covid.bio, 1: 1000 dilution), primary mouse anti-MxA antibody[11], primary mouse anti-VP2 antibody (QED Bioscience Ltd. -18758), or a primary rabbit-anti-hACE2 (Cell Signalling Technology) antibody. For immunofluorescence, primary antibodies were detected using an AlexaFluor 555-conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody (A11015, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:1000 dilution) and an AlexaFluor 488",

To assess the impact of coinfections on the replication kinetics of each virus, HRV and SARS-CoV-2 titers were determined at different times post infection from apical washes of coinfected cells and compared to their respective titers from single virus infections. SARS-CoV-2 exhibited highly contrasting replication kinetics in single and coinfections (p= 0.03928, Figure 1A). SARS-CoV-2 titers increased slowly from 24 hours post-infection (hpi) onwards and up to 96 hpi in single infections, whereas in coinfections with HRV, SARS-CoV-2 titers decreased rapidly",

Coinfected cultures exhibited high levels of MxA expression, similar to those exhibited in single infections with HRV (Figure 2). We further performed immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid (N) of SARS-CoV-2 and observed that N expression is clearly detected mainly on the apical area of epithelial cells subject to single SARS-CoV-2 infection, but undetectable in co-infected cells (Figure 3). Overall, our combined experiments confirmed i) that SARS-CoV-2 replication within the ALI-cultures ofHBECs does not progress in the presence of HRV and ii) that HRV triggers a faster and likely stronger IFN response compared to SARS-CoV-2. We therefore hypothesized that the block observed in SARS-CoV-2 replication was due to an innate immune response triggered by HRV. To test this, we performed HRV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfections in the presence of BX795, an inhibitor of TANK-binding kinase 1 that has been shown to block the IFNmediated innate immune response in differentiated cultures of respiratory epithelium[4]. In the presence of BX795, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in the respiratory epithelium is",

These findings have important implications, as they suggest that immune-mediated effects induced by mild,common cold virus infections, including HRV, might confer some level of protection against SARS-CoV-2, potentially attenuating the severity of COVID-19. Given the high transmissibility and prevalence of HRV, this effect might have an impact on the disease burden caused by COVID-19 at the population scale, with expected heterogeneities depending on HRV prevalence among different age groups. For example, this interference effect can contribute to differences in SARS-CoV-2 transmission between school-aged children (with high prevalence of HRV) and adult populations (with comparatively lower HRV prevalence). Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens that can only infect a restricted number of cell types within the body (a property known as tropism). Virus-virus interactions are likely to occur not only in the respiratory tract but also in other tissues that support multi-virus environments, such as the gastrointestinal tract, where enteric infections are modulated by",

Cells were maintained and seeded on transwells (Cell culture inserts, Falcon\u00aeCat. No.: 734-0036) using Epithelix hAEC media (Epithelix, EP09AM) and incubated at 37oC with 5% CO2. An air-liquid interface (ALI) was initiated once they reached confluency, when the maintenance media was switched to Pneumacult TM -ALI media (Cat. No.: 05001, STEMCELL Technologies). Vero E6 F5 cells were subcloned from Vero E6 cells, which were a gift from Prof. Michele Bouloy. A bulk population of VeroE6 cells was diluted in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum to 1 cell per 100 ul and plated into a 96 well format and incubated at 37C in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator. Wells were assessed for cell number with 0 and 3 cells/well observed. Once the population had expanded, each clonal population was further seeded into a single well in a 96 well-plate. The next day, the plate was infected with 8400 pfu/well of SARS-CoV2 and left for 72 hours. The plates were fixed in 8% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (0.1% [w/v] Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; 45% [v/v] methanol; 10% [v/v] glacial acetic acid) and",
