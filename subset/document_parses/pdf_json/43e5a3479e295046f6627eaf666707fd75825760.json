The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to contain its spread fundamentally transformed the day-to-day lives of most individuals and the workplace. This study examined the challenges experienced and adaptations employed by community-based organizations as they navigated shelter-in-place orders and other workplace and community restrictions. Between July and September of 2020, researchers completed 16 semi-structured interviews with agency administrators of community-based organizations serving at-risk youth or formerly incarcerated persons operating in a large Midwestern city. The findings highlight several challenges faced by agency administrators as they attempted to maintain services to their clients, including having to move from largely in-person service modalities to methods of contact and communication that embraced social distancing and virtual interaction. They also actively responded to the health safety needs of their staff, clients, and community by instituting new safety protocols, like staff and client COVID-19 testing, handing out personal protection equipment and supplies, and educating community members. The findings demonstrate a high degree of community mobilization and resilience in light of a global crisis.",

The novel coronavirus pandemic transformed the social landscape for criminal justice agencies, social service providers and the populations they serve. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States occurred in January 2020, and by mid-March most states and local jurisdictions began to issue \"shelter-in-place\" or \"stay-at-home\" orders that required most agencies to shutter in-person operations and work remotely. These \"shelter in place\" or \"stay-at-home\" orders generally extended through the end of May, and continued to some extent through early 2021, including continued restrictions on public and indoor gatherings.",

For example, following the shelter-in-place orders, Shayegh and Malpede (2020) documented a 43% decline in crime in San Francisco and 50% decline in Oakland. Furthermore, Pietrawska et al. (2020) identified a 35% decline in Chicago crime five weeks after the governor issued the orders. On the other hand, Ashby's (2020) research showed no consistent pattern of change during the pandemic. Changes in crime appeared to be random and dependent on the city or county under examination. Other research suggests that shelter in place orders did not influence Chicago homicides and may have actually contributed to a 15% increase in Philadelphia homicides (Philadelphia Police, 2020) .",

As of 2019, there were nearly 2.2 million people incarcerated in local jails and state and federal prisons in the United States (Carson, 2020; Zeng & Minton, 2021) . Mass incarceration because of decades-long policies that encouraged the use of jail and prison and instituted lengthy sentences meant that many correctional facilities were managing the spread of a highly infectious respiratory disease in historically overcrowded and sometimes aging facilities that are difficult to sanitize effectively (Franco-Paredes et al., 2020) . Moreover, many imprisoned individuals have chronic health conditions that increase the risk associated with COVID-19 infections and deaths, and many correctional facilities lack adequate health care service to address the needs of those who do get sick (Hawks et al., 2020) . As of June 2020, the infection rate for state and federal prisoners (3,251 per 100,000 prisoners) was 5.5 times that of the general population (587 per 100,000 population) (Saloner et al., 2020) .",

This may have inadvertently enabled the spread of COVID-19 into already vulnerable communities. One study examining arrests and releases in Cook County, IL found that individuals cycling in and out of the Cook County Jail, one of the largest jail facilities in the U.S., accounted for 15.9% of all COVID-19 cases in Chicago alone during the early months of the pandemic. Neighborhood arrest and jail release rates explained 55% of the variation in COVID-19 infections by zip code in Cook County even after controlling for other factors, such as poverty and population density, leading the study's authors to conclude that the historic overuse of arrest and incarceration in poor, minority communities makes these communities vulnerable to future pandemics (Reinhart & Chen, 2020) . In a study of urban areas in the U.S., Adhikari and colleagues (2020) found that counties with lower reported median income and high percentages of non-White residents, characteristics that are also associated with higher violent crime and incarceration rates, had COVID-19 infection rates that were 8 times higher and death rates that were 9 times greater than similarly situated majority White communities. African Americans had the highest rate of COVID-19-related deaths across age groups (Ford et al., 2020) , although Latinx populations and Native Americans also had considerable higher rates of mortality in comparison to Whites (Burki, 2021; Podewils et al., 2020) .",

Moreover, the pandemic required criminal justice agencies to shift operations in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Miller and Blumstein (2020) argue a national research agenda on the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on crime, victimization and the system's response is needed to fully appreciate its significance and to develop effective policies moving forward. This includes considering how social distancing and other mitigation strategies were associated with crime changes and whether and how returning to normal activities similarly effects crime rates. As part of this agenda, criminologist must also consider the role of community resiliency in mitigating the effect of large-scale events and the role of community-based agencies in public safety.",

In their conceptualization of community resilience, Norris et al. (2008) advanced four network adaptive capacities: information and communication, community competence, social capital, and economic development. Pfefferbaum and Klomp (2013) argue that community resilience emerges from collective efforts to join the goal of fostering a response for recovery. In working class communities, social capital mitigates the challenges of adverse circumstances and activates social networks.

In many urban neighborhoods, community-based agencies are the primary organizations that support violence prevention and intervention efforts and assist those returning from incarceration. The utilization of community-based agencies to achieve violence prevention and recidivism reduction goals is purposeful; it has long been realized that community-led programs experience greater acceptance within neighborhoods, particularly where residents are suspicious and less trusting of government-led efforts (Mercy et al., 1993) . The desire to include communities in the design and implementation of violence prevention and intervention programs and reentry support has resulted in significant funding aimed at capacity building, technical assistance, and community mobilization and empowerment to increase the number and diversity of evidence-based practices and programs within high crime communities (Vivolo et al., 2011) . Thus, it is important to document and understand how community-based agencies adapted to the pandemic given their relative importance not only in providing services to vulnerable populations (i.e., at-risk youth and previously incarcerated persons), but in overall community health. This study sought to document how community-based agencies responded to the everchanging environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For instance, testing procedures intended to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the shelters or temporary housing facilities sometimes meant emergency placement was sometimes unavailable, while social distancing requirements meant the agency served fewer people.

The most common strategy employed, something all but one agency mentioned, was shifting activities to online platforms, and more specifically to hosting events through video conferencing software. This meant securing software that would enable video conferencing, computer equipment for their staff, and tablets for their clients. Some were able to secure additional funding through donors to offset the costs associated with moving their work remotely. Others absorbed these additional costs or made due with existing resources. As one agency noted, \"In our communities, we lack internet and computers. Even if we wanted to meet with our youth, they do not have internet and computers. We had to realign our budget and buy tablets\" (Violence Prevention -6). A few mentioned creating videos that were posted online for clients to view, although this was much less common than video conferencing.",

The interviews conducted for this study occurred early in the pandemic (July -September 2020) and offered a unique opportunity to understand its effect on programs that aim to reduce violence and offending. Our analytical strategy began by acknowledging our preconceived ideas about the impact of COVID-19 on agency operations based on our experiences trying to navigate the pandemic. We accomplished this by discussing and documenting themes we thought might emerge. These included the belief that agency staff would struggle to connect and engage with clients, clients would experience a decline in services available to them, and changes in operations would require additional funding and training. By documenting these preconceived notions, we were able to appreciate more fully if and how the data truly reflected these issues. In some cases, the data were confirmatory. For instance, we were correct that agencies experience challenges engaging clients and providing the same level or, in some cases, types of services.

Moreover, agency administrators shared various ways they stepped into new roles for the benefit of the community, including those that promoted health safety and well-being. Although some agencies reported receiving additional funding to support these efforts as monies became available through local government agencies (e.g., dollars for personal protection equipment), many also completed these tasks out of concern for the communities they served even at the potential expense of their personal health and well-being. These efforts illustrate the ways in which community-based agencies work to address localized problems. Not only did these agencies work to ensure residents had access to personal protection equipment, such as hand sanitizer and masks, but some agencies also engaged actively in addressing misinformation and myths surrounding who was at-risk of contracting COVID-19. Many of the agency administrators interviewed devoted time and energy to handing out PPE, hand sanitizer, and sharing information with residents about the dangers of COVID-19 and precautionary steps they could take to prevent infection or spread of the virus. Thus, these agencies became integral to information sharing during the pandemic, often filling the gap produced by a breakdown in infrastructure, equipment and technology inefficiencies, and problems with the content and flow of information (Pan et al., 2020) . These agencies felt such work was important because the neighborhoods they served were experiencing higher rates of infection compared to other areas of the county or state and because not all residents understood the risk. These agencies represented a network of resources that could quickly mobilize for the benefit of communities in response to a sifting environment, underscoring the importance of community-based agencies in promoting community resiliency. Some also created spaces for young people to express how the pandemic was affecting their lives. When viewed together, these activities are consistent with what Sharkey (2018) refers to as a \"community quarterback,\" or agencies who \"oversee public spaces, to take care of everyone within them, and to make sure the neighborhood does not begin to fall apart\" (p. 167).",

Community-based organizations drew on their human, economic, and social capital to work collectively and address their client's needs. Administrators mobilized networks, norms, and trust to facilitate action and cooperation for mutual benefit (Putnam, 1993) . As federal and state governments closed their doors, communities relied on the concept of social cohesion, the degree of social connectedness and solidarity between different community groups, as well as the level of trust and connectedness between individuals and across community groups (Ludin et al., 2019; Townshend et al., 2015) . Communitybased agencies helped facilitate this social cohesion. The pandemic forced community-based agencies to reactivate their assets to advocate on behalf of their clients. Building on the concept of social capital, community-based organizations strengthened a sense of community, commitment to place, shared information and facilitated trust during a crisis (Aldrich, 2012) .",

(2020) , social isolation associated with quarantine and shelter-in place-orders heightened economic and health vulnerabilities for marginalized populations like IPV victims because of a lack of social support systems. This finding is consistent with that noted elsewhere; the social determinants that make individuals and communities susceptible to other negative outcomes, including poor health, criminal justice involvement, mass incarceration, housing and food insecurity, intensified the impact of the pandemic (Rosenberg et al., 2020; Zheng & Walsham, 2021) . For particularly vulnerable populations like IPV victims, the shelter-in-place orders and social distancing guidelines restricted individuals to their place of residency with limited access to social service providers (Mazza et al., 2020) . During the early days of the pandemic, the economic uncertainty and record levels of unemployment intensified levels of stress and increased the risk of marital conflict and violence (Kaukinen, 2020) .",

Differential access to computer technology and the Internet has been the subject of numerous studies, many of which show that poor or racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to have reliable access to the digital resources needed as compared to their wealthier and White counterparts (Chakraborty & Bosman, 2005) . Disparities in access to the Internet is often associated with information inequality (Yu, 2006) . The pandemic further highlighted the consequences of the digital divide beyond simply information acquisition; limited or no access to technology meant that individuals could not connect to social support systems and services. Prosocial support services have been used historically as an evidence-based strategy to assist individuals at greatest risk for becoming justiceinvolved or continued justice system involvement (Duwe & Johnson, 2016 ). Yet, most of these services are heavily reliant on face-to-face engagement practices that were either not feasible or difficult to sustain at pre-pandemic levels. Other research similarly found that community organizations faced challenges disrupting the cycle of violence in working class communities during the pandemic due to significant changes in what violence interrupters could do. Specifically, early engagement activities, such as showing up to the hospital soon after a shooting in an effort to support victims and their loved ones and mediate potential conflict resulting from the shooting, for instance, were no longer possible because of strict hospital visitation policies aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 (Altheimer et al., 2020) .",

Although governmental agencies worked to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by modifying practices, some research suggests that shelter in place orders and quarantine guidelines may have heighted the risk of victimization by increasing financial stress and limiting social services. This study supports the notion that a national COVID-19 research program is needed to critically understand the impact of the pandemic on crime and response and shape effective policy. As posited by Miller and Blumstein (2020) , a conceptual framework can direct the tone of inquiry, issues researched, and related attributed significance. Such a framework is a purposeful activity that can produce a greater understanding of how large-scale events affect neighborhoods and the agencies that work within them.",

Several researchers have highlighted the importance of community-based agencies in supporting crime reduction strategies within neighborhoods across the US (see, for instance, Sharkey, 2018 ). Yet, analysis of crime and large-scale events sometimes overlook localized efforts undertaken by non-governmental entities. Our study addresses this limitation by documenting the experiences of community-based agency administrators as they managed changes to their work environments during the early spring and summer months of COVID-19 while trying to maintain violence prevention and support services for their clients, most of whom also lived in communities experiencing high rates of violent crime, mass incarceration, and COVID-19 infection rates. Our findings suggest that community-based organizations quickly adapted to the new social landscape by executing social distancing and remote contact measures. Despite fears of contamination, agency staff members continued to serve the most vulnerable populations during the pandemic.",
