Our specific focus is on the broad research questions: How do liquid IT workers remain competitive? What are suitable strategies for their management and engagement? Using the research insights from the interviews with independent liquid IT professionals working on the same mission-critical compliance program in a large financial institution, we propose a new conceptual model of their 'personal competitive advantage' (PCA). Drawing from the theories of human capital and social capital, we theorize PCA as a complex, mutually enhancing (a triple-helix-like) interplay of three highlyintertwined components of 'Doing', 'Relating' and 'Becoming'. Based on the proposed model, we then articulate an initial set of strategies for management and engagement of the liquid workforce. In doing so, we expand and challenge the current IS research on IT workforce that remains focused on its retention and prevention of turnover. Instead, we propose to focus on specific management strategies for building and maintaining social capital within and beyond organizational boundaries.",

At the same time, the nature of IT workforce is rapidly changing. For example, Randstad's future workforce report predicts that by year 2025, 69 % of the workforce will consist of agile and non-traditional workers (Randstad, 2016) . In a more recent survey of 800 executives world-wide, about 70 % expect the demand for individual, on-site freelancers, contractors and temporary workers to increase over the next two years, compared to the pre-Covid 19 pandemic levels (Dua et al., 2020) . This includes the demand for IT contractor talent with specialist competencies (McDonald, 2020) .",

This trend is often attributed to job preferences of new generations of millennial workers (Wingard, 2019) . Citing the USA today report, Wingard (2019) found that 70 % of millennials are interested in freelancing and 40 % plan to leave their permanent jobs in pursuit of freelancing over the next 5 years. A new generation of talent platforms, currently used by almost all 500 companies, now provides on-demand access to freelance workers with premium expertise (Fuller et al., 2020) . Some industry reports go even further and predict that within a decade we could expect to see a new Global 2000 company without any full-time employees apart from senior executives (Daugherty et al., 2016) . Consequently, new types of 'on-demand by choice' IT workforce are constantly emerging, including crowdsourced workers (Pedersen et al., 2013; Zhao & Zhu, 2014; Deng & Joshi, 2016; Taylor & Joshi, 2018) , digital nomadic workers (Wang et al., 2020; Schlagwein & Jarrahi, 2020) and, as discussed here, liquid workers.",

This in turn opens a pathway for a better understanding of suitable strategies for their management and engagement.

Relating describes building, using and maintaining social capital of relating to others, within and beyond the current work assignment. Becoming refers to a deliberate practice of engaging in the ongoing process of \"developing a professional self\" (Scanlon, 2011, p.14) . This component includes deliberate application and refinement of higher-order non-cognitive skills, such as reflection, self-efficacy, and selfawareness.

Section 5 elaborates on our findings, organized around different phases of the liquid workers' experience from finding work, working on temporary projects, leaving the current work assignment and finding the next one. Based on our research findings we then propose a theoretical model of PCA in Section 6, thus answering the first research question. In Section 7 we use the proposed theoretical model of PCA to infer and articulate new management strategies for the liquid workforce as an alternative to those that focus on IT retention and prevention of turnover.

Building upon this definition, Accenture (2016) added more characteristics by describing liquid workforce as adaptable, contingent, with valuable external skillset, and organized around projects. More recently, liquid workforce was described as new type of highly-skilled workers that 'can be \"seasonally\" attached and detached with ease as per the contingent strategic and operational needs' (Gupta, 2018, p5) . Emphasising a win-win value proposition of employing liquid workers, another recent industry report described them as \"a team of willing experts can be hired to swoop in and innovate, then swoop back out whenever they like\" (JLL, 2019, p.1).

(2019) observe three waves of related research. Even though their research curation was based on the articles published by a leading IS journal (MIS Quarterly), it is nevertheless reflective of the history of thinking about IT workforce by the leading IS scholars. Thus, the first wave, which was mainly conducted in the 80 s, coincided with the emergence of IT as the core business function. Consequently, the research in this wave focused on articulation of IT as a new profession by investigating specific skills and competences of at-the-time emerging IT/IS jobs, such as system analyst (Green, 1989) , the role of IT managers, and the roles of IT workforce in general. The second wave of IT workforce research (from early 90s to early 2000s) coincided with the recognition of IT as a strategic resource. Consequently it focused on the relationship between very dynamic IT jobs requirements and the fast-emerging new IT trends (Wiesche et al., 2019) . This wave also emphasized IT managers becoming a critical organizational resource. The third wave (from early-mid 2000 to today) has shifted the focus to new forms of IT organizations, such as open-source communities and online labor platforms (Howison & Crowston, 2014; Stewart & Gosian, 2006) . This wave, Wisheche et al. (2019) observe, aims to extend our collective understanding of the changing nature of IT workforce beyond the organizational boundaries and the traditional employment relationships to new forms of working and new types of organizations.",

First, the new types of IT workforce shift the focus from organisations to the workers who are self-employed and choose their work. This in turn shifts the power relationship found in traditional organizations, in relation to employment engagement. The prime example of this emerging trend are digital nomads (Wang et al., 2020) who are not only self-employed, but challenge our traditional understanding of the context of work, which in their case spans different geographical and organizational boundaries. Second, with each new category of IT workforce emerging, pioneering IS researchers first focus on its conceptualization as a new phenomenon. For example, Zhao & Zhu (2014) and Pedersen et al. (2013) first conceptualized the phenomenon of crowdsourcing, thus paving the way for other IS researchers to explore its many aspects. Their collective efforts shaped what is now recognized as an important area of IS research. We observe a similar trend now emerging with conceptualization of digital nomadism (Wang et al., 2020; Schlagwein & Jarrahi, 2020) . Third, we observe the absence of any prior IS research on the liquid workforce. Based on our previous discussion, we claim that the liquid workers represent the new category of work and as such expand the third wave of IS research on IT workforce.",

Although very diverse, these studies continue to emphasize that IT work is very unique compared to other professions.

For example, in their comprehensive literature review of research on IT skills Goles et al. (2008) discuss a variety of technical skills, which are specific to the IT field. They also include less-precise, non-technical skills, which include business skills, management and interpersonal skills, often referred to as 'soft-skills'. More recently, both academic and industry literature emphasize the rising importance of 'softskills', especially communication and team skills.",

For example, researchers often use various classifications of IT skills and proceed to map the skill set of different IT roles under investigation (e.g. Zweig et al., 2006) . A different approach, which is particularly relevant for our work, focuses on skills that shape an IT professional's career. For example, researchers have used different stages of IT career and the corresponding frameworks, such as the so-called career anchor model, to identify the most important career-defining skills (Ginszerg & Baroudi, 1988; Lash & Sein, 1995; Josefek & Kaufman, 2003) . The same approach was deemed appropriate for our project, as it enabled us to focus on the most important skills that shape an IT liquid professional's career, while remaining open towards the emergence of new skills not previously discussed in the literature on more traditional IT workforce. Also, when investigating the career-shaping skills of the liquid workforce, we focused on types of skills, rather than actual skill set included in, for example, project management or system analysis. The latter is the approach taken by researchers who use mapping against previous agreed classifications, see for example Zweig et al. (2006) .",

Following the same line of thinking, the academic literature offers numerous studies on IT turnover. For example, citing a large number of meta studies, Wynen et al. (2018) confirm that employee turnover has been a core theme in organisation and management studies for years. Importantly, there is a common assumption that turnover is negative (Whynen et al., 2018 , Wang et al., 2017 and should be prevented. In addition to the loss of valuable knowledge and skills for the organisations (de Vasconcelos et al., 2016; Bairi et al., 2011) and a significant labour cost involved in finding and hiring suitable IT experts (Wang & Kaarst-Brown, 2014) , there are also consequences for the remaining employees, such as increased workload and decreased moral (Wang & Kaarst-Brown, 2014) .",

Management efforts are combined with other initiatives. For example, organisations are now using HR analytics for employee retention. Boudreau (2014) offers a good illustration of what is already possible: \"Imagine one of your managers walks into their subordinate's office and says: 'Our data analysis predicts that you will soon get restless and think of leaving us, so we want to make you an offer that our data shows has retained others like you'\" (p.1).",

Based on a comprehensive literature review on voluntary turnover of IT employees, Lo (2015) offers the following important observation: \"The need for further research on IT turnover has been called by many, but much of the literature continues to conduct similar studies using the same constructs, and these studies find similar results\" (p.378). Consequently, Lo (2015) issues a call to IS and other researchers to focus our collective attention to new and less explored research directions. In answering Lo's (2015) call, we observe that the liquid workforce offer an opportunity for a much needed new direction in IT turnover research. At the same time, they also open an important research gap, as their turnover is frequent, predictable and, by definition, unavoidable.",

            "text": "In answering the first research question: How do liquid IT workers remain competitive in highly dynamic IT industry?\" we theorize that they remain competitive by growing what we term here \"personal competitive advantage\" (PCA). They grow it over time and through deliberate long-term strategies, as they chart their own careers across temporary job assignments. Based on our research findings, we conceptualize their PCA as an ongoing and mutually enhancing interplay of three highly-intertwined components, we term Doing, Relating and Becoming. Observed through the combined theoretical lens of human and social capital, they are described as follows: -The Doing component of PCA corresponds to their highly specialized IT skills and knowledgetheir human capital (HC). We name this component Doing to emphasize the act of doing that is applying their skills and knowledge (i.e. their HC) to complete a particular work assignment in a given context in order to create value. This component also assumes maintenance and growth of HC through ongoing learning and professional development, which liquid workers see to be their own responsibility. -The Relating component corresponds to their social capital acquired on their current work assignment and accumulated from the previous ones. This social capital includes 'bonding' capital with the current and past members of the same project team, 'bridging' across different projects and work assignments and 'linking' with their current and past managers. We name this component Relating to emphasize the nature of this component that is intra-personal and relational. -The Becoming component emphasizes \"the evolutionary, processual nature of developing a professional self\" (Scanlon, 2011, p.14) , in this case as a liquid IT professional. In the professional learning literature, the notion of 'becoming\" is considered to be different from 'being' a professional. As Scanlon (2011) explains: \"'being' a professional denotes the notion of arriving at a static point of expertise. It is a concept frequently encountered in typologies of professional practice\" (p.14). We observe the same practice in IS research on IT professionals, in both the first and second waves of this research, as described by Wiesche et al. (2019) . On the other hand, as Scanlon (2011) argues, becoming is \"an iterative concept that eschews notion of arrival and end-point achievement of expertise. It is for that reason that 'becoming' is contiguous with notion of lifelong learning\" (p.14). Our research findings also confirm that the ongoing process of becoming a liquid IT professional is a deliberate practice, rather than determined by various job assignments as they become available. As such, this deliberate practice includes the ongoing application and refinement of higher-order non-cognitive skills, such as reflection, self-efficacy, and self-awareness. Becoming also includes personal characteristics, in particular character strengths, such as 'social intelligence' and persistence, as previously articulated by Peterson, et al. (2010) .",

Also focusing on different types of workplace support (including for example, mentoring or resource support) for liquid workforce, Ghosh and colleagues (2019) posit that such support prevents (i.e. \"negatively influences\") their turnover intention. Contrary to these insights from the literature, the liquid workforce we interviewed did not receive, nor expected any career support including on-the-job training. There was no investment in their development by the organisation they worked in. Interestingly, even if offered, they would not even value such support. Yet, contrary to the previous research findings, they kept looking for every possible opportunity to contribute and show their commitment and demonstrate high performance. We could explain it by the Becoming component of their PCA, in particular their ongoing commitment to building and maintaining their professional reputation.

Although their knowledge and skills are still perceived as valuable to the company, the main focus shifts from the ownership of HC to building SC through relationships. Consequently, rather than trying to prevent it, IT turnover is embraced by the company as a future opportunity to enhance the existing skill set on a continuous basis. This is because when established with the liquid workers, social capital could be used to \"pull back\" skills and knowledge of previously-engaged liquid IT workforce. Every time these workers return, they bring back more and more valuable skills and knowledge (HC) accumulated throughout their other job assignments. Our interviews reveal that managers of BNQ's liquid workers were aware of this important feature of human capital and were happy to let the highly-skilled IT professionals go after each project, without any attempt to retain them. Contrary to the recommendations found in the management literaturesee for example a literature review conducted by Wynen et al. (2018) -BNQ's managers were embracing IT turnover as an opportunity to attract this workforce back. By maintaining the social capital with former employees, and beyond the immediate work assignments, these managers created future long-term opportunities to bring these employees back, when needed. While human capital is confined within the boundaries of formal organizations, social capital transcends organizational boundaries. This in turn is expected to change the nature of management strategies beyond organizational boundaries and even beyond the current employment of liquid workers. We also found that the current employees were also using their own social capital to find and recommend the required liquid workforce to be interviewed, and if successful, to be selected for the temporary positions. This has an important implication for managers who need to create opportunities for the existing workforce to enhance their social capital while on the job assignment. Being aware of such a practice, at BNQ, managers introduced all new employees to the key liquid workers whose HC (knowledge and skills) might be helpful. The allocation of a senior partner from another team as a designated go-to person, was also a very important strategy for building (linking) social capital and discovering the needed HC within the organization. The just-in time engagement of liquid workers also requires rethinking of company's existing human resources (HR) processes that might be too slow for this purpose.",

Our research findings indicate that the liquid IT workers considered the Doing component (IT skills and knowledge) of their PCA to be necessary but not sufficient for a successful career. While the the Relating component (their social capital) enabled them to survive in the current job and find the next temporary job assignment, the Becoming component was found to contribute to longevity of their career and shaping of their career choices. Therefore, contrary to prior research on the importance of skills for the recruitment of candidates (Humburg & Van der Velden, 2015) , our research indicate that even advanced IT skills and knowledge of liquid IT workers are no longer sufficient for a successful long-term career.",

We addressed this limitation to some extent, by considering multidisciplinary literature and learning from the ways other (at-the-time new) concepts where first introduced to the IS community, such as crowdsourcing and digital nomadism. Our future research includes education of the liquid workforce and well as transformation of various organizational processes to better accommodate them, while on temporary work assignments. Another limitation is a limited number of interviews with the liquid IT workers. Given their highly-dynamic work context as well as their status of highly-sought after professionals, securing interviews with this group professionals was and will always be a challenge. We also aimed to select and interview liquid IT workers in different roles, which further impacted on the number of interviews we conducted. Our future work will include more interviews of liquid IT professionals across different industry contexts. Our research findings also open some important questions and directions for future education of IT workforce and their managers. Our experience as educators across both business and IT schools confirms that across both contexts, too much emphasis has been placed on IT skills and knowledge (i.e. the Doing component). Consequently, we call for more attention to Relating and Becoming in education of the future IT workforce and their managers. We also note that social capital continues to be perceived as \"soft-skills\" or even more limited \"networking skills\". We argue that such a limited perception is misleading and even damaging. Skills involved in building and maintaining social capital in very dynamic environments involve much more than communication skills and teamwork. With more and more highly-skilled IT professionals choosing to work as liquid workforce, these skills will become critical for professional survival. Our research also opens new questions about possible inclusion/exclusion issues in the employment practices of liquid workforce. For example, with liquid workers recommending other liquid workers, there is a potential for favoritism (Ponzo & Scoppa, 2011) as well as potential bias related to gender, race and ethnicity (McGee, 2018). We are not implying that the hiring practices reported by the liquid workers in our study were biased or included favoritism. Indeed, in spite of being recommended, all interviewed liquid workers were hired through rigorous recruitment and interview processes. However, a limited pool of liquid workers who need to be found and hired very quickly may limit future opportunities for those who are entering the market of the liquid workers for the first time. This in turn opens interesting research questions related to equity and diversity, prevention of bias and favouritism in hiring practices of liquid IT workforce as well as their impact on the overall IT labour market.",
