While many recognized pathophysiological mechanisms are involved-coagulation and inflammatory cascades, pulmonary exudation and respiratory compensation, endovascular and renal injury-the exact causal relationships between them remain opaque. A better understanding of these causal processes is urgent and important for predicting their progression, targeting therapeutic approaches and improving patient outcomes. To this end, the worldwide pandemic generated a flood of research, but much of the early output was unfiltered, sometimes conflicting, and of reduced reliability [1] .

Formally, a BN [2, 12, 13] includes a directed, acyclic graph (DAG), (e.g., Fig. 1 ), which consists of nodes connected by arcs (pointing from 'parent' to 'child') that never point in a continuous sequence from a node back to itself. 1 In addition, in a BN each node represents a random variable with multiple possible states, and each arc represents a direct probabilistic dependency, quantified by a conditional probability table (CPT) or equation specifying the probability distribution of the child given the states of all its parents. In causal DAGs and BNs, these arcs also represent direct causal influences-hence they can also predict the effects of decisions regarding interventions. 1 In mathematical graph theory, where early work focused on polyhedra, these are traditionally called 'vertices' connected by 'directed edges'; but common and equivalent terms are 'nodes' connected by 'directed links', 'arrows' or 'arcs'.",

Informed by our previous modeling experience and preliminary literature review, we initially divided the problem into four submodels: Core Mechanism, Complications, Immune Response, and Diagnosis. (This division was eventually revised substantially, as described in \u00a7 3.1.) Our Core Mechanism submodel was focused primarily on the respiratory system, so we primarily enlisted respiratory and infectious disease specialists to help create it. Immune Response details were elicited from clinical immunologists and other domain experts in human immunology. In contrast, to discuss Complications, we enlisted a more varied group of clinicians and other domain experts, including cardiologists, intensivists, and renal specialists.

We raised the general issue of what question the model is trying to answer, and tried to achieve an expert consensus on this. We then proceeded to a standard set of questions for eliciting causal structure, applied in an adaptive and iterative fashion. We asked about which factors (variables) are relevant, and only asked about their possible states if it was important to help define them. Experts frequently suggested clarification of the concepts intended to be captured by existing variables or modification of their names as elicitation progressed, and sometimes suggested merging and separating variables. We asked about the causal relationships between them, usually focusing on one variable at a time and asking which other variables are direct causes and which are direct effects (a localized version of the \"bowtie\" method used for risk analysis[49]). When new variables were added and connected, we , but in this initial non-dynamic graph we displayed only one direction. We chose a direction that created no cycle, and was either the initial influence, or the more immediate(i.e., with less time delay), or the strongest, as deemed most informative for disease progression or most pertinent to a submodel's goal. We also noted any other comments, such as which connections were more important, unusual, or controversial. Experts sometimes clarified the basis for their suggestions by referring to the literature or their own opinion. The primary outcome of the workshop was a causal DAG (in the GeNIe BN software) that a high proportion of experts agreed captured the most important underlying pathophysiological processes. 6. Post-workshop review: After the workshop, our team had a debrief discussion (30-60 min), for feedback on their own performance and to consolidate their understanding. Subsequently, the modelers cleaned up any loose ends in the model or documentation, making sure all the knowledge elicited was understood and documented correctly, and simultaneously looking for gaps that would need further clarification. This included indicative parameters and typical scenarios, as described above. The whole workshop, conducted remotely by web-based videoconference (Zoom), was recorded as video, and the audio later transcribed into text. This allowed us to review any part of the elicitation as required. Our transcripts and video recordings, the \"raw data\" of these elicitation sessions, have been retained and securely stored. We used our newfound understanding to choose and sched-ule subsequent elicitations and actions. These included emailing questions to specific experts that were present or to other experts with different skill sets or knowledge, and then if needed, scheduling one-on-one elicitation sessions.7. Translation to application models: As a result of our various expert elicitation sessions, we produced multiple \"expert models\" that represented different body subsystems, and sometimes represented alternative perspectives put forward by different experts. Our approach here was exploratory, avoiding premature judgments on what would be important for practical applications, so we tried to capture this theoretical expert knowledge comprehensively. However, our ultimate aim is to develop practical tools powered by customized \"application models\", the first of which will be to support clinical reasoning in the prognostication for COVID-19.",

As an adaptive, generative process in a complex, novel domain, our progress was inevitably evolutionary: new model variants were created, crossbred and adapted for each environmental niche, with many now extinct and a few still extant. Our Core Mechanism model centered mainly on the respiratory system from the outset; as the multi-system nature of COVID-19 became apparent we decided to rename it the Respiratory model and focus on the initial infection process in that system. It is presented below. Our Complications model largely begins where the Respiratory model's story of pathophysiology ends, capturing for more severe cases the knock-on effects to other organ systems and body functions.

Knowledge about their role in the COVID-19 process was too limited: although they are known to directly influence some of our variables (e.g., vaccination reduces the chance of initial infection), not all of their direct influences are clear (e.g., vaccination also decreases the chance of infection developing into severe COVID-19, probably by influencing multiple variables along these pathways). Fortunately, these theoretical models are useful and valid will affect the parameters, e.g., how strongly some variables influence others. When adequate data is available to adjust these parameters depending on background factors, then these factors can be appended by researchers to the DAGs we present here as additional causes. 3 Many variables involved in these processes are latent, but their probability distributions can be inferred from observed evidence, such as clinical signs, symptoms and laboratory measurements.

Direct infection involving the alveoli without preceding or simultaneous infection involving the upper respiratory tract is possible, although it may be less likely. The virus can first become established at one site then spread to or re-establish in another. For example, Infection of olfactory epithelium following epithelial infection in the upper respiratory tract has manifested as Ageusia and/or anosmia in some patients. The virus may spread from epithelial to endothelial cells in alveoli, causing at any site may activate Systemic immune and inflammatory response, which often results in the release of pro-and/or anti-inflammatory blood markers from immunerelated cells. Pulmonary system The primary function of the respiratory system is to support the metabolic processes of the body by taking in oxygen and removing carbon dioxide; this occurs through gas exchange between air and blood at the delicate membranes of the lung alveoli. Our Respiratory causal DAG (S1 Fig.) models the initial pathophysiological process which is initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in this system. The most notable large-scale feature is the three distinct pathways from the initial infection to involvement of the respiratory system and then complications, although these pathways have interconnections and often contribute concurrently. Mechanical pathway: Alveolar and systemic inflammation can damage pulmonary capillaries causing the leakage of plasma (Pulmonary capillary leakage), leading to filling of the alveoli with exudate (Alveolar consolidation) that causes stiffening and reduced mechanical lung function (Reduced lung compliance), and results in Ventilatory insufficiency. Alveolar epithelial infection (and inflammation) can also directly reduce compliance, but to a lesser extent. Another possible cause of ventilatory insufficiency is a loss of muscle mass (Muscle wasting) which can be directly caused by catabolism as a result of the systemic immune response and may be affected by a range of background factors, such as nutritional status and immobility, not shown in this model. Gas exchange pathway: Pulmonary capillary leakage and alveolar consolidation blocks the passage of air and reduces the alveolar surface area available for gas exchange, and this mismatch between ventilation and blood perfusion reduces gas exchange in the affected parts of the lungs (V/Q mismatch). At an extreme, local perfusion may occur in the absence of ventilation with oxygenated air (Shunt). Alveolar infection causes local Hypoxia which can trigger counteracting Pulmonary vasoconstriction, an adaptive physiological response which helps to match regional perfusion to ventilation in the lungs and thus reduces the extent of V/Q mismatch. Coagulation pathway: Endothelial infection/ inflammation and possibly the presence of virus in the blood (viremia) may trigger a systemic immune and inflammatory response, and this may result in an abnormally high propensity to coagulation (Hypercoagulable state). This may begin locally in the small vessels of the lower airways (Pulmonary microthromboses), but can later manifest as macroscopic thromboses in larger vessels (Other thromboses). Both types of thrombosis can block vessels in the lungs (Pulmonary circulatory blockage) and lead to V/Q mismatch, to which alveolar endothelial infection/inflammation can also directly contribute.",

Some issues involve modeling choices: even where the process being represented is entirely agreed upon, modeling sometimes involves choices about how to represent it, and some of the options we chose here may need clarification or appear controversial. Some issues involve domain knowledge: there are some aspects of COVID-19 that are still not fully understood, about which there may be competing hypotheses. So, some of the options we chose here may need revision in future as further research resolves these controversies. Upper respiratory tract mediation: One theoretical controversy, related to the diagnostic value of a dry cough, concerns three possible respiratory pathways by which the virus enters the body. Respiratory viruses are thought to typically infect the upper respiratory tract first (abbreviated as URT in the BN), then descend by contiguous spread to the alveoli and (rarely) via the bloodstream. COVID-19 may take this normal path, or may bypass the upper respiratory tract or the larger airways to infect the endothelium of the lower airways more directly via the ACE2 receptor, or less directly from the upper respiratory tract via the bloodstream. The data on this issue is currently limited so we have included all three pathways in the model, but our experts thought the typical path for respiratory viruses was less likely than the other two. Future findings may support this opinion and clarify their relative importance. unique feature of COVID-19. Our Respiratory BN includes vascular involvement (in the Coagulation pathway) primarily as a mediator for the initial phase of infection in the lung, whereas our Complications BN places more emphasis on subsequent feedback loops. Since vascular involvement is complicated, we explored it by eliciting a separate vascular model from two of our experts, which is not presented here. We were satisfied that the vascular elements included in our Respiratory and Complications models were sufficient for our purposes. V/Q mismatch and Shunt seem logically related: It is good practice to avoid including logically related terms in a causal model, i.e., where their semantics results in a logical dependence. Such a connection results in probabilistic dependence and an arc in the model, but it may behave differently to a causal connection under intervention, which can make it difficult to adapt the model for decision support. Here we included both Shunt and V/Q mismatch, even though shunt is (by definition) a type of V/Q mismatch, so the former logically entails the latter. This accurately represents the statements elicited: our experts consistently used both these terms and distinguished between them. They had good reason: different interventions (such as positive airway pressure for shunt and supplementary oxygen for V/Q mismatch) are considered appropriate in each case. So, mirroring their terminology faithfully captures expert knowledge in a way they can agree is accurate, which in this case includes the relevant causal connections to interventions or tests.",

In particular, they both can affect the vascular system by reducing Vascular integrity and Vascular tone. Vascular integrity refers to the status of endothelial structure compromising permeability, and the vascular tone refers to the degree of constriction of a blood vessel. The systemic inflammatory response can additionally increase the probability of Hypercoagulable state (as also depicted in the Respiratory model) and Dehydration.

In this model, we summarize all such feedback loops by presenting only their final deterioration to particular organ failures. Since vascular failure is ill defined, we instead represent a key pathway in which a hypercoagulable state combined with possible liver, kidney and hematologic dysfunctions lead to general coagulopathy that can in turn contribute to severe vascular dysfunction that may result in the heart stopping and subsequent death.

Hence, additional observations can usually be represented simply by adding another such variable without changing the underlying causal structure. For simplicity, we omit these variables here, with the exception of Low oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) in the Respiratory model.

The names of these variables generally refer to the abnormal status of a mechanism, since people more readily interpret abnormal states as causes, particularly when they tend to produce an abnormal result [52], and to make the causal diagrams more easily digested in the absence of visible states. Most of our other variables, such as Acidosis, are ordered categorical: they have a finite number of discrete states in a meaningful order (usually degrees of severity).Continuous variables are often discretized during a measurement process and/or during BN construction to assist with probability estimation and computation (although BNs can include them).

DAGs help researchers identify relevant factors, and more specifically, factors that are potential mediators, confounders, and sources of selection bias or measurement error. So, we anticipate that our models will serve as a guide to the design of cohort and case-control studies of the effects of various demographic and clinical risk factors, or of the effects of various interventions, on one of several clinical outcomes of interest for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Causal DAGs have similar applications to the design of experimental studies, even where manipulation or randomization of the treatment variables reduces confounding. So, we anticipate that our models will also be useful to guide the design of clinical trials of treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our DAGs can be used to identify important non-treatment factors that may influence and produce unwanted variation in the trial outcome, and which should therefore be considered for control by stratification or statistical adjustment (regardless of whether treatment randomization is employed) in order to increase the statistical power of the experiment.

As new data accrues on the impacts of such interventions, the application models can be re-parameterized to remain accurate.Even if an application model is developed independently of our models, the dependencies this application model encodes between variables (including interventions) can be checked against our DAGs to identify any likely discrepancies.Our models thus provide a ready-made and well grounded source of theoretical validation for other research teams using different modeling methods.In our ongoing work with these BN models, we are already developing several of our own tools for either standalone or integrated decision support, parameterized using the IDDO subset of the ISARIC database (https://www.iddo.org/covid-19) and LEOSS databases (https: //leoss.net/). We are tailoring two distinct tools based on an applied version of the models we have described here, one for in-hospital prognosis and management of COVID-19 patients and another to support resource management and monitoring for confirmed cases. For the in-hospital prognosis tool, available information about the patient can be entered into the tool by a clinician directly, or retrieved automatically from a patient's record. The clinician will then receive information not just on the patient's overall prognosis, but also on risks around organs, body functions and treatment requirements over the next 24 hours and the next 5 days.
