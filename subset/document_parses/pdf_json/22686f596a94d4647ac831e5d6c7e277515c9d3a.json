It is transmitted through respiratory droplets (sneezing and coughing) of infected persons and contaminated surfaces (WHO, 2020b) . Besides, it could be transmitted from diseased carriers without any symptoms to contacted persons . This virus is infectious because its incubation period ranges between one day and two weeks. Additionally, it can persist on surfaces for up to nine days at room temperature, accelerating its transmission (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Therefore, this infectious disease is a critical topic for medical society (Saba and Elsheikh, 2020) .",

Therefore, this virus is considered the most critical crisis since the Second World War (Boccaletti et al., 2020) . The observed cases are based on the testing results, so the number of actual infections is higher than that of reported infections. It is pertinent to mention that undertesting leads to errors in the forecasting model (Farooq and Bazaz, 2021) . As a result, predicting the number of infected persons is critical (Saba and Elsheikh, 2020) .",

This research is concerned with applying time-series analysis to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases. It provides insights into the spread pattern of this disease to determine the best policies. Besides, it is critical for establishing resilience against this pandemic. Resilience provides a paradigm for orchestrating a more effective response to COVID-19 and eventually altering trajecto-ries to reduce the likelihood of future global health crises (Bragatto et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "Time series analysis could be described as monitoring a particular phenomenon over time and forecasting its future response. The time-series data could be forecasted using several models. These models could be categorized into three classes (Khan et al., 2020) : a) statistical models, b) machine learning models, and c) deep learning models. Numerous research efforts have been exerted to model the spread of this novel coronavirus. For instance, Amar et al. (2020) applied seven regression models (i.e., exponential, logit growth, quadratic, third-degree, fourth-degree, fifth-degree, and sixth-degree) to forecast the number of infected patients in Egypt. The official database from 15 February till 15 June 2020 was used for training the models. These models predicted the COVID-19 outbreak for the next 15 days, one month, and the final epidemic size and time. The results confirmed that the exponential, fourth-degree, fifth-degree, and sixth-degree models yielded the best prediction results for the next 15 days. Meanwhile, the fourthdegree model proved its prediction capability for one month. Using the logit growth regression model, the epidemic peak and final time were estimated to be on 22 June 2020 and 8 September 2020, respectively. Besides, it was predicted that the total epidemic size would be 166,760 cases. However, the reported results were subjected to uncertainty from social and natural (climatic) conditions. Ardabili et al. (2020) compared the ability of machine learning models to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, China, Iran, Germany, and the United States. The results of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system models were promising. The study affirmed the outperformance of machine learning models in modeling the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, it recommended modeling the mortality rate to estimate the required beds in intensive care units. Finally, it suggested integrating machine learning and susceptible-exposed-infectiousremoved (SEIR) models to enhance the accuracy and lead time of standard epidemiological models. Gupta et al. (2020) employed a support vector machine (SVM), prophet forecasting model, and linear regression model for predicting the active, death, and cured rates in India. The prophet forecasting model produced better results compared to SVM and linear regression models because of the following points: 1) it analyzed the dataset trend to determine the growth curve, 2) it used the Fourier transformation series for data analysis based on daily, weekly, or yearly basis, and 3) it automatically identified the change points in data unlike the SVM and linear regression models. However, SVM provided more significant results in comparison to the linear regression model. This is because the linear regression model did not account for the change of data over time parameter. Saba and Elsheikh (2020) forecasted the spread of COVID-19 in Egypt using nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The models were trained using the reported dataset from 1 March till 1 May 2020. The models were evaluated using determination coefficient, mean absolute error, root mean square error, deviation ratio, and coefficient of residual mass. The statistical indicators confirmed that the NARANN model had a better prediction ability compared with the ARIMA model. Muhammad et al. (2021) implemented several supervised machine learning algorithms for modeling COVID-19 infection in Mexico. These models included SVM, logistic regression, decision tree, naive Bayes, and artificial neural network. The relationship between features of the dataset was examined using correlation coefficient analysis. The results confirmed that the decision tree model had the highest accuracy of 94.99 %. In comparison, the naive Bayes model had the highest specificity of 94.30 %, and the SVM model had the highest sensitivity of 93.34 %. Based on the above-referenced literature, classical statistical models fail to capture the nonlinear and complex behavior in the assessed data (Tollenaar and Van der Heijden, 2013) . On the contrary, machine learning algorithms could learn the general trend and intricacies of the data, providing high-quality predictive models (Lawson, 2013; Wong et al., 2019; Hui et al., 2020) . Therefore, the machine learning models outperform traditional statistical models (Makridakis et al., 2018) . However, the machine learning models could not provide reliable results in modeling the complex behavior of COVID-19 data. The reason is that the number of reported cases varies based on multiple factors, including environmental conditions and physical proximity (Khan et al., 2020) .",

Farooq and Bazaz (2021) developed a deep neural network model for modeling the COVID-19 spread in India's five worstaffected states. The model parameters were updated using an adaptive online incremental learning technique. This technique eliminated the need to rebuild the model from scratch when receiving a new dataset. Therefore, it can overcome the computational complexities arising from data size, run-time duration, transmission dynamics change, and change in infection control mechanisms or government policies. The results affirmed that the reported cases would significantly increase in the coming weeks without flattening the infection curves during this period. This necessitates that policymakers should take appropriate decisions to combat the disease spread. Jin et al. (2021) investigated the spatial-temporal features of the COVID-19 growth in mainland China and Hubei Province. Additionally, a correlation study of the parameters affecting the pandemic severity was carried out. The daily fluctuations in the number of confirmed cases were modeled using logical growth, polynomial, and fully connected neural network models. The experimental findings affirmed the outperformance of the polynomial model (degree = 18) for fitting the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, the deep learning models have exhibited outstanding performance in detecting COVID-19 cases based on chest radiology data. For instance, Aishwarya and Kumar (2021) reviewed and analyzed the application of various machine and deep learning techniques to test the presence of COVID-19 using chest X-rays and computed tomography images. For the deep learning models, it was found that the CheXNet network architecture yielded the most accurate detection results. Furthermore, support vector regression and stacking-ensemble learning models were determined to be the best machine learning models. The proposed methodology could aid doctors and physicians in detecting COVID-19 instances in a short time.",

However, they have not tackled the following aspects: 1) predicting the total number of infections, recoveries, and deaths in Egypt, 2) examining the application of deep learning models to forecast the epidemic size in Egypt, and 3) comparing the performance of machine learning approaches and deep learning techniques using the official reported data till June 2021. In order to address the aforementioned limitations, this research employs two deep learning algorithms to predict the COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt. These algorithms are the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The performance of these models is evaluated against that of the MLP neural network. These forecasting models are trained and tested using the data reported from 14 February to 15 August 2020. These models are applied to predict the cumulative infected cases for the next seven and thirty days. Different statistical indices are applied to decide the optimal parameters of the best forecasting model. The proposed model with the optimal parameter values is trained using the data reported from 14 February 2020 to 30 June 2021. This model is utilized to forecast the cumulative infections, recoveries, and deaths for one month ahead. The proposed model could help researchers, health officials, and policymakers forecast the epidemic size and develop policies to defeat this crisis.",

As a result, it is crucial to prepare and pre-process the data before being imported to neural networks. Fig. 2 illustrates the data preparation procedure. The lengthy sequence (S) is partitioned into sub-sequences (\u015c) of fixed-length (L), where S = {x t , x t+1 , . . .x T } and\u015c = {x t , x t+1 , . . .x t+L }. In this research, the length of the sub-sequence is equal to 20 consecutive days. The data is then pre-processed in the following phase. Data normalization and standardization are two techniques used in the data preparation phase (Ali and Faraj, 2014) . In this research, data standardization is utilized as a scaling approach to set the mean and standard deviation to 0 and 1, respectively. After data standardization, the neural networks conduct time-series analysis by splitting the data in each sub-sequence into input and output observations. For one-step prediction, the first twenty data points of each subsequence are modeled as inputs and the twenty-first data point is regarded as an output.",

It has a high capability to learn dependencies and process large quantities of data for a long time (Elsheikh et al., 2021a) . This network has a chain architecture consisting of several modules. These modules are used to store processed data from previous stages (Sherstinsky, 2020) . The structures of these modules differ from those of traditional recurrent neural networks. The structure of a typical LSTM consists of several memory modules called cells. Hidden and cell states are transferred from the previous cell to the next one. The data is processed as it moves in the forward direction through the cell state. The memory blocks remember things through three primary gate controllers; input, forget, and output gates. The input gate adds information to the cell state while the forget gate filters the unrequired or unimportant information from the cell state. Finally, the output gate displays the output from the current cell state. These gates are responsible for enhancing the network capabilities by controlling the memorizing process and avoiding dependency problems (Elsheikh et al., 2021b) . As depicted in Fig. 3 , the proposed LSTM architecture comprises an input layer, an LSTM layer, a dropout layer, a fully connected layer, and an output layer.",

It differs from a recurrent network as it is a feedforward network that filters spatial data, unlike a recurrent network that feeds data back to itself. CNN has achieved good performance in forecasting time series data (Acharya et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017) . Its structure is inspired by biological neurology. The neurons in this network are only connected to the closer neurons, and they all have the exact weights, unlike a simple neural network. The connections among the neurons are simplified to uphold the spatial aspects of the dataset. As shown in Fig. 4 , its architecture comprises convolutional, batch normalization, rectified linear unit (ReLU), pooling, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layer is responsible for extracting features by placing filters over inputs and creating a convolved feature map based on filter stride and size. The pooling layer applies a downsampling operation to reduce the sample size of feature maps, minimizing the computational efforts required for processing data. There are two ways to produce a pooled feature map; max pooling and average pooling. The max-pooling and average pooling take the maximum and average input of a specific convolved feature, respectively. The ReLU layer acts as an activation function to maintain nonlinearity and dimensionality as the data propagates from one layer to another in the network. Finally, the fully connected layer delivers the output by mapping the extracted features (Khan et al., 2020) .",

Besides, the output layer consists of neurons that correspond to the predicted output. The neurons apply an activation function on weighted inputs to forecast the output (Bishop, 2006; Goodfellow et al., 2016) . The weights of connections among neurons are random at the initial stage. This network is trained iteratively using an optimization approach, and an error metric is computed based on the difference between observed and predicted values in each training cycle. The weights of neuron connections are adjusted based on the contribution to the total error through the backward propagation process (Bishop, 1999) .",

The Mediterranean Sea borders it to the north, Gaza Strip, Israel, and the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. It is considered a lower-middle-income country with respect to a World Bank categorization. The total population in Egypt exceeds 100 million people, representing 1.3 % of the total world population and 7.6 % of the Africa population. About 32.5 % of the entire population lives under the national poverty line. The Egyptian health systems have a moderate capacity to confront the coronavirus. The physician and hospital bed densities are 0.79 physicians and 1.6 beds per 1000 persons, respectively. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak is a significant challenge for health workers and policymakers. However, the demographic structure of Egypt differs from other European and Asian countries. About 21 % of the Egyptians are between 18 and 29 years old, while only 3.9 % exceed 65 years old. It was found that older people and those suffering debilitating diseases are more susceptible to COVID-19.

Fig. 5 shows the number of reported cases during this period. The data statistics Fig. 9 . Active, death, and recovery rates due to COVID-19 in Egypt. are depicted in Table 1 . It is clear from Fig. 5 and Table 1 that the COVID-19 profile is highly variable. The frequency distribution of the data is illustrated in Fig. 6 . The means of the daily infected cases, deaths, and recoveries are 559, 32, and 420. Additionally, the medians of the daily infections, deaths, and recoveries are 523, 31, and 411, respectively. The data are not normally distributed and are rather positively (right) skewed because the means are greater than the medians. Fig. 7 presents an overview of the COVID-19 spread in Egypt. As of 30 June 2021, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is 281,282, with 211,384 recoveries and 16,169 deaths. It could be noted that the virus spread is growing exponentially, which implies the need to apply monitoring and control systems. The future progression of this outbreak is still ambiguous because it spreads randomly. As shown in Fig. 8 , Egypt is considered one of the most COVID-19 hotspots in Africa as it has 2,748.66 cumulative confirmed cases per million people on 30 June 2021. It has been ranked as the fourth African country after South Africa, Morocco, and Tunisia regarding the cumulative confirmed cases. Moreover, regarding COVID-19 resilience ranking, it has been ranked 1st in Africa, 3rd in the Middle East, and 25th globally, as stated by the Egyptian cabinet's information and decision support center. It is worth mentioning that the COVID resilience index estimates the capacity of nations to battle COVID-19 based on ten indicators: deaths per 1 million, monthly fatality rate, monthly infected cases per 100k, positive test rate, lockdown effectiveness, availability to COVID immunizations, society mobility, growth rate of the gross domestic product in 2020, medical care inclusion, and human advancement index (IDSC, 2020) .",

The general parameter setting of the deep learning models is depicted in Table 2 . The data reported from 14 February to 15 August 2020 is divided into 90 % for the training phase (166 readings from 14 February 2020 to 28 July 2020) and 10 % for the testing phase (18 readings from 29 July 2020 to 15 August 2020). The trained models are applied to forecast the total number of infections for a short period (i.e., one week ahead). These models are developed using MATLAB R2019a, under the same environment of Intel i7\u22122.20 GHz, 8 GBs of RAM, and Windows 10. The CNN architecture comprises three blocks, where each block is composed of convolutional, batch normalization, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) layers. The convolutional layers of the first, second, and third blocks comprise 16, 32, and 64 filters, respectively. For the three blocks, the sizes of filters, stride, and padding are 2, 1, and 1, respectively along all edges of the layer. Two max-pooling layers are utilized after the first and second blocks. The first pooling layer has pool size 2 and stride 2 while a second pooling layer with pool size 2 and stride 1 is utilized. For the LSTM model, the number of hidden layers, the number of hidden units in each layer, and the dropout value in each layer are assumed to be 1, 120, and 0.5, respectively. Regarding the MLP model, the number of feedforward layers is three, while the training function is scaled conjugate gradient. The number of neurons in the first, second, and third layers is 3, 5, 10, respectively. It shall be noted that the maximum number of training iterations for the prediction models is 200. The time series plot of the reported and forecasted data is illustrated in Fig. 10 . An excellent agreement is observed between the forecasted results of the LSTM network (i.e., 97,396 cases) and the reported official data (i.e., 97,237 cases) on 22 August 2020.",

The application of artificial intelligence-based methods has been emphasized as an alternative for clinical methods to model the spread of this infectious disease. This intelligent method could reduce the burden on healthcare systems and revive the economic sector. This research applied two deep learning models to predict the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt. These models were the long short-term memory network (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The models were trained and tested using 90 % and 10 % of the data reported by the Egyptian ministry of health and population from 14 February to 15 August 2020. The trained models were applied to forecast the total number of infections for one week ahead. The forecasting performance of these models was assessed against that of multilayer perceptron (MLP) using determination coefficient (R 2 ) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The LSTM model obtained an R 2 value of 9.999E-01, higher than that of CNN and MLP models by 0.017 % and 0.19 %, respectively. Furthermore, it obtained an RMSE value of 436.06, less than that of CNN and MLP models by 47.06 % and 76.65 %, respectively.

Therefore, the LSTM model outperformed the remaining deep learning and machine learning models for one week and one month-ahead forecasting.

It is worth mentioning that the reliability of the provided results relies on data quality because under-testing could lead to fewer reported cases and more forecasting errors. Besides, the performance of the models is limited to the presence of noise in the daily data. In such cases, it is recommended to apply the moving average technique for smoothing out variations and separating noise from trends in time series data. However, this research could help researchers, public health officials, and policymakers forecast and track the COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt. Obtaining accurate predictions will improve the resilience ability of the society against COVID-19 disease. The resilience strategy cannot prevent external events from jeopardizing the health system.
