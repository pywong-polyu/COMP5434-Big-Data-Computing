More than 90% of sick and deceased patients belong to the category of older adults (65 years and older). This category of the population is most vulnerable to infectious diseases, so vaccination is the most effective preventive strategy, the need for which for older adults is indisputable. Here we briefly summarize information about age-related changes in the immune system and present current data on their impact on the formation of the immune response to vaccination. Older age is accompanied by the process of biological aging accompanied by involution of the immune system with increased susceptibility to infections and a decrease in the effect of immunization. Therefore, in the ongoing mass COVID-19 vaccination, the older adults are a growing public health concern. The authors provide an overview of the various types of COVID-19 vaccines approved for mass immunization of the population by the end of 2020, including older adults, as well as an overview of strategies and platforms to improve the effectiveness of vaccination of this population. In the final part, the authors propose for discussion a system for assessing the safety and monitoring the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for the older adults.",

With an increase in the general inflammatory status, due to increased activation of cytokine secretion, a weakened immune response to vaccination in older adults is associated, which leads to obvious problems in the development of a vaccine in this age group of the population [23] .",

In recent years, it became known that these cells are actively involved in regulating the immune system's effector link, synthesizing and secreting a wide range of cytokines and chemokines [37, 38] . Besides, neutrophils' phenotypic plasticity allows them to express functional MHC-II molecules and, possibly, functional T-cell receptors, which mediates deep functional connections of PNL with the main components of adaptive immunity [39] [40] [41] . An example of the most pronounced processes of immune aging are age-related changes in the phenotype and subpopulations, as well as a decrease in the activity of natural killer (NKs) cells [23, 25, 26] . These cells are designed to recognize as well as direct and rapid MHC-independent destruction of infected and cancer cells by releasing perforin and granzymes [24] [25] [26] . With age, NKs show a significant decrease in their functionality, including cytotoxicity and cytokine production [23, 26] , which may alter the expected response to vaccines in the older adults [23, 26, 27] (Table 1) .",

In this regard, in recent years, there has been an active search for strategies to improve the effectiveness of vaccination, which depends, in particular, on i) the type of vaccines used, the content of antigen, adjuvant, dosage and ii) the schedule of vaccination, the method and place of administration of the vaccine. Of course, the effectiveness of vaccination will depend on the individual characteristics of the patient [127, 129] .",
