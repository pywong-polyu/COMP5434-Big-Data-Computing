Therefore, in this pandemic, thoracic surgeons must make their patient rounds with greater caution to distinguish infection from noninfectious symptoms, perhaps to assume infection by default. As a result of our experiences, we have provided hospitalized patients with a daily self-checking form to record possible symptoms with onset, duration, severity, and dynamic changes to help early detection of infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Case fatality in this study was significantly associated with resected lung segments (!5), severity of postoperative hypoproteinemia or hypoalbuminemia, and peak value of lactate dehydrogenase. We cannot determine causality, nor control for other factors, including comorbidities and surgery. Case ID 1 with a smoking index of 1600 had an asymptomatic period for 3 weeks and had onset of fever within 12 hours after operation. Whether this was due to a long period of incubation (known to be up to 24 days) or exacerbated by the stress of the surgical procedure cannot be assessed. Case ID 2 had history of colon cancer, marginal pulmonary function test (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 1.39 L/s, forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity 70.1%), and a smoking index of 1600. Case ID 3 had arterial hypertension (stage I, high risk), left ventricular dilatation (ejection fraction: 63%), and coronary artery atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease reporting and data system 1). Of the 3 fatal cases, matched analysis over a much larger sample size is required to answer whether surgery or types of surgery increase morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. We observed leukocytosis with lymphopenia in 10 cases and leukopenia in 2 cases (18.2%), which differs from previously reported COVID-19 cases with an incidence of 5.9%, 33.7%, and 70%, respectively. 9 Leukocytosis after major surgeries is physiological in the early postoperative period, and in other postoperative settings, lymphopenia can occur in 22% to 35.6% patients within 7 days. 10, 11 Thoracic surgery is also associated with lymphocyte reduction. 12 These nonspecific postoperative laboratory changes make detection of infection on these parameters alone extremely challenging. Nonetheless, persisting abnormal white cell counts for more than 1 week is infrequent postoperatively but is common in this case series of COVID-19. In addition, we observed an impressive reduction of lymphocyte and eosinophil counts in all cases, suggesting their prognostic value should be explored in future studies with larger sample sizes. In this case series, the average time from symptom onset to rt-PCR-confirmed diagnosis was about 2 weeks, a time frame unsuitable for hospital practice, which is highly dependent on rapid diagnosis and isolation of cases in hospitalized patients for infection control. Serum antibody detection has better reported sensitivity (88.66%) and specificity (90.63%) 13 ; however, the time to their detection remains uncertain. We know that immunoglobulin M became detectable 3 to 6 days after severe acute respiratory syndrome infection, 14 and if this is similar in the case of COVID-19 such delays will remain challenging in the hospital setting.
