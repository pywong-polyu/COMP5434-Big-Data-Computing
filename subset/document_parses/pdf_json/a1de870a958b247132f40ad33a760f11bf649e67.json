However, the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy are restrictive for losing weight. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) was developed as a new therapy, picking the best of both medication and surgery, less invasive and more effective. Recently, ESG is gradually spreading in Western countries, but there is Case report doesn't need conclusion/result for Japanese patients. We herein reported the first clinical case of ESG in Japan. Given the situation of the pandemic of COVID-19, we could not invite a proctor from Western countries and receive the instruction of the device setting and maneuver face to face. Thus, we conducted the training for device setting, maneuver, and operation under a web-based international remote collaboration. Eventually, we completed ESG without an adverse event. We could prove this web-based proctor system was useful through the introduction of ESG in Japan. The international remote collaboration could become a new normal even in the endoscopy field post-COVID-19 era.",

Widespread application has been limited to less than 2% of the eligible population due to costs, morbidity, and mortality associated with GIWLS procedures. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) was reported in 2013. 3 This peroral flexible endoscopic procedure avoids the need for skin incision and permanent alteration of the upper GI tract notably with significantly fewer serious adverse events. 4 Recently long-term outcomes were reported, with mean total body weight loss maintained at 15.9% over 5 years. 5 ESG has positioned itself in Western countries as a bridge between highly invasive surgical and standard medical treatment. ESG has just started in East Asia. Our plan is to introduce ESG in Japan through a clinical trial examining safety and efficacy. We planned to preliminarily conduct supervised ex vivo and in vivo animal training with the requisite endoscopic suturing system (OverStitch Sx; Apollo Endosurgery, TX, USA) to master full-thickness suturing and the ESG technique. We planned for ESG to be done in the presence of an expert proctor.",

The setup and performance of this device differed compared to our earlier experience with the OverStitch Gen 2 device requiring a dual-channel therapeutic Olympus endoscope. 3 Initially, we planned to invite a western endoscopist with expertise in ESG and learn the newer device use and nuances. The first clinical case was to be done under real-time supervision by the same proctor. However, these plans were thwarted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We then decided on remote instruction and clinical proctoring. GoToMeeting (LogMeIn, Inc. Boston, MA, USA) and Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc, San Jose, CA, USA) provided remote collaboration. Video imaging transmitted included endoscopic imaging, endoscopist physical actions, and procedure room activity.

Unique to this case, the patient was prepped for laparoscopy to inspect the stomach and surrounding structures after completion of the ESG. A 20 mm diameter overtube (20 double slim 16406) was inserted into the esophagus. Cautery markings were placed on the anterior and posterior wall by an endoscopic submucosal dissection knife (Dual knife; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) from the incisura proximally, short of the fundus, to target the placement of the stitches creating each of the individually stacked plications. Plications were created beginning at the incisura and stopping before the fundus. Stitches were placed using a pattern beginning at the mid anterior wall to the greater curvature, then a mid-posterior wall, back to the greater curvature, and finally the anterior wall. 7 Additional in-line stitches were placed approximately 1 cm after the first anterior wall stitch and posterior wall stitch to foreshorten the stomach. Seven stitches were placed for each plication using this suturing pattern. Four plications were created with four sutures. Two additional sutures were placed with three stitches (anterior, greater ",

On the other hand, there has been no reported experience with ESG from East Asia. This may be due to the low incidence of obesity as reflected by the number of GIWLS in Asia, fewer than in Western countries. 8 GIWLS is a highly invasive treatment for obesity. LSG is covered by insurance for patients with a BMI of more than 35 kg/m 2 in Japan. It is difficult to offer GIWLS for obese patients below a BMI of 35 kg/m 2 due to the extensiveness of the surgery. Asian patients can develop metabolic syndrome when only overweight with a BMI of less than 25 kg/m 2 . 9 ESG is appealing for these lower BMI patient groups offering greater effectiveness over medication and less invasive than GIWLS with significantly lesser risk for serious adverse events. 4 Given these considerations, there are many potential patients suitable for ESG in Asian countries. Once the overweight and the obese patient develops metabolic syndrome, there is a commitment to life-long medication use with surrounding tissues, including compliance. The cost for lifelong pharmacotherapy for single and multiple comorbidities is significant and puts pressure on providing public financing. ESG offers an opportunity to reduce these medical expenses. For these reasons, we advocate including patients in Asia with a BMI of less than 35 kg/m 2 as candidates for ESG. It is important to acknowledge the value to intervene in these patients before the metabolic syndrome has developed. Accordingly, we targeted this ESG trial for patients with a BMI of more than 32 kg/m 2 .",

The restrictions imposed for the proctor in observing the flow of activity within the procedure room, including responding to procedure room personnel questions may have some subtle downsides.
