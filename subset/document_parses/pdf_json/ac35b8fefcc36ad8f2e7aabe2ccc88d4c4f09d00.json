We compared the mutational spectrum in the new SARS-CoV-2 mutation dataset with the previously published mutation spectrum in hypermutated genomes of rubella-another positive single stranded (ss) RNA virus. Each of the rubella virus isolates arose by accumulation of hundreds of mutations during propagation in a single subject, while SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum represents a collection events in multiple virus isolates from individuals across the world. We found a clear similarity between the spectra of single base substitutions in rubella and in SARS-CoV-2, with C to U as well as A to G and U to C being the most prominent in plus strand genomic RNA of each virus. Of those, U to C changes universally showed preference for loops versus stems in predicted RNA secondary structure. Similarly, to what was previously reported for rubella virus, C to U changes showed enrichment in the uCn motif, which suggested a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminase being a source of these substitutions. We also found enrichment of several other trinucleotide-centered mutation motifs only in SARS-CoV-2-likely indicative of a mutation process characteristic to this virus. Altogether, the results of this analysis suggest that the mutation mechanisms that lead to hypermutation of the rubella vaccine virus in a rare pathological condition may also operate in the background of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently propagating in the human population.",

Errors source of mutations, however in coronaviruses some of these errors can be corrected by a proofreading RNA exonuclease ExoN [3, 4] . Another source of mutations comes from RNA base editing by two classes of endogenous enzymes: adenine deaminases (ADAR) and cytosine deaminases APOBECs (APOlipoprotein B mRNA Editing Complex like polypeptides) which have a broad range of functions spanning from site-specific editing of cellular mRNAs to inhibiting viral and retrotransposon proliferation [5] [6] [7] . ADARs (ADAR1 and ADAR2) are double-strand (ds) RNA-specific enzymes converting adenine to inosine (A to I). Since inosine pairs with cytosine, this will result in A to G changes after the next round of replication. The preference of ADARs for certain deamination motifs -reflecting a combination of immediate nucleotide context and the anticipated dsRNA formed by folding-was assessed for in vitro editing of several RNA substrates. Based on these data, software was developed aimed to assign predictive ADAR deamination scores to any A position in a given RNA molecule [8] . The ADAR editing sites that were deduced in RNAs of cultured stimulated immune cells [9] agreed with the preferences defined in the in vitro study. It remains to be established whether these preferences would hold for a wide variety of RNA substrates in conditions of controlled in vivo expression of either ADAR1 or ADAR2.",

At least two APOBECs, APOBEC1 and APOBEC3A are capable of deaminating cytosine to uracil in RNA, however an RNA editing capacity of other APOBECs cannot be excluded [10] [11] [12] [13] . Cytosine deamination in RNA creates the normal RNA base-uracil, which can be then accurately copied in subsequent rounds of RNA replication. DNA deamination motifs or mutation signatures (i.e., the immediate nucleotide contexts around deaminated Cs) of several human APOBECs were first defined in model microbial systems and then found in genomic DNAs of human cancers, where they can cause hypermutation clusters [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The preferred DNA deamination motif of APOBEC3G (A3G) is nCc to nTc (n = any base; the mutated nucleotide and the resulting nucleotide are capitalized). Other APOBECs show preference for the tCn to tTn deamination motif or to a more stringently defined trinucleotide. For example, both APOBEC3A (A3A) and APOBEC3B (A3B) prefer tCa as a target, both in the yeast model and in human cancers [15] .",

            "text": "An indication of frequent RNA editing was recently found in the isolates of the hypermutated plus-strand ssRNA rubella vaccine virus from cutaneous granulomas of children with primary immunodeficiencies [20] . Altogether, genomes of six independent isolates of the hypermutated vaccine-derived viruses contained 993 mutations. Most changes were C to U in the genomic plus-strand RNA. These C to U changes showed high enrichment of a uCa to uUa RNA editing motif-a match to the characteristic A3A or A3B mutagenic motif in DNA. While the similarity between the C to U RNA editing motif in rubella virus and the DNA editing motifs strongly suggested the nature of the editing enzyme, signature motifs of APOBEC cytosine deamination in RNA are yet to be confirmed in a direct study involving expression of an APOBEC enzyme and collection of in vivo-editing spectrum data. The second most prevalent type of editing event was A to G change in the rubella plus or minus-strand, revealed as either U to C or G to A changes in the reported plus-strand sequence, respectively. These changes would be expected to result from ADAR editing. Minus-strand RNA in rubella virus as well as in Coronaviridae would often exist within completely-or partially double-stranded RNA [21, 22] , which would be the right substrate for an ADAR. This strand is a template for the multiple rounds of transcription generating many plus-strand partial-or full-size genomic RNAs. Thus, an A to G editing event in the minus-strand of dsRNA at the beginning of replication cycle would be carried as a U to C change to multiple rubella virus genomes. A to G editing events in the plus-strand of the dsRNA intermediate may directly contribute to the mutation spectrum in plus-strand viral genomes or propagate the mutation via the subsequent rounds of replication within the same cell. Besides ADAR editing, U to C (or complementary A to G) changes can result from uracil modifications by enzymes normally acting on specific uracils in tRNAs [23, 24] In summary, the previous analysis of the mutation spectrum and mutational signatures of hypermutated rubella virus genomes provided a strong indication of hyperediting by APOBEC cytidine deaminases as well as suggested editing by ADAR adenine deaminases [20] . Both rubella and Coroniviridae are positive ssRNA viruses which produce many copies of the genomic positive RNA strand and also have dsRNA intermediates in their replication cycles [21, 22, 25] , which can serve as substrates for APOBECs and for ADARs, respectively. Indeed, recent analyses suggested APOBEC and ADAR editing in SARS-CoV-2 based on an excess of C to U changes and A to G in sequencing reads from lavages of two COVID-19 patients or in genome alignments [26, 27] . Based on the similarity between the preferred RNA editing motifs in rubella virus and the APOBEC DNA hypermutation motifs, we sought to determine whether similar mutational signature motifs can be detected in a collection of 32,341 whole genome sequences of multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates that have been sequenced during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We present here the evidence indicating a similarity between the RNA editing spectra and mutational signatures between the hypermutated rubella virus isolates and the load of editing changes accumulated in this collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We also found several new trinucleotide-centered mutational motifs unique to SARS-CoV-2.",

Thus, in order to correct for the latter, we calculated densities of each of twelve possible base substitutions in each SARS-CoV-2 and rubella MAFs, dividing a base substitution count by the number of the mutated base in the reference sequence. We then assessed similarity of base substitution densities distributions between rubella virus and each of SARS-CoV-2 filtered MAF using non-parametric Spearman correlation with the null hypothesis that, there is no positive correlation between spectra in rubella and SARS-CoV-2.",

For that purpose, we obtained the viral genome FASTA files and processed them to obtain unique mutation calls and the mutation signatures as outlined in Fig 1. 32,341 FASTA files were downloaded from the GISAID Initiative [34] web site (https:// www.gisaid.org/) on 06/22/2020, each containing a consensus whole genome-sequence of a SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated from a human subject and sequenced at high coverage. Based on the published analysis of the GISAID data for a subset of around 4000 of SARS-CoV-2 isolates across the world performed with the use of the Nextstrain package ( [35] and https://nextstrain. org/ncov/global?l=clock), an average lineage of SARS-CoV-2 virus successfully transmitted from one subject to another would accumulate approximately 22 base substitutions per year (12-13 base substitutions for the period of December-June, 2020); a similar estimate was also obtained in [36] ). The final FASTA sequence files of the individual isolates in GISAID represent a consensus derived from high coverage sequencing reads and contain information about the mutations present with high frequency in a sequenced viral isolate and therefore belong to viral particles capable of proliferation. We aligned each sequence against the sequence of presumably the earliest isolate of a SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512. 2) and listed each change in a separate row of a mutation annotation file (MAF) Fig 1 and S1A Table. We annotated each of 251,273 mutation events in each isolate by surrounding +/-20 nucleotides of genomic context around position of each mutation, by location in one or in several overlapping ORFs, by potential amino acid change or protein truncation effect, as well as by location of a change in self complementary area (predicted stem) or outside of such area (predicted loop) in plusstrand genomic RNA. Many independent isolates could have originated from the already mutated virus spreading the same mutation(s) into genomes of multiple (up to thousands) downstream isolates (see column \"times_refPos_mutated_inMAF\" in S1A Table) . Therefore, we also annotated each mutation in a sample by the number of different samples in which such a mutation was found. Since each genome of an individual isolate contained only few mutations and many of these mutations were identical in multiple isolates, we built our analysis to evaluate the overall spectrum of non-redundant mutation events that have accumulated in the human population through the current pandemic rather than the mutation spectra in ",

The first group contained a pooled non-redundant set with no duplicates (NoDups) that listed each individual mutation only once regardless of how many isolates contained the same mutation (total 12,156 mutation events). While the individual isolates are not listed in this group any more, it contains a set of distinct events most closely representing the spectrum of unrelated mutation events rather than a complex downstream process of distributing mutant forms in human population. However, even in the NoDups list (S2C Table) the base substitutions in many positions could be under positive or negative selection, which could skew the spectrum of the observed changes from the mechanistic mutation spectrum that accurately reflects the underlying mutagenic processes. Therefore, we subdivided this group based on whether the changes yielded functional effects in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Non-synonymous amino acid changes and changes introducing or removing stop codons were designated as functional (Func), while synonymous changes or changes outside ORFs were designated and non-functional (NonFunc). The content of NoDupsNonFunc group (S2A Table) would be the least affected by functional selection and thus, most accurately represent the impact of unconstrained mutational processes operating on the viral genome. While this group is smaller, it still contains a sufficient number of changes (4,740 mutation events) for detecting trends in the mutational patterns. The mutation spectrum of 7,416 NoDupsFunc events (S2B Table) was also analyzed. Each of the three SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectra was compared to the combined mutation spectrum (993 base substitutions) from six independent isolates originated from the hypermutated rubella-vaccine virus [20] (S3A Table) . Unlike many SARS-CoV-2 isolates, where individual mutated event could be carried from one isolate to another, each rubella virus isolate contained mutations that had occurred independently from the vaccine virus in each subject. Thus, the total of the mutational events in six rubella isolates was, at least in part, representative of the mutation spectrum. However, mutation spectra in each rubella isolate may represent an unknown level of selection. Indeed, a number of mutations was observed in more than one rubella virus isolate (see column \"times_refPos_mu-tated_inMAF\" in S3A Table) . Some level of selection was also indicated by analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in each codon [20] . Therefore, we made separate comparisons of the rubella virus mutation spectra with each of the three SARS-CoV-2 nonredundant MAFs (Fig 1) : the non-duplicated mutation events (NoDups), and its two subsetsthe non-duplicated mutation events with potential of functional significance (NoDupsFunc) and the non-duplicated non-functional mutation events (NoDupsNonFunc).",

It is well established that several mechanisms of mutagenesis in DNA of tumors and normal cells can have not only distinctive base substitutions spectra but also diagnostic preference for trinucleotide mutation motifs [30, 40, 41] . Currently there is very little information about motif preference in RNA editing or mutagenesis. Therefore, we assessed enrichment using all possible 192 trinucleotide mutation motifs (96 in plus and 96 in minus RNA strand) of each virus. Enrichment values for each motif were calculated based on counts of mutations in a motif normalized for the motif content in the genomic background (see Methods). Statistical evaluation of enrichments showed significance for several motifs even after FDR<0.05 correction to individual P-values was applied (S6A-S6C Table) . However, base substitutions for the most-enriched motifs were present in low numbers, so these results require validation in independent studies (also see Discussion). Therefore, we concentrated on the motifs representing the most abundant types of base substitutions present in both viruses, i.e., on the C to U and their complement G to A, as well as U to C and their complement A to G changes. For statistically-significant enriched trinucleotide motifs containing one of these four base substitutions, we calculated the minimum estimates of mutation load (MutLoad) that can be assigned to mechanism(s) with preference for a significantly enriched motif (Fig 4, S6A -S6D Table and Materials and methods).",

Analysis of A to G and U to C substitutions consistent with the biochemical specificity of ADARs did not reveal any preference for mutagenesis in loops versus stem regions. ADARs are known to act on dsRNA substrates. Thus, if ADARs did in fact contribute to induction of these substitutions, they should be acting on a dsRNA form, wherein we do not expect RNA to fold into secondary structures. We also found in SARS-CoV-2, but not in rubella, statistically significant enrichment of the nAu to nGu mutations along with its reverse complement aUn to aCn. While these could reflect adenine deamination by one of the ADARs in either strand of a dsRNA intermediate, these motifs are different from the motif preference revealed by in vitro editing of artificial dsRNA substrate [8] . Also, there was no increase in ADAR scores in the SARS-CoV-2 A to G or U to C mutations (S1 Fig and S1 Data) , thus indicating that ADARs may not be the primary source of these changes. If A to G or U to C changes are really stemming from ADAR activity, it is possible that these enriched motifs are preferred by ADARs in SARS-CoV-2 but not in RNA substrates used to generate the editing consensus in [8] . Alternatively, A to G and U to C changes could be caused by one or more mechanisms unconnected to ADARs.",

Agnostic analysis of enrichments in all 192 possible trinucleotide mutation motifs highlighted statistically significant excess of uCa to uUa motif in rubella, however these changes were not prevalent in SARS-CoV-2. Mutations in plus-strands of both viruses showed statistically significant enrichments with uCg to uUg and uCu to uUu motifs (Fig 4A and 4B ). These motifs belong to a group uCn to uUn (tCn to tTn in DNA) which is characteristic of several APOBEC cytidine deaminases ( [15] and references therein). We note that although these signatures were enriched in the non-functional mutations (NoDupsNonFunc), they did not pass the 0.05 FDR threshold in filtered datasets that included mutations with potential functional effects (NoDupsFunc). These differences in the mutation signatures between SARS-CoV-2 and rubella may be due to different APOBEC family members performing editing or due to the confounding presence of other sources of C to U mutagenesis, such as spontaneous cytosine deamination that frequently occurs in ssDNA [44] or oxidative mutagenesis capable of generating C to T mutations in ssDNA in vivo [45, 46] . In support of the role of oxidative damage in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, is the increased prevalence of G to U substitutions which is consistent with the oxidation of guanines in the RNA plus-strand (Fig 2) . G to U changes could be caused by an increased level of oxidative damage generating 8-oxoG in viral RNA within cells or during sequencing library preparation [47, 48] . Frequent copying of 8-oxoG with A, would show up as G to U changes in the strand, where 8-oxoG was present. However, since we analyze the consensus sequences of the viral genomes and not individual reads, errors during library preparation would most likely be filtered out and would not be represented in the viral genome sequence. We also note that the recent study [27] indicated the overall low chance of sequencing errors reflected in SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences in the dataset analyzed in that work.",

There were two more groups of trinucleotide mutation motifs involving C to U (and complementary G to A) substitutions in plus RNA strand specifically enriched for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4A and 4B) . The aCn to aUn (reverse complement nGu to nAu) group of motifs may represent a preference previously unknown for APOBECs in RNA or just a mutagenic mechanism yet to be defined. The cGn to cAn group of motifs seen in the plus-strand may be in fact due to mutations of the reverse complement motif nCg to nUg in the minus-strand. nCg to nTg (CpG to TpG) germline and somatic mutagenesis is universally present in DNA of species with 5-methylcytosine and is generated by systems specialized to mutagenesis in methylated CpG sequences. However various studies have demonstrated that CpG to TpG mutagenesis can occur independent of cytosine methylation [49, 50] . Several studies have shown that CpG dinucleotides are depleted in the genomes of SARS viruses indicating functional selection and/ or increased frequency of cytosine deamination in these viral genomes [51-54]. Our study shows with high statistical confidence that nCg to nUg (CpG to UpG) mutagenesis in the minus strand is enriched (Fig 4B) supporting the role of nCg-(CpG)-specific cytosine deamination in minus RNA strand in SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutagenesis.",

            "text": "In summary, comparison of base substitution spectra and signatures between hypermutated rubella virus isolates and the SARS-CoV-2 multi-genome dataset demonstrates both similarities and differences in the mutational processes active upon the two plus-strand RNA viruses. It is important to understand the mechanisms that contribute to mutagenesis of viral genomes, since hypermutation of even inactivated rubella vaccine virus was shown to generate reactivated viral particles [20] . We demonstrate here that the APOBEC-specific uCa to uUa changes that are highly enriched in hypermutated rubella, are much less prevalent in SARS-CoV-2. We propose that assessment of uCa to uUa signature in viral genomes can provide insights into the potential hypermutation risk of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, understanding the genomic mutational patterns is important for predicting virus evolution. Our study has highlighted several distinct features of SARS-CoV-2 mutational spectrum that, after validation with independent dataset(s) can be used to build predictive models for this and related SARS viruses.
