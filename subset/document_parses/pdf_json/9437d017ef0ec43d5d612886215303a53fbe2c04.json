            "text": "Purpose Pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) confers a substantial financial burden onto patients' families. In addition to high direct medical costs, HSCTs typically require at least one caregiver to take time away from work or other responsibilities, often leading to reduced household income. Using mixed methods, we sought to understand the impact of pediatric HSCT on caregiver employment and financial need. Methods We surveyed caregivers of living pediatric patients who underwent HSCT at one of two southeastern transplant centers between 2012 and 2018 (N = 95). We then interviewed a subset of caregivers (N = 18) to understand whether and how employment disruption contributed to financial distress. Results Among caregivers surveyed, the majority of household wage earners changed their work schedules to attend medical appointments and missed workdays. This resulted in income loss for 87% of families, with 31% experiencing an income reduction of over 50%. Qualitative interviews pointed to four emergent themes: (1) employment disruption exacerbated existing financial challenges; (2) parental division of labor between caregiving and providing financially led to heightened psychological distress; (3) existing employment leave and protection resources were essential but not sufficient; and (4) the ability to work remotely and having a supportive employer facilitated employment maintenance throughout the HSCT process. Conclusion Expanded employment protections and access to accommodations are needed to limit the impact of HSCT on household income, health insurance, and financial hardship. Additionally, interventions are needed to ensure caregivers are equipped with the information necessary to navigate conversations with employers and prepare for the financial and psychological reality of employment disruption.",

Potentially curative, HSCT is a medically intensive process, with direct medical costs for pediatric allogeneic and autologous transplants averaging $585,300 and $244,337, respectively, at 100-day follow-up [2] . As healthcare costs are increasingly passed to insured patients [3] , pediatric HSCTs can confer a substantial financial burden onto families [4] . Additionally, HSCTs require prolonged hospitalizations, ranging from a mean of 26 days for autologous to 54 days for allogeneic transplants [2] , which often require caregivers to take time away from work [4, 5] . Further, following patient discharge, caregivers must manage intensive outpatient follow-up care [6, 7] . Though the extent of employment disruption may depend on employment type and accommodations [8] [9] [10] , it is consistently associated with financial and psychological burden among caregivers of adults with cancer and other chronic illnesses [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

To date, a single study has described the experience of financial hardship, or financial toxicity, among families of pediatric HSCT recipients during the first year post-transplant [4] . While this study found that substantial income loss (> 40%) was a primary contributor to financial distress, it used percent of annual income lost as the sole indicator of employment disruption. To comprehensively describe the long-term and nuanced impact of employment disruption on financial toxicity in this population, we conducted a mixed methods analysis of caregivers of children who underwent allogeneic or autologous HSCT in the prior 2 to 8 years.",

Eligible participants were caregivers of pediatric HSCT recipients (< 18 years of age at the time of transplant) who underwent allogeneic or autologous HSCT between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2018, at one of two Southeastern academic medical centers. Despite these transplant centers being located in adjacent cities, the programs differ in terms of transplant center size and the patient populations served, resulting in a cohort of participants from diverse backgrounds and experiences. We excluded caregivers of deceased patients or patients residing outside of the USA. Caregiver contact information and patient clinical information (e.g., HSCT date) were collected from patients' electronic health records. Of the 260 caregivers approached for the study, 38% completed the survey electronically (N = 49) or by phone (N = 50). Four participants were excluded due to not responding to the employment section of the survey for a final sample of N = 95 and a response rate of 36.5%. Clinical characteristics (i.e., sex, HSCT type, HSCT year, diagnosis, graft versus host disease) of patients did not differ between respondents and nonrespondents based on nonsignificant (p > 0.05) chi-squared test results. The institutional review boards at both institutions approved the study (UNC-CH IRB#19-0490).",

Substantial employment disruption has also been previously reported among working-age caregivers of dependent pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer [31] [32] [33] . Consistent among this and prior studies is the association between employment disruption and financial burden [4, 31, 34] , which has also been documented extensively in the adult cancer and HSCT populations [35, 36] . This suggests the need for comprehensive solutions addressing the employment challenges faced by all caregivers in their productive working years, regardless of the patient's diagnosis or treatment regimen.

Additionally, 12 weeks may not be sufficient to accommodate the prolonged hospitalization and intensive outpatient follow-up care associated with HSCT. Workplace accommodations, such as flexible scheduling arrangements and remote work, were identified in our analysis as critical to balancing employment and caregiving responsibilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which grants reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities, does not apply to caregivers [10, 42] . Policies are needed to ensure caregivers, particularly caregivers of pediatric patients undergoing intensive procedures such as HSCT, have equitable access to workplace accommodations and protections [43] .

To our knowledge, no hospital-based interventions addressing the employment and financial needs of pediatric HSCT caregivers have been developed to date. However, several evidence-based interventions, specifically web-based applications, have been developed to provide HSCT caregivers with real-time patient-specific clinical information during the transplant period [44, 45] .

This may have imposed selection bias if caregivers responding to the survey experienced more extreme financial and employment disruption. However, it is also possible that caregivers experiencing severe financial consequences post-transplant did not have the capacity to complete the survey, thus biasing results in the opposite direction. Furthermore, data collection occurred during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which may have also contributed to our relatively low survey response rate. Second, results are subject to recall bias, given that we included caregivers of patients who were between 2 and 8 years post-HSCT. This was necessitated, however, by our belief in the importance of capturing the long-term impacts of HSCT on employment and finances. Lastly, this mixed methods analysis was descriptive in nature and did not examine predictors of employment disruption.
