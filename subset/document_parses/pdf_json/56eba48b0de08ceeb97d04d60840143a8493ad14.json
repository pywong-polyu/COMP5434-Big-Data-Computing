While a large and growing body of research has demonstrated that conventional drugs such as Dexamethasone and Ribavirin are partly effective, therapies using biologic agents for COVID-19 are not briefly mentioned. For this reason, the current review focuses mainly on different treatment strategies using a variety of biological agents based on clinical trials registered on the clinicaltrials.gov. Given that a huge effort is being put in the development of biological agents, we will briefly summarize our understanding of such agents as well as comment on their pros and cons for the management of COVID-19. Acknowledging multiple aspects of some therapeutic agents, this review also addresses their potential immuno-pathological complications in COVID-19 infection control for the development of more safe and effective biological therapies. In addition, several therapeutic drugs that are not biologic but closely related to the biological signaling cascade such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor and Rapamycin are also discussed and included to this review.",

In order to get the latest research information from NIH, we recently performed a search at the clinicaltrials.gov in the present article. We used the key search terms \"COVID-19\", \"antibody/immunoglobulin\", \"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)\", \"cytokine\", \"growth factor\", \"antagonist/agonist/inhibitor\", \"mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR)\" and \"complement\" and, after selection, comprehensively enumerated the total of 317 clinical investigations worldwide registered on the clinicaltrials.gov through February 28, 2021 (Table 1 ). The eligibility criteria for considering a clinical trial included in this review belong to the following categories: a ClinicalTrials Identifier number; the number of participants; a time period; the participants' clinical condition/disease; the nature of intervention/ treatment, contact and location. We roughly categorized the selected investigations into anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies (282 trials) and therapeutic repair (35 trials) according to the biological agents that are currently being explored. Some of the mentioned therapeutic agents can be ascribed to any of these categories such as JAK inhibitor. Indeed, the issue of separating biological processes is challenging due to the multifaceted roles of these cytokines and growth factors that have been implied within different contexts. We analyzed and assessed their therapeutic potentials and challenges for the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. Importantly, it would be to quickly determine whether these biological agents are safe and effective in clinical trials. Expectedly, patients with COVID-19 would come forward to take these agents early if clinical data suggest these biologics may be promising.",

Therefore, targeting cytokine-associated signaling pathway for mitigation of the hyper-inflammatory state could be a therapeutic strategy. Currently, there are certain clinical data available using cytokine antagonists with biological agents for the treatment of COVID-19. One small openlabel study has reported that targeting the inflammatory cascade with Anakinra, a recombinant form of IL-1 receptor antagonist, is a safe and effective approach for the treatment of the moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. 6 Another open-label and randomized clinical trial demonstrates that Anakinra does not improve outcomes in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. 7 Interestingly, one trial (NCT04148430) conducted by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, is underway to determine whether Anakinra ",

First, CP collected from COVID-19 convalescent patients contains a variety of blood-derived components, including nonprotective antibodies/immunoglobulins, complements, clotting factors, cytokines and growth factors, in addition to a large quantity of neutralizing antibodies. 26 Second, considering that the mutated virus is able to escape the one type of antibody therapy, the emergence of resistant SARS-CoV-2 mutations that may diminish the therapeutic efficacy of neutralizing antibodies needs further attention for the effective treatment options. Third, a potential risk during CP therapy has to be alert on the antibody-dependent enhancement due to cross-reactive antibody responses between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. 27, 28 Indeed, non-neutralizing antibodies can also bind to the spike glycoprotein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 to promote virus uptake into host cells via angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-mediated viral fusion. Fourth, another potential risk is the transfusion immunoglobulin-related acute lung injury, a severe adverse effect of high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin, with high mortality. 29 Finally, there still exists a potential risk during preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins that needs for viral pathogens inactivation for the safer products. Therefore, CP therapy has safety concerns that still remain under debate.",

IVIG immunotherapy has been supposed as an efficacious adjuvant with other antiviral drugs in the treatment of COVID-19. 30,31 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and enriched immunoglobulins from CP have important advantages over the CP. Currently, fifty-nine clinical trials using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulins are being performed in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. Among these, two clinical studies are exemplified as representing new immunotherapeutic approaches. One study (NCT04342195) conducted by Columbia University, New York, is still ongoing to utilize blood specimens from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection for isolation of specific monoclonal antibodies from human B cells to potently neutralize the SARS-CoV-2. Purified antibodies will be further assessed using neutralization assays to determine the therapeutic potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2. Another one (NCT04354766) has been conducting to generate human monoclonal antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 from convalescent patients and antibody Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2021:15 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress neutralizing capacities would be evaluated among the COVID-19 convalescent donors. Double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP), an extracorporeal blood purification technique to reduce hepatitis C viral RNA, is also used to efficiently collect antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent patients (NCT04346589 and NCT04418531).

Antibody cocktail approaches have shown substantial promise in recent in vitro and in vivo studies for preventing SARS-CoV-2 escape. 33, 34 Of special notes, one double-blind and Phase I-III trial suggests that an antibody cocktail against SARS-CoV-2 is safe and effective in an individual patient whose immune response has not yet been initiated. 35 Currently, there are eleven ongoing trials (NCT04381936, NCT04425629, NCT04426695, NCT04452318, NCT04519437, NCT04617535, NCT04634409, NCT04666441, NCT04691180, NCT04700163 and NCT04770467) using the synergistic neutralizing antibody cocktails in COVID-19 patients.",

Complement is involved in the immunomodulatory processes. Complement is also a major component of the innate immune system in host that functions to defense against bacterial and viral infection and to maintain immune homeostasis. Excessive complement activation in the lung may contribute to pathologic outcomes. 36 Gralinski et al previously observed that complement component C3 activation in the lung initiated as early as day one following SARS-CoV infection in a C3 \u2212/animal model and C3 \u2212/mice exhibited significantly less respiratory dysfunction. 37 Jiang et al reported in a previous study that the concentration of C5a was increased in sera and lung tissues in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-transgenic mice and the blockade of the C5a-C5aR axis with a specific complementary antibody alleviated lung damage. 38 Potential complement component inhibitors with biological agents are currently being tested in patients with COVID-19. One recent clinical study using the combination of an anti-C5a monoclonal antibody (Eculizumab) and a JAK1/2 inhibitor (Ruxolitinib) revealed significant improvement in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS. 39 Another recent investigation indicated Eculizumab, a well-established safety profile, combined with antiviral drugs might work as a therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. 40 These safe data collected from clinical studies will support complement inhibition therapeutic potential in treating COVID-19.",

            "text": "As aforementioned, a central unanswered question concerns the right timing of administration that is critical and needs to be determined in clinical trials. Currently, the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is becoming clearer. There are three stages of the infection's progression, as is recognized as the mild, moderate and severe symptoms in COVID-19 patients, and the optimal times for therapeutic interventions are proposed. 43 Theoretically, cytokine monoclonal antibodies/inhibitors such as JAK inhibitors might be given quickly once the COVID-19 symptoms appear. Thus, assessing clinical progression is urgently needed. Tissue repair and regeneration is a complex process involving a variety of bioactive molecules and enzymes such as VEGF and matrix metalloproteinases. 44 VEGF is known as a key vascular permeability inducer to increase pulmonary edema during infection. VEGF is also involved in the activation of coagulation pathways in severe COVID-19 probably through triggering endothelial cells to upregulate the expression of tissue factor, 45 a potent activator of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade. Therefore, VEGF is considered as a potential therapeutic target to counteract vessel-permeabilizing effect in the early onset of COVID-19 to reduce the disease severity. Yuksel et al have reported that VEGF antagonist (Bevacizumab) restores epithelial barrier dysfunction in an experimental asthma model. 46 A recent clinical study with Bevacizumab showed therapeutic efficacy by improving oxygenation and shortening oxygen-support duration in patients with severe COVID-19. 47 Likewise, Thalidomide, another angiogenesis inhibitor, has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects and is also used for treatment of COVID-19 (NCT04273529 and NCT04273581). Two recent clinical studies suggested Thalidomide combined with lowdose short-term glucocorticoid as an effective therapeutic option in patients with severe COVID-19. 48, 49 However, FDA has warned about life-threatening birth defects caused by Thalidomide and risk of blood clots. 50 VEGF, on the other hand, is essential for the vascular formation and remodeling and critical for restoration of lung homeostasis. A previous study conducted by McClendon et al showed that VEGF signaling may mediate the role of hypoxia-inducible factor in ATII cell proliferation and spreading, the critical stages necessary to restore epithelial structure and function after lung injury. 51 Thus, whether VEGF promotes lung therapeutic repair or exacerbates pulmonary edema remains controversial. The immuno-pathological complications need to be considered cautiously. In addition, four clinical trials (NCT04311697, NCT04360096, NCT04453839, and NCT04536350) describe that Aviptadil, a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, may restore barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface, thus protecting the lung from failure. Alprostadil, a PGE1 analog, is a potent vasodilator agent that increases peripheral blood flow. 52 One Phase II clinical trial (NCT04536363) is ongoing to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the administration of intravenous PGE1. Although PGE1 may cause bronchodilation and possibly decrease platelet aggregation and intrapulmonary polymorphonuclear leukocyte sequestration for antiinflammatory treatment and tissue modeling in patients with ARDS, there is an increase in the rate of significant adverse events. 53, 54 Together, while some cytokines are responsible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection to play a dual role, it is important to quickly determine whether the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Therefore, the plasticity of these therapeutic agents for treatment should be used with great caution.",

One recent single-centre prospective cohort clinical study showed that administration of Mavrilimumab, an anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, improved clinical outcomes in thirteen nonmechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation. 59 Another randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that Lenzilumab, another anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, was safe and effective for the treatment of severe COVID-19. 60 Currently, there are twelve clinical trials underway to explore a novel approach for the treatment of COVID-19 through targeting of human GM-CSF.",

To help speed the clinical research, the data collected in the present study from current clinical studies may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of the biological therapeutic agents. Recently published studies have shown that some therapeutic agents play both pathological and beneficial roles in the management of patients with COVID-19 and mixed results have also been obtained in these completed COVID-19 clinical trials ( Table 2) . We appreciate these clinical trial efforts currently underway for different aspects of COVID-19. While clinical improvement in COVID-19 is the primary outcome measure in most clinical trials of biologics, additional work needs to address safety-and efficacy-related matters in large studies for optimum clinical outcomes. The bottom line is that biological therapeutic agents appear to be safe and clinical efficacy is required more studies. We hope that more and more favorable outcomes of ongoing clinical trials are expected to be observed as quickly as possible.",

The majority of COVID-19 patients presented with progressive hyperinflammation governed by Ruxolitinib and the 4/14 patients indicated the viral clearance. During the early stage of infection, IFNs (type-I IFNs) responses are required to prevent viral replication. As the infection progresses, viruses can develop new strategies to counteract effects of IFNs by targeting JAK signaling pathway.18 Additionally, given the hypercoagulability of COVID-19, the potentially increased inherent thrombotic risk associated JAK inhibitor should be alert for the hospitalized patients with COVID-19.19 Therefore, JAK inhibitors need to be used cautiously to treat COVID-19. mTOR is involved in regulating cell metabolism, growth and proliferation, survival, and immunity. Several RNA viruses such as influenza virus, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus hijack mTOR pathway to promote their own replication.20 An integrative proteo-transcriptomics analysis is performed by Appelberg et al in SARS-CoV-2 infected human hepatocyte-derived cellular carcinoma cell line Huh7 to map the cellular responses.20 This study by Appelberg et al 20 suggests a crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 and the Akt/ mTOR/HIF-1 signaling pathway. Attractively, Akt inhibitor MK-2206 can inhibit mTOR signaling pathway, further decreasing virus production in Huh7. However, using mTOR inhibitor Sirolimus failed to block SARS-CoV-2 infection, albeit it was observed to inhibit MERS-CoV in mice.21 mTOR inhibitor targeting cell proliferation and suppression of gene expression are being tested in clinical trials. There are six clinical trials for mTOR inhibitors NCT04482712, and NCT04584710), as potential treatment options in minimizing the severity of COVID-19.",
