As a result, relatives of ICU patients are at risk of developing several psychological sequelae, such as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and complicated grief in the unfortunate event of a patient dying during ICU treatment. Clinically relevant symptoms of PTSD occur in 21% of relatives of ICU patients, especially in relatives of adult patients, clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety occur in 40% and clinically relevant symptoms of depression occur in 23%. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] These impairments are collectively referred to as the post-intensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F). 6 12 13 PICS-F frequently results in loss of employment, financial burden, lifestyle interference and a profound impact on quality of life. 14 These consequences often last a long time and already start during ICU stay of their kin. 3 Important risk factors for the development Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba A randomised controlled trial examining the effect of Intensive Care Unit-specific Virtual Reality for Family members/relatives (ICU-VR-F) on psychological well-being and quality of life using an innovative and uniform modality. \u25ba ICU-VR-F represents an easy applicable, safe and immersive modality to improve communication through better information provision regarding treatment-related and environment-related information about the ICU, enabling relatives to receive uniform and complete information. \u25ba ICU-VR-F is an innovative method that is generalisable and makes information easily accessible and immersive. \u25ba Blinding of patients or investigators is not possible due to the nature of the intervention.",

Therefore, communication between ICU staff and families is essential in the care process, and good communication and information provision improve the relatives' understanding of ICU treatment and satisfaction, limit lawsuits and are associated with lower prevalence of PTSD during ICU stay. 5 17 18 As such, good information provision to relatives of ICU patients is essential in improving the relatives' comprehension of ICU procedures and ICU environment during the ICU stay. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitals worldwide disallowed visitors for all adult inpatients including all ICU patients with COVID-19 and without COVID-19. Relatives of ICU patients during the COVID-19 pandemic are therefore confronted with the impracticality of visiting their relative in the ICU or receiving good communication from the ICU staff, which may result in a higher psychological burden. 19 20 In the face of mounting PICS-F-related sequelae, several interventions, such as information brochures, family conferences and educational programmes for relatives, have been tested, but did not result in a clinically meaningful improvement in psychological well-being or quality of life. 21 22 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the disruption of an integral aspect of care in most ICUs across the world and the importance of generalisable and on-demand information has been addressed. To date, a clinically meaningful, simple and generalisable intervention remains unavailable.",

As such, it allows relatives to experience what the patient is experiencing during ICU treatment, possibly leading to a better comprehension of an ICU stay. Information provision using VR has shown to decrease preoperative anxiety in both adult and paediatric patients, to help women and their partner to feel better prepared for caesarean delivery, to successfully deliver healthcarerelated information to adults with intellectual disabilities and to be an appropriate tool to deliver additional treatment-related information to increase patients' satisfaction.

Additionally, relatives should be able to understand the Dutch language to understand ICU-specific Virtual Reality for Family members/relatives (ICU-VR-F) and should in possession of smartphone, tablet or computer to watch ICU-VR-F at home. Multiple relatives per patient can participate; the primary contact person of the ICU patient will be approached first and will be invited to share the study information with other relatives who could be interested in participation. There is no maximum number of relatives per patient who can participate. In the case of multiple relatives of the same patient participating, relatives of the same patient will be clustered to the same randomisation allocation. Relatives with no formal address or relatives of patients with an expected ICU length of stay less than 72 hours will be excluded. Close friends are eligible for inclusion in the case that no relative is available. Close friends are considered close friends if they address themselves as close friends and are responsible for decision-making. Relatives of patients who die during ICU treatment will retrospectively be excluded from the main analysis.",

Based on focus group meetings with this team and previous studies, the following information was included in the intervention: (1) an introduction by an intensivist and an ICU nurse to welcome the relative to the ICU and VR environment explaining daily movements at an ICU, (2) explanation of monitors and noises in an ICU room, (3) information regarding mechanical ventilation, intubation and tracheal tube suction, (4) information and necessity of central/peripheral lines and intravenous/ drips, (5) information and necessity of the treatment team and ICU workflow. 31 32 The ICU-specific VR intervention was designed with the aim of showing relevant and truthful treatment-related and ICU environmentrelated information, and was hospital specific. The point of view for the camera was the field of vision of the mock patient lying in a hospital bed.

In these, all patients who have received ICU-VR-F, either both in the hospital and at home or only at home, will be compared with those who did not, and relatives of patients who have died during ICU treatment will be excluded. To determine whether there is a difference in effect between having watched ICU-VR-F the first time in the hospital and having watched the ICU-VR-F only at home, we will use dummy variables (ICU-VR-F in the hospital and at home/ICU-VR-F only at home/no ICU-VR-F) instead of the randomisation variables in the mixed-effects regression models, and determine whether that dummy variable has a significant contribution to the model. We will additionally perform an analysis in which (1) patients who did not watch ICU-VR-F in the hospital will be excluded and (2) patients who watched ICU-VR in the hospital will be excluded to determine whether there is a difference in effect.",

We received approval from the MEC of the Erasmus MC, and local approval has been obtained from the institutional ethics review boards of each participating hospital, that is, the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland Hospital, the Ikazia Hospital and the Maasstad Hospital. If deviation from the protocol is necessary, then it will not be implemented without the prior review and approval of the MEC of the Erasmus MC and each participating hospital's institutional ethics review board. Signed informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Previous research demonstrated that (ICU-)VR is safe. 23 31 32 48 Informed consent forms will be kept in a locked cabinet in a limited-access room at the Erasmus MC. Data will be archived for 15 years. The handling of personal data complies with the Dutch law. On completion of the study, its findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international scientific conferences to publicise the research to healthcare professionals, health service authorities and the public. A summary of the results will be made available to the study patients if requested.",
