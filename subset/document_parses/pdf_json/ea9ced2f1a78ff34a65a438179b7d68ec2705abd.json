To anticipate bottlenecks in delivery, any predictive modeling has to sufficiently adjust to each center's circumstances. This requires a model capable of simulating in detail the course of patients according to a particular hospital's practices. Because most centers do not have the capability to develop these simulations on their own, a tool that may be used by many hospitals to model patient flow during the COVID-19 pandemic can be of benefit. Such a tool must allow the customization of inputs to produce suitable estimates that hospital teams can reliably use to make decisions regarding expanding capacity, providing care for patients with other illnesses, requests for external support, and so on. Given the substantial uncertainty surrounding a novel virus epidemic, the model must allow for consideration of many scenarios. Because the epidemic changes as it progresses and is modified by imposition and withdrawal of mitigation measures, the model must be capable of incorporating new data as they become available and its structure must remain flexible and adaptable.",

It was created at the request of an English National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust (Guy's and St Thomas' Trust [GSTT]). As is common for individual hospitals, they faced extreme time constraints that required a model able to produce results within days. The intent was to make the model available to other hospitals nationally and internationally, and thus, it had to be constructed using widely available spreadsheet software and be capable of simulating the trajectories at an adequate level of detail; it needed to be extremely flexible and easily and quickly adaptable because the data and needs were rapidly changing. This article focuses on the design and structuring of the simulation of hospital resource use, from arrival in the emergency department (ED) to discharge or death. A separate article, which deals with the local epidemiologic predictions, is in development. These details, though important to the full implementation of the forecasts, are not covered here because the simulation of hospital trajectories is not bound to any specific way of deriving the epidemiologic estimates and users can incorporate to the model what seems logical for their own context by replacing the existing estimates. To illustrate how the simulation works, a case study was presented using the inputs provided by GSTT in early April 2020.",

DICE simulation has been described in detail elsewhereadditional information, templates, training materials, and the DICE engine are freely available at https://dice.impact-hta.eu/. DICE is an approach to designing and structuring a simulation by separating the information to be processed from the changes that are forecast to happen. The information is stored in a table of uniquely named Conditions (names italicized here), and the changes are specified in Events (named with no spaces, capitalized, and bolded here). Each change is expressed in text that respects Excel syntax but without the \"=\" sign. A small macro reads the tables and processes them row by row, successively inserting an \"=\" sign to activate each expression in turn. Because all elements of the model are tabulated with no programming or hidden parts, a DICE model is very transparent, readily understood, and easily modified by editing the text expressions or adding or deleting rows in the tables. DICE has been used by health technology assessment agencies, including the English National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 26 and the French Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9, 27 and further developed as part of the Impact HTA Horizon 2020 project (https://www.impact-hta.eu/).",

The assumptions made in the model implementation create structural uncertainty. In DICE, this is handled by specifying alternative scenarios. For this model, scenarios could be specified covering any of the inputs or combinations. Finally, parameter uncertainty arises from the statistical uncertainty surrounding many of the inputs. The uncertainty table in a DICE model allows the analyst to specify the parameters that bear statistical uncertainty and their distributions.

The Emergency Department and Urgent Care Centre at GSTT is one of the busiest in the NHS, with 240 000 patient encounters per annum, predominately drawn from South London and of widely varying individual characteristics. GSTT was able to expand bed capacity based on surge principles for a conventional response where a hospital's CC resources should expand immediately by 20% above baseline, followed by capacity expansion of at least 200% above baseline to meet demands using local, regional, national, and international resources. 31 The GSTT team made several specifications on Thursday, March 26, 2020, defining a model to characterize their own setting (Table 3) . To meet these specifications in the time allowed and with the data provided, the initial design for the model considered the wards as compartments and simulated the transfers among them. This cohort model was functional the following Wednesday, April 1, 2020. Eventually, this early cohort model was found to be insufficient to handle the heterogeneity in management, dependencies of transfer probabilities on LOSs, and more complex pathways. Therefore, it was converted to the individual simulation reported here.",

The model tended to predict higher occupancy than what was eventually observed (eg, for the first 7 days of April, the model predicted average ward daily occupancy of 344.9 than an actual average of 325.1).

Additional details of the patient flows and resource use can be incorporated through additional conditions and events if local data and expertise allow. The predictions are useful for resource capacity planning and preparedness. A health authority needs to only rely on a small amount of local data to specify a few inputs to adapt the model to their context and aid their understanding of how their own patient flows will affect their ability to match uncertain demands being placed on their capacity. This modeling will be increasingly valuable as the pandemic progresses and should be considered as new waves emerge to ensure appropriate planning of in-hospital resources to deliver safe, timely, and resilient healthcare services.",
