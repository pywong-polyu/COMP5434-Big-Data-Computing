            "text": "Drawing from interviews with 31 young leading climate activists from 23 countries across the world this article aims to capture the contribution of the recent youth climate movement to communicating climate science and politics. We show that from the point of view of the youth activists, the movement powerfully connects personal and local experiences and emotions with climate science. This has enabled the activists to construct an authentic, generational and temporal identity that has helped them to carve out an autonomous position and voice with considerable moral authority among existing climate policy actors. Claiming to represent the future generation, we conclude that activists have offered an important added value to climate science as new ambassadors for scientific consensus and climate mitigation. The youth movement and the added value it brings communicating climate science is an example of the dynamics of the formation of \"relational publics\" and emphasizes the need to understand better the networked communication landscape where climate politics is debated.",

We will therefore begin (section 2) by introducing (through selected earlier scholarship) three conceptual threads that have informed our analysis: 1) challenges of climate science communication, 2) the specific nature of the youth movement itself, and 3) the broader communication landscape (both in terms of media infrastructure and political division). We will then present the empirical material and discuss our methodological approach in section 3. This is followed by the empirical analysis focusing on the three research questions (sections 4, 5, and 6). While these sections provide distinct findings and reflections on these specific themes, our main argument is a synthetic one: if we are to understand the specific value of the youth movementand its lessons to climate science communicationit is crucial to see how the knowledge authority drawn from climate science, the authenticity drawn from personal and lived experience, and the relative autonomy of the movement in relation to other actors were combined and mutually constructed. The concluding section, then, presents the key findings as interrelated elements that shape the communicative power of the movement.",

It clarified, in relatively accessible and simple terms, the difference in consequences between 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C of average global warming (IPCC, SPM 2018) . Thus, it underscored that while past emissions have already baked risky future changes into the climate system, the level of ambition in mitigation and other action can still make a difference. This adjusted framing effectively re-energized the climate debate by showing that even if the 2\u00b0C political targets set by the Paris Agreement 2015 were to be reached, it would still not make things right. The message echoed the core point made by a coalition of the most vulnerable countries 1 that played a very active role at the Paris COP21 by pressing for a more ambitious target to be included in the text of the final accord (e.g., Boykoff, 2019: 82-84) .",

However, the IPCC, by emphasizing the need for \"unprecedented\" and \"systemic\" changes, provided key ingredients for it. During 2018 and 2019, scientific messaging, energized activism, and dramatic extreme weather events intersected in powerful ways. At this conjuncture, the overall discourse showed signs of change. Several actors, such as the European Parliament and some leading mainstream news organizations began to replace the word 'change' in 'climate change' with 'crisis' or 'emergency'. The global Fridays for Future (FFF) movement contributed to this heightened attention and sense of political urgency. At the same time, the interplay between scientists, politicians and the media created favourable conditions for the movement to appear and spread.",

In contrast, science communication scholars have long stressed the need for alternative models. For instance, Secko, Amend and Friday (2013, p. 6 ) have pointed to the role of context (developing different messaging for different audiences), lay expertise (highlighting interaction between scientists and lay people) and public participation (democratizing science through more engaging communication).",

This dilemma has, of course, seen some scientists stretch the 'policy-relevant' statements to saying that 'substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions' are required (see e.g. author, 2017, xxx & author 2019), thus offering a chance for politicians and activists to translate scientific evidence more easily into calls for climate action.",

            "text": "Many scholars have focused on the emotional aspect of young climate activists and their expressed combination of fear, despair, and hope. A telling moment of this was Thunberg's speech to the UN in the fall of 2019, stating: \"I want you to panic.\" (Thunberg, 2019) . We should not look at such rhetoric merely as a communication strategy but also recognize the psychological burden that it expresses. In a situation where media has often stressed frames of 'doom and gloom' and disaster (O'Brien et al., 2018; Painter, 2017; O'Neill et al., 2015; O'Neill & Nicholson-Cole, 2009 ), fearfulness may indeed easily emerge. Nairn (2019) has emphasized how different emotions may interfere with each other. In a study of youth in New Zealand, she found 'burnout' among activists who had previously experienced hope and positive aspirations that, in turn, led to their retreat from activism. On the other hand, the young people she studied seemed to generate hope by taking part in collective processes and engaging in climate activist groups, emphasizing the importance of networking (Nairn, 2019, 440 ; see also Kleres & Wettergren, 2017; Lee et al., 2020) . As other researchers have observed, the \"framing of climate change as an impending environmental disaster may contribute to a sense of despair and feeling of helplessness, which can lead to disillusion, apathy and inactivity\" (O'Brien et al., 2018) , while positive framings may generate a different kind of engagement and bring opportunities for action (ibid.). The movement has somewhat successfully presented itself through a synthesis of fear and hope as a necessary combination of emotions that climate politics needs.",

De Moor et al. (2020) emphasized the large mobilization of a new age cohort (school pupils), especially girls; however, they also pointed towards a higher educational bias (see also Emilsson, Johansson & Wennerhag 2020) . Scholars have also tried to capture the variations of political demands inside the movement. O'Brien et al. (2018) distinguished between dutiful (reformist), disruptive (norm-challenging) and dangerous (mobilizing alternatives) dissent, arguing that these models of activismand their creative combinationswill be needed for youth climate activism to have an impact. Other scholars also highlight how the radical potential of the movement might be overshadowed by the unifying perspective (Marguardt 2020; see also Ellisson et al. 2020; de Moor et al. 2020) .",

The recent youth climate movement highlights an emotional, personal commitment and rhetoric, which has brought together activists from very different and diverse contexts. This echoes Bennett and Segerberg's (2013) notion of \"connective action\"; the way in which the networked landscape of social media can cultivate personal action frames that allow people to join a \"movement\" for different reasons and confront \"a situation that has to be changed\" (ibid: 37). One distinct aspect of the current youth activists is their way of expressing themselves more consciously as inheritors of the planet. A parallel personal-generational argument is also articulated by grandparent action networks (see Lawson et al. 2018 on intergenerational learning). Furthermore, even if some of the local initiatives originate from existing organizations, the FFF and related actions have mostly built their own structures. The youth actions starting in 2018, in the organizational sense, may bear more similarities to separate ad-hoc initiatives, such as for example 'Black Lives Matter ' (Lawson et al. 2018: 206) .",

This underlines the role of socialization in the cultivation of \"meaning-focused coping\" towards climate threats (Ojala, 2019) as motivating pro-environmental attitudes. However, it also points at the possibility of climate activism as an \u00e9lite phenomenon that builds on generationally accumulated social and cultural capital. An Italian activist complained: \"Scientific ignorance is widespread [here] , much more than in other countries\". She felt that media \"do not understand how we are those in favour of science while they [opponents] are against science and development.\" (Italy, Interview). A Swedish activist had read parts of the full IPCC reports, concluding that, \"when one reads them, one understands exactly how serious it is. I cannot understand how people can know of these facts and are (still) not willing to do anything\" (Sweden, Interview). In turn, a Ugandan activist launched a critique, not of other people, but of global leaders for their \"inability to take the necessary action\", explaining that, \"scientists have provided the technical information\" (Uganda, Interview). These activists' trust in climate science was especially motivated by calls for action, since activism is a larger part of their social fabric. Thus, they provide a bridge from the climate scientists' \"policy relevant, but not policy prescriptive\" status (IPCC mandate) to activities seeking concrete political remedies and changes.",

Because it is evident: [\u2026] we can't continue doing things that harm the earth. And we know that.\" (Ibid.) This points to a tacit understanding of how handling scientific certainty or consensus and public or political reasoning must, to a degree, follow different logics. It also shows that activists canconsciously and strategically-choose to take some distance from scientists.

Indeed, many of the respondents stressed the autonomy and self-decision-making of local movements: there was often no clear \"connection between overseas strikes that are happening\" (Australia, interview), and a key characteristic of the movement was \"lack of leadership\" (Chile, interview). In other words, this meant that \"it is necessary to create an original [national] Japanese plan\" (Japan, interview) or that \"these things would take place even without international movements, without linking with them, attending the joint events etc.\" (Slovenia, interview). Of course, the respondents' emphasis on local initiatives and judgements can partly be a defensive reaction against criticism, as the strikers have been blamed for being driven by fashionable media attention or co-opted by the global movement. Nevertheless, this is also evidence of a de-centralized, \"connective\" identity towards the global movement: \"an organizational principle that is different from notions of collective action based on core assumptions about the role of resources, networks and collective identity\" (Bennett & Segerberg, 2013: 53) . These de-centralized identities may also be regarded as related to their very different local experiences of climate crisis effects, which inspires locally tailored communication. Furthermore, their desire for local independence could be seen as an element of local, \"spectral knowledge\"' that is needed to balance abstract global knowledge production-a critique that has also been directed towards climate science (e.g. Hulme, 2014) .",

(Japan, interview). On the other hand, the activists remain suspicious of this tide of appreciation. Some were annoyed that political parties sometimes joined in on the strikes, prompting a Danish activist to accuse them of an \"attempt to hijack our movement\" (Denmark, interview) and a Finnish activist described as despicable \"politicians [who]\u2026show up for a photo op at strike events, fetching a selfie saying, 'here we are'; all the while, their deeds are completely incompatible with [our position].\" (Finland, interview).

This highlights the value of consensus as a practical public good, as a rationally valid, temporally shared understanding and, as a starting point that we should allow to frame the debate about political choices and actions. Stressing the practical and political common-sense conclusions and consensus the movement actors have helped to translate scientific knowledge into the realm of public debate. By doing so, they have helped to negotiate the distinction between scientific production of knowledge (and consensus), built on organized uncertainty and doubt, and policy debates that aim towards temporary agreement for action. For our understanding of how better climate science communication works this underlines the importance of actively participatory, and co-productive climate communication where scientific fact and scenarios are translated into meaningful (and powerful) messaging. Of course, this role is not unique and new as such. This is what environmental NGO's, and climate conscious politicians and their networks have also been involved in for decades. This is what many active scientists have tried to do for a long time (and our respondents reported examples of how the movement inspired some scientists to actively endorse the activists). Thus, to capture more clearly the specific contribution of the youth movement, it is important to look at the nature and identity of the movement itself.",

            "text": "A key feature of the movement (from the perspective of the actors) is its strong rootedness to concrete, lived experience of the activists (RQ2). In the interviews, this took several forms. For several respondents, this came through, at the level information and knowledge, in their ability to recognize connections between the main IPCC conclusions and their own local observations that gave global climate science a tangible meaning. More importantly for our argument here, many of them interviewed activists described a strong affective dimension in their engagement, showing how activism was often anchored into almost existential, personal, lived experiences of anxietyand hope. We can argue that the youth movement has played a key role in carving out a space for more public recognition of the fears that dire future predictions must cause also in wider parts of the population. Again, it not alone in articulating climate anxiety, but it has offered a model of translating it to public action. Facing growing uncertainties at a personal level and sharing these publicly will be an important part of public discussion and the ways in which scientific predictions and scenarios of both hope and despair are handled. This psychological aspect of climate debate, on could argue, grows in importance as we begin to realize that we are in some sense \"too late\"? (Moser, 2020; Bruhn Jensen, 2018) . We may view the dynamics between fear and hope (or panic and action) as a practical way of rearticulating the critiques of 'alarmism' and dysfunctional 'disaster' framing that communication scholars have oftentimes highlighted. In this landscape, the youth movements' personalized, emotionally loaded and morally strong point is that it is normal to panic, at least sufficiently to spring into action, cannot just be pushed aside as 'alarmism', especially when the situation has been established as alarming (Risbey, 2008) . Finally, and most importantly, the movement has articulated a new dimension of political representation. They have intensified the climate (science) debate by concretely highlighting politics of time and generationsand the consequent questions of justice and responsibility. Or put it another way, a simple lesson from the youth movement is to say that they embody the precautionary principle of expert assessment. By assuming this role and emphasizing it through striking from school (their presupposed path to the future), they have provided a new kind of representation of the future based on climate science and the urgency of climate action. Although questions of local experience, personal anxieties and generational justice point to different directions, they can all be seen as resources for the movement to carve out a claim for an autonomous, distinct terrain from which an authentic and distinct voice could speak with enough authority that it could not be ignored. This voicepreviously often ignored (Graham & de Bell, 2021)and its communicative power is what made and makes the movement also an effective part of communicating climate science and translating it into lessons that bare on meaning structured of everyday life. By assuming the position of living representatives of the future that has been predicted by climate scientists the movement claimed the right and justification to rely on scientific consensus in a way that has been more difficult for other social actors, including the scientists themselves.",

The interviews show how the ingredients of autonomy (local knowledge, emotional and temporal claims) seemed to work together. But this was crucially made possible by the contemporary communication infrastructure that supporter \"self-mediation\" (Cammaerts, 2018) of the movement (both the internal communication between activists and its high public attention). The mix local, personal, generational, emotional and its linkage to hard scientific evidence and consensus is inspiring example of \"connective action\" in action (Bennett & Segerberg, 2013) . However, it is important here to remind that the core activities of the movement took place in the street demonstrations, where the activists' personal feelings of empowerment were often located (this is also an element of the movement that was hit hard by the COVID-19). Understanding the movement through the lens a \"relational public\" (Starr, 2021), however, also demands that we pay attention to the careful negotiation of alliances and tensions with already existing institutions. This includes recognizing the energizing power of the aggressive dismissal and critique as well as the more supportive reactions of actors that favour climate action, including parts of mainstream media, environmental NGOs, and transnational governance organizations. If we look at the \"inherited\" landscape of climate politics, perhaps the most important and interesting contribution of the movement does not lie in their confrontations with misogynist populist or networks of climate denial and delay. Rather, the more distinctive and useful element of the movement has been the critique of the capacity of the whole political system (nationally, and internationally) to face the message of climate science and translate that to action.",
