However, they have all resulted in significant social inequalities in terms of morbidity and mortality. Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), a filoviridae virus, was first identified in 1976 in Zaire (Democratic Republic of Congo). In the 2015-16 outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, there were over 28,000 suspected cases and 11,000 deaths. Fruit bats (Family Pteropodidae) are considered to be the primary reservoir hosts. Community spread is via blood, bodily fluids and contact. Research has found that transmission was 50% higher in the most impoverished communities and that most of the spread originated in lower socio-economic status areas [4] . In 2014, WHO's director stated that \"poverty is the mother of the current Ebola epidemic\" [5] .",

By January 2020, the disease had started to spread globally, and at the end of the month the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To date (August 2021), globally, there have been around 200 million recorded cases and over 4 million recorded deaths from COVID-19. Community transmission is primarily by airborne viral droplets. Numerous studies conducted in multiple countries have found strong associations between COVID-19 mortality and socio-economic status with death rates >2 times higher in the most deprived groups [7] .",

In terms of Ebola, reliance on bush meat consumption amongst the poorest communities may have increased exposure -as has increased encroachment into forests [11] .

With Zika, the extreme overcrowding in the urban favelas led to much higher rates of infection [6] . Transmission of COVID-19 was higher in deprived neighbourhoods which had more houses of multiple occupation, smaller house sizes, more urbanity and higher population densities [3] . Differences in health and cultural behaviours also contribute to unequal transmission. For example, in the West African Ebola outbreaks, continuation of traditional funeral practices (including washing and cleaning of the corpse, washing of hands in a common bowl and then touching the face of the deceased) [11] and higher rates of social contacts were noted amongst low income populations [4] . Similarly with Zika, residents of low income neighbourhoods had less knowledge of preventive behaviour measures, perhaps compounded by lower health literacy [10] .",

These co-morbidities are unequally distributed with higher prevalence in more socio-economically deprived populations [8] . Secondly, the social determinants of health also work to make people from low-income communities more vulnerable to EID infection -even when they have no underlying health conditions: living in adverse material (e.g. poor nutrition) and psychosocial circumstances (resulting in chronic stress responses) can exacerbate the onset, course and outcome of infectious diseases. With COVID-19, the higher rates of chronic disease in low socio-economic status communities increased disease severity and mortality rates [3] .

This was exacerbated by lack of trust in healthcare professionals and resistance to public health approaches (leading to low compliance and reluctance to seek medical care) [11] ; reliance on traditional medicine in the management of disease [11] ; and the stigmatisation and fear of health care professionals [11] . For Zika, inadequate public health facilities (including disease surveillance) and poor support for CZS cases has been noted [6, 10] . For COVID-19, even in high-income countries with universal health care systems, there is emerging evidence of unequal access to-and uptake of-vaccines [13] .

It has outlined a model to understand inequalities in EIDs and it is hoped that this will inspire more careful consideration of equity in EIDs in future research and policy responses. Whilst specific policies will be needed in different countries, contexts and for different EIDs, it is clear that an understanding of the key health equity aspects of EIDs needs to be taken into account in public health responses (e.g. codesigning with local communities and adapting them to local cultural contexts to increase adherence); treatment development (e.g. increasing diversity in clinical trials) and allocation (e.g. training community health workers, ensuring universal accessibility and uptake, proactively identifying areas that need healthcare resources); and prevention (e.g. surveillance systems should include socio-demographic data, ensuring access to vaccines e.g. COVAX). Understanding the social nature of EID pandemics will ultimately help reduce the burden of disease.",
