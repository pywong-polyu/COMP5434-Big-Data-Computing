It has exposed the unpreparedness and scarcity of resources through out the world in dealing with such a situation. When even essential services are affected badly, we cannot expect services like palliative care to function effectively. Even though the Worldwide Palliative Care Alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared palliative care as a human right less than a decade ago, it has remained an under-resourced branch world over even in the best times. 1 COVID-19 pandemic has costed enormous problems in palliative and hospice care. In a study conducted among hospices in Italy it was clearly understood that all of them had rapidly implemented changes in practice which was not customized to hospice services. 2 Many centers had changed their admission criteria and visitors were not allowed except for dying patients.",

            "text": "Palliative dermatology is a relatively new branch of palliative care introduced by Hafi et al., in 2018 which covers dermatological disorders in palliative care patients as well as dermatologica l conditions requiring palliative care. 4,5 Based on a few studies in the past, it is clear that there are a wide variety of dermatological diagnoses prevalent among such patients ranging from xerosis to cutaneous malignancies. Skin infections and eczematous conditions are also common among them. Lack of dermatologists in palliative care team poses danger of misdiagnosis and improper management such as irrational use of steroid containing creams resulting in recalcitrant superfic ia l mycoses and skin atrophy. Even though most of the conditions mentioned above are not of grave morbidity, it may affect patients' quality of life very badly. Most of the patients covered under this branch are vulnerable to psychological co morbidities aggravating many of the dermatologica l conditions, hence requiring a liaison approach by a well trained psycho dermatology team. Media discussions around Covid-19 may adversely impact mental health of such patients which worsen the situation again. Since resources of palliative dermatology are extremely scarce, judicious rationing is the need of the time. Tele dermatology comes to the rescue in such context and this therapeutic help can be extended beyond national boundaries. Tele dermatology is particular ly effective in nom emergency medical consultations not involving serious situations. 6 This has gained much popularity among doctors and patients as well during the pandemic and consequent lockdown. It can be done in real time using available modes of texting , imaging, audio and video facility through computer, smartphone or telemedicine units. It can alleviate symptoms, if not cure the disease, and increase quality of life in end of the time. Hence we suggest dermatologistsThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",
