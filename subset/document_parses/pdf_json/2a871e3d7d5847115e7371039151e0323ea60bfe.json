COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has quickly spread around the globe. This pandemic demands rapid development of drugs and vaccines. Plant-based vaccines are a technology with proven viability, which have led to promising results for candidates evaluated at the clinical level, meaning this technology could contribute towards the fight against COVID-19. Herein, a perspective in how plant-based vaccines can be developed against COVID-19 is presented. Injectable vaccines could be generated by using transient expression systems, which offer the highest protein yields and are already adopted at the industrial level to produce VLPs-vaccines and other biopharmaceuticals under GMPC-processes. Stably-transformed plants are another option, but this approach requires more time for the development of antigen-producing lines. Nonetheless, this approach offers the possibility of developing oral vaccines in which the plant cell could act as the antigen delivery agent. Therefore, this is the most attractive approach in terms of cost, easy delivery, and mucosal immunity induction. The development of multiepitope, rationally-designed vaccines is also discussed regarding the experience gained in expression of chimeric immunogenic proteins in plant systems.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses having a positive-sense, single-stranded genomic RNA [1] and are grouped into four genera: \u03b1-CoVs, \u03b2-CoVs, \u03b3-CoVs, and \u03b4-CoVs. The ones that affect mammals are \u03b1and \u03b2-CoVs, while the other two genera infect birds and could also infect mammals [2] . Lately, the coronavirus has become a remarkable concern for global health after the diagnosis of a cluster of unknown pneumonia patients in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was associated with workers in the Wuhan Wholesale Seafood Market, in which live exotic animals are sold [3] . The pathogen was named SARS-CoV-2 given its similarity (70% of genomic similarity) to SARS-CoV-1, which was responsible for the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (SARS) . Until now, the official and accepted name for this new coronavirus strain is COVID-19 virus, an acronym for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 [1] . A systematic genomic analysis has revealed 380 amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, which is a starting point to study its functional and pathogenic divergence [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 293, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 585, "end": 588, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 772, "end": 778, "text": "(SARS)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 925, "end": 928, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1117, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Presently, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19. As an emerging pathogen, several knowledge gaps exist about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the coming months will be critical to refine clinical management and advancement in the validation of possible treatments. A myriad of efforts is ongoing to perform clinical trials and determine the efficacy of preexisting drugs, with hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir as the most promising candidates [10] . Receptor blockers are also under evaluation [11] , along with the assessment and development of monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, transfusions using plasma from individuals recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (containing neutralizing antibodies) are under exploration with promising findings [12] . Nonetheless, vaccination is the most effective approach to control and ultimately eradicate infectious diseases. Since SARS-CoV-2 possesses high transmissibility (asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, which results in a high number of patients with mild symptoms), the development of vaccines is an urgent goal to fight against this pathogen. The straightforward path to generate vaccine candidates is the technology of inactivated vaccines, which can be formulated with SARS-CoV-2 virions previously inactivated by chemical or physical treatments. A vaccine based on live-attenuated virus is another possible approach [13] . For SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, inactivated vaccine candidates have induced robust humoral responses leading to virus neutralization. Alternatively, the construction of a chimeric attenuated virus constitutes an interesting path. For instance, the influenza virus can be used as a scaffold to expose SARS-CoV-2 antigens and generate a bivalent vaccine targeting two relevant pathogens causing respiratory diseases [14] . Similarly, adenoviral vectors could be applied in this field [15] . Vaccines based on whole viruses are associated with concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection, reactogenicity, and strain reversion to pathogenic forms, among other safety issues [16] . Therefore, the path for vaccine development will require a detailed characterization, not only in terms of efficacy but also safety [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 443, "end": 447, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 494, "end": 498, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 741, "end": 745, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1381, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1795, "end": 1799, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1863, "end": 1867, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2072, "end": 2076, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2211, "end": 2215, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Development of Therapeutic and Prophylactic Treatments against COVID-19"}, {"text": "Although inactivated vaccines will perhaps be the main avenue for generating the first experimental vaccines, alternative approaches should be explored in parallel, namely the development of subunit vaccines.

Under this focus, the goal is to trigger specific immune responses via the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). For this purpose, edible plants lacking toxic metabolites should be used. Perhaps the main disadvantage of this technology is the long time required to generate transformed lines of edible crops efficiently expressing the antigen of interest (e.g., rice or corn transgenic lines or transplastomic lines) [51] . These oral vaccines will overcome the disadvantages of injectable vaccines such as painful administration and the risk associated with invasive delivery routes.

The scheme also allowed inducing neutralizing antibodies for the three poliovirus Sabin serotypes when two doses of IPV and plant-cell oral boosts were administered, whereas a single dose of IPV resulted in low neutralization potential [105] . In this way, freeze-dried plant material can be used as a low-cost vaccine rendering thermostability and easy to administer features.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 89, "end": 93, "text": "[75,", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 94, "end": 98, "text": "104]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1016, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1692, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Relevance of Mucosal Vaccines and Prime-Boosting Immunization Schemes"}, {"text": "Similarly, pure antigens produced in plants have been assessed with promising results in schemes where a conventional vaccine is used as a priming agent and the plant-made antigen is administered by the oral route as boosting [106] .

In this scenario, a plant-made vaccine is a viable approach to rapidly respond to this need. The current expression technologies offer relevant paths for developing anti-COVID-19 vaccines. VLPs constitute an attractive approach for the development of efficient and safe vaccines, which is associated with high immunogenicity, preservation of the antigenic determinants, and lack of replicative capacity. Thus, VLPs based on the main SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins is an attractive approach for vaccine development against coronavirus infections. The transient expression systems based on deconstructed viral vectors and N. benthamiana as host will allow for immediate exploitation of plants as efficient biofactories of injectable vaccine candidates, which are expected to be implemented and entered into clinical trials in a year. The development of vaccines based on transplastomic lines or edible plant species transformed at the nuclear level and intended to result in oral vaccines (especially boosting agents to provide mucosal immunity) are considered long term goals. However, they have special importance given their low cost and potential to serve as effective boosting agents, which could lead to attractive immune profiles characterized by proper humoral response in the mucosal compartments and long-lasting protection, especially for the elderly.
