            "text": "Graph neural networks are emerging as promising methods for modeling molecular graphs, in which nodes and edges correspond to atoms and chemical bonds, respectively. Recent studies show that when 3D molecular geometries, such as bond lengths and angles, are available, molecular property prediction tasks can be made more accurate. However, computing of 3D molecular geometries requires quantum calculations that are computationally prohibitive. For example, accurate calculation of 3D geometries of a small molecule requires hours of computing time using density functional theory (DFT). Here, we propose to predict the ground-state 3D geometries from molecular graphs using machine learning methods. To make this feasible, we develop a benchmark, known as Molecule3D, that includes a dataset with precise ground-state geometries of approximately 4 million molecules derived from DFT. We also provide a set of software tools for data processing, splitting, training, and evaluation, etc. Specifically, we propose to assess the error and validity of predicted geometries using four metrics. We implement two baseline methods that either predict the pairwise distance between atoms or atom coordinates in 3D space. Experimental results show that, compared with generating 3D geometries with RDKit, our method can achieve comparable prediction accuracy but with much smaller computational costs. Our Molecule3D is available as a module of the MoleculeX software library (https://github.com/divelab/MoleculeX).",

            "text": "In recent years, significant progress has been made in data-driven molecular representation learning methods. Many methods [53, 41, 46] use low-dimensional representations of molecules as the inputs, such as SMILES [47] sequences and molecular graphs. On the other hand, the ground-state 3D geometries of molecules, i.e., the 3D coordinates of all atoms in the ground-state molecule, are critical to a variety of applications, including but not limited to analysis of the molecular dynamics, prediction of biological activities of molecules, and design ligands or 3D linkers [21, 54] for proteins. Existing studies [49, 12] also demonstrate that use of ground-state 3D geometries as inputs of machine learning models can improve the prediction performance of quantum properties. However, obtaining the ground-state 3D geometry of a molecule can take hours of computation with density functional theory (DFT). A promising way to reduce the computational cost is predicting ground-state 3D geometries from input molecular graphs by using machine learning models. Nonetheless, no benchmark dataset has been specifically designed for this geometry prediction task currently. Meanwhile, due to the poor accuracy of current fast geometry generative methods, no prior works employ the generated 3D geometries for downstream applications.",

The dataset contains the information of over 3.9 million molecules, including their molecular graphs, ground-state 3D geometries, and various quantum properties. We develop a set of software tools to process the dataset and perform the 3D geometry prediction task. We design 4 metrics to evaluate the geometry prediction performance. In addition, to verify the benefits of the predicted 3D geometries, we employ a test bed based on the quantum property prediction task.

Accordingly, the GEOM [2] dataset has been created as a benchmark for this 3D geometry generation task and provides 3D geometries for over 430,000 molecules simulated by the first principle. In this dataset, a single molecule is associated with multiple low-energy 3D geometries, but they are non-ground-state geometries. Generative methods consider a one-to-many problem, i.e., generating multiple non-ground-state molecular geometries of the given molecular graph. To obtain the quantum property of a molecule, generative methods compute and average the properties of all generated molecular geometries. However, many works of 3D GNN [cite] have already proved that merely using the ground-state geometry with the lowest total energy can significantly boost the performance of the property prediction task. Hence, we propose a different, one-to-one method, that is, directly predicting the unique ground-state geometries of molecules. Compared to generation approaches targeting multiple non-ground-state geometries, prediction approaches targeting the ground-state geometries are interpreting and solving the geometry problem from a distinct perspective. We believe prediction approaches can also be effective, efficient, and promising to construct 3D geometries.",

QM9 is a widely used dataset for quantum property prediction and includes over 130,000 molecules together with their ground-state 3D geometries obtained by DFT computations.

The number of heavy atoms are limited to less than 9, and types of all atoms are restricted to be one of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The QM7/QM7b and QM8 datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark have the same constraints as QM9, and they even have fewer data than QM9. In summary, all current 3D molecule datasets are designed for property prediction tasks, and they are not suited to be adapted to 3D geometry prediction tasks.

Drug discovery and materials informatics often involve quantitative structureproperty relationship (QSPR) and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR). Both QSPR and QSAR are under the assumption that structurally similar molecules exhibit similar properties and activities. In these studies, the structural information of molecules is represented in various forms. For example, Faber-Christensen Huang-Lilienfeld (FCHL) [5] and smooth overlap of atomic densities (SOAP) [3] are two representations that describe atomic environments and they have been used by quantum machine learning community for a long time. One-dimensional (1D) structural keys is another representation to describe molecular composition and structures as a Boolean vector. Recently, it becomes popular to use two-dimensional (2D) molecular graphs representing atoms/bonds as nodes/edges to show connections explicitly. However, the specific shape of a molecule still lacks in 2D graphs. 3D molecular geometries provide additional spatial information, and recent studies show that using 3D geometries leads to more accurate molecular property prediction than using 2D graphs only. This improvement is consistent with the fact that properties are often closely related to the shape of a molecule [8] .",

Molecule3D consists of a dataset with molecular graphs and 3D geometries, baseline methods, evaluation metrics, and sample downstream tasks using the predicted geometries.

Once 3D molecular geometries can be predicted accurately and efficiently, they can be used directly in many downstream tasks such as property prediction. Predicting properties will benefit a wide range of real-world applications such as molecular discovery or virtual screening campaigns. For example, using predicted 3D molecular geometries as features can help predict HOMO, an essential property in discovering new electron acceptor materials in organic photovoltaics. Besides this application in renewable energy technologies, the predicted 3D geometries can also be used in drug discovery open challenge MIT AI Cures [6] . This challenge aims to discover new antibiotics to cure the secondary lung infections caused by COVID-19, but 3D molecular geometries are not provided in AI Cures. Thus, almost all participants are using molecular graphs, SMILES sequences, or fingerprints. With the Molecule3D dataset and the provided pipeline, one can train a model to predict relatively accurate ground-state geometry. Then, this pre-trained model with knowledge of 3D geometries can help predict antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. In short, we believe 3D geometry prediction has a potential to provide a new avenue for the computation of 3D geometries, thereby overcoming the current dilemma of scarce 3D geometries data.

Extracted properties are saved in a CSV file with the same order of the valid molecule list.

For random split, using predicted 3D geometries by all three baseline methods improves the prediction performance compared to using molecular graphs only. This result confirms our hypothesis that the predicted 3D geometries could benefit downstream property prediction tasks. Not surprisingly, it is harder to perform well on scaffold split, especially when both 3D geometry prediction and property prediction tasks employ scaffold split, which doubles the difficulty for our DeeperGCN-DAGNN based methods.",

The main contributions of our work include: (1) curate a large dataset with more than 3.9 million molecules' ground-state 3D geometries and 4 quantum properties, (2) propose to construct 3D geometries via predictive methods, which is in a distinct direction from generative methods, (3) propose 4 metrics to evaluate the geometry prediction accuracy, and (4) provide AI-ready software tools for processing data and performing geometry prediction. In addition, we design two baseline methods based on the DeeperGCN-DAGNN [29] model to predict 3D geometries by either predicting pairwise distances between atoms or 3D coordinates of atoms. We show that compared with RDKit ETKDG [37] method, our methods can achieve comparable prediction accuracy but 7\u00d7 speedup. This demonstrates that deep learning methods are promising for significantly reducing computational costs of obtaining ground-state 3D molecular geometries.",

Based on the proposed large dataset Molecule3D, we believe machine learning based prediction approaches have a great potential to predict the ground-truth 3D geometries accurately. Fast and accurately predicted 3D geometries will definitely advance studies of various real-world applications that rely on molecular structures.

Compared to DFT, PM6 optimization is much faster but yields slightly inaccurate structures. With this dataset, we can do pre-training to enforce the model to learn more about 3D geometries.

In every molecule folder, there are files including inp files of both ground-state and excited-state geometries and corresponding log files recording the optimization process. Note that inp files store atom coordinates only without any information about bonds. Thus, we use a mol file that is converted from the inp file by Open Babel. The mol file contains not only atom coordinates but also bonds and bond types. To make mol files more accessible by users, we read all mol files from each folder and integrate them into four SDF files. Moreover, we use the cclib package [35] to parse log files and extract quantum properties from massive information. Extracted properties are stored in a CSV file where each column saves one property. We find some molecules invalid during the above procedure due to SMILES conversion error and RDKit warnings, with sanitize problem, or with damaged log files.
