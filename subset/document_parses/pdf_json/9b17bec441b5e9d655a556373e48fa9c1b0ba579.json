SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) is an established drug target for the design of protease inhibitors. We performed a structure\u2212activity relationship (SAR) study of noncovalent compounds that bind in the enzyme's substrate-binding subsites S1 and S2, revealing structural, electronic, and electrostatic determinants of these sites. The study was guided by the X-ray/neutron structure of M pro complexed with Mcule-5948770040 (compound 1), in which protonation states were directly visualized. Virtual reality-assisted structure analysis and small-molecule building were employed to generate analogues of 1. In vitro enzyme inhibition assays and room-temperature X-ray structures demonstrated the effect of chemical modifications on M pro inhibition, showing that (1) maintaining correct geometry of an inhibitor's P1 group is essential to preserve the hydrogen bond with the protonated His163; (2) a positively charged linker is preferred; and (3) subsite S2 prefers nonbulky modestly electronegative groups.",

However, due to vaccine hesitancy, pre-existing health conditions, and vaccine escape variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 5 a significant proportion of the population will remain at risk, creating an urgent priority to advance existing therapeutics. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, believed to be of zoonotic origin, 6, 7 raising concerns that other easily transmissible respiratory viruses will emerge to cause future pandemics. The arsenal of therapeutic intervention options will undoubtedly be expanded by designing multiple small-molecule drugs that inhibit various viral targets disrupting essential steps in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. 8 This bolstered preparedness strategy has the potential to yield broad-spectrum antivirals providing a means of tackling future pathogenic coronaviruses.",

            "text": "3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ), also known as the main protease (M pro ), from SARS-CoV-2 is a viral cysteine protease enzyme 9 and an important drug target that has attracted considerable attention from structural and computa-tional biologists and drug designers. 10\u221215 SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of \u223c30k nucleotides resembling mRNA. 16 Host cell ribosomes partially translate the genomic mRNA to generate two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, encoded by the viral replicase gene during the initial steps of the virus replication cycle. 16, 17 The proteolytic cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab is vital for SARS-CoV-2 proliferation and liberates 16 individual viral protein components necessary for the viral genome transcription activity. This essential step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle is accomplished by M pro , and another cysteine protease, the papain-like protease (PL pro ), through hydrolyzing peptide bonds within the two polyproteins at specific locations. Smallmolecule inhibitors of the viral protease enzymatic activity have strong clinical precedence for blocking virus replication, and hence, the fervent interest of the scientific community to develop coronavirus-specific protease inhibitors. The active site of M pro is distinct from the known human proteases; thus, off-target binding of specific M pro inhibitors can be minimized. 10, 11 Conversely, conservation of the M pro active site across various coronaviruses creates an opportunity to design pan-coronavirus antivirals. 18 Significant effort in the design of M pro inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 8,19\u221221 has focused on the reversible and irreversible (suicidal) covalent inhibitors, including compounds initially designed for the inhibition of SARS-CoV M pro . 22\u221225 Such inhibitors contain chemical groups, or warheads, that are reactive toward the catalytic cysteine of M pro , Cys145. The hepatitis C virus clinical protease inhibitor boceprevir and the feline peritonitis virus protease inhibitor GC-376 were initially considered for drug repurposing, leading to the rational design of hybrid inhibitors. 26\u221228 In addition, noncovalent competitive and allosteric inhibitors have captured interest due to the availability of high-throughput virtual and experimental screening of large compound libraries that leverage new advances in supercomputing and fast X-ray crystallographic screening. 15,29\u221232 Compounds can be fed into structure-based drug design pipelines and chemically modified to improve their potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M pro . 33\u221236 Moreover, noncovalent inhibitors may have a higher selectivity for M pro compared to covalent compounds that can also target host proteases and can possess elevated cytotoxicity due to binding to other human proteins. 33, 36 The active site of M pro consists of subsites S5\u2212S1\u2032, which can accommodate substrate and inhibitor groups at positions P5\u2212P1\u2032. Subsites S1 and S2 are selective for Gln and a medium-sized hydrophobic residue like Leu or Phe, respectively. 11,37\u221239 A recent study analyzed the effect of chemical modifications in a noncovalent inhibitor ML188 on its binding to M pro . 36 Here, we report a structure\u2212activity relationship (SAR) study performed on a competitive noncovalent inhibitor Mcule-5948770040 (compound 1) of a novel scaffold that we recently discovered through a large-scale virtual screening and validated using in vitro enzyme inhibition assays and X-ray crystallography. 40 The aim of our SAR study was to chemically modify compound 1 that binds across the M pro catalytic site in the substrate-binding subsites S1 and S2 to reveal structural, electronic, and electrostatic determinants of these ligand-binding sites. Compound 1 has a general architecture of P1\u2212linker\u2212P2 (Scheme 1). We initiated the study by obtaining a joint X-ray/neutron (XN) structure of the M pro -1 complex at near-physiological temperature and neutral pH (Figure 1a ). The XN structure permitted us to fully map the hydrogen positions (observed as deuterium atoms) in the M pro active site and compound 1, accurately determining protonation states of the enzyme amino acid residues and the inhibitor. With this information in hand, we systematically derivatized P1, P2, and linker groups producing a series of compounds; named as the HL-3 series (Scheme 1). A virtual reality-assisted structure analysis and small-molecule building were employed to generate derivatives of 1, considering the geometric constraints of the M pro subsites S1 and S2 and the feasibility of the syntheses. In vitro enzyme inhibition assays demonstrated the effect of chemical modifications on the ability of the modified compounds to inhibit M pro . In contrast, subsequent X-ray crystallographic analysis at room temperature identified the structural determinants for P1, P2, and linker binding. Moreover, we designed an improved inhibitor, compound HL-3-68, that showed several-fold better inhibition of M pro in vitro.",

The uracil-like P1 group of 1 contains a carbonyl that forms a short 1.7 \u00c5 hydrogen bond with a doubly protonated His163. This carbonyl's second lone pair of electrons makes a weaker unconventional C\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bond with C\u03b42 of His172. The other carbonyl of the P1 group forms a D 2 O-mediated interaction with Ser1\u2032 of the second M pro protomer. Another D 2 O-mediated interaction to Asn142 arises from the amide ND group at the P1 group's 2 position, whereas the amide ND at the 4-position forms a 2.0 \u00c5 hydrogen bond with the carboxylate side chain of Glu166. To facilitate this interaction, the Glu166 carboxylate rotates from its position observed in the ligand-free M pro structure toward 1, and His163 gains a D atom on N\u03b52 to become positively Scheme 1. Chemical Diagrams of Mcule-5948770040 (Compound 1) and Its Derivatives a a For the generalized structure of the HL-3 series not all possible combinations of X, Y, and Z substituents were examined. The full list of HL-3 series of compounds, including their chemical structures, is given in Table S1 . charged in M pro -1 ( Figure S1a ). Interestingly, the same conformational change of the Glu166 side chain was observed in the telaprevir-bound neutron structure, where His163 was also found in the doubly protonated state, relative to the ligand-free M pro ( Figure S1b ). However, telaprevir possesses a short hydrophobic norvaline P1 group that prevents a direct polar interaction with the enzyme; instead, a water molecule is recruited to this position to hydrogen bond with His163. The aromatic dichlorobenzene P2 group orchestrates itself into the hydrophobic S2 subsite by displacing Met49 and S2 helix (residues 46\u221252) and rearranging His41 and Gln189 to create \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interactions. 40 P1 and P2 groups of 1 are connected by a saturated heterocyclic piperazine\u2212amide linker that includes a carbonyl aimed toward the oxyanion hole and a potentially ionizable tertiary amine preceding P2. Analysis of the nuclear density demonstrated that the latter amine nitrogen is protonated with the D atom directed away from His41 and into the bulk solvent. As a result, compound 1 is a cation with a +1 positive charge.",

The catalytic dyad exists in the zwitterionic state in ligand-free M pro as discrete anionic thiolate and cationic imidazolium side chains. 41 The hydrogen-bonding landscapes of His41 and D 2 O cat in M pro -1 are presented in Figure 2b . In this complex, the catalytic dyad is neutralized with Cys145 observed as a thiol (-SD), and His41 singly protonated on N\u03b52 but not on N\u03b41. The Cys145 thiol deuterium was refined to \u223c85% D occupancy. Relative to the ligand-free M pro and M pro -telaprevir neutron structures, the His41 side chain is flipped about 180\u00b0, its position in M pro -1 being stabilized by a new hydrogen bond formed between N\u03b52-D and the His164 main chain carbonyl (Figures 2c and S1b). Consequently, a conserved hydrogen bond with D 2 O cat observed in the other two neutron structures is eliminated to create a new hydrogen bond made by the N\u03b41 with a D 2 O molecule recruited from the bulk solvent. D 2 O cat in M pro -1 is oriented by donating its D atoms in hydrogen bonds with the His164 and Asp187 side chains in a rotation pose not seen in either the ligand-free or telaprevirbound neutron structures ( Figure S1a,b) . In contrast to ligandfree M pro in which His164 is doubly protonated, His164 is neutrally charged in M pro -1, possessing strong nuclear density for N\u03b41-D that is hydrogen-bonded to Thr175 ( Figure 2b ). Moreover, this neutral protonation state configuration of His164 is different from that observed in the M pro -telaprevir neutron structure where N\u03b52 is protonated, and the hydrogen bond to Thr175 is absent. Thus, in M pro -1, D 2 O cat rotates to donate its D atoms in hydrogen bonds with His164 N\u03b52 and Asp187 carboxylate.",

The linker is a piperazine-1-carbonyl moiety whose carbonyl group is anchored by the oxyanion hole of the catalytic site. P2, a substituted benzene substituent, inserts into the mostly hydrophobic S2 subsite bordered by Met49 from the S2 helix, main chain atoms of Arg188 and Gln189, and side chains of His41, Cys44, Tyr54, and Gln189. The Tyr54 phenolic hydroxyl is the only group that potentially can play a role of a hydrogen-bonding partner with a P2 group of an inhibitor. To improve inhibitor affinity and probe the chemical determinants for ligand binding to S1 and S2, we designed an array of compound 1 derivatives, which we call HL-3 series, to methodically assess how the P1, linker, and P2 groups contribute to M pro inhibition.",

We employed virtual reality software to immerse into the M pro structure, to modify the scaffold of compound 1, and to perform structural analysis of the modeled complexes. First, we examined the effect of saturating the olefinic portion of the uracil-like (pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione) P1 group that creates a nonplanar sp 3hybridized endocyclic carbon. Both enantiomers were made to mimic the \u03b3-lactam ring commonly used as inhibitor's P1 (HL-3-51, HL-3-53). Such modification should not eliminate the P1 group's ability to hydrogen bond with His163, which is a prerequisite for M pro inhibitors. Next, we examined the effect of removing a positive charge from the linker, where the aniline nitrogen is observed in the protonated quaternary ammonium state in our neutron structure. To achieve this, the aniline nitrogen was replaced with a saturated carbon by substitution of a piperidine moiety for the piperazine in the linker (HL-3-69). The most extensive modifications were made to the P2 group by varying substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 of the phenyl ring. We examined the effect of removing one Cl from Various halides (F, Cl, I), nitrile, and trifluoromethyl were examined at the para position to modulate the electronic properties of the P2 group. In contrast, aldehyde and hydroxymethyl substituents were investigated to determine whether the Tyr54 side chain can act as a hydrogen-bond partner, donor or acceptor. Sterically bulkier substituents were not considered for synthesis due to geometric constraints of the S2 subsite.",

Therefore, the structurally conserved S1 subsite cannot accommodate the bent structures of these P1 groups. Interestingly, replacing the protonated positively charged aniline nitrogen with carbon to give HL-3-69 also negatively affected the compound's potency (IC 50 = 8.8 \u03bcM), even though this nitrogen does not make close contacts with M pro residues.

A similar result was obtained for compounds HL-3-46 and HL-3-71, in which the chlorine at the 4-position is replaced, respectively, with \u2212H or \u2212CH 2 OH. These observations clearly indicated that \u2212Cl at the 3-position of the P2 group is essential for a compound to maintain its potency. Indeed, adding Cl back to the 3-position for monosubstituted compounds with CHO (HL-3-44) or CF 3 (HL-3-50) at the 4-position significantly restored potency, with HL-3-70 and HL-3-63 possessing IC 50 values of of 6.2 and 6.4 \u03bcM, respectively. However, the potencies of HL-3-70 and HL-3-63 are an order of magnitude worse than that of compound 1, indicating that the presence of sterically larger and more electronegative substituents than Cl at the 4-position reduces an inhibitor's potency. Replacing Cl at the 4-position with \u2212Br, whose van der Waals radius of 1.97 \u00c5 is slightly larger than that of Cl (1.90 \u00c5) and electronegativity lower than that of Cl, while maintaining Cl at the 3-position, resulted in compound HL-3-78, which demonstrated potency as good as compound 1. Unexpectedly, we determined that when Cl and CF 3 in HL-3-63 swap positions to give HL-3-52, the IC 50 improves several folds to 1.4 \u03bcM, which is only about twice as high as that for compound 1. Adding an extra Cl substituent to HL-3-63 at the 5-position (HL-3-87) caused a similar reduction in IC 50 . The latter two observations demonstrated that the 3-position of the P2 group could accommodate a bulkier and more electronegative substituent, and addition of Cl to the 5-position on the benzene ring is beneficial for an inhibitor's potency.",

To directly assess the thermodynamic binding properties of compound 1 and the two most potent inhibitors HL-3-68 and Mcule-CSR-494190-S1, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC, Table 2 and Figure S3 ). The K d values measured by ITC are in good agreement with the K i values obtained by enzyme kinetics. HL-3-68 demonstrates sub-\u03bcM affinity to M pro , binding \u223c2-fold better to the enzyme than the other two compounds. The binding of all three compounds to M pro is driven primarily by enthalpy. Compound 1 binds to the enzyme with essentially no change in entropy, whereas \u0394S of binding for Mcule-CSR-494190-S1, although small (\u22123.16 cal/ (mol\u00b7K)), is negative and therefore contributes unfavorably to the binding with \u2212T\u0394S of +0.95 kcal/mol. Conversely, substitution of the methyl at the 4-position of the P2 group with Cl reverts \u0394S to a small positive value of 2.4 cal/(mol\u00b7K). Interestingly, \u0394H of binding is the most favorable for Mcule-CSR-494190-S1, although its \u0394S is the most unfavorable. The interplay of the enthalpy and entropy components results in HL-3-68 possessing the highest affinity for M pro (K d = 0.69 \u03bcM).",

MD simulations of M pro (ligand-free), the M pro -HL-3-68, and M pro -1 complexes reveal a consistent picture of how the HL-3-68 ligand is more stable within the primary binding site of M pro compared to compound 1 reported in our previous study. 40 We quantified the conformational changes using the rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) analysis across each trajectory ( Figures 4 and S6) . The distribution of the RMSDs determined from at least three replicates of the simulations (shown in Figure 4A as a histogram of all conformers from MD trajectories) further reveals that HL-3-68 stabilizes the binding pocket of M pro more than compound 1. For each system, we did observe slightly different fluctuations in chain A and chain B, which agrees with the previous simulation results. 13, 40 Across the three simulation systems, the M pro -HL-3-68 complex had the lowest average RMSD from both chains when compared with M pro and the M pro -1 system ( Figure S6 ). Per-residue fluctuations were characterized by calculating the root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) of the C\u03b1-atoms using the average conformation of each trajectory as the reference structure. Despite the fluctuation at the C-termini, the fluctuation patterns are largely in agreement, except that the M pro -HL-3-68 system depicts suppressed fluctuations across the entire protein ( Figure 4 ). Lower RMSFs were observed for the primary ligand-binding site of the M pro -HL-3-68 system, whereas other regions remained largely unaffected by the binding of the ligand(s). In our previous simulations 40 and as demonstrated here, compound 1 can potentially move away from the primary binding site to occupy various novel sites on the surface of M pro ; however, in crystallographic studies, compound 1 has not been observed to bind to other sites. Given that both crystallographic studies and biochemical assays indicate that the HL-3-68 is more stabilizing, our simulations also confirm that over the course of the time-scales of our simulations, it appears that the HL-3-68 stabilizes the primary interactions in S1 and S2 subsites by \"locking\" in the site, thus considerably reducing the flexibility of the loops surrounding the primary binding site. Thus, our analyses support the observation that HL-3-68 ligand binding stabilizes the M pro structure, forming stronger interactions than compound 1.",

Protonation state modulations occur through His163 in the S1 subsite, Cys145, and the His41\u2212D 2 O cat \u2212His164 network. As predicted computationally, 44 His163's N\u03b41 becomes protonated upon ligand binding. The active site electrostatics can thus be tuned to allow the Cys145 side chain to exist as a thiol in M pro -1 or as a thiolate primed for catalysis as observed in the ligand-free form. The imidazole ring of His41 is not only flipped 180\u00b0r elative to its conformation in the ligand-free and telaprevir complexes but also neutral. Hence, while the catalytic dyad is zwitterionic in the ligand-free structure, it is neutral in M pro -1. Whether the protonation states of the Cys\u2212His dyad are interdependent is currently an open question. Each protonation state combination of His41 and His164 has now been captured individually in the three neutron structures, suggesting that D 2 O cat -mediated H-bonding between these two side chains is not required for inhibition or a stable active site. Taken together, the protonation states determined from these three neutron structures suggest a mechanism where charges are shuffled between His163, the catalytic dyad, and His164 maintaining an overall +1 charge by active site residues when binding to inhibitors.",

The cationic nature of the linker positioned above the neutral catalytic dyad is beneficial for the compound's potency. However, the antiviral activity of some cationic drugs may be attributed to induced phospholipidosis rather than their specific function; 45 thus, novel M pro inhibitors should be designed with this knowledge in mind.

The solution was cooled to 0\u00b0C, and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2032-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC\u00b7HCl) (1 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, and DMF was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (DCM to DCM/CH 3 OH = 10:1). The removal of the solvents yielded the products as solids in yields >90%. Purity is >95% for all compounds as measured by NMR and mass spectrometry analyses (see the Supporting Information). Gene Construction, Expression, and Purification of Hydrogenated and Partially Deuterated SARS-CoV-2 M pro . A codonoptimized gene sequence of M pro (NSP5) from SARS-CoV-2 was cloned into a plasmid harboring the kanamycin resistance cassette (pD451-SR, Atum, Newark, CA). The M pro construct is flanked upstream by a gene for maltose-binding protein (MBP) and downstream by a His 6 tag. 52 The native N-terminus is achieved during expression through an M pro autoprocessing site SAVLQ\u2193 SGFRK, where \u2193 denotes the cleavage site, corresponding to the cleavage between NSP4 and NSP5 in the viral polyprotein. The native C-terminus is produced through an HRV-3C protease cleavage site (SGVTFQ\u2193GP). This strategy enables a two-step Ni-affinity chromatography purification. Hydrogenated M pro was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to the established procedures. 52 Partially deuterated M pro was expressed using a bioreactor and purified, as described recently. 42 Final protein yields for hydrogenated M pro preparations averaged \u223c4 mg per 1 g cells (\u223c17 mg/L of cell culture), whereas partially deuterated preparations yielded \u223c0.8 mg per 1 g of cell paste (\u223c40 mg/L of cell culture).",

Correctness of sidechain conformations, hydrogen bonding, and orientations of D 2 O water molecules in the structure was based on the mF o \u2212 DF c difference neutron scattering length density maps. The mF o \u2212 DF c and mF o \u2212 DF c neutron scattering length density maps were then examined to determine the correct orientations of hydroxyl (Ser, Thr, Tyr), thiol (Cys), and ammonium (Lys) groups as well as protonation states of the enzyme residues and compound 1. The protonation states of some disordered side chains on the protein surface could not be obtained directly and remained ambiguous. Water molecules were refined as D 2 O where water oxygen atoms were centered on their electron density peaks and each molecule was rotated in accordance with the neutron scattering length density maps. Hydrogen positions in the protein were modeled as deuterium atoms because the protein was partially deuterated. Compound 1 is ionizable at the piperazine amine and was modeled as the protonated species with a D atom. Occupancies of D atoms were refined individually within the range of \u22120.56 (pure H) to 1.00 (pure D) because the neutron scattering length of H is \u22120.56 times that of D. Before depositing the neutron structure to the PDB, coordinates of a D atom were split into two records corresponding to an H and a D partially occupying the same site, both with positive partial occupancies that add up to unity.

Purified wild-type M pro was diluted from a stock solution to 60 \u03bcM and dialyzed overnight at 4\u00b0C against 25 mM Tris\u2212HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP (ITC buffer). The concentration of the enzyme was estimated based on its 280 nm absorbance. Stock solutions of inhibitors were diluted in ITC buffer to 0.3 mM and contained a final concentration of 0.5% DMSO. The protein solution was also adjusted to contain the same concentration of DMSO. Titrations were performed at 28\u00b0C on an iTC200 microcalorimeter (Malvern Instruments Inc., Westborough, Massachusetts). A control titration of buffer with the inhibitor showed a negligible response. Data were processed and plots were generated using the Origin software provided with the instrument. For competitive inhibitors that bind at only one site, the dissociation constant (K d = 1/K a ) is equivalent to the inhibition constant measured by enzyme kinetics (K i ).",

MD simulations were performed for three different systems (ligand-free, or apo-, M pro ; M pro in complex with compound 1; and M pro with HL-3-68) to study the protein stability upon binding with different ligands. The simulation runs were carried out with the OpenMM package on Nvidia V100 GPUs. The protein atomic interactions were described with the Amberff14SB force field and tip3p water model. The ligands, compound 1, and HL-3-68 were modeled using the antechamber package with the GAFF force field. Each system was neutralized with counterions. The nonbonded interactions were cut off at 10 \u00c5 and long-range interactions were calculated with the particle mesh Ewald method. The simulations were run at 310 K and 2 fs time steps with the Langevin integrator. The chemical bonds with hydrogen atoms were fixed, and the system pressure was fixed at 1 bar with a Monte Carlo barostat. Each of the three systems was equilibrated using a procedure described in the previous work 40 and three replicas (each with a 250 ns production run) were generated; snapshots from the simulation were saved every 50 ps. For all of the trajectories, we calculated the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) for the overall protein structure and root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) to quantify perresidue fluctuations.",
