The multivariate analysis revealed the factors independently associated with statin treatment to be younger age, not being institutionalized, a higher Barthel score, a lower Charlson score, a higher body mass index, and a history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. Conclusions A significant percentage of nonagenarians-mainly less frail patients with more comorbidities-in the Community of Madrid receive statin treatment.

            "text": "Meta-analyses of clinical trials have confirmed that treatment with statins [5] or with lipid-lowering agents in general [6] reduces cardiovascular events in patients aged over 75 years. However, when differentiating between patients with and without previous cardiovascular disease, the beneficial effect did not reach statistical significance in those undergoing primary prevention and aged over 70 years [6] . In the last two years, numerous retrospective studies have been published to determine the effect of statins in patients over 75 years of age without cardiovascular disease [13] [14] [15] . Using the database of primary care in Catalonia (Spain), [14] . In contrast, in studies conducted in Korea [15] and the United States [13] , initiation of statins in this age group was associated with decreased cardiovascular events and mortality. Finally, in a study conducted in France, the withdrawal of lipid-lowering treatment in primary prevention patients aged over 75 years was associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular admissions in the following two years [16] . Therefore, data from observational studies and meta-analyses appear to support lipid-lowering treatment in the elderly without cardiovascular disease, although we must await the conclusions of several clinical trials currently underway to resolve this issue. Consistent with our findings, data from other authors reveal less frequent prescription of statins with increasing age in elderly patients, probably related to the progressive increase in frailty and lower life expectancy [17] [18] [19] . Similarly, most studies show that statins are taken less frequently by women, regardless of age [17] [18] [19] . This is because they are perceived by health care personnel as having a lower cardiovascular risk and, therefore, receive less treatment and less intensive treatment [20] and partly because of a higher rate of discontinuation of statin treatment [21] . In our study, being male was associated with statin therapy, this association was almost significant in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.065). As expected, the presence of established cardiovascular disease is closely associated with statins in elderly patients [19] . In our population of nonagenarians, slightly more than half of the patients in secondary prevention received statins, whereas fewer than one in four did so among those with no known cardiovascular disease. The presence of diabetes mellitus, is also related to greater use of statins owing to its higher associated cardiovascular risk, as has also been shown elsewhere both in primary [19] and in secondary prevention [18] . In our study, not being institutionalized, lower dependency, as calculated by the Barthel index, and higher body mass index, as markers of good health and longer life expectancy, were associated with a higher probability of receiving treatment with statins. Therefore, statins in nonagenarians are associated with high cardiovascular risk and better health status.",
