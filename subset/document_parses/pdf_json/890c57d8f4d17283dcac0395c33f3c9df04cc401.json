Dynamics like globalization has led these countries to create tourism services with global standards, however, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, these services have been affected as shown the social networks. This fact led to a change in the perception of tourists against a destination. In order to unify this change in an objective manner, we propose a Deep Learning model that integrates a PANAS scale (Positive and Negative Affect Scale) (PANAS-tDL), to characterize a tourist destination based on a series of potential factors (weather conditions, healthy, holidays, seasonality and economic factors) identified in comments obtained from a social network like Twitter. The results obtained by the PANAS-tDL model show its good performance evaluating the change of perception of tourists against four destinations affected by COVID-19, taking as reference the 11-sentiment scale defined by PANAS-t scale. Thanks to adaptation capacity, the model can be extended to evaluate the change in perception of tourists using different social networks and to evaluate different marketing strategies to promote a destination.",

In a second stage (Autonomy Validation), the comments were additionally grouped taking into account four tourist destinations as Colombia, Italy, Spain and USA, and for before and during COVID-19 worldwide pandemic to analyze the change of perception of tourists against this destinations. The results show that the model reached compression rates above 80% on average for the configuration of stacked neuron layers, taking as a reference the first layer of neurons, and an auto-encoder strategy [21] . Regarding a learning stage, the model reached sensitivity and specificity indices above 85% on average against the classification of comments as PA or NA, while for the characterization of the categories defined by the PANAS-t scale (11-sentiments), the model reached IOAs above 95% on average taking as reference the Log-logistic function that defines the FCL. According to the second stage (Autonomy Validation), it is important to note that the model managed to identify the negative effects that the COVID-19 pandemic generates on four tourist destinations defined by this study in absence of a learning process, which shows, in general, the good behaviour achieved by the model in the characterization of comments on Twitter for a specific tourist destination in an objective manner.",

Despite the number of layers and the number of neurons for the first layer was increased, the IC index did not change approximately from 8-layers and for 800-neurons as show the IC curve (Green line). Table 5 shows the results reached by the model against the classification of comments as PA and NA sentiments in the Frist Stage, taking the Confusion Matrix as reference. The results show that the PANAS-tDL model reached classification percentages above 85% on average for the sensitivity (Eq. 6) and for specificity (Eq. 7), which shows a priori the good behavior of the model according to the Softmax activation function for a n n \u00bc 1 (Eq. 2).

The radar chart shows the slight trend of the PANAS-tDL model to classify PA comments in a better way, due to a lower value reached against the SI index. This behaviour was mainly due to the complexity involved in the classification of sentiments in the limit between PA and NA, as shown in the confusion matrix. Figure 4 shows the CDF given by the PANAS-tDL (Orange line -SI = 0.750858), taking as reference the CDF that represent the Baseline scenario for the validation of the proposed model (Blue Line SI = 0.617066462). It can be seen that the model reach an IOA above to 95% in the characterization of sentiments in absence of a learning process, despite the IOA value was located slightly below the IOA achieved by the model in the learning stage. However, this fact guarantees the good behaviour of the model in the characterization of sentiments in the absence of a learning process. According to CDF (Orange line), the proposed model has a slight trend to classify in a better way NA comments as shown a higher SI value reached. This behaviour was extended from the learning stage. Figure 5 show the CDF for the comments grouped under the label of Colombia for before and the current impact of COVID-19. Here, it can be seen that the CDF (currently -COVID-19) showed characteristics similar to slender CDFs (Orange line SI = 0.92693). Regarding the Baseline scenario for Colombia (Blue line -SI = 0.4707791), the CDFs given by the model showed long-tail structures with a SI value much higher, which indicates the presence of a large number of NA comments regarding this tourism destination. This behaviour can be observed in the radar chart (Fig. 6) , where the currently comments for Italy were located toward the negative zone (Right side Orange line), standing out in the comments sentiments like Fear, Sadness and Hostility, which clearly shows the impact of COVID-19 on this tourism destination [22, 25] . Table 6 shows the values reached by the proposed model for P(s). Here, you can see how the perception of tourists evolved into NA comments for Italy destination (change perception), taking as reference the Eqs. 9 & 10. This fact corroborates once again the good performance of the PANAS-tDL in absence of a learning process, constituting as a tool for the objective evaluation of sentiments based on comments in Twitter social network.
