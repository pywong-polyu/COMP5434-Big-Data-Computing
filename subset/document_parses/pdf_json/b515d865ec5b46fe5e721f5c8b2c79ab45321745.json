The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to the way most people live, work, study, socialise, and access health care; with widespread travel bans, border closures, lockdowns, social distancing, isolation and quarantine measures enforced by many countries. These changes and their ramifications (e.g., unemployment, social isolation), along with fears of COVID-19 are likely to have significant and long-term impacts on the mental health of the community. Research into past pandemics, such as the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), has shown higher rates of illness fears, psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress), insomnia and other mental health problems (e.g., posttraumatic stress) in people with pre-existing mental illness, frontline health care workers [2] , and survivors of severe and life-threatening cases of the disease [3] [4] [5] [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1114, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1186, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1190, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1194, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1198, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "High quality research into the mental health impacts of COVID-19 is urgently needed [7] to inform evidence-based policy decisions, prevention efforts, treatment programs and community support systems, particularly for those who are most vulnerable and those who are at risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes during and after this pandemic. In marked contrast to the rapidly growing literature into the physical health consequences of COVID-19, there is currently limited information about the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak in the general population.

In another survey of 1210 members of the general public (half of whom were students) conducted between 31 st January to 2 nd February 2020, Wang et al.

In contrast, engaging in precautionary behaviours (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) have been associated with lower distress [8, 22] .

In that study, we found one in three participants were very or extremely concerned about an outbreak, and that participants perceived their risk of personally contracting COVID-19 as relatively high (rated as 70% likelihood of contracting the virus). Moreover, most participants (61%) expected that they would experience moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19 if they contracted the virus. We did not measure mental health outcomes, or how afraid individuals were of personally contracting COVID-19. Therefore, the current study extended our previous survey and investigated the mental health of Australian residents during a 12-day period from 27 th March to 7 th April 2020, which is now considered to be the time of the peak in new cases, and the steady decline in new cases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 422, "end": 426, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "There were several restrictions in place at the time of recruitment, including 1.5 metre social distancing rules [27] , and international travel bans.

Our primary aim was to provide the first snapshot of the mental health of the general community during the initial COVID-19 outbreak (and enforcement of social distancing laws) in Australia. The second aim was to explore the relationship between specific demographic and sample characteristics with depression, anxiety and stress, to identify factors that are associated with increased vulnerability for poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. While we acknowledge that the data from an online survey may not be representative of the entire population, they provide an important opportunity to i) identify vulnerable groups who are at risk of poorer mental health during COVID-19, ii) determine the socio-demographic and psychological factors that predict psychological distress, and iii) examine whether the findings from past pandemics, and from China, apply to the Australian context during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on research from past pandemics, and Chinese research, we expected that between 20-35% would worry about contracting COVID-19 and experience elevated psychological distress, and that specific demographic variables including younger age, being a student, unemployed, female, or with lower educational attainment would predict higher distress levels in the current cohort.

We found higher than expected levels of acute distress based on research in China during the COVID-19 pandemic [8] , and compared to normative data [37, 46] . Between 20.3-24.1% of the current sample were experiencing severe or extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress, and a further 18-22% moderate symptoms.

Estimates of the rates of psychological distress in other countries, such as Spain, India and Italy have varied widely, but range from one quarter [24] to 70% of participants [19] . The differences between our results and past studies may be due to the high proportion of people with pre-existing mental health diagnoses (70%) in our sample, which have been shown to be a vulnerable group [8, 11] , or because of the significant proportion with a self-reported chronic illness (38%), who may be more susceptible to more severe COVID-19 disease, and therefore more distressed.

While these symptoms are not necessarily indicative of illness anxiety disorder, high health anxiety is likely to have significant ramifications for health service utilisation. Responses to health anxiety vary substantially, ranging from a complete avoidance of doctors, hospitals, and medical settings due to fear, to the other end of the spectrum of excessive, repeated, and unnecessary health service use, diagnostic testing, emergency visits and paramedic calls [52] .

Consistent with the findings of SARS pandemics, and our previous study, we found moderate perceptions of risk of contracting the virus. Participants rated on average that there was a 50% likelihood of contracting the virus personally, and higher perceived risk was associated with higher depression and stress levels. In the current cohort approximately one third of participants expected COVID-19 to lead to severe symptoms (32.1%), and in some cases death (4%), which is higher than in our previous study, where we found only 25% expected severe symptoms. The expected severity of the COVID-19 illness differs markedly to the reality for most people, as studies show that 80% of people will experience no or mild symptoms [55] . These findings reinforce the need for education campaigns to address these misperceptions, especially as research has shown that these beliefs are associated with engagement with distress. These risk perceptions explained a relatively small amount of variance in the regression analyses, with perceived control over COVID-19 a consistent predictor of better mental health and higher perceived severity of illness associated with higher depression and anxiety. However, it is important to note that other predictors, including loneliness, financial stress, uncertainty, demographic factors, and prior history of mental and chronic illness were stronger predictors of distress. These findings suggest that sociodemographic factors, and general uncertainty about the future, financial stress, and physical and mental health status may play a more important role in contributing to psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic than specific fears or perceived risk of contracting the virus. However, it is also possible that individuals with these risk factors were already distressed prior to the pandemic. The small variance explained by the COVID-19 variables might also be due to the fact that variance in distress was accounted for other variables (e.g., uncertainty about the future, hygiene behaviours) that were entered in earlier steps of the regression analyses. This finding requires replication, and future studies should examine whether the COVID-19 risk perception variables predict behavioural responses to the pandemic (e.g., hand-washing, social distancing), contamination fears, or health anxiety to a greater degree than general psychological distress.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Similar to Wang et al.

In previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours, such as handwashing have been associated with lower distress and anxiety, suggesting behavioural control may be protective for mental health. However, in the current cohort we found some inconsistent results, with engagement in more hygiene behaviours associated with higher anxiety and stress levels (they were not associated with depression). These findings differ to the findings of Wang et al. [8] during the early stages of the epidemic in China, where the use of precautionary measures, such as avoiding sharing utensils, hand hygiene and wearing masks were associated with lower stress, anxiety and depression. However, the current findings are consistent with some research from the SARS epidemic, in which moderate levels of anxiety were associated with higher uptake of precautionary behaviours [56] .
