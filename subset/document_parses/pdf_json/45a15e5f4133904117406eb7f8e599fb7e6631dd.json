Metagenomic analyses have shown that humans, along with for example, domestic animals, wildlife and arthropods, are colonized by an immense community of viruses. The current Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) heightens the need to rapidly detect previously unknown viruses in an unbiased way. The increasing availability of metagenomic data in this era of next-generation sequencing (NGS), along with increasingly affordable sequencing technologies, highlight the need for reliable and comprehensive methods to manage such data. In this article, we present a novel bioinformatics pipeline called LAZYPIPE for identifying both previously known and novel viruses in host associated or environmental samples and give examples of virus discovery based on it. LAZYPIPE is a Unix-based pipeline for automated assembling and taxonomic profiling of NGS libraries implemented as a collection of C\u00fe\u00fe, Perl, and R scripts.",

Analyzing viral data are particularly challenging given the considerable variability in viruses and the low coverage of viral diversity in current databases. It is estimated that a vast majority of virus taxa are yet to be described and classified (Geoghegan and Holmes 2017) . This challenge is further complicated by the high evolutionary rate of viruses leading to emergence of new virus lineages and the relative scarcity of viral genetic material in metagenomic samples (Rose et al. 2016 ). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a high throughput, impartial technology with numerous attractive features compared with established diagnostic methods for virus detection (Mokili, Rohwer, and Dutilh 2012) . NGSbased studies have improved our understanding of viral diversity (Cantalupo et al. 2011) . There is considerable interest within virology to explore the use of metagenomics techniques, specifically in the detection of viruses that cannot be cultured (Smits et al. 2015; Graf et al. 2016) . Metagenomics can also be used to diagnose patients with rare or unknown disease aetiologies that would otherwise require multiple targeted tests (Pallen 2014) or emerging infections for which tests are yet to be developed.",

Nonetheless, the influence of the viral constituent of the microbiome (i.e. virome) has received considerably less attention. Recent research has indicated that both pathogenic and commensal viral species can modulate host immune responses and thereby either prevent or induce diseases (Lim et al. 2015; Neil and Cadwell 2018) . Additionally, recent research has revealed modifications in the virome that are related to diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease (Norman et al. 2015) . Accordingly, there is a need to identify novel viruses that may be established pathogens and to define wider links of the virome with health and disease. Beyond humans, the veterinary, wildlife, arthropod, and environmental viromes have large implications in for example, animal health, zoonotic emergence, and ecosystem research that require new tools to understand and study the virosphere.",

            "text": "Bioinformatics pipelines and algorithms designed for the analysis of NGS microbiome data can be separated into three groups. The first group includes pipelines for virome composition analysis. These pipelines mine the relative abundance and types of viruses present in a given sample. These pipelines include VirusSeeker (Zhao et al. 2017 ), Viral Informatics Resource for Metagenome Exploration (Wommack et al. 2012) , viGEN (Bhuvaneshwar et al. 2018) , the Viral MetaGenome Annotation Pipeline (Lorenzi et al. 2011), and MetaVir (Roux et al. 2014 ). The second group includes pipelines that are designed for bacterial composition analysis, such as MG-RAST (Meyer et al. 2008) . Pipelines in the third group, such as MetaPhlan2 (Truong et al. 2015) , Kraken2 (Wood, Lu, and Langmead 2019) and Centrifuge (Kim et al. 2016) , can perform composition analysis for all known taxa. There are also a number of tools, pipelines, and algorithms for virus discovery, including Genome Detective (Vilsker et al. 2019) , VIP (Li et al. 2016) , PathSeq (Kostic et al. 2011) , SURPI (Naccache et al. 2014) , READSCAN (Naeem, Rashid, and Pain 2013) , VirusFinder (Wang, Jia, and Zhongming 2013) , and MetaShot (Fosso et al. 2017 ). Most of these pipelines are based on homology searches in the nucleotide (nt) or amino acid (aa) space against a local database of reference sequences. Notably, homology searches in the aa space are expected to retrieve more distant homologs, which is key for detecting divergent novel viral sequences.",

            "text": "Lazypipe offers several advantages to the existing methods for taxonomic profiling of viral NGS data. Lazypipe outsources homology search to a separate server eliminating the need to install and update local sequence databases. This is helpful in both reducing the workload on the user and ensuring that all the latest viral sequences are covered by the homology search. Additionally, this feature can significantly reduce the threshold for employing Lazypipe by the less technically savvy researchers. Lazypipe uses SANSparallel (Somervuo and Holm 2015) to search for aa homologs in the UniProtKB database. Searching for homologs in the protein space is expected to retrieve more distant viral homologs than searches with nucleotide sequences (Zhao et al. 2017) . Furthermore, SANSparallel is $100 times faster compared with the BLASTP search (Somervuo and Holm 2015) , which is the default search engine employed by nearly all other annotation pipelines that search the protein space. Lazypipe assembles and annotates viral contigs, thus reducing the workload on the downstream analysis. This function is supported by some other pipelines, such as Metavir (Roux et al. 2014 ) and virMine (Garretto, Hatzopoulos, and Putonti 2019) , but both Metavir and virMine use a much slower BLASTP search and require installation of local sequence databases. Lazypipe implements a flexible stepwise architecture that allows reexecution of individual steps or parts of the analysis. This architecture addresses the increased risk of execution failure that is inherent to the analysis of large NGS libraries. Lazypipe supports data formats that can be used both by human researchers and automated tools. Results are output in the form of intuitive excel tables and interactive graphs, but also, in the form of standardized taxonomic profiles that can be integrated with automated workflows.",

First, primers, short reads and low-quality reads are removed with Trimmomatic (Bolger, Lohse, and Usadel 2014) or fastp (Chen et al. 2018) . Then host reads are filtered by aligning reads against the host genome with BWA-MEM (Li 2013 ) and removing reads with high scoring alignments with SAMtools (Li et al. 2009 ). A threshold of 50 was selected by comparing the pre-assembly mapping of reads to the host genome to the postassembly taxonomic binning of reads (without the host genome filtering). Comparing these for several samples showed that a threshold of 50 removes between 90 and 94 per cent of reads that are assigned to Eukaryota in post-assembly binning while removing only 1-10 per cent of reads that are assigned to Viruses (data omitted). Decreasing this threshold to 30 resulted in removal of only 63-64 per cent of reads assigned to Eukaryota and increased removal of reads assigned to Viruses (18-29%). Increasing threshold to 100 again decreased the number of filtered eukaryotic reads (to 74-86%) with only slight improvement on the number of retained virus reads (0-9%). For the simulated metagenome (Fosso et al. 2017) , setting the threshold to 50 results in filtering 99.93 per cent of host reads and only 0.05 per cent of viral reads (excluding the endogenous retroviral reads, which are filtered to a large extent).

            "text": "Next, taxonomy links generated by SANSparallel and read distribution tables are processed into an abundance table, which summarizes the number of contigs and reads binned to each taxon. Contigs that are mapped to two or more taxa may contribute different fractions of reads to different taxa according to the selected weighting model. In the taxacount model reads are distributed equally between all taxa linked to the contig. In the bitscore model reads are distributed according to the sum of bitscores from the database hits. Here, for each taxon linked to the contig the weight is the ratio of two sums: the sum of bitscores for the contig and taxon, and the sum of all bitscores for the taxon. In our benchmarking we used the bitscore model, which showed a slightly better performance. The raw abundance table is converted to an Excel file (using R) with several spreadsheets, each providing a different view of the acquired data. These views include the abundance of virus taxa (excluding bacteriophages), bacteriophages, bacteria, eukaryotes and, optionally, other high-level domains. For each of these groups, abundances are reported at three taxonomic levels (family, genus, and species). This arrangement allows for a rapid overview of NGS results and convenient 'zooming in' on the taxa of interest. Taxonomic abundances are also presented as an interactive Krona graph (Ondov, Bergman, and Phillippy 2011) , which supports dynamic exploration of abundancies across different taxa. We also convert taxonomic abundances to CAMI Profiling Output Format (Sczyrba et al. 2017) . By providing standardized output we support benchmarking of our pipeline by unbiased third-party evaluation initiatives such as CAMI (Sczyrba et al. 2017) . Standardized output also aims to support simple and stable integration in automated workflows. To simplify accessibility, contigs for different taxa are sorted into a directory structure that follows the taxonomic hierarchy. A summary table is printed that lists all contigs for viruses, bacteriophages, bacteria and eukaryotes along with hits from SANSparallel or Centrifuge search.",

We implement a similar strategy by assigning each taxon a cumulative frequency distribution value (csum), which sums read frequencies mapped to that taxon and the more abundant taxa. We also assign confidence scores based on the csum score: the [0.95%] interval is assigned Confidence 1, the [95%, 99%] Confidence 2 and the tail values [99%, 100%] are assigned Confidence 3.

From the CSF sample, a complete genome with 99 per cent sequence identity with Coxsacievirus B5 (a member of Enterovirus B species) strains AU17EV1 and AU17EV2 (Queensland, Australia; Huang et al. 2017 ) was retrieved. From the two serum samples complete genomes of Coxsackievirus A6 (Enterovirus A species) and Human Parechovirus 3 (Parechovirus A species) were retrieved. From the cerebellum sample a complete genome of TBEV was retrieved. From the nasopharyngeal swab sample originated from the first case of Coronavirus disease 2019 in Finland (Haveri et al. 2020 ), a nearly complete SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome and fragments of Human mastadenovirus C sequences were retrieved (see Table 4 ).",

Many of the existing pipelines are hindered by one or several limitations including large locally installed reference databases, slow homology search engines employed, low sensitivity for novel divergent sequences, low precision/recall performance for viral taxa or the lack of benchmarking for viral taxon retrieval, and the lack of assembling and contig annotation steps in the analysis. These limitations slow down the use of the unbiased sequencing approaches for rapid detection of novel emerging viruses.",

Lazypipe avoids installation of large reference databases by delegating homology search to an external server. This frees the user from the need to install, index and update local reference databases, which can pose serious technical and resource constrains due to the sheer size of the modern sequence databases. By using SANSparallel (Somervuo and Holm 2015) we also make Lazypipe considerably faster than pipelines based on BLASTP, and, simultaneously, render Lazypipe sensitive to highly divergent sequences, because viral peptides tend to be more conservative than nucleotide sequences. Other fast alternatives to BLASTP, such as DIAMOND (Buchfink, Xie, and Huson 2015) , show comparable sensitivity and speed (Medlar and Holm 2018) , but unlike SANSparallel, require installation of local databases.",

Testing on real mock community data demonstrated precision and recall nearing 100 per cent for eukaryotic viruses. The detection of multiple novel viruses from various environmental and clinical samples reported here and in previous studies that used Lazypipe analysis (Forbes et al. 2019; Kuivanen et al. 2019) demonstrates that Lazypipe is also well suited for the detection and characterization of novel and highly divergent viral (Forbes et al. 2019) , and a new tick-borne pathogen Alongshan virus from ticks in Northeast Europe (Kuivanen et al. 2019) .

Reflecting on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation (April 2020) we tested SARS-CoV-2 positive Illumina libraries with Lazypipe and confirmed that the pipeline detected SARS-CoV in nine out of ten libraries with default settings and without SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. This demonstrates the utility of Lazypipe for scenarios in which novel zoonotic viral agents emerge and can be quickly detected by NGS sequencing from clinical samples.Previously, we have published two examples of novel and potentially zoonotic viral agents that were identified with Lazypipe from wild animals that can serve as vectors. A new ebolavirus was identified from faeces and organ samples of Mops condylurus bats in Kenya",
