Such partnerships result not only in a greater impact of published research enhancing the career development of early and later stage researchers, but they also ensure that advances in plant science and crop breeding technologies make a meaningful contribution to society by brokering acceptance of emerging solutions to the world problems. We discuss the evidence showing that despite a lack of funding, scientists in some African countries make a significant contribution to global science output. We consider the criteria for success in establishing long-term scientific partnerships between scientists in developing countries in Southern Africa (\"the South\") and developed countries such as the UK (\"the North\"). We provide our own personal perspectives on the key attributes that lead to successful institutional collaborations and the establishment of sustainable networks of successful \"North-South\" scientific partnerships. In addition, we highlight some of the stumbling blocks which tend to hinder the sustainability of long-term \"North-South\" scientific networks. We use this personal knowledge and experiences to provide guidelines on how to establish and maintain successful long-term \"North-South\" scientific partnerships.",

Moreover, they are a key driver for successful translation of new knowledge to the farmer and agro-industries, as well as the successful development of up-to-date research environments in developing countries, which are often at the frontline of the consequences of global challenges such as climate change. Societies in both developed and developing economies remain uncertain about embracing technologies, such as gene-editing, for building climate change resilientcrops. International partnerships can foster societal acceptance, a necessary condition to regulatory approval and investment. Next generation sequencing technologies provide unprecedented possibilities for reconstructing the complex genomes of crops and powerful new genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas, allow the targeted modification of genes necessary to engineer entirely new traits and preferred trait combinations thus overcoming the incompatibility barriers between species (Bailey-Serres et al., 2019) . The adoption of these high throughput technologies in international scientific partnerships encourages multidisciplinary research approaches and greatly the capacity to extend new knowledge, as well as publishing and the applying the outputs from research. The impact of published research is considerably enhanced providing unprecedented possibilities in the fight for resilient high-yielding crops. Moreover, international partnerships can become important actors in the dissemination of information that satisfies societies' renewed interest in agriculture and alleviate public unease about \"incomprehensible\" scientific innovations that are deeply rooted in consumers' intrinsic care about the food supply (Adams and Loach, 2015) . If successful, such partnerships can be the driving force behind successful policymaking and the associated and much needed private and public investment in plant science research.",

Multidisciplinary partnerships greatly strengthen the scientific activities of all the participants and their technical capabilities by enhancing human-centered design (HCD) pipelines, as well as research breadth, standards and quality. They are the drivers for employment and economic development by facilitating rapid capacity building. The promotion and support of international scientific partnerships is therefore high priority for most countries. Successful outcomes, however, are often determined by the socioeconomic wealth and scientific activities of the scientists in each country. The scientists are ultimately the real \"actors\" and \"facilitators\" of these partnerships, as they very often initiate partnerships by setting up informal contacts and acquaintances. However, all too frequently the scientists have no basic training in how to establish sustainable longterm partnerships that will have the durability to facilitate real benefits to society beyond the lifetime of the initial contracts. If we have learnt anything from humanities efforts to continue to function during the COVID 19 crisis, then it is that current globalization trends and available information and communication technologies and distance is making no longer a stumbling block to engaging in international partnerships. The participating institutions must have the capacity to provide the required infrastructure, as well as the essentially equipment, laboratories and facilities, as well as the legal frameworks required to realize successful scientific partnerships. In this article we provide perspectives and guidelines based on our own experience of the factors to be considered when establishing scientific partnerships with African countries. We highlight the potential hurdles that have to be overcome in order to establish successful longterm, sustainable scientific partnerships.",

However, the establishment of sustainable scientific partnerships with African colleagues is often challenging. This can be due to many factors, such as political instability and civil wars, colonial scientific legacies; structural adjustments and economic decline, together with a continuation of brain drain that are beyond the control of the immediate partners (Mouton, 2018). However, many such initiatives focus too much on immediate scientific goals and they fail to identify the key aspirations, needs and requirements of each partner for both short and long-term sustainability. For partnerships to be sustainable, they must be built on mutual respect and shared knowledge. They should be fair and equal with respect to ownership and beyond, in order to strengthen capacity, improve development and promote scientific outcomes (Carbonnier and Kontinen, 2014) .",

Governmental investments in research and development (R&D) expressed as proportion of gross domestic product across Africa averages between 0.2% and 0.3% (Table 1) . This low investment in R&D makes African scientists highly dependent on foreign funding to support research activities . This funding is often skewed by the investors interest (i.e., mostly toward health-and agricultural related fields) rather than the needs of the local communities and researchers. Inadequate funding has negative impacts on the quantity and quality of research outputs because it results in a lack of infrastructural support, minimal access to new technologies and hence, the low novelty and competitiveness of outputs, which in turn leads to poor publication records and limited access to scientific journals (Langer et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "A recent survey reported that apart from South Africa and Tunisia, most research in Africa is still supported by funding agencies based in Europe, the United States and China (Figure 1) . Private investment and funding from the National Research Foundation of South Africa are the biggest contributors to research funding in South Africa, while Tunisia's science ministry makes a significant contribution to research funding in Northern Africa. Research in most other African countries depends almost exclusively on funding agencies based outside the continent, because national organizations are unable to give sufficient support to research activities that would assist in the establishment or . Over the past decade the African Union in partnership with the EU has invested over $US20 million in research, of which about 7 Million has supported R&D projects related to agriculture (African Union, https://au.int/ sites/default/files/newsevents/workingdocuments/27671 -wd-23_-_aurg-booklet-draft-v3_0.pdf). A prevailing problem with such funding models however, is that most financial donors still apply demand-driven approaches and mainly support African priorities defined by donors. These donors are often constrained by government priorities and they do not fund essential underpinning innovative research that would drive African science forward and create the essential cohort of highly trained and internationally completive African researchers that would form the backbone of next generation science in Africa. For example in the agricultural field, such funding restrictions mean that most African scientists are forced work on crops that are perceived important by the local donors or governments. This emphasis can be a severe impediment to knowledge generation, not least because such donor-imposed constraints may neglect other local crops that could answer important research questions and that may also add value in terms of food security. Although scientists working in agriculture may have access to international research funding, the number of scientific partnerships with Europe is generally much lower than in political or medical science fields, despite the importance of agriculture to African economies. For example, academics affiliated with the University of Pretoria in South Africa participated in 21-EU-funded projects in the field of Natural/Agricultural Sciences from 2006-2019, of these 14 were within the category of Agriculture/Plant Sciences. However, only one project was coordinated by the University of Pretoria, the rest being under the coordination of an EU partner. Also, in all these partnerships, limited funding (from 50-100,000 Euros) was distributed to the African partner. Similarly, academics from Stellenbosch University, another leading academic institution in South Africa, were participants in 13 EU-funded Agriculture/Plant Sciencerelated projects since 2014. Again, coordination was undertaken by the EU partners, with minimal funding allocated to Africa. Many EU-funded initiatives, such as the European Cooperation in Science and Technology COST program, are co-funded by the Department of Science and Technology in South Africa and they are designed to establish global scientific networks and aim to establish longer-term scientific partnerships.",

            "text": "The UK Development Partnerships in Higher Education (DelPHE) (https://www.britishcouncil.org/partner/trackrecord/development-partnerships-higher-education) seeks to establish partnerships between scientists in the UK and Africa. A key aim is to strengthen the capacity of higher education institutions so that they could achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Germany promotes partnerships between German and African scientists, particularly in countries such as Namibia and South Africa, under the umbrella of sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity in Africa, in the program BIOTA AFRICA (http://www. biota-africa.de/index.php?Page_ID\u00bcL900). However, the number of scientific partnerships originating from such R&D and/or network programs is generally still low in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, South Africa makes a significant contribution to these international scientific partnerships (Leydesdorff et al., 2013) . The low number of international partnerships with Africa is also clearly reflected by the small percentage of international exchanges supported by the Royal Society, UK, which is one of the largest European supporters of international scientific exchange programs globally. For example, between 2011 and 2017, only 2.6% Royal Society supported exchanges took place between the UK and African countries compared with 38% with Asian countries (https://royalsociety.org/ grants-schemes-awards/grants/international-exchanges/). Bibliometric data accumulated over the past decade indicates that research outputs increased significantly (+ 33%) in Africa. For example, 182,177 outputs were recorded for the period between 2005 and 2010, while 275,466 research papers were published from 2011 to 2015. It is worthy of note, however, that approximately 74% of all the outputs originated from only six countries (i.e., South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Nigeria and Morocco) on the continent (Mouton and Blanckenberg, 2018) ( Figure 2 ). Interestingly, an analysis by the same authors revealed that African scientists contributed more papers than the overall world average (3.2%) in 86 of the total of 273 subject categories in The Web of Science. Crucially, African researchers made a significant contribution to global output (more than 4%) in nine fields i.e. tropical medicine; parasitology; infectious diseases; public, environmental and occupational health; water resources; ecology; immunology; zoology; and plant sciences. These results clearly reflect realities and priorities in the African continent including the extreme richness in biodiversity, and the urgent need to invest much effort in the study of tropical diseases that plague many African countries ( Figure 1 ). There is also a direct correlation between R&D investment and the success of research activities. Countries with a stronger R&D investment, whether via direct Government investments (South Africa and Tunisia) or via foreign funding tend to be more productive over a 10year period ( Figure 3 ). These countries also traditionally have stronger international scientific partnerships with funding from outside Africa. This provides a firm foundation for the observed contribution of double the amount of scientific papers, compared to the number of outputs produced by researchers with no international funding support.",

            "text": "There are several reasons why it is beneficial for a scientist working in the \"North\" to interact with African scientists particularly in the field of Agricultural and/or Pant Sciences/ Biodiversity. Scientists in the \"North\" might, for example, have better access to the specific environments existing in Africa, with field studies and open air laboratories or other natural resources in the \"South\" for their research that is not available in the \"North.\" For example, the access to the African flora or pests and diseases that are not available in their own countries or regions, are key drivers for a \"North-South\" scientific partnership. Since Africa is certainly no longer perceived as the \"dark Continent,\" scientists from the \"North\" might also be interested to tap into local indigenous knowledge, such as natural resources, resource management ensuring food security and traditional practices that are not available in the \"North.\" However, it is crucial that the partner in the \"South\" is equal in status and in that realization of the outcomes of the scientific partnership and not simply the provider of a specific resource. For example, factors such as providing an interesting species, allowing field trials in the \"South,\" that are not allowed in the \"North,\" or simply filling a place in a proposal so that the partner in the \"North\" has a better chance of success are unlikely to result in a longterm successful scientific partnership. Balancing the needs, aspirations and interests of all the scientists in such partnership is, however, not a simple task. It is particularly challenging when the funding is unequal between partners, and if for example most of the funding is retained by the institution from the \"North\" (Blagescu and Young, 2005; Bradley, 2008) . Financial models differ between institutions but many universities and other organizations in Africa do not have the financial means to absorb and/or support research for interim periods for example while awaiting the release of funding. Such factors slow down the production of deliverables and result in conflicts in due dates/expectations.",

Partnerships are not driven only by the skills, reputations and innovative ideas of individuals, but rather by the complementarity of their interests, knowledge and skill sets. Partners should be willing and able to share infrastructure and data, and to strive for joint publications. All partners should also consider the needs and the advantages of any planned partnership carefully in advance of any commitments. Mutual trust and respect based on a shared scientific vision and agreed common goals is vital to the success of any partnership. Furthermore, any interaction with a partner who does not bring additional or useful expertise and resources to the table is doomed to fail. Successful partnerships can sometimes prevail over long periods with very little funding because of visible mutual benefits.

In our studies, for example, plant stress biology is a common \"interest\" (Box 1). Most of Sub Saharan Africa is in the grip of climate change-associated variability in weather patterns with accompanying changes in the spread of pests and diseases (Botha et al., 2020) . The focus of our studies on plant stress biology is especially useful in building platforms for scientific cooperation and expanding partnerships. The negative impacts of environmental stress e.g. abiotic stresses, including drought or biotic stresses such as insect pests on crop productivity, is a global problem. Hence, finding funding to support longer-term partnerships is somewhat easier because we address the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. The inclusion of a major crop, such as soybean and wheat, which are of interest to both Europe and Africa, is also important. Lessons learned from the partnership are presented in Box 1. Significant benefits come through joint projects on important model plants, such as Arabidopsis, tobacco and poplar, in which the consequences of genetic modification can be tested and the effects of specific gene targets characterized. Such activities result in an increased number and quality of research outputs (Kunert et al., 2016; Quain et al., 2015) . For example, in total, Professors Kunert and Foyer have published 36 joint peer-reviewed articles in International Journals together. Of these, 25 papers that were published in the last 18 years include other African researchers and their partner countries. Moreover, over the same period a further 7 joint publications were achieved through collaborations between Professor Foyer and other colleagues in Africa. These numbers highlight how successful partnerships can be in achieving significant research outputs.",

This was a distinct advantage in finding governmental support for our research activities, because we are able to obtain funding in the form of stipends, scholarships and bursaries, which supported capacity building through staff and student training. In these partnerships two African students undertook the PhD studies through the Commonwealth Split-Site Scholarship Program, and 15 other African researchers undertook joint MSc, PhD or post-doctoral training studies through similar financial instruments. All of these trainees now have good jobs in Academia, agro-industry or Government, mainly in Africa but also in other countries. These facts bear testimony to the benefits of joint training programs offered by the partnerships. Moreover, the associated technologies that were applied in these studies were successfully transferred from Southern Africa to the rest of Africa allowing rapid development in several African partnerships. This partnership also produced improved model and crop plants that have improved tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought and low temperatures (Kunert et al., 2016; Le Roux et al., 2019; Quain et al., 2015) . The development and application of the biotechnological tools for plant improvement against environmental stress has become the major focus of many joint funding applications by scientists worldwide in collaboration with African partners.",

In general, African scientists are very poorly funded with much less resources than their fellow scientists in the \"North\" (Table 1) . Although the situation varies from country to country, most African universities and science councils are confounded by poor or outdated infrastructure with inadequate instructional technologies (Saywerr, 2004) .

Academic institutions in Africa often have large student numbers and underqualified academic staff (The Star, 2019). African scientists can be overwhelmed by teaching duties and the associated paperwork. This allows little time for the research and other activities required to set up successful long-term scientific partnerships. Unfortunately, the drop-out rates of students at tertiary level in many African countries is high, with very few students that enroll for degree programs finishing, and there are few Masters Programs. This means that African academics can have little or no practical training in the laboratory. This trend has dire consequences for the educational system at large, because the number of academics (who undertake the teaching these institutions) who have PhD degrees is low (The Star, 2019). A lack of PhD-level training can not only give rise to insecurity but also represent a severe logistical challenge even at planning stages of scientific partnerships. In such cases, it is crucial that goals and expectations are realistic. It is therefore important to recognize and build on the strengths of the African scientists, who can have extensive field experience, knowledge of the agro-ecological systems and cultural practices, as well as crucial local and farm-level networks. The lack of appropriate technical skills can then be addressed through workshops and training courses as part of the partnership and capacity building program. Many funding instruments are available to support of these types of initiatives (e.g. the British Council funded workshops).",

The successful completion of a joint research activity is rewarding but the outcomes can be transient particularly if the partnership is not sustained. Funding in Africa comes in bursts, arriving from agencies with different drivers and priorities. The arrival of new funding can result in activities that totally undo the achievements of the previous project. Hence, long-term scientific partnerships are crucial to the effective translation of research outputs into society. Sustainability can only be achieved, if the partners are supported by effective and efficient institutional structures. It is thus recommended that all new funding initiatives provide training of financial support staff in project management. Many African scientists currently have to manage the administration of finances, instead of focusing solely on the science. Such messages resonate with policy-makers and investors after decades of declining investment in areas such as agriculture and food security research.",

Figure 4 summarizes some of the important contributing factors and hurdles that were found to be important in our partnerships, and through the two case studies presented here. Successful \"North-South\" scientific partnerships within Africa, and between African scientists and those from developed countries (such as the UK) will be increasingly important in knowledge generation, as well as the establishment of world leading R&D in African institutions. Relevant research networks that advance global research agendas, for example in agriculture, are important priorities for governments in both the \"North\" and the \"South.\" We consider that joint activities will enable African science to find its true place in being a global science, initiating and driving completely new fields of endeavor and research. Sustainability requires long-term commitment and funding on a global scale. We consider that Africa has the potential not only to produce enough food for its own population (Foyer et al., 2019) but also to make a significant contribution to global food security. If justice and fairness prevail, long-term scientific partnerships will be successful and be a key driver in the success of African science.",
