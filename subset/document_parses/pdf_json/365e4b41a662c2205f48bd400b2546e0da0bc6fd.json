            "text": "Irrefutable links between cigarette smoking and lung cancer risk 1 legislative efforts in the United States and other industrialized nations to prevent initiation of smoking in minors and reduce cigarette addiction among adults. Decreasing cigarette consumption has been offset by the use of relatively unregulated cigarette alternatives, such as communal smoking of hookah tobacco (shisha) by means of water pipe. 2 Although traditionally observed among various cultures throughout the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and North Africa, water pipe smoking, often known as hookah smoking, is rapidly becoming more prevalent worldwide. In the United States, an estimated 10% to 20% of adolescents and young adults are current hookah smokers. [2] [3] [4] Because shisha burns at a lower temperature than cigarette tobacco (450 C versus 900 C) and is cooled and \"filtered\" by water, many smokers perceive hookah (particularly flavored blends) to be a safe alternative to cigarettes. 2, 5 Nevertheless, during a typical hookah session that lasts approximately 1 hour, individuals inhale considerably more smoke than inhaled by smoking a conventional cigarette (9.8 liter versus 0.55 liter, respectively) 6 ; as such, a hookah session results in approximately 1.7-, 6.5-, and 46-fold more nicotine, carbon monoxide, and tar exposures relative to a conventional cigarette. [6] [7] [8] Whereas hookah smoke has much lower levels of carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) per unit volume than cigarette smoke, a typical hookah session delivers approximately 20 times more total PAHs and nearly 50 times more heavy PAHs than a conventional cigarette. 9 Furthermore, relative to conventional cigarette smoke, hookah smoke has higher levels of carcinogenic metals, such as arsenic, lead, and chromium. 10 Thus, depending on which chemicals are used for comparison, carcinogen exposures from a single hookah session have been estimated to be equivalent to smoking 10 to 50 cigarettes. 9, 11 Despite potential health hazards of hookah smoking, 12 associations between this activity and human cancers have not been firmly established. The present study evaluated global epigenomic and transcriptomic effects of hookah smoke relative to conventional cigarette smoke in human respiratory epithelial cells.",

Water pipe condensates (WPCs) were generated from Al-Fakher unflavored shisha tobacco with quick-lighting charcoal disks (Three Kings Brand, Bladel, Holland) on perforated foil above the tobacco using a Borgwaldt-S1000 shisha smoking machine. A total of 170 puffs were used to fully smoke each bowl of hookah; puff time was 20 seconds. At the 100th puff, an additional half charcoal disk was added to the bowl for optimal ignition of the tobacco. The condensates were trapped on preweighed Cambridge glass fiber filters that were then air-died for 1 hour and reweighed, and condensates were extracted from the filters by continuous shaking in corresponding cell culture media without DMSO for 3 hours to yield stock solutions (4 mg tar/mL), which were then further dissolved in SAGM or keratinocyte serum-free media.",

Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that CSC and WPC mediated dose-dependent up-regulation of xenobiotic response genes in cultured respiratory epithelial cells (representative results pertaining to CYP1A1 are depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1A ). CYP1A1 induction by 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL WPC approximated that observed for 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL CSC, which we have used previously in our smoke exposure studies. 14 Additional experiments revealed that CSC and WPC mediated dose-dependent growth inhibition in SAEC, human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC), and HSAEC ( Supplementary Fig. 1B) . The growth inhibitory effects of 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL WPC approximated those observed for 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL CSC. Because we have previously estimated these CSC concentrations to correspond to approximately 0.5 to 1 pack-per-day exposures in humans, 14 and because a hookah session yields approximately 46-fold more tar than a conventional cigarette, 6 we chose to use 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL WPC for definitive experiments. These WPC concentrations were twofold to sixfold lower than those used by Rammah et al. 15 and Shihadeh et al. 16 in their studies pertaining to the effects of WPC on growth and signal transduction in lung cancer cells.",

Review of TCGA and Oncomine data sets confirmed repression of FILIP1L and ABI3BP in lung cancers relative to normal lung ( Fig. 6A and D) . qRT-PCR experiments using primers recognizing all FILIP1L transcripts and primers specific for variant 2 revealed dosedependent repression of FILIP1L in SAEC and to a somewhat lesser extent, HBEC after CSC or WPC exposures ( Fig. 6B ; left and right panels, respectively). Consistent with previous observations, 21 FILIP1L protein levels were not detected in proliferating SAEC or HBEC (data not found). In addition, consistent with bisulfite sequencing analysis of the FILIP1L promoter in cultured lung cancer cells, 21 methylation-specific PCR experiments revealed that CSC and WPC increased DNA methylation within a CpG island in the promoter region of variant 2 in SAEC and HBEC (Fig. 6C) . Additional qRT-PCR and immunoblot experiments confirmed that CSC and WPC mediated dose-dependent decreases in ABI3BP in SAEC and HBEC (Fig. 6E) . No CpG island was identified within the ABI3BP promoter, suggesting DNA methylation is not a primary mechanism of CSC-and WPC-mediated repression of this putative tumor-suppressor gene in respiratory epithelial cells. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that downregulation of ABI3BP coincided with increased occupancy of EZH2 (a core component of PRC-2) with a concomitant increase in the PRC-2-mediated repressive histone mark, H3K27me3, and a decrease in the histone activation mark H3K4me3 within the ABI3BP regulatory region (Fig. 6F) . Collectively, these findings reveal that CSC and WPC silence mediators of senescence in human respiratory epithelial cells by DNA methylation and polycomb mechanisms.",

Of particular concern regarding the globalization of hookah smoking are observations that in addition to inherent health risks, this activity increases susceptibility to initiation of cigarette smoking; as such, hookah smoking has been referred to as a \"gateway\" to cigarette addiction. 28 In this study, we observed that similar to CSC, WPC mediates dose-dependent reductions in global levels of H4K20me3 and H4K16ac in respiratory epithelial cells. These histone alterations, which have been designated \"hallmarks of cancer\" have been linked to epigenetic derepression of DNA repeats and retrotransposons resulting in genomic instability. 29, 30 Loss of H4K20me3 and decreased H4K16ac levels have been observed in large percentages of human lung cancers and their precursor lesions. 31 The mechanisms by which CSC and WPC mediate these rapid and dynamic histone alterations are a focus of ongoing investigation in our laboratory.",

Overall, there was a tendency for the immortalized lines (HBEC; HSAEC) to be more responsive to CSC and less responsive to WPC compared with SAEC. In addition, more cancer-associated transcripts were modulated by CSC than WPC across all five lines (Supplementary  Table 18 ). Relatively limited overlap of transcriptome signatures was observed between CSC and WPC in either SAEC cultures or HBEC and HSAEC. Presently, we are unable to ascribe these differences to variations in either unique components or relative levels of specific carcinogens because the complexities of the condensates have precluded simple comparison by mass spectroscopy or high-performance liquid chromatography techniques, and there are no published data pertaining to this issue. In addition, limited overlap of CSC-or WPC-mediated transcriptome signatures was observed between short-term SAEC and immortalized HBEC and HSAEC, suggesting immortalization affects plasticity of transcriptional responses to the condensates. Such heterogeneous responses to CSC and WPC exposures highlight potential limitations of using only one or two cell lines to identify potential biomarkers of malignant transformation in respiratory epithelia of smokers.",

Notably, short-term WPC and CSC exposures mediated epigenetic dysregulation of EREG, FILIP1L, and ABI3BP in human respiratory cells. EREG encodes one of seven ligands that interact with erbB receptors; up-regulation of EREG promotes lung cancers in mice and enhances proliferation, metastatic potential, and stemness of cancer cells. [32] [33] [34] Nearly 70% of NSCLC exhibit overexpression of EREG, with levels tending to be higher in smokers and adenocarcinomas. 32 FILIP1L (also known as DOC1) is up-regulated in prostate epithelial cells as they senesce 35 and inhibits angiogenesis, adhesion, migration, invasion, epithelial-tomesenchymal transition, and metastatic potential of cancer cells by facilitating degradation of b-catenin and subsequent attenuation of Wnt signaling. 22 ABI3BP has been implicated in replicative senescence, maintenance of chromosomal stability, and differentiation of normal stem cells by means of mechanisms that remain elusive. 23, [36] [37] [38] Although our findings suggest a strong selection pressure to upregulate EREG and silence FLILIP1L and ABI3BP during human pulmonary carcinogenesis, additional studies are necessary to determine if these epigenetic perturbations (which conceivably promote the acquisition of stem-like phenotypes) are relevant biomarkers of carcinogen exposure and lung cancer risk in hookah and cigarette smokers.",

Because of the coronavirus disease pandemic, we have been unable to obtain bronchoscopic biopsy samples of respiratory epithelia from asymptomatic hookah smokers to validate our in vitro findings. The fact that some of the transcripts often regulated by WPC across the five cell lines have also been detected in respiratory epithelial cells from \"light\" (intermittent) hookah smokers 40 suggests that our model does indeed reflect in vivo exposures. Collectively, our findings support additional studies to ascertain if hookah-mediated epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations in cultured respiratory epithelial cells are detectable and clinically relevant in hookah smokers. levels in HBEC.
