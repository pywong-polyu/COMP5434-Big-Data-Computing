A recent investigation demonstrated resveratrol and its derivatives to be promising anti-COVID-19 agents. However, conventional cultivation of MA does not meet the demand for its stilbenes, and root quality usually varies between crops. This study established the in vitro non-GMO root culture of MA and optimized the root density, precursor feeding, and elicitors for stilbene productivity. A root culture with optimal inoculum density (3 g/flask of 30 mL medium) accumulated mulberroside A, oxyresveratrol, and resveratrol at 18.7 \u00b1 1.00 mg/g, 136 \u00b1 5.05 \u00b5g/g, and 41.6 \u00b1 5.84 \u00b5g/g dry weight (DW), respectively. The feeding of L-tyrosine shortened the time required to reach the stilbene productive stage. Root cultures co-treated with 200 \u00b5M methyl jasmonate and 2 mg/mL yeast extract accumulated the highest contents of mulberroside A (30.3 \u00b1 2.68 mg/g DW), oxyresveratrol (68.6 \u00b1 3.53 \u00b5g/g DW), and resveratrol (10.2 \u00b1 0.53 \u00b5g/g DW). In summary, root culture is a promising and sustainable source of stilbenes for the development of health products and agents for further investigation as potential anti-COVID-19 agents.",

MA roots contain high levels of bioactive stilbene compounds, including mulberroside A (MuA), oxyresveratrol (OXY), and resveratrol (RES), and thus are an important source of stilbenes for the health product industry. MA roots have also been utilized commercially as an active ingredient in whitening and anti-aging cosmetics. Studies have reported these stilbene compounds to have anti-inflammatory [1] , anti-tyrosinase [2] , and antioxidant [3, 4] properties. Moreover, MA root bark has been used as an ingredient in Chinese Herbal Pharmacopoeia recipes [5] . Because MA phytochemicals exhibit various pharmacological activities related to the oxidative process and aging, MA is in high demand in the industrial production of cosmetic and health-promoting products. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this natural product has also received attention in the search for new drugs, as stilbenes provide pharmacological activity against COVID-19 pathology. Via molecular dynamics simulation, RES has been shown to interact with Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https ://doi.org/10.1007/s0044 9-020-02474 -7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. viral spike protein [6] , and the synthetic isomer of OXY has shown an inhibitory effect on SARS coronavirus replication [7] .

In addition, the season of harvest affects the production level of secondary metabolites [4] . Environmental factors (temperature, soil nutrients, rainfall, etc.) usually influence secondary metabolism and bioactive accumulation in medicinal plants. Therefore, an alternative cultivation system is required to solve the limitations of the MA source and its quality variation. A system of in vitro plant tissue culture is one method of choice, in which the plant is cultured in a synthetic medium under controlled conditions. Such a technique could provide rapid propagation and high accumulation of the desired secondary metabolites. MA culturing systems, including callus, cell suspension, and root cultures, have been reported [10] [11] [12] . The treatment of callus cultures using 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin has been shown to improve OXY and RES production [11] . Elicitation of MA cell suspension cultures with methyl jasmonate (MJ) and yeast extract (YS) has also been shown to enhance OXY and RES production [10] .",

The accumulation of MuA increased in tandem with the growth pattern. However, the MuA content decreased after the growth reached the stationary phase, whereas OXY and RES accumulation increased during this phase. The expression of UDPglycosyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of glucose molecules to RES, was high in the root cap meristem and correlated with cell division and root growth [19] . Therefore, MuA production was high during the exponential growth phase, whereas glycosyltransferase expression decreased in the stationary growth phase, and the accumulation of nonglycosylated compounds (OXY and RES) increased.

The root culture with an initial cell density of 1 g/flask reached the highest growth rate after four weeks (Table 2) . When the root density increased further, the GI decreased. A higher initial inoculum/root density produced a lower GI because of the limited supply of oxygen and nutrients [20, 21] . The stress condition of high root density and limited nutrients and oxygen increased the production and accumulation of stilbenes, with the highest contents of MuA, OXY, and RES observed in the root culture with an initial root density of 3 g/flask. Further increase in initial root density (6 g/flask) decreased the accumulated stilbene content.

After precursor feeding for 5, 10, 20, 40, and 50 days, the roots were harvested in triplicate, and the level of stilbene accumulation was investigated by icELISA and 1 The contents of MuA are expressed in the unit of mg/g DW, whereas OXY and RES are in the unit of \u00b5g/g DW.

Although TYR and its combination with PHE can enhance the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in vitro [24] , the combination of PHE and TYR (PT) did not exert synergistic or additive effects on stilbene accumulation. TYR was transformed directly to p-coumaric acid by tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL), whereas PHE was enzymatically converted to p-coumaric acid by PAL and consequently to cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (4CH) [23] . p-Coumaric acid was further synthesized as a stilbene structure. PAL also displays TAL activity, converting TYR to p-coumaric acid [13] . Feeding TYR contributed more to stilbene synthesis in the early stage of growth. On the 50th day after precursor feeding and culture, the accumulation of all stilbenes was below that observed in the untreated MA root. Therefore, the advantage of precursor feeding lay in shortening the time to reach maximum stilbene production. However, TYR produced the highest accumulation of MuA, OXY, and RES after 40 days of immobilized MA cell culture [10] . This indicates that different types of culture may produce varied responses to precursor feeding.",

Although this The dried root for each treatment was subjected to stilbene extraction with methanol, the content of which was then determined using HPLC and icELISA. The experiment was performed in triplicate (n = 3), and the data are presented as the mean and SD indicated with an error bar. The significance of the mean difference between the precursor treatment and control (CON) was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by the least significant difference at p < 0.01, indicated by * increase is statistically significant, the RES accumulation is still lower than that in the intact MA root [25] and Polygonum cuspidatum root [26] . Elicitors activate defense or stress-induced mechanisms that affect plant metabolism and usually enhance secondary metabolism. In a prior study, the treatment of grapevine cell cultures with MJ increased the expression of stilbene biosynthetic enzymes and the accumulation of trans-RES [27] . The combination of YS and MJ is usually useful in eliciting secondary plant metabolism via the phenylpropanoid pathway in Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn cell cultures [28] , Medicago truncatula cell suspension cultures [29] , and MA cell suspension and root cultures [12] . A previous transcriptional analysis indicated that YS and MJ enhance different enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway. For example, YS induced a 45-and 14-fold increase in PAL and CHS transcripts, respectively, in cell suspension cultures of the model legume M. truncatula [29] . In addition, MJ increased the transcription of stilbene synthase (STS) in grapevine cell cultures [27] . The co-treatment of MJ and YS significantly enhanced the accumulation of MuA, OXY, and RES in an immobilized MA cell culture [10] . This raises the possibility that MJ and YS induce different enzymes involved in stilbene biosynthesis, and that their combination provides co-elicitation. Therefore, the co-elicited MA root culture produced a comparable amount of MuA to the intact root, which accumulated MuA at 5.24-24.32 mg/g DW [18] and 0.093-47.196 mg/g [30] . The stilbene productivity of an MA cell suspension culture was also enhanced by treatment with YS, MJ, chitosan, and salicylic acid, which increased MuA accumulation to 6.9-33.0 mg/g DW compared with 9.9 mg/g DW in the control culture [12] . The stilbene production of the MA root culture in response to YS and MJ was less than that of the cell suspension culture, which may be related to the different cell structures. The co-treatment of cell immobilization and elicitation (MJ and YS) of MA cells increased both intracellular and secreted stilbenes, yielding a total content of 70.48 mg/g DW [10] . In addition, other substances (cyclodextrin, salicylic acid, and ethylene) have also been shown to stimulate RES production in the Vitis vinifera cultivar Monastrell [31] , but YS and MJ exhibited more efficient elicitation than chitosan and salicylic acid in the MA root culture [12] .",

The co-elicitation treatment effectively enhanced the accumulation of MuA, The dry root for each treatment was subjected to stilbene extraction using methanol, the content of which was then determined using HPLC and icELISA. The experiment was performed in triplicate (n = 3), and the data are presented as the mean and SD indicated with an error bar. The significance of the mean difference between the precursor treatment and control (CON) was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by the least significant difference at p < 0.01, indicated by * RES, and OXY. Further investigation using an integrated approach is required to elucidate the interactions between inoculum density, precursor feeding, and elicitors to achieve maximum productivity of these stilbenes. Although the accumulation of RES and OXY was much improved, their contents were much lower than that of MuA. However, MuA can be bio-converted to OXY by beta-glucosidase [32] . Thus, MuA can be a source of OXY that exhibits various pharmacological activities, including anti-COVID-19 properties.",
