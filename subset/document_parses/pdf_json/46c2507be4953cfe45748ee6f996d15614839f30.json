We studied respiratory droplet generation and exhalation in human and nonhuman primate subjects with and without COVID-19 infection to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection, and other changes in physiological state, translates into observable evolution of numbers and sizes of exhaled respiratory droplets in healthy and diseased subjects. In our observational cohort study of the exhaled breath particles of 74 healthy human subjects, and in our experimental infection study of eight nonhuman primates infected by aerosol with SARS-CoV-2, we found that exhaled aerosol particles increase one to three orders of magnitude with aging, high BMI, and COVID-19 infection. These variances appear to be related to changes in airway mucus surface composition and the propensity for mucus surfaces to breakup into small droplets during acts of breathing. We also observed that 20% of those participating in our human study accounted for 80% of the overall exhaled bioaerosol, reflecting a bioaerosol distribution analogous to a classical 20:80 super spreader distribution.",

At peak inspiratory flows during normal breathing air speeds in the trachea and main bronchi can reach turbulent velocities (5) . The rush of air over the thin (5 to 10 \u03bcm) mucus layer lining the airways can break up the mucus surface into small droplets in the way strong winds produce breakup and spray on the surface of the ocean (6) . The nature and extent of this droplet breakup is dependent on the surface properties of the mucus itself (6, 7) . Among properties most influencing droplet generation and droplet size are surface viscoelasticity (which resists the stretching of mucus surface on breakup) and surface tension (which lowers the energy expended in small droplet creation) (8, 9) . In airway lining mucus, both properties vary with lung surfactant type and concentration, as well as with composition and structure of mucus in close proximity to air surfaces (6) .

This sampling was performed using a modified pediatric face mask fitted with a HEPA-filtered inspiration port, and corresponding sampler for exhalation. A particle counter (Thermo Systems Inc. (TSI) AeroTrak handheld particle counter Model 9306-V2, St. Paul, MN) was used to sample exhaled breath particles for five one-minute intervals at every sampling time point. Exhaled breath particle data were collected in a cumulative fashion. .

The corresponding color-matched box-and-whisker plots of total exhaled breath particles represent iterative five (5) one-minute sampling events to genomic viral RNA (color-matched circles) for each animal at each respective timepoint. Mean calculated correlation between timepoint-matched exhaled breath particle production and genomic viral RNA showed statistically significant correlations in 75% of the RM (RM01, r2=0.93, p<0.03; RM02, r2=0.99, p<0.004; RM04, r2=0.98, p<0.0008) and 50% of the AGM (AGM02, r2=0.91, p<0.04; AGM03, r2=0.97, p<0.01).
