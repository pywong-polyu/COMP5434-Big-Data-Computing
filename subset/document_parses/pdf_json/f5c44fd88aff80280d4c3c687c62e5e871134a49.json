Cities are becoming increasingly densely populated; i.e., a higher number of people live in spatial proximity to each other. Further, facilities to meet people's daily needs are also being opened in these densely populated areas. Thus, there are more potential noise sources present in people's neighbourhoods. Most recently, it has been shown that this trend has shifted in Germany, with more residents moving from cities to surrounding lower density regions [1] . However, cities remain highly dense and, for reasons of sustainability, policy prefers the densification of urban areas [2] .",

However, living close together creates new challenges beyond traffic noise, one of which is neighbour noise. The German Environment Agency defines neighbour noise as follows: \"Noises caused by activities of private persons in the neighbourhood that are disruptive or annoying are referred to as neighbour noise. This includes, for example, loudly tuned televisions, a party, home improvement work in the home or garden, or the operation of vehicles or lawn mowers on private property.\" (see [4] , translated by the authors). Various studies have investigated the relations between neighbour noise and different health outcomes, and neighbour noise annoyance was shown to be associated with impaired mental health [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , poor general health status [11] , and poor physical health [10, 12] .",

In a postal study on the influence of the physical and social environment on mental health, dissatisfaction with neighbour noise was further associated with an increase in the risk of poor mental health [9] , even when adjusted for other factors related to mental health. In line with this, in a population-based prospective cohort study, it was investigated whether noise annoyance resulting from/caused by different noise sources predicts mental distress five years later [6] . The results indicated that neighbour noise annoyance was predictive of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. High annoyance due to neighbour noise was further observed to be associated with higher odds of suffering from different health symptoms such as pain in different body parts, headache, and sleeping problems [12] . In the European LARES study (Large Analysis and Review of European Housing and Health Status), which was conducted in different European countries, effects of annoyance and both physical and mental health outcomes were observed [10] : in people reporting severe annoyance due to neighbour noise, risks were increased for hypertension, depression, and migraine.",

Neighbour noise annoyance is especially problematic, as it affects many people, and research suggests it to be associated with other health outcomes: according to a biennial survey on environmental awareness by the German Environment Agency, 60% of respondents stated that they were at least slightly annoyed by neighbour noise [15] , making it the second most annoying noise source after road traffic noise [15] .",

In particular, the degree of neighbour noise annoyance was higher in people living in metropolitan areas [17] . In line with this, differences in annoyance ratings were observed depending on the type of house in which people live. Annoyance due to neighbour noise was more frequently reported by people living in multi-storey buildings in comparison to people living in detached houses [17] [18] [19] .

The study was conducted as part of a representative survey on noise annoyance from different environmental noise sources in Germany. Note that the study was conducted in 2018 and 2019; i.e., the (increased) neighbour noise annoyance during the COVID-19 lockdown could not be studied in this survey. The noise sources studied were air traffic, road traffic, rail traffic, industry, wind turbine noise, and neighbour noise. The study was carried out in four different areas in Germany divided in sub-areas with different agglomeration densities to reflect the population density structure. Focus groups were conducted to gather first insights into the general understanding of neighbour noise in the population and important related factors. Based on these results, a questionnaire was developed. A multi method (online and paper-pencil) survey was conducted.",

In addition, the study areas were intended to reflect the typical noise pollution in Germany. Each area was divided into three agglomeration types: the inner-city area, the urban outskirt, and the rural area. The agglomeration types were based on national statistics of the population density and estimations of the population per km 2 as depicted in [29] . For the definition of the three categories of agglomeration density, a ratio for the number of participants was applied according to the ratio of the population density of each area. As an example, in the study area of Hamburg, the ratio of the inner city, outskirt, and rural area was 4:2:1. Only around Dusseldorf was a ratio of 6:3:1 applied, as the region is less rural.",

Besides annoyance due to neighbour noise, we assessed the annoyance due to road traffic as the most widespread source of environmental noise annoyance [15] , followed by noise due to the food service industry. The latter source was assessed because focus group participants often included noise from (open-air) pubs, restaurants, or from people on the street leaving these establishments in their definition of neighbour noise, even though gastronomy locations belong to the source \"industry and trade\" from a legal point of view.",

As a result of the focus groups, it was found that the connotation of the German term \"living environment\" (Wohnumgebung) refers more to spatial issues, whereas the connotation of the German term \"neighbourhood\" (Nachbarschaft) refers more to social issues; i.e., the relation between neighbours. To capture both connotations in the residential satisfaction assessment, we added two further questions: \"How satisfied are you-all in all-with your neighbourhood?\", which was assessed on a five-point scale from (1) not satisfied to (5) very satisfied; and \"All in all, how would you describe your relationship with your neighbours in general?\", with five answer categories from (1) very bad to (5) very good.

There are several standardized inventories assessing noise sensitivity. However, to reduce the time that participants needed to answer the questionnaire, noise sensitivity was assessed in terms of a self-reported single item: \"How sensitive are you to noise in general?\", with a five-point answering scale from (1) not sensitive to (5) very sensitive. Further, socio-demographics were assessed, including gender and age. From these socio-demographic variables, age was included in the analysis, as age is known to have an inverted U-shaped relationship with annoyance; i.e., middle-aged adults (about 40 to 60 age) are more annoyed than younger and older people [46] .

Correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between variables. When Pearson's correlation coefficient was r > +/\u2212 0.2, the variables were selected for the regression analyses. To analyze the impact of several variables on the manifestation of annoyance due to neighbour noise, linear regression models were performed using generalized linear models (GZLM) with the predictors of age, density of agglomeration, residential satisfaction, relationship to neighbours, satisfaction with neighbourhood, annoyance due to other noise sources (road, food service industry), and noise sensitivity. The GZLM procedure allows the application of robust estimators (Huber-White sandwich estimators; [47, 48] ), which provide consistent covariance estimates even in the presence of assumption violations on the distribution shape and variance homogeneity.",

The strongest effect was found for satisfaction with the neighbourhood. These results suggest that both satisfaction measures seem to be important for the perception of neighbour noise. Being predominantly satisfied with the living environment or the neighbourhood-e.g., due to nearby green spaces, a good accessibility of facilities for daily needs, a good connection to public transport, etc.-could compensate for aspects such as neighbour noise, which may be more disturbing if one is generally not very satisfied with the living environment. Additionally, satisfying neighbourhoods might offer social cohesion and more options for recreation or respite to recover from neighbour noise, even if these neighbourhoods are noisier. Both the restorative quality of a neighbourhood and social cohesion are known to be associated with reduced road noise annoyance and to beneficially mediate the relationship between noise annoyance and mental health [50] . It can be assumed that this might be also true for neighbor noise. One could argue that satisfaction with the neighbourhood and residential satisfaction refer to the same concept. However, the difference in the magnitude of the influence of both variables on neighbour noise annoyance indicates that participants respond to conceptually different items. When asked about their residential satisfaction, participants might think about physical features and different aspects that their close environment has to offer (e.g., shopping possibilities, parks, etc.). In contrast, satisfaction with the neighbourhood might focus on the social aspect of one's close environment; i.e., the social contact with other people living in the same area. As the current study used a cross-sectional design, no conclusions can be drawn about the causal pathway. There could be a reciprocal relationship between these three variables. Neighbour noise annoyance could influence residential satisfaction and satisfaction with the neighbourhood and vice versa.",

A better relationship to neighbours is linked to lower neighbour noise annoyance. This corresponds to recent findings where neighbour noise annoyance was associated with conflicts with neighbours [17, 20] . It further corresponds to findings that satisfaction with the relationship to neighbours was associated with the perception of psychological distress [24] . A noise-causing neighbour might lead to annoyance, which might in turn affect the relationship to that neighbour. A general positive feeling towards the person causing the noise might enhance the acceptance of that noise or decrease the perception of specific sounds as noise in the first place. The concept of the relationship to neighbours might be similar to the non-acoustic factor attitudes towards a noise source, which is known to impact noise annoyance levels. For example, positive attitudes towards a noise source are associated with less noise annoyance [31] , whereas negative attitudes are linked to higher noise annoyance ratings [51] . The association of the relationship to neighbours and neighbour noise annoyance found in this study corresponds to the findings in [52] . The authors found that the type of relationship to one's neighbours (e.g., friends or enemies) is linked to different types of coping strategies [52] .",
