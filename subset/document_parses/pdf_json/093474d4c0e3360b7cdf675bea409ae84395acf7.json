            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 continues to spread worldwide, and the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants further brings new challenges in the prevention and control of the global pandemic [1, 2] . Although this pandemic has been effectively controlled by non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including social isolation, mask use, and case isolation in China [3] , it remains extremely vulnerable to imported SARS-CoV-2 transmission [4, 5] . Mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought as the most cost-effective strategy to establish a herd immunity barrier and eventually stop this pandemic. So far, more than 17 kinds of COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for clinical use [6] . As of 12 September 2021, more than 2.14 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been administrated in China [6] . Currently, several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for clinical use [7] , but the long-term surveillance of their safety should be further studied, especially among vulnerable populations with medical conditions. In addition, it is known that the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines might not be 100% [8, 9] , and it will be further compromised as the SARS-CoV-2 variants facilitate the immune escape from the current COVID-19 vaccines [10] . Thus, we should pay attention to the breakthrough infections after vaccination in recent real-world evidence [11] [12] [13] [14] . A noteworthy issue is that the daily preventive behaviors of the general population might change after vaccination [15] . The maintenance of NPIs is necessary to prevent the rebound of the COVID-19 pandemic, until sufficient vaccination coverage is reached for herd immunity [4] . Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the changes in personal preventive behaviors before and after COVID-19 vaccination, which represents a top priority to adjust the prevention and control strategies with the process of mass vaccination.",

For example, clinically generalized anxiety, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep quality among the general population have been proven to be more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic in China [17] . However, it is not known whether the mental health status would be affected after COVID-19 vaccination. One study showed that timely HPV vaccination could effectively alleviate anxiety and depression [18] , while another study indicated that HPV vaccination is not associated with physical and mental health complaints [19] . In addition, influenza vaccine had a greater negative effect on patients with depression and anxiety than on mentally healthy individuals [20] . Consequently, it is of great significance to investigate how this mass vaccination against COVID-19 would have an impact on mental health among the general population.",

The questionnaire is provided in Supplementary Materials. The HBM scale was previously used to evaluate people's health beliefs and attitudes toward seasonal influenza vaccination [21] , as well as to predict the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination [22] [23] [24] . In this study, we modified the HBM scale to evaluate the health beliefs of vaccinated individuals. The HBM scale was adapted from above-mentioned literatures [21] [22] [23] and contained five dimensions: perceived the susceptibility of COVID-19 (four items), perceived the severity of COVID-19 (five items), perceived the benefits of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (three items), perceived obstacles to access the vaccine (three items), and motivation to get vaccination (three items). The participants were asked how they agreed or disagreed with each statement, and a 5-point Likert scale was used to score each item, from strongly disagree (1 point) to strongly agree (5 points). Except for perceived obstacles to access the vaccine, which was reverse scoring to improve credibility, all other items were forward scoring. That is, higher scores indicated a greater health belief.",

The daily preventive behaviors against COVID-19 were measured via a modified 9-item scale developed by previous studies [23, 26] . The participants were asked about their daily use of masks, hand washing and disinfection, and social distancing. Both the mental health scale and the preventive behavior scale were scored using a 5-point Likert scoring method, from strongly disagree (1 point) to strongly agree (5 points). Higher scores represented worse psychological conditions or a higher probability to take preventive measures against COVID-19.

In this study, we used the HBM as an outcome variable to investigate whether health beliefs would change following COVID-19 vaccination. We aimed to explore the potential differences of HBM items between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination populations, including how they understand the severity and susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, how they understand the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, and what obstacles they encounter in getting vaccination. In our study, a moderate but statistically significant difference was found between the post-vaccination group and the pre-vaccination group, even after PSM treatment. These findings should be reasonable, since all participants in this study were either waiting for vaccination or had been vaccinated at COVID-19 vaccination sites. Therefore, they had a willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and remained similar in health beliefs toward COVID-19. Among the items of the HBM, perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 decreased in the post-vaccination group (p < 0.001), reflecting that the participants intended to believe that COVID-19 vaccination could reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to some extent, which was consistent with previous findings [35] . Another observation was that the scores of perceived susceptibility scores of COVID-19 were low in both pre-and post-vaccination groups, and the reason might be that the Chinese government has controlled the COVID-19 pandemic at a low level, with only sporadic cases via vigorous prevention and control policies [36, 37] .",

However, another critical question of great significance is to investigate how COVID-19 vaccination may influence the negative status of mental health toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we planned to address this issue by our adaption scale of mental health. Interestingly, the scores of mental health status in our study were all at a low level before and after vaccination, suggesting that there is a relatively healthy mental status among the general population toward the COVID-19 pandemic in China when compared to other countries [38, 39] . This might be partly attributed to the impressive controlling performance against the COVID-19 pandemic by the Chinese government, and the participants were less worried about SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a result, a highly trusted government would be a powerful measure to promote mental health among the general population. This observation may give governments and health authorities some important implications to enhance public credibility.",

To our surprise, compared with the pre-vaccination group, participants in the post-vaccination group had a mildly higher frequency to follow preventive behaviors, including wearing a mask and following social distancing. One possible explanation is that the participants received good health education during the COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, the preventive behaviors in the early phase of the pandemic had been transformed into personal habits and awareness, and the continually mandatory mask wearing and social distancing in public places also facilitated strengthening of the daily preventive behaviors among the general population [40] . However, a stochastic dynamic model study previously suggested that a relaxation of NPIs would raise the reproduction number (Rt) value of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines 2021, 9, 1044 9 of 11 back to 1.5, leading to sustained epidemic growth [4] .
