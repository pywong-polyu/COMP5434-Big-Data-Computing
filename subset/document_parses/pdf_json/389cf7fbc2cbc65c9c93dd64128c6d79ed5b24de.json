The first local case of COVID-19 detected in Malaysia was on January 23, 2020, involving two citizens from Sabah and one from Selangor. The government took a preventive measure to combat the COVID-19 outbreak through social and physical distancing by implementing a nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO) starting March 18, 2020 with the recommendation of the WHO. The MCO was a directive closure of all government and private premises except for essential services which included water, electricity, energy, telecommunications, postal, transportation, irrigation, oil, gas, fuel, lubricants, broadcasting, financial, banking, health, pharmacy, fire, prison, port, airport, security, defense, cleaning, retail, and food supply. In addition, the closing of all nurseries, government, private schools, and public and private higher education institutions was required. A significant increase in cases was seen in October 2020, which caused the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) and the Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO) to be implemented in selected states in Malaysia. The social and physical distance practices were crucial in combating the COVID-19 outbreak. However, it has also altered many aspects of life, including lifestyle, psychological factors affecting eating habits, and physical activity during the pandemic (3) .",

Various studies on lifestyle changes during COVID-19 were conducted, including eating habits, supplementation, smoking habits, alcohol intake, and sleeping patterns. Increased time at home has led to excessive consumption of food which were related to social, emotion, or food cravings, commonly known as \"comfort food\" to help in reducing stress. \"Comfort food\" is normally high in simple carbohydrates which aid to reduce stress by inducing high serotonin production, thus positively impacts one's emotions. However, the effect on \"comfort foods\" is directly proportional to the glycemic index of food, which is closely related to increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, all of which are known to increase risk of complications among COVID-19 victims (5) . In addition, psychological factors such as anxiety, loneliness, and boredom have also affected eating habits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The isolation has caused great pressure, resulting in high intake of food. In addition to that, news and information on COVID-19 in social media can be stressful and overwhelming, leading to excessive eating (1) .",

The EEQ is a 10-item questionnaire developed to assess the extent to which emotions affect eating behavior. The question had four possible replies: (1) never, (2) sometimes, (3) generally, and (4) always. The total score ranged from 0 to 30. The subjects were classified into 4 groups: nonemotional eater (score 0-5), low emotional eater (score 6-10), emotional eater (score [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , and very emotional eater (score [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .

The questions included were total frequency and duration of vigorous activity, moderate activity, walking, and sitting. The following metabolic equivalent of task (MET) values were used: walking = 3.3 METs, moderate activity = 4.0 METs, and vigorous activity = 8.0 METs. The MET-minutes per week (MET-min/week) was calculated as follows: minutes of activity/day \u00d7 days per week \u00d7 MET level. The total amount of physical activity scores obtained from the IPAQ-M was classified into three categories, namely, low, moderate, or high physical activity level, according to the scoring protocol on the IPAQ Web site guidelines (11) .",

Firstly, the data for weight and level of physical activity were self-reported, which could lead to the possibility of having under-reported and over-reported data for both categories. However, to minimize this issue, detailed instructions were written in the questionnaire prior to questions on anthropometry. However, the L\u00f3pez-Moreno et al. (1) questionnaire that were used was not validated for the Malaysian population. In addition, the answers were not classified as a scoring system. Therefore, each of the components studied could not be categorized. Thus, less statistical analysis could be done to test various research hypotheses toward the result obtained from the study. Lastly, it was also found that a higher proportion of women responded to the survey compared to men, which is consistent in other similar health surveys (1, 5, 17).",
