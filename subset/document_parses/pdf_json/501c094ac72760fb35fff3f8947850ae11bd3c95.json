Methods: To develop the survey items, 20 pre-clerkship students were interviewed about their learning experiences in the first semester of 2020. A total of 425 pre-clerkship students have participated in the survey, which comprised four parts (general experience, learning strategies, important features, and overall satisfaction). Results: Before classes began, students generally had \"neutral expectations\" about online classes (2.90 out of 5). At the end of the semester, overall satisfaction with the curriculum was moderate (3.04 out of 5). Premedical students reported lower scores in \"daily study hours\" and \"regular lifestyle\" and higher scores in \"experience of playing recorded lectures solely for an attendance check\" (p<0.001). In addition, first-year premedical students not only showed significantly lower utilization of learning strategies compared to other grades (p<0.001). Conclusion: Although pre-clerkship students mostly shared similar perceptions and behaviors in their learning regardless of grade level, some characteristics were either more prominent in premedical students on the whole or limited to first-year premedical students.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused sweeping changes in political, economic, and social aspects worldwide-and education was no exception. Particularly, the pandemic has \"forced\" classes to be non-contact based online lectures. Unlike the past, the professors are no longer able to \"choose\" between contact and non-contact methods based on their learning objectives and the type of educational content. Previous studies have reported that students prefer online classes mostly because they are liberated from restrictions in time and space and save time moving between classrooms [1] . However, in the absence of other options, learning at home can be an isolating experience, and, as it has been pointed out, COVID-19 has affected the mental health of college students across various dimensions [2] .",

Moreover, previous studies reported during COVID-19 focus on the clinical workplace or clerkship phases of the undergraduate medical education program [4, 5] . However, changes in the pre-clerkship curriculum cannot be overlooked, since premedical and preclinical education serve as the foundation for the later stages of medical school education. To improve online classes that are most likely to continue after the pandemic, it is crucial to understand students' responses to educational changes brought on by COVID-19.",

The collected data were transcribed, coded, and analyzed, resulting in two main themes: perception of online classes and characteristics of learning behavior in online classes. The final survey questions were developed after pilot tests for groups of medical education experts and students. The survey consisted of the following parts: general experiences, learning strategies, important features, perception of the professors and changes in interactions, and overall satisfaction.
