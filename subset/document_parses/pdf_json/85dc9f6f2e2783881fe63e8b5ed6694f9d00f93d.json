Secondary research questions were whether people changed oral hygiene regimens during the COVID-19 pandemic and to what extent dental symptoms existed and developed compared to pre-pandemic. For this cross-sectional study a survey has been conceptualized to determine OHRQoL, stress, depression and anxiety and their specific confounders in a German cohort. Validated questionnaires as OHIP-G14, PHQ-Stress and PHQ-4 have been implemented. Altogether 1178 participants completed the survey between May and August 2020. The overall OHIP-G14 sum score of 4.8 \u00b1 7.5 indicated good OHRQoL. 21% of the participants (n = 248) reported toothache, 23% (n = 270) mucosal problems, 31% (n = 356) hypersensitivity of the teeth and 27% (n = 305) myofacial pain. The PHQ-Stress score (4.5 \u00b1 3.5) demonstrated a mild severity of stress. Depression and anxiety level has been mild to moderate (PHQ-4 score: 2.4 \u00b1 2.6). 38% of the participants stated subjectively greater emotional burden compared to pre-pandemic. Statistically significant differences exist for OHRQoL, stress, anxiety and depression levels between participants with greater, equal or less emotional burden compared to pre-pandemic. COVID-19 history and aggravated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress seem to associate with lower OHRQoL. Psychosocial consequences during pandemic times and their association to oral health should be further investigated.",

            "text": "Survey development. For this study, a digital questionnaire consisting of validated items was conceptualized to determine oral health and psychosocial factors and queries experiences in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the questionnaire is conducted of sub-questionnaires and free questions (total: 27 questions). To query oral-health related and also sociodemographic data, the seven-item questionnaire from the German Society for Periodontology (DG PARO) \"the periodontitis risk score\" was integrated. The age range was slightly modified in order to include all ages from 18 years onwards 16 . The score ranges from 0 points indicating lowest periodontitis risk up to 20 points indicating very high periodontitis risk. A question was also added asking whether toothache, mucosal pain, dental hypersensitivity or myofacial pain were perceived symptoms and whether they were felt the same, stronger or weaker compared to before the pandemic. OHRQoL was assessed by the German version of the 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-G14). It consists of 14 questions which can be grouped into seven distinct sub-domains: (1) functional limitation (items 1 and 2), (2) handicap (items 3 and 10), (3) psychological disability (items 4 and 11), (4) psychological discomfort (items 5 and 14), (5) physical disability (items 6 and 12), (6) physical pain (items 7 and 13), and (7) social disability (items 8 and 9). The answers are recorded on a Likert scale with values ranging from 0 to 4 coded as 0 \"never\", 1 \"hardly ever\", 2 \"occasionally\", 3 \"fairly often\", or 4 \"very often\". The OHIP-G14 sum score can range from 0 to 56 with a higher score indicating a poorer OHRQoL 17 . To determine psychosocial stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the validated ten-item PHQ-Stress module (Patient Health Questionnaire) was chosen. The psychosocial impairment caused by the queried factors can be assessed from 0 \"not impaired\", over 1 \"slightly impaired\" to 2 \"severely impaired\". Score values of 0-4 can be viewed as minimally pronounced psychosocial stress factors. Total values of 5-9 represent mild, 10-14 moderate and 15-20 severe stress manifestation 18 . As a validated screening instrument for depressive disorders and generalized anxiety, the four-item PHQ-4 was included. The frequency of complaints inquired can be evaluated on a scale from 0 \"not at all\" to 3 \"almost every day\". Total values can range from 0-12. A PHQ-4 score of 0-2 designates none-to-minimal, 3-5 mild, 6-8 moderate and 9-12 severe level of depression and anxiety 18, 19 . Questions were added on the subjective assessment of the extent of pandemic-related restrictions in life (none/little/strong), as well as the extent to which the pandemic had an influence on work and family/social life (none/little/strong). An additional question was implemented on subjectively perceived emotional burden during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the pandemic (greater/equal/less) to also match these selfassessments in relation to the more objectified scores of the psychosocial sub-questionnaires as the PHQ-Stress and PHQ-4. In order to take known confounders for oral health and psychosocial factors into account, questions about the oral hygiene behavior, systemic diseases, body weight and height (to calculate the body mass index (BMI)) as well as the aforementioned demographic and socioeconomic questions regarding age, sex, smoking educational and employment status were added.",

The factors \"BMI\", \"educational status\", \"interdental cleaning\", \"dentist visit frequency\", \"tooth brushing frequency\" and \"emotional burden due to the COVID-19-pandemic compared to pre-pandemic\" cannot be found in the final output of the regression (Table 5 ) due to the elimination process of the performed variable selection (bidirectional elimination) based on Akaike information criterion. The variable with the strongest impact on a lower OHIP-G14 sum score is a confirmed COVID-19 history with an estimate of 12.05, meaning that participants with COVID-19 history have on average a 12.05 significantly increased OHIP-G14 sum score compared to participants without COVID-19 history. In addition, an increase of one unit of the PHQ-4 sum score associates with a statistically significant increase of 0.973 in the OHIP-G14 sum score. PHQ-Stress sum score is significantly relevant with an estimate of 0.585, as well as the age group of 60-100 years with an estimate of 1.706 compared to the age groups of 40-59 years (0.848) and 18-39 years (0). Participants with systemic diseases have an increase of 0.89 in the OHIP-G14 sum score compared to participants without systemic diseases. Sex and pandemic related restrictions in life were not statistically significantly relevant in the final model.

In contrast to a low OHIP-G14 sum score of 4.8 \u00b1 7.5 in the overall cohort, suggesting a rather high OHRQoL 17 , the sum scores of participants with self-assessed greater (7.7 \u00b1 9.4), equal (3.1 \u00b1 5.1) and less (3.8 \u00b1 7.1) emotional burden compared to pre-pandemic were statistically significantly different indicating an influential factor of psychosocial factors during the COVID-19 pandemic on OHRQoL. The differentiation of participants with subjectively rated higher, equal, or less emotional burden compared to pre-pandemic is reflected in statically significant group-differences in the more objectified scores of the PHQ-4 and PHQ-Stress sub-questionnaires.",

This can be seen in the linear regression result for modeling the OHIP-G14 score and the variables \"PHQ-4\" and \"PHQ-Stress\". The significant differences in the PHQ-4 sum scores between emotionally greater burdened (4.0 \u00b1 2.8) and equally (1.4 \u00b1 1.7) or less (1.4 \u00b1 1.8) burdened compared to pre-pandemic should be emphasized, since from a sum score of 3.0 onwards a moderate severity of depression and anxiety has to be assumed 19 . The results on stress exposure suggest a mild manifestation in participants with greater emotional burden compared to participants with equal or less emotional burden compared to pre-pandemic and a minimal stress exposure 18 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ past pandemics. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fear, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss and stigma. Long-lasting effects are assumed 22 . The COVID-19 pandemic has generally led to short term as well as long term psychosocial and mental health implications 23 . Peters et al. also concluded psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic from a national cohort study in Germany. In May 2020-at a similar point in time as in this observation-stress was also evaluated with the PHQ-Stress module, depression with PHQ-9 and anxiety with GAD-7. Due to the possibility of comparison with pre-pandemic results, a longitudinal assessment was possible and showed an increase in the PHQ-Stress score of 1.14 \u00b1 0.02, an increase in PHQ-9 by 0.38 \u00b1 0.02 and an increase of the GAD-9 by 0.36 \u00b1 0.02. 24 Due to different incidence rates on regional and national levels as well as varying socio-political circumstances and reactions, the effects on social, professional and personal life may be diverse. Therefore, generalization of the present results, but also previous research on this topic, should only be transferred to similar circumstances and conditions. Nonetheless, Kishi et al. also demonstrated disaster-related effects on OHRQoL and mental health following the East Japan Earthquake and tsunami in 2011 26 .",

However, due to the localization of the study www.nature.com/scientificreports/ center and the associated accessibility, many participants are from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse and possibly former patients of the Clinic of Conservative Dentistry at Heidelberg University. Therefore, this study cohort is not representative for the overall German population. This selection bias needs to be taken into consideration, when interpreting e.g. oral hygiene-related parameters. For example, interdental care is rated rather high which is reflected by 43.8% of the study participants using interdental brushes. In contrast, the broad-based and latest Fifth German Oral Health Study from 2013/2014 indicated a prevalence for the usage of interdental brushes of 16.5% for younger adults aged 35-44 years and a prevalence of 29% for younger seniors aged 65-74. Interestingly, in the preceding study of 2005, these values were 10.8% and 14.4%, respectively. This development could indicate that a further increase at an empirical level could be expected through enhanced education in preventive measures in recent years 33 . Thus, the results of this study could either due to the explicit patient collective or follow a positive trend in the usage of interdental brushes in general. As shown in the regression analysis with variable selection, a COVID-19 history, the PHQ-4 sum score, the PHQ-Stress sum score, age and systemic diseases exerted an influence on OHRQoL. Consensually, the impact of sociodemographic factors on OHRQoL and periodontitis has been described 34, 35 .",
