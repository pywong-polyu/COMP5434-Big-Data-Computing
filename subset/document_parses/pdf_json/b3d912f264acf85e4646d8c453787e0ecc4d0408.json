The onset of COVID-19 occurred during phase two of research in which we were investigating social workers' informal use of ICT with clients. Prior to COVID-19, we were conducting interviews with practitioners and clients from four agencies serving diverse client populations in a large city in Canada. With the onset of COVID-19, we adapted to the COVID-19 context and amended the questions to investigate ICT use during the pandemic. In addition, with ethics approval, we conducted second interviews with practitioners interviewed prior to COVID-19 with a revised guide to address the pandemic context; and we continued to recruit and interview practitioners and clients using an amended interview guide incorporating pandemic-related questions. The sample comprised 27 practitioners and 22 clients. Eleven practitioners participated in interviews prior to and during COVID-19. Analysis of transcribed interviews revealed that the COVID-19 context had led to a paradigm shift in practitioners' ICT use, with two key themes identified: (1) boundary challenges and (2) clients' diverging ICT needs. We discuss these themes and present implications for policy and practice in a post-COVID-19 world.",

As ICTs affect all aspects of human interaction, it is critical to understand the implications of ICTs (Perron et al., 2010) .

Despite claiming that they did not expect practitioners to respond beyond office hours, clients appreciated practitioners responding promptly to ICT communication. Several practitioners believed that clients assumed practitioners had greater flexibility because of working from home during COVID-19. Indirectly or directly therefore, clients' expectations appear to contribute to the increased pressure expressed by practitioners to respond beyond business hours. Fear for client safety and wellbeing was another factor that exerted pressure to respond. Some practitioners depicted struggling internally, feeling compelled both to respond to clients outside of business hours and to maintain the boundaries. The context of the pandemic and remote service complicated practitioners' ability to differentiate these alternatives. This finding corresponds to other findings that during COVID-19, social workers commonly reported \"perceived or overt pressure 'to be available' to meet emergent and acute patient needs\" (Ross et al., 2021, p. 17) .",

In contrast, client populations lacking ICT access or digital literacy skills suffered. While gaps existed prior to COVID-19, the move to remote sessions emphasized inequities and clients' divergent ICT needs. As ICT communication reduced barriers to service for some clients (e.g., transportation, stigma) (Moreland et al., 2021) , a critical challenge will be to maintain remote options beyond COVID-19. Concurrently, the barriers faced by clients in accessing digital services, due to issues such as lack of Internet, privacy, or digital literacy, highlight the challenge in developing policies and supports to provide clients equitable access to digital services.",

Analysis revealed several contributing factors including modified regulations to accommodate COVID-19, practitioners' internal as well as client pressure, and a lack of clear agency guidance. Once face-to-face practice resumes, it is likely that the greater incorporation of ICTs in social work practice will continue. The complex factors producing boundary challenges emphasize that practitioners require support and viable options to maintain boundaries, while ensuring that clients receive needed support. It will be important for agencies to implement clear policies regarding professional boundaries. In phase one of the study (survey of social workers' informal ICT use), a significant percentage of participants did not discuss their ICT use with supervisors or colleagues (Mishna et al., 2021a, b) . This finding underscores that organizations must provide support for practitioners in maintaining professional boundaries and ensuring wellbeing, for example, providing work cellphones, as participants found this helped them keep work separate from their personal lives.",
