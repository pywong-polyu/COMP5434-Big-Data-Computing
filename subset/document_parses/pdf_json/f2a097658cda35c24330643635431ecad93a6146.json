GC-376 is a M pro inhibitor with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Using the K18-hACE2 mouse model, the in vivo antiviral efficacy of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated. GC-376 treatment was not toxic in K18-hACE2 mice. Overall outcome of clinical symptoms and survival upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge were not improved in mice treated with GC-376 compared to controls. The treatment with GC-376 slightly improved survival from 0 to 20% in mice challenged with a high virus dose at 10 5 TCID50/mouse. Most notably, GC-376 treatment led to milder tissue lesions, reduced viral loads, fewer presence of viral antigen, and reduced inflammation in comparison to vehicle-treated controls in mice challenged with a low virus dose at 10 3 TCID50/mouse. This was particularly the case in the brain where a 5-log reduction in viral titers was observed in GC-376 treated mice compared to vehicle controls. This study supports the notion that GC-376 represents a promising lead candidate for further development to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection and that the K18-hACE2 mouse model is suitable to study antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2.",

At the time of writing of this report, several groups showed that K18-hACE2 mice develop clinical signs and mortality after SARS-CoV-2 challenge 14-17 . Two different virus challenge doses of SARS-CoV-2 were used that produced clinical signs of disease and mortality that correlated with the virus dose administered. Modest differences in terms of clinical signs, weight loss, and survival were observed between GC-376 and vehicle mice. Further analyses indicated that GC-376/SARS-CoV-2 challenged mice showed lower viral loads, milder tissue lesions and reduced inflammation compared to vehicle SARS-CoV-2 challenged controls indicating that GC-376 can act as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral in vivo.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the defining global health crisis of our time. As of March 3, 2020, more than 110 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported, associated with 2.54 million deaths 1 . SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which are RNA viruses commonly associated with mild upper respiratory illness. In the past few years, novel coronaviruses have emerged from animal reservoirs crossing the species barrier causing sporadic outbreaks in humans such as SARS-CoV and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The current global health emergency prompted a race to develop resources to combat the pandemic. Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently in different stages of pre-clinical or clinical evaluation [2] [3] [4] . Among these, several have received emergency use approval in several countries, most notably the Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's mRNA-based vaccines, the first of their kind approved for human use. Additionally, a number of viral proteins and host factors have been proposed as small molecule antiviral drug targets to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among those, the viral main protease (M pro ) is one of the most extensive explored drug targets 5 , and a number of M pro inhibitors are in different stages of preclinical and clinical development. GC-376 is a representative M pro inhibitor that has shown antiviral activity against Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) CoV in experimentally infected cats 6, 7 . The ~ 30 kb viral genome SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which must be cleaved in order to be functional and lead to active viral replication. Cleavage is mediated by the M pro and the papain-like (PL pro ) proteases 8 , both are potential antiviral targets. In vitro studies have shown inhibition of SARS-CoV M pro in the presence of GC376 9 . More recently, the potential antiviral activity of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in vitro, placing GC-376 as a promising antiviral candidate for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, the antiviral activity of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo has not been addressed, neither have any other M pro inhibitors that are currently in development. Therefore, to fulfil the knowledge gap and provide insights of the translational potential of M pro inhibitors as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we report in this RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. RNAs were extracted from the different tissue homogenates using the MagMax-96 AI/ND viral RNA isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following manufacturer's protocol. A one-step real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based on the Nucleoprotein gene segment was used as surrogate of viral load and it was employed using the primers 2019-nCov_N2-F (5\u2032-TTA CAA ACA TTG GCC GCA AA-3\u2032) and 2019-nCov_N2-R (5\u2032-GCG CGA CAT TCC GAA GAA -3\u2032). A probe with FAM as a reporter and TAMRA as a quencher was used (5\u2032-FAM-ACA ATT TGC CCC CAG CGC TTCAG-TAMRA-3\u2032). The RT-qPCR was performed in a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using a Quantabio qScript XLT One-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix kit (Quantabio, Beverly, MA) in a final reaction volume of 20 \u03bcl. Each reaction mixture contained 1 \u00d7 master mix, 0.5 \u03bcM forward and reverse primers, 0.3 \u03bcM probe, and 5 \u03bcl of RNA. The qPCR cycling conditions were 50 \u00b0C, 20 min; 95 \u00b0C, 1 min, 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C, 1 min; 60 \u00b0C, 1 min; and 72 \u00b0C 1 s; with a final cooling step at 4 \u00b0C. A standard curve was generated using tenfold serial dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 virus stock of known titer to correlate RT-qPCR crossing point (Cp) values with the viral load from each tissue. Viral loads were calculated as Log 10 TCID50 equivalents/per gram of tissue.",

We evaluated the efficacy of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo using the K18-hACE2 mouse model (Fig. 1A) . Concomitantly, we evaluated the potential toxicity of GC-376 in K18-hACE2 mice, noting that previous studies have shown no liver toxicity caused by GC-376 in other mouse strains at the dose administered in this study 19 . K18-hACE2 mice were either mock-challenged (PBS, G1, n = 6/group and G2, n = 8/group), challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 virus (1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID50/mouse, G3 and G4, n = 11/ group), or challenged with a low dose of SARS-CoV-2 virus (1 \u00d7 10 3 TCID50/mouse, G5 and G6, n = 11/group). At 3 h post-challenge, mice were treated for 7 days, twice daily i.p. with either vehicle (G1, G3, and G5) or GC-376 (G2, G4, and G6, 40 mg/kg daily, 20 mg/kg each dose). No significant weight loss and 100% survival was observed in both the mock-challenged mice treated with GC-376 (G2) and the mock-challenged vehicle control group (G1, Fig. 1B,C) . Furthermore, lungs, brain, liver, small intestine, spleen and heart did not present any tissue alteration at 14 days post-treatment with GC-376 in comparison with the vehicle control group (Fig. 1D ).",

In mice challenged with the high virus dose (G3 and G4), there was a period of relatively normal activity (response to the environment and stimulus given by the personnel) and physical appearance ( Fig. 2A,B ) followed by rapid weight loss and presentation of clinical signs (Fig. 2C ). By 6 dpc, mice in G3 (high virus dose/vehicle, white symbols) showed about 20% weight loss and by 8 dpc there were no survivors because they have either succumbed to the infection or had to be humanely euthanized due to severe clinical signs (lethargy, ruffled fur, labored breathing, and/or \u2265 25% body weight loss, Fig. 2D ). These observations are consistent with previous reports 16, 17, 20, 21 . G4 mice (high virus dose/GC-376) showed similar clinical signs but such progression was delayed by about 24 h (~ 15% weight loss by 6 dpc). In terms of body weight loss, statistically significant differences were established between G3 and G4 in comparison to G1 from 4 to 6 dpc. Of note, the G4 mice (high virus dose/GC-376) showed 20% survival (n = 1 out of 5) but such difference was not statistically significant. We analyzed whether the antiviral activity of GC-376 could improve disease outcome when a low challenge dose of SARS-CoV-2 was used. As expected, progression of the disease occurred slower compared to groups of mice challenged with the high virus dose (G3 and G4, Fig. 2A-D) . It was interesting to observe transient reduced activity and deterioration of physical appearance (Fig. 2E ,F) regardless of treatment accompanied by consistent and statistically significant body weight loss between 5 to 7 dpc in all mice regardless of group at the low virus challenge dose compared to mock-challenged/vehicle treated mice, ultimately leading to 60% survival ( Fig. 2G,H) . These observations are significant because it suggests that disease progression due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the k18-hACE2 mouse model is virus dose dependent adding more value to the system to better study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and host responses. Of note, a trend towards increased weight loss but faster body weight recovery was observed in G6 mice (low virus dose/GC-376) compared to G5 mice (low virus dose/ vehicle). However, and despite the 100 times lower virus challenge dose, we did not notice an improvement in the clinical outcome of mice treated with GC-376 compared to mice in vehicle control group. Taken together, these results suggest that GC-376 has modest benefit in K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of clinical signs outcome, weight changes, and survival.",

            "text": "A trend towards reduced SARS-CoV-2 vRNA loads in GC-376-treated mice. To better characterize the effect of GC-376 treatment against SARS-CoV-2, sections of NT, lungs, brain, liver, small intestine (SI) and spleen were collected at 2 and 5 dpc and each tissue split into two to assess vRNA viral loads and for histopathological analyses, respectively. Tissue homogenates were prepared, vRNA extracted and then vRNA loads and vRNA tissue distribution were evaluated by RT-qPCR. High vRNA content consistent with active virus replication was observed in tissue homogenates from the NT, lungs, and brain of mice in G3 (high virus dose/ vehicle). RT-qPCR results were consistent with the clinical observations in G3 mice, with average higher vRNA signals at 2 dpc than at 5 dpc in samples from the lungs and NT, but the opposite in other tissues (brain, liver, SI and spleen) indicative of systemic virus spread (Fig. 3A) . Likewise, vRNA loads in G5 mice (low virus dose/ vehicle) followed disease progression with higher average signals on 5 dpc compared to 2 dpc, particularly in the brain where these differences were statistically significant (Fig. 3A ). Also consistent with the clinical outcome of the disease, reduced vRNA load averages were observed in NT, lungs and brain samples from mice in G4 (high virus dose/GC-376) compared to homologous samples from mice in G3 (high virus dose/vehicle). Samples from mice in G4 showed more individual variations in vRNA loads, several at levels below limit of detection, than the counterparts in G3 (Fig. 3B) . Similarly, more individual variations in vRNA levels were observed in NT, lungs and brain samples from G6 mice (low virus dose/GC-376) than in G5 mice (low virus dose/vehicle) (Fig. 3C) . Interestingly, brain samples from G6 mice showed statistically significant lower vRNA levels than those from G5 mice. Overall, these results suggest high levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication in the NT, lungs, and brain of K18-hACE2 mice and detectable vRNA in liver, SI and spleen. GC-376 treatment leads towards reduced virus load averages with the caveat of noticeable individual variations among treated animals, and the inability to properly prevent the burden and mortality caused by SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice. At the low dose virus challenge, GC-376 prevented to great extent the virus' ability to reach the brain, but such effect was not correlated with increased survival compared to vehicle-treated controls. NT, and brains at 2, 5, and 14 dpc (Table 1) showed overall milder lesions in mice treated with GC-376 and challenged with the low dose virus (Fig. 4) . At 2 dpc, no differences were observed in the two groups challenged with the high dose (G3 and G4). Lesions at 2 dpc consisted of mild-moderate interstitial lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic inflammation especially centered around vessels and peribronchiolar spaces (Fig. 4A ,B, asterisks). In addition, marked edema was effacing the alveoli and interstitium in the G3 group (red arrowheads). At 2 dpc, G5 and G6 (low dose/vehicle and low dose/GC-376) presented similar but milder extent of lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic inflammation (Fig. 4C ,D, asterisks) compared to high dose groups. At 5 dpc, interstitial pneumonia in both G4 and G3 (high dose/GC-376 and high dose/vehicle) groups increased of severity and percentage of parenchyma affected (Fig. 4F ,G) and again no significant differences in scoring were observed. Alveolar septal www.nature.com/scientificreports/ thickening and consolidation were caused by the severe proliferation of type II pneumocytes and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation (Fig. 4F ,G arrowhead and asterisk, respectively). In addition, the high dose/vehicle G3 group presented a more pronounced neutrophilic inflammation ( Fig. 4G white arrowhead) with necrosis of alveolar septa, hemorrhage and presence of binucleated, and multinucleated epithelial cells (syncytia) sloughing into the alveolar lumen. Mild-moderate pleuritis was often observed in the affected groups. Despite the minimal differences observed at 5 dpc in the high dose challenged groups, 2 out of 3 mice treated with GC-376 and challenged with the low dose, did not present any pulmonary lesions (Fig. 4H ). In the low dose/vehicle group, mice presented mild to moderate lesions similar to what was already described in the previous high dose groups (G3 and G4). These also included marked alveolar edema and pleuritis (Fig. 4I , red arrowhead and black arrow, respectively). Airways were mostly spared of lesions, presenting occasional blebbing and sloughing of bronchial epithelial cells into the lumen (Fig. 4F ,G,I). By 14 dpc, none to minimal lesions were observed in G4 (high dose/ GC-376, only one survivor) (Fig. 4K) , whereas in G3 (high dose/vehicle) lesions at 14 dpc could not be evaluated because there were no survivors. At 14 dpc, the mice in G6 (low dose/GC-376) presented mild-moderate multifocal perivascular cuffing forming lymphoid nodular aggregates (Fig. 4L , asterisk). The G5 low dose/vehicle mice presented sparser lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltrates similar to the one observed at day 2 dpc (Fig. 4M, asterisk) . Lesions in the olfactory epithelium of the NT were minimal, only observed in 2 out of 3 mice at 2 dpc, in G4 (high dose/GC-376), G3 and G5 (high virus dose/vehicle and low virus dose/vehicle, respectively) at all timepoints, and none in G6 (low dose/GC367). These consisted of vacuolar degeneration, pyknosis and karyorrhexis of random single mucosal epithelial cells (Fig. 4O arrowheads) .",

Viral antigen was distributed in neurons of both the white and grey matters, and randomly across the olfactory bulb, cerebrum, limbic system (e.g., hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus) and brainstem. Interestingly, when challenged with the low dose, no antigen was detected in any of the mice in G6 (low virus dose/ GC-376) in contrast with all the mice in G5 (low virus dose/vehicle) which presented moderate to large amounts of viral antigen in the brain at 5 dpc (Fig. 5R,S) . This suggested a lower SARS-CoV-2 replication preventing the spreading of the virus in the presence of GC-376. These observations are consistent with the vRNA load data by RT-qPCR for both of these groups (Fig. 3C) . As expected, tissue samples from G1 (mock challenge/vehicle) showed absence of viral antigen staining (Fig. 5E,J,O,T) . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ IHC using antibodies against CD3 or Iba1 was performed to better characterize the type and extent of the cellular inflammatory infiltrate, T lymphocytes and cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, respectively ( Table 2) . No significant differences in numbers of CD3+ cells in any organ were noticed between vehicle-treated mice or GC-376 treated mice challenged with the high dose SARS-CoV-2 at the given timepoints (Fig. 6 , panels 1-2, 6-7, [11] [12] [16] [17] . On the contrary, a clearly lower number of CD3+ cells were observed at both 2 and 5 dpc in the lungs, NT and brain of G6 mice (low virus dose/GC-376) compared to G5 mice (low virus dose/ vehicle) (Fig. 6, panels 3-4, 8-9, 13-14, 18-19 ). This suggests a potential implication of GC-376 in preventing more severe inflammation and virus-induced tissue damage ( Fig. 6; Table 2 ). Similar results were observed with Iba1 IHC, showing similar staining patterns in the organs from the high dose challenge groups but lower staining overall in G6 (low dose/GC-376) when compared against its control G5 (low dose/vehicle) (Fig. 6 , panels [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] .

The current COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 45 million confirmed infections associated to more than 1 million deaths worldwide, a public health emergency of incomparable proportions in the twenty-first century 1 . Many anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral efforts have focused on the repurposing of antivirals compounds rather than the development of novel compounds. Among those, drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, favipiravir, ivermectin, among others have been proposed as promising candidates. There are currently more than 50 different clinical trials where compounds with potential antiviral activity are under evaluationn 22 . Previous studies have shown HCQ antiviral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-1 and, early during the COVID-19 pandemic, against SARS-CoV-2 23, 24 . However, further analysis in animal models (hamsters and monkeys) and in human clinical trials showed that HCQ is ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo [25] [26] [27] . More promising outcomes have been observed with remdesivir, an adenosine nucleoside triphosphate analog, that shows antiviral activity in vitro and in mice against a surrogate chimeric SARS-CoV-2 virus 13,28-30 . More importantly, remdesivir was shown to shorten the time to recovery of COVID-19 hospitalized patients 31, 32 . The FDA has recently approved the remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 patients, ages \u2265 12 years old and weighing \u2265 40 lb, that require hospitalization. However, remdesivir may offer limited benefits to those that are severely ill. More importantly, a press release from the WHO on November 20, 2020 recommends against the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients. Immunotherapy using convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies is another avenue of great focus in the treatment of COVID-19.",

For these studies we used the K18-hACE2 mouse model which was previously established as a suitable small animal model of SARS-CoV-1 infection 14 . We must note that at the time we initiated our studies, no reports were available in the public domain regarding the suitability of the K18-hACE2 mouse model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since then, several reports have emerged and our results are in agreement with the notion that the K18-hACE2 mouse model is a suitable small animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis 16, 17, 21 . Previous reports have also shown that K18-hACE2 mice are amenable for the study of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 20 but, to our knowledge, assessment of this mouse model for the evaluation of potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 was lacking. We observed clinical signs of disease and mortality in K18-hACE2 mice upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a virus dose-dependent manner (Figs. 3 and 4) . Severe clinical signs and 0% survival was observed at the high virus challenge dose in contrast to the relatively delayed onset of clinical signs and 60% survival at the low virus challenge dose demonstrating that this model is not hypersusceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Data on clinical signs and body weight monitoring indicated that mice in the low virus challenge dose were indeed infected and those that survived were essentially devoid of clinical signs by 14 dpc. This is relevant since the K18hACE2/SARS-CoV-2 model offers the opportunity to study disease outcome and host responses which in humans are thought to be related, at least in part, to the amount of virus during exposure. In contrast, other mouse models, either transduced with a recombinant adenovirus or modified with CRISPR/Cas9 to express hACE2 have shown limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and/or neither apparent clinical signs nor mortality 2, 35 .",

            "text": "We observed a modest although clearly beneficial effect of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo based on the collective analysis of the following observations: slight delay in onset of clinical signs accompanied by one survivor in the GC-376-treated group compared to no survivors in the vehicle-treated mice challenged with a high virus dose. More interindividual variations with several more tissue samples showing vRNA below levels of detection comparing GC-376-treated to vehicle-treated animals challenged with either high or low virus dose. Although not statistically significant, average lower vRNA levels were observed in tissue samples from the NT, lungs, and brain in mice treated GC-376 than in the vehicle-treated counterparts. Faster body weight recovery and significantly reduced vRNA presence in brain samples collected at 5 dpc was observed in GC-376-treated versus vehicle-treated mice challenged with low dose virus. The reduced vRNA load in brain samples was consistent with reduced viral antigen staining. Reduced virus involvement in the brain is important considering the neurologic features observed in COVID-19 patients where disorientation, poorly organized movements and confusion among other neurological symptoms have been observed 36 . Additionally, COVID-19 neurological symptoms can be potentially life threatening in around 65% of the cases 37 . A positive effect of GC-376 was also supported by the histopathological examinations and analysis of markers of cellular infiltration (CD3 and Iba1). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Milder lesions and lower detection of CD3+ and Iba1+ cells in lungs, NT and brain samples were observed in GC-376-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. The decrease in CD3+ and Iba1+ cells was correlated with milder inflammation also observed at HE. A lower, measured inflammatory response is thought to be favorable for the host, in contrast with an excessive inflammatory reaction, such as the multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, which is considered a major complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, often fatal in COVID-19 patients. The widespread virus colonization of neurons and associated meningoencephalitis observed in mice, partially explains the neurological deficits observed COVID-19 patients 37, 38 . Various infective mechanisms and paths can be exploited by the virus to reach the central nervous system. SARS-CoV-2 can access the brain through various neural or hematogenous routes that connect nasal mucosae, primary site of virus replication, to the anatomically adjacent forebrain across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone 39 . Our results are in agreement with the notion that virus dissemination to the brain is likely to occur from the upper respiratory tract via non-neuronal cells that provide metabolic and structural support to sensory olfactory nerve cells 40 . The modest in vivo antiviral activity of GC-376 in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18hACE2 mice is consisted with its moderate in vitro antiviral activity. The reported in vitro EC 50 values of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture range from 0.5 to 3.4 \u00b5M from several independent studies, depending on the cell types and assay conditions 12, 13, 41 . In comparison, a GC-376 analog 6j was recently reported to improve survival in MERS-CoV-infected mice, and the EC 50 value of the in vitro cellular antiviral activity of 6j against MERS-CoV was 0.04 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5M 10 . This result suggests that the in vitro cellular antiviral activity of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2 needs to be improved by 10-100-fold to achieve desired in vivo antiviral efficacy. As such, the lead optimization on GC-376 should mainly focus on improving the cellular antiviral activity. Alternatively, higher doses of GC-376, alone or in combination with other antivirals such as remdesivir or EIDD-2801 and/or anti-inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone could be evaluated against SARS-CoV-2. Although such studies are beyond the scope of the present report, they are undoubtedly warranted. This is particularly the case since currently approved intervention strategies are limited and not very efficacious to treat severe COVID-19 cases. To our knowledge, ours is the first to study the in vivo efficacy of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2. The precedent successful examples of GC-376 in treating FIP CoV infection and 6j in treating MERS-CoV infection in mice, coupled with the promising anti-inflammatory effects of GC-376 against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice from this current study, warrants further development of GC-376 to specifically target SARS-CoV-2.",
