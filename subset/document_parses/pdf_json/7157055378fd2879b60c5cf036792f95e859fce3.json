One thing that differs from previous epidemics is the updating of available information on confirmed cases and mortality on a global level, such as that provided by the Johns Hopkins University website (John Hopkins University, 2020). On 13 June 2020, 7.533.117 cases had been declared worldwide, 2.336.040 cases in Europe and 243.605 cases of COVID-19 in Spain, being Spain one of the countries with the highest number of cases declared (Spanish Government, 2020).",

At the beginning, masks and gloves were only recommended for health workers at risk of high exposure to COVID-19 patients, then passing to other workers exposed to potential contagion, and only at the end of the pandemic the use of masks became mandatory in all closed spaces and establishments, and in public spaces where an interpersonal distance of two metres could not be maintained, discouraging the use of gloves for the general population (Benavides, 2020) . The main reason for not advising the widespread use of masks may be in the unavailability of personal protective equipment worldwide. Therefore, in many essential workplaces, such as those dealing with food distribution, it was common for workers not to wear a mask in the exercise of their duties. It has also been observed that the perception of proper protection is associated with common mental health disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, poorer global health, and emotional problems (Simms et al., 2020; Videgaard, 2020) .",

As has been proven in previous epidemics such as SARS-CoV, in 2002 , MERS-CoV, in 2012 Ebola, between 2014-2016, the effects on mental health and stress have been important among this group (Schwartz et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2009) given the need to take on the challenge of managing a dangerous problem in terms of health and enormous uncertainty, as the effects are unknown until now. Health workers are at increased risk of developing the disease (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) and spreading it (Chang et al., 2020 ; Instituto Carlos III, 2020) because of the proximity during treatment of infected people. In this line, it is thought that work stress can weaken their immune system and, along with close contact with the infected, can lead to exposure to a higher viral load (Rose, 2020) . However, although it is true that health professionals must be a priority research group, it is no less true that many other professionals who practice activities that are considered essential have been exposed to possible contamination of the virus (Sim, 2020) , to transmit the virus to their relatives, and to be stigmatised, without being reflected in specific research or publications. Other activities such as treating the sick face-to-face and being responsible for their healing are only typical of health workers.",

Guides have also been published to assist physicians in the management of sick leaves and return to work (Rueda-Garrido et al., 2020; OSHA, 2020), or in the rehabilitation of workers after overcoming the disease (Barker-Davies et al., 2020), after discovering the importance of not delaying the start of rehabilitation more than 30 days after the acute phase (NICE, 2017). In Spain, decisions for return to work have been affected by the unavailability of tests for the detection of the disease or the logical uncertainty regarding the validity of such tests Ranka et al., 2020) , which has forced a permanent review of all protocols and guides following the continuous changes found in scientific evidence.

To assess the level of psychological distress, and according to the degree of mental health and psychological adjustment, the Goldberg GHQ-12 General Health Questionnaire was used, a self-administered scale of 12 items which allows screening of non-psychotic psychiatric disorders (Goldberg et al., 1997) . The final scoring ranges from 1 to 12, and each item has four possible answers, getting zero points in options 1 or 2, and 1 point in options 3 or 4. Values equal to or greater than 3 were considered to evidence the presence of psychological adjustment, obtaining an internal consistency index (Cronbach's Alpha of 0.869).",

The age of 43 years or less is close to the statistical significance OR = 1.403 (95% CI = 0.980-2.008), p = 0.64 (Table 6 ). In all three models, the Wald test assessed the individual statistical significance of each of the predictive variables, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated a good fit of the model, showing no statistical significance, with p-values of 0.928, 0.656, and 0.153 respectively. On the other hand, the omnibus test allowed to assert that the variables included in the models, taken together, help explain the modifications that occur in the probability of having or not psychological distress (p<.001 in the three models).",

A higher level of psychological distress has been observed among women, as in most previous studies (Rodriguez-Rey et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), being so among health workers (Lopez-Atanes et al., 2020), patients, their families, and general society (Leung et al., 2020) . In addition, women have been more willing to answer the questionnaire (66% of non-health workers who have answered it); perhaps the reason for this is their higher level of distress. This contrasts with the low number of women included in the sample of other COVID-19 research projects (Pinho-Gomes et al., 2020) or the few articles in which they appear as first author (Andersen et al., 2020) .",

However, health centres were prioritised, unlike other workers of essential activities, who could also be exposed to contagion (Benavides, 2020) . Among professional workers, the availability of protective measures has been a matter of concern associated with the fear of self-contagion and that of their families (Simms et al., 2020) . Fear that, indeed, has proven to be real since, according to official data, one in four of the infected was a healthcare professional (Instituto Carlos III, 2020). On the other hand, the number of health workers infected was questioned, since for most of the pandemic there were no diagnostic tests available for healthcare workers. The number of contagions among other workers of essential activities should also be questioned, as diagnostic tests were prioritised for health workers. In the present study, only 1.1% (12 cases) responded to have been performed a diagnostic test, being this number lower among workers who worked away from home 0.8% (4 cases). Contact with infected people or contaminated material has been observed to be a predictor of psychological distress regarding the group of non-health workers, and more specifically, those working from home.",
