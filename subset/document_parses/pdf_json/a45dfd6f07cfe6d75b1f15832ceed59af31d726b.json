Disadvantaged subgroups include those experiencing social inequities and discrimination based social categories, e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, Indigeneity, class, sexuality, and ability. In the general population, men have historically smoked at higher rates than women, but this gender gap favoring women is shrinking. Recent studies have found that the rate at which women smoke has not declined as rapidly as their male counterparts, largely as a result of biopsychosocial differences [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In particular, these differences contribute to more severe impacts of smoking on women, increased difficulty with quitting smoking, and increased relapse following quit attempts, especially among specific subgroups [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 12] .",

For example, smoking rates among women using alcohol and other substances have been reported to range from 53.5% to as high as 71.7% [14] ; these percentages may be greater among women in residential substance use treatment programs [15] . Additionally, compared to their male counterparts, women with SUDs face greater challenges addressing tobacco dependence due to higher lifetime rates of mood and anxiety disorders [16] . Women also face additional, gender-specific obstacles in accessing treatment for SUDs, including social stigma and child-caregiving pressures [17] . Unfortunately, researchers have documented a research-to-practice gap in adopting evidence-based practices for treating tobacco in substance use treatment centers (SUTCs) due to a widespread culture of smoking, high smoking rates among staff, misconceptions regarding clients' desire to quit, and the idea that quitting might interfere with SUD recovery [18] [19] [20] . Research refutes these misconceptions, indicating that on the contrary, SUTC clients want to quit smoking [21] , and that quitting can improve psychiatric symptoms [22, 23] and SUD recovery by increasing abstinence from alcohol and other substances by 25% [18] , and can increase psychological quality of life [24] . Sadly, more individuals with SUDs (>50%) die from smoking-related than from substance-related disease [25] . Moreover, women who have experienced trauma, domestic violence, and/or abuse are also at increased risk for tobacco and substance use [13, 26, 27] . Among women with posttraumatic stress disorder, recent studies indicate smoking rates ranged from 39.2% to 53.6% [26] . Taken together, these disparities, complemented by the intersecting challenges and stigmatization that female smokers experiencing disadvantage face, require tailored interventions to address the complex, multi-leveled factors influencing smoking behaviors among women in SUTCs [5] [6] [7] 28, 29 ]. An example of such a successful, evidence-based tobacco control intervention that uses a tailored approach is our Taking Texas Tobacco-Free (TTTF) program (www.takingtexastobaccofree.com) (accessed on 3 March 2021).",

            "text": "TTTF is a multi-component tobacco-free workplace (TFW) program that adopts a center-specific approach to implementation designed to target known implementation barriers to comprehensive and sustainable tobacco cessation policies and practices. TTTF applies a system-wide strategy, seeking to ultimately affect a change in organizational culture regarding the treatment of tobacco addiction through changing tobacco use norms using strategies that reduce tobacco-related inequities among groups experiencing disadvantage (i.e., single mothers, those with substance use and mental health disorders, sexual minorities, those experiencing homelessness, former prisoners, and those of lower socioeconomic status). The means used to change smoking norms is through education and training of clinicians-and through them, clients-by correcting misconceptions regarding: (a) tobacco use as an effective \"coping mechanism\" for stress; (b) the effects of quitting smoking on SUD recovery; (c) the harms and prevalence of smoking; (d) the motivation and capacity of those with SUDs to quit smoking; and (e) the distortions and manipulations of the tobacco industry's targeting of groups experiencing disadvantage. The program consists of: (1) adoption of organization-wide tobacco-free policies; (2) staff education on the harms of tobacco dependence; (3) specialized clinician training on how to assess and treat tobacco dependence using evidence-based interventions, i.e., tobacco-use screenings, behavioral interventions including the 5A's and motivational interviewing, and FDA-approved medications and nicotine replacement therapies (NRT); (4) provision of free NRT and practical, hands-on guidance from the TTTF team throughout the implementation process; and (5) community engagement and outreach. Our comprehensive program focuses on treating tobacco dependence among groups experiencing disadvantage with the highest smoking rates and need for assistance in quitting. To date, TTTF has been successfully implemented in 300 mental health centers [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] and has recently expanded into 30 standalone SUTCs/community centers [36] [37] [38] , four of which serve women only and are the subject of this report.",

Despite repeated calls for tailored interventions to address smoking cessation among women experiencing social and health inequities, few such programs have been developed [7, 13, 29, 42] . Likewise, scant research has focused on how intersecting vulnerabilities influence women's smoking [43, 44] . Intersectionality is a theoretical framework that centers on understanding how multiple social identities (gender, class, race/ethnicity, behavioral health status, single motherhood) intersect in an interactive, rather than an additive, manner to [re]produce relationships of power and oppression [45, 46] . The women within SUTCs/women-serving centers are especially vulnerable and at extremely high risk for smoking due to multiple, intersecting axes of inequality and identity: low socioeconomic status, low level of education, history of trauma and/or domestic violence, high stress, previous history in the criminal justice system, single motherhood, and having substance use and/or mental/behavioral health disorders [47] . As each of these is a stigmatized social category, an intersectional perspective can help elucidate how smoking-a stigmatized activity that can compound social isolation and stigmatization-is experienced by women living with multi-layered social inequities.",

Given the disparities in prenatal and postpartum smoking rates among low-income women and the significant risks associated with smoking during pregnancy, this study seeks to specifically examine the experiences of women smokers of childbearing age experiencing vulnerabilities [48, 49] . To effectively address smoking cessation among this group of smokers, an understanding of the meanings of smoking in the lives of these women, as well as their needs and preferences regarding smoking interventions, must first be understood [39] . As smoking is recognized as a health inequity issue disproportionately borne by groups experiencing disadvantage globally, an intersectional perspective can assist researchers in being particularly sensitive to how tobacco control policies may exacerbate social justice and stigmatization issues among these groups [3] . This study fills a gap in the literature regarding the tailoring of smoking cessation interventions to the social context and needs of women with SUDs experiencing multiple disadvantages.",

Our aim to understand how participants construct their experiences and meanings around smoking and how those understandings can inform tailoring of women-centered cessation interventions guided the study design. A qualitative research design based on an intersectional [46] and social constructionist framework was chosen as most appropriate for the present study as this perspective focuses on the way in which women's smoking is shaped by multiple identities and how they socially construct the world of experience and make sense or meaning of it [50] . Qualitative methodologies have been recognized as best suited to capturing and understanding individuals' experiences and perspectives [51] . Client focus groups were used to explore women's experiences with smoking and views on what they needed to successfully quit. Clinician focus group were also used to understand organizational culture, and what types of client support and services were being offered, both generally and those specific to tobacco control. Different types of purposive sampling were used based on the size of the participating center. Criterion sampling was used with smaller centers, which involved selecting clients with smoking experience and clinicians involved with TTTF's implementation. If the center was large enough to allow for additional variation in sampling, heterogeneous sampling was used in which program supporters as well as opponents were selected to capture a wide range of responses. The combination of different purposive sampling strategies increased the breadth and variation of data collection, and strengthened the analytical approach of the study [51] . Inclusion criteria included adults age 18 or older (for clients, those self-identifying as women, and who spoke English), and were either clients or clinicians providing direct client services (e.g., counselors, peer support) at a women-only serving SUTC or community center participating in the TTTF program (grant #PP170070). Focus group participants were recruited via coordination with the center program champion-a volunteer clinician or manager who was trained as a tobacco treatment specialist [52] as part of the TTTF program, and who was not additionally compensated for this position.",

Our study contributes to and expands upon a limited body of literature on developing smoking interventions tailored to women with SUDs experiencing disadvantage. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study of women with SUDs experiencing disadvantage focused on participants' experiences of a smoking cessation intervention that was tailored to the social context of their smoking and their cessation needs in collaboration with women in multiple settings. Findings are framed within the intersecting psychosocial and structural inequities that constrain the lives and choices of women experiencing disadvantage and describe the meanings they attribute to smoking and their experiences and recommendations regarding the TTTF program to inform the tailoring of effective smoking cessation interventions based on their needs and preferences. Study findings attest to the fact that in spite of the multiple challenges and disadvantages these women face, they are willing and capable of reducing or quitting smoking when they are provided respectful, compassionate, and supportive care and cessation services that are responsive to their circumstances. As such, this study contributes to a small body of research [5, 6, 59] which recognizes that the challenges and complexities of addressing smoking cessation among women with SUDs should compel rather than deter researchers from engaging in interventions tailored to their circumstances given the high rate of smoking among this population and their dire need for assistance in quitting.",

These multiple psychosocial stressors can result in high levels of perceived stress, which has been associated with a higher prevalence of smoking [61] , particularly among women [8] . However, abundant research also shows that nicotine has been associated with increasing stress [24, 62, 63] , which in turn drives smokers to smoke even more, trapping them in an endless cycle of addiction. Withdrawal symptoms of nicotine include anxiety, irritability, and depression, which are reliably alleviated by smoking, leading smokers to conclude that smoking provides psychological benefits, when smoking and nicotine withdrawal is what initially caused these psychological disturbances [24] . As such, misattributing stress relief with smoking, which is also promoted in tobacco advertising [7] , can only worsen these symptoms of stress. Supporting cessation among these women also necessitates correcting this misattribution by decoupling smoking from stress relief. Overcoming the cravings and withdrawal symptoms of recovering from any addiction is a complex and stressful process. Behavioral health clinicians do not question the value of assisting women to overcome their substance use addiction, yet, as study participants reported, they often fail to treat tobacco as a harmful addiction, even though high mortality rates among those with alcohol and SUDs are attributed to tobacco-related diseases rather than alcohol or drug use [64] -with more than 50% of those in treatment dying from smoking-related diseases [25] .",

Such experiential insights into the relationship between stress and smoking provide clinicians with a valuable opportunity to meaningfully address smoking cessation and to correct this misattribution. Thus, supporting women to relinquish a behavior that is physically unhealthy to them and their families, that threatens their psychological wellbeing by increasing anxiety and depression, and that keeps them trapped in a vicious cycle of nicotine addiction and increased probability of SUD relapse [65] . Research indicates that former smokers will reap the psychological benefits of quitting by around 3 weeks, due to the abating of withdrawal symptoms [66] . Moreover, even within these treatment and women's center-either before they adopted a TFW policy or for those that did not-clients and clinicians reported that smoking continued to be the main social activity for women, which led those who had quit or were non-smokers to take up smoking. Unfortunately, the failure to replace smoking within these centers with another healthy social activity (e.g., group \"walks\" for physical activity) represents a missed opportunity for smoking cessation and recovery in general, and for correcting the misattribution of stress relief with smoking, as it reinforces smoking as the requisite social currency, the means of \"relaxing\" and socializing [57] . This practice can also increase the internal conflicts women experience around smoking in wanting to socialize while also feeling shame and compelled to quit for their children [67] . Stigmatization for smoking among pregnant women or those with small children is high [68] . Mothers within this study shamed themselves and others for smoking, particularly during pregnancy; for many it was only during pregnancy that they had successfully quit, although post-partum relapse rates are high [69] [70] [71] and at least partially attributable to negative affect/stress and low perceived agency (i.e., self-efficacy/self-confidence), which may be common among women facing myriad disadvantages. However, a number of smoking cessation interventions have focused on women with SUDs' increased motivation to quit while pregnant for the sake of their child's health as an opportunity to enlist them in successfully giving up smoking [59] . Framing smoking cessation negatively, where guilt, shame, or stigmatization is used to motivate already stigmatized female smokers to relinquish a behavior that affords them pleasure not only fails to support quitting, but increases resolve to continue smoking [68] , even though women also perceived smoking as self-destructive. The fact that some women continued to smoke under these conflicting and difficult circumstances underscores the complexities of their tobacco addiction and challenges to quitting.",

Many women reported that emphasizing shame and guilt, whether arising from self or others, only kept them in the vicious cycle of addiction. For other women, agency in quitting was primary; they attributed successfully quitting to having made the decision themselves, rather than being told, to quit [72] . These women benefited from motivational interviewing, which recognizes that readiness to change habits results from inner change combined with external opportunities that align with a time and pace appropriate to the individual [73, 74] . Many reported smoking and substance use triggered each other [75] ; ample research documents the association between smoking and substance use [13] [14] [15] . Engaging in smoking and substance use was so inextricably connected for some women that they reported feeling that giving up smoking would free them from their substance addiction.",

Some clinicians supported the notion that treating tobacco and substance use addiction simultaneously could jeopardize SUD recovery; attempting to recover from both would stress clients excessively, resulting in their SUD relapse and undervalued tobacco addiction as a problem; which has been recognized as a serious barrier to treating tobacco dependence within these settings [63] . In spite of significant research demonstrating that, on the contrary, quitting smoking increases abstinence from alcohol and other substances by 25% [18] , decreases anxiety [22] , and increases overall psychological quality of life [24] , this misconception regarding smoking and substance use treatment is entrenched among behavioral health clinicians and communicated to clients. These attitudes then become internalized by clients, to become additional internal challenges to quitting augmented by the absence of clinician support in addressing smoking. Other studies confirm clients and clinicians in SUTCs often do not support women in quitting smoking while in recovery; in fact, clinicians encourage women to smoke as a means of \"pacifying\" them [6] . The failure of treatment providers to conceptualize and frame tobacco use disorder as a chronic and relapsing disease in need of recovery advocacy and support-similar to other addictions-can disenfranchise clients from getting the care they need in behavioral health treatment settings [76] . However, most of our program partners were dedicated to changing the permissive \"culture of smoking\" traditionally associated with behavioral health and addiction treatment centers.",

Physical activity has been demonstrated to acutely reduce cigarette craving [77, 78] . A recent tobacco treatment intervention for women in a SUTC based on physical activity and smoking cessation counseling resulted in successfully reducing nicotine dependence and smoking among participants [5] . Likewise, both of our stakeholder groups emphasized peer group smoking cessation counseling was preferable, as peer support was also essential [42] . Many clinicians had recovered from SUDs and smoking themselves and knew first-hand how essential social support interventions were to their successful recovery. Cessation interventions that increase social support are recognized as successfully promoting cessation among women experiencing socioeconomical disadvantages [79] , and are especially relevant because: (1) these women live in environments where smoking is socially accepted and may need additional social support while tackling cessation [13] ; and (2) economic realities mean they must rely on free psychosocial support offered by community health programs or state Quitlines for quitting assistance [41] . Women were concerned they would resume smoking once they returned to their \"normal\" life (i.e., were discharged from the residential setting) where smoking was an accepted social norm [41] . In fact, some were more concerned about relapsing regarding tobacco than illicit drug use, given the legality and accessibility of tobacco, and therefore were grateful for receiving treatment in a smoke-free environment that supported them in their efforts to quit. This finding corroborates the value of TFW policies in promoting successful quit attempts among those experiencing disadvantages and as an important part of their tobacco recovery [80] . Here again, these women require additional support to continue to be smoke-free, such as distributing NRT to family members as well as clients [32] , whenever feasible, as encouraged by TTTF. Adoption of supportive community-level interventions, such as tobacco-free policies and smoke-free homes can provide important additional social supports to women and their families to remain smoke-free once they have left treatment centers [81] [82] [83] .",

Overall, clinicians' and clients' experiences regarding TTTF were largely positive. Even those clients who were either not interested in quitting or rebelled against not having a choice about quitting while in recovery saw TTTF as an opportunity to quit smoking for those interested in doing so. In fact, many women said they were grateful for the TFW policy that banned smoking while they were in recovery, as they never would have quit otherwise, and they recognized that quitting supported their SUD recovery. A number of these women had been in recovery repeatedly without ever having been offered the chance to also quit smoking, and they had all relapsed [65] . For these women, the opportunity offered by TTTF to quit all of their addictions at once made sense to them, as substance and tobacco use go hand-in-hand. Women were happy they had quit, reporting feeling better, healthier, and that their children were grateful they had stopped smoking. Clients and clinicians stated that the supports they received from TTTF, i.e., NRT, supportive and educational smoking cessation counseling and compassionate motivational support, had helped clients to quit smoking. Additionally, in response to clinicians' and clients' requests, we developed materials and strategies to facilitate program implementation and community outreach, based on collaboration with these stakeholders, e.g., educational brochures on the hazards of second-hand smoke and smoking for pregnant women. It is important to note that although all of the SUTCs had adopted a 100% tobacco-free policy within their centers' parameters, women could sneak a smoke while off-campus attending referred treatment, whereas the women's center did have designated smoking areas. As such, even though women in the SUTCs were enrolled in a tobacco-free program, most could exercise their choice to smoke or to quit smoking.",

Each of the different SUTCs and women's centers that participated in the TTTF program were unique and had leeway on implementation of program adaptations to their center according to their needs and resources.

Researchers advocate that smoking cessation interventions for women experiencing disadvantages should: (1) be tailored to women's needs; (2) focus on building confidence and motivation; (3) incorporate social justice issues; and (4) adopt a holistic and comprehensive approach [13] . TTTF is allied with these recommendations. Firstly, in conducting formative research to adapt the program to women's needs, which included counselors drawing up individualized recovery and quit plans for women, TTTF was women-tailored. Secondly, clinicians were trained in using non-judgmental approaches to address client tobacco use, including motivational interviewing and the 5A's (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange). Thirdly, sensitivity to social justice issues and not increasing the stigmatization of these women experiencing vulnerabilities guided program design and was seen, for example, in educational programming that emphasized the tobacco companies' unscrupulous marketing practices. While denormalization strategies, which attempt to influence social norms as a means of supporting smoking cessation, can contribute to stigmatization [72] , TTTF relied on norms-related approaches focused on changing smoking behavior that did not increase inequality and stigmatization [3, 84] . We adopted a social norms marketing strategy, which is based on the idea that perceived social norms influence our behavior; however, individuals' understandings of social norms are based on perceptions of certain behaviors, which may be incorrect [84] .",

As these misperceptions contribute to smoking behavior, correcting them served as a crucial strategy for achieving smoking cessation through correction of a biased inequality in the choices faced by these women experiencing disadvantages. That is, those within groups experiencing disadvantages that have a higher prevalence of smoking can perceive norms through a misleading lens that could increase their likelihood of smoking [3] . Likewise, a tobacco industry denormalization strategy was included in our trainings for clinicians, in which, rather than focusing on denormalizing and vilifying tobacco use among women, the aim was to alter perceptions of the tobacco industry, revealing the fraudulent, unethical, and manipulative tactics used to target groups facing disadvantages [84] . As the tobacco industry is also complicit via its targeted campaigns to distort social norms regarding smoking among those living with disadvantages, both of these norms-related strategies are equitable and non-stigmatizing, as they shift the blame for smoking away from the individual smoker to the context of smoking and to the tobacco industry. Lastly, the TTTF program adopts a comprehensive approach, targeting system-level changes (organization, community, clinician, client), and adopts an integrated approach to treating mental health, SUDs, and tobacco use, given the co-occurring disorders experienced by these women confronting multiple disadvantages. Through our program, women were provided with motivational support, behavioral counseling, and pharmacological support, e.g., varied NRT, that assisted them with nicotine withdrawal, and which they reported facilitated their quitting, in keeping with best practices for smoking cessation [85] .",

            "text": "As a study focused on contributing to the tailoring of smoking cessation interventions to women experiencing various disadvantages, the applicability of findings may be limited. Pre-and post-implementation focus groups were conducted with different clients (e.g., due to 90-day residential programs), which limited the extent to which the same clients could comment on pre-and post-implementation center changes. However, findings were consistent with and support those of other studies focused on women with SUDs experiencing social disadvantages [6, 13, 60] . A strength of this study is that key stakeholders, clinicians, and clients were enlisted as collaborators in adapting the program to women's needs and preferences. Additionally, program detractors, as well as program supporters, were purposefully selected to participate in focus groups, to minimize social desirability bias. Given the centrality of addressing these women's high level of stress and their misattribution of stress relief with smoking, intervention studies are needed that focus on investigating the effects of this misperception among women in treatment for SUDs. The increasingly wide inequalities between those living with advantage and those living with disadvantage can only lead to further stigmatization of smokers experiencing disadvantage, necessitating more research that targets social inequities and contextualizes health behaviors. Finally, as female smokers experiencing disadvantage live under the burden of multiple social inequalities, targeting specific health behaviors such as smoking may not be sufficient. More comprehensive smoking cessation projects are needed that target the multi-level factors, rather than simply the individual factors, that together create the conditions of vulnerability contributing to smoking among these women. The complexity of addressing smoking cessation among women undergoing disadvantage requires research that provides evidence of \"best practices\" that have proven effective in addressing tobacco dependency among this group [70, 74, 86] .",

Addressing tobacco reduction or cessation among women with SUDs is challenging and requires commitment, as these women require dedicated, focused, and contextualized support, which most critically starts with supporting and re-educating clinicians in using non-stigmatizing and equitable approaches to tobacco cessation. Assisting women in learning healthy ways of coping with stress as well as correcting clinicians' and clients' prevalent misconceptions that support smoking-e.g., smoking relieves stress, and quitting smoking jeopardizes SUD recovery-were crucial to helping them quit. The components women identified as necessary to help them quit-the provision of NRT, and non-shaming, compassionate, and supportive strategies that assisted them in developing self-awareness and self-compassion and understanding of the connections between their drug and tobacco use-were aligned with the TTTF program that responded to the context of smoking within their lives. Clients and clinicians alike reported that tailored interventions should include non-judgmental approaches, use of varied NRT, dedicated smoking cessation counseling and peer support, physical activity, and access to tobacco-free environments, including the adoption of a TFW policy, to facilitate tobacco use recovery. Study findings demonstrate how to adapt a TFW program to be responsive to the intersecting social inequities that constrain the lives and choices of these women, through tailored interventions and strategies that promote equity in tobacco control policies and decrease further stigmatization of women smokers experiencing disadvantage. These findings present an effective model for treating tobacco dependence tailored to the needs and preferences of women experiencing disadvantage that they reported was successful in assisting them to quit smoking while in SUD recovery. TTTF serves as a model of an effective comprehensive TFW program that can be tailored to the needs and populations of community centers interested in treating tobacco dependence.",

Even though it wasn't my choice initially, I don't want to continue smoking. So, I'm optimistic about being able to do it this time. (Joy, SUTC3) [NRT] is really the only thing that's helped. I think it's the patch with the lozenge because it's an oral fixation, smoking is something in your mouth all the time. (Laura, SUTC3)",
