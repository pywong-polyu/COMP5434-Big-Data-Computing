In their recent JAMA Cardiology article, Shi and colleagues reported an association between cardiac injury and higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Approximately 20% (82 patients) of the study cohort presented with a cardiac injury. The investigators identified cardiac injury as an independent risk factor of mortality during hospitalization (52% with cardiac injury vs. 5% without cardiac injury, p < 0.001). Consequently, their findings are highly relevant for patients with preexisting cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Among those are patients with neurological disorders. There is a considerable prevalence of myocardial injury in patients with acute neurological illness, which appears to adversely affect prognosis. Individuals with an underlying neurological disorder are particularly vulnerable to increased cardio-cerebrovascular disease risk due to physical limitations and the pathophysiology of their condition. Thus, we would like to specifically highlight the attention of health care professionals treating patients with pervasive neurological disorders to their potentially elevated risk of poorer COVID-19 related outcomes.",

First, the authors excluded over 588 patients of the initial cohort, of whom 39% were excluded because of missing cardiac biomarkers, including values of hs-TNI and creatine kinase myocardial band. This is problematic as patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions are more likely to get tested for cardiac biomarkers, which can lead to a selection bias. Second, patients with cardiac injury were older (median age, 74 vs. 60 years, p < 0.001); had higher levels of leukocytes, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and creatinine; and had lower levels of lymphocytes and platelets compared with patients without cardiac injury.",

For example, individuals with spinal cord injury often present with chronic inflammation and a degree of immune impairment, either as a result of reduced physical activity or autonomic nervous system dysfunction causing immunodeficiency through diminished innervation of lymphoid organs or associated endocrine disorders. 10 Thus, we would like to specifically highlight the attention of health care professionals treating patients with pervasive neurological disorders to their potentially elevated risk of poorer COVID-19 related outcomes. It is of utmost importance that the practice of social distancing is emphasized in these population groups and vulnerable individuals adhere to self-isolation practices to minimize transmission of the disease. These practices are particularly relevant for individuals with neurological disorders given the increased prevalence and constellation of risk factors identified by Shi and colleagues as important for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.",
