The time from the onset of disease until clinical symptoms occur is known as the pre-clinical phase. The individual has the disease but doesn't know it. The clinical phase is the latter part of the process, from the occurrence of clinical symptoms through therapy and outcome [4] . Within the preclinical phase, there may be an interval between the onset of the disease and the occurrence of clinical symptoms during which disease can be detected with certain screening tests. This is called a detectable pre-clinical, or latent, phase.

If condition X has a high prevalence in the population (e.g. hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, endemic infections, amongst others) or a high pre-test probability in a given individual and \u03b5 > 1, then significant drops in prevalence will not bring about significant drops in PPV until prevalence drops below a certain threshold, which for cases of \u03b5 > 1, occurs at low prevalence levels. It thus follows that in cases like this, the screening tests detection ability remains relatively stable until it has significantly helped drop the prevalence.

That said, we can consider the predictive values \u03c1(\u03d5) to be most consequential to the individual clinician over the other parameters. Why is \u03c1(\u03d5) a more critical parameter for the clinician than sensitivity and specificity? This is simply because the interpretation of predictive values is done at the level of a single test result, among individuals in whom a diagnosis has not yet been made, and whose ultimate diagnostic status is therefore unknown. In the case of sensitivity and specificity, the ultimate diagnostic status in the patient must be known a priori in order to determine whether a particular screening test is sensitive and/or specific. As such, chronologically speaking, since screening tests lead to eventual diagnoses, the interpretation of a test must occur before a diagnosis is made. Fig 3 depicts a random sample of combinations of \u03b5 values calculated from random sensitivities and specificities, and their corresponding prevalence threshold (\u03d5 e ) values. To obtain the prevalence at which the threshold is crossed, multiply the values in red by 10. \u03d5 e is undefined in the special case where the geometry of the screening curve becomes linear as a consequence of \u03b5 equalling 1. Though there is indeed little clinical applicability for tests whose \u03b5 value is < 1, the point of demonstrating the aforementioned cases is to complete the theory for all possible values of prevalence and sensitivity/specificity even if they're not commonly encountered in clinical practice. The reason is simple-sometimes those tests are all that exist for certain conditions. One can contemplate a test whose specificity is poor but whose sensitivity to rule out disease is good so that \u03b5 \ufffd 1.",

We thus obtain: As noted in the figure above, significant drops in prevalence only marginally impact the PPV until the prevalence threshold is reached. In other words, when the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases drops below 9.3 percent, the nasal RT-PCR test's PPV drops significantly faster. Since 9.3 percent of the population has thankfully not been infected at any given time, we deduce that a significant proportion of the current positive nasal RT-PCR tests are false positives. The benefits of contextualizing the validity of a screening test in real time cannot be understated This is indeed a critical exercise since a large number of public health decisions rely on the validity of these screening tests. With a reliable test, we can better inform the individual on his or her risk of contracting and transmitting the disease in question. Likewise, it can guide quarantine guidelines so as to best integrate that individual back into the economy and society at large. Furthermore, reliable estimates of incidence and prevalence with good tests can guide the proper distribution of resources to contain the spread of the virus. All in all, understanding where this prevalence point lies in the curve has important implications for the administration of healthcare systems, the implementation of public health measures, the development of epidemiologic models, and in cases of pandemics like SARS-CoV-2, the functioning of society at large. When the prevalence drops below the prevalence threshold, the censoring of patients never affected needs to be contrasted with the Bayesian limitations imposed by the screening paradox. ",

In consequence, there is an inflection point of maximum curvature in the screening curve defined as a function of the sensitivity and specificity beyond which the rate of change of a test's PPV declines sharply relative to disease prevalence. Herein, we demonstrate a mathematical model exploring this phenomenon and define the prevalence threshold point where this change occurs. To the best of our knowledge, while this concept is a simple consequence of Bayes' theorem and the natural shape of screening curves, it has never been properly formalized mathematically as showcased in this work. The prevalence threshold can help contextualize the validity of a screening test in real time, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics and epidemiology of specific conditions.
