This was a retrospective observational study in two centers. Hospitalized patients with CAP were grouped according to the empiric regimen (ceftaroline versus standard therapy) and analyzed using a propensity score matching (PSM) method to reduce confounding factors. Out of the 6981 patients enrolled, 5640 met the inclusion criteria, and 89 of these received ceftaroline. After PSM, 78 patients were considered in the ceftaroline group (cases) and 78 in the standard group (controls). Ceftaroline was mainly prescribed in cases with severe pneumonia (67% vs. 56%, p = 0.215) with high suspicion of Staphylococcus aureus infection (9% vs. 0%, p = 0.026). Cases had a longer length of hospital stay (13 days vs. 10 days, p = 0.007), while an increased risk of in-hospital mortality was observed in the control group compared to the case group (13% vs. 21%, HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.62, p = 0.003). The empiric use of ceftaroline in hospitalized patients with severe CAP was associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality.",

However, this combination is not good enough to cover Staphylococcus aureus, which is increasingly identified as a cause of severe pneumonia with high associated mortality, particularly in cases related to influenza virus co-infection or COVID-19 [1, 6, 7] . Also, the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and penicillin-and ceftriaxone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in severe CAP has made this combination of antibiotics less effective [8, 9] . Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that covers gram-positive bacteria (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and drug-resistant S. pneumoniae) and third-generation-susceptible gram-negative bacilli [10] . Results of the FOCUS 1 and 2 trials demonstrated the superiority of ceftaroline against ceftriaxone in bacterial CAP; however, these studies did not include severe cases and the mortality rate was low [10] . In comparison with ceftriaxone, ceftaroline has shown to have superior in vitro activity against S. aureus (\u2265 16-fold more potent than ceftriaxone against MSSA and active against MRSA), S. pneumoniae, and other common CAP pathogens [11, 12] .",

Ceftaroline has been proposed as a better alternative to ceftriaxone during influenza season when S. aureus is more prevalent [17] . Severe infections characterize this population [18, 19] , and it explains why ceftaroline was used mainly in critically ill patients in our cohort (67% presented with severe CAP). These patients had a higher prevalence of S. aureus and a recent history of pneumococcal vaccine. Ceftaroline is 16 times more active against MSSA (MIC 90 0.25 versus 4 mg/L) than ceftriaxone and is active against MRSA as well [11] . Furthermore, available data about critically ill patients suggest that 2 g of ceftriaxone does not reach adequate plasma concentrations [20] . In the case of ceftaroline, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target is achieved with a standard dosage, although PK data in critically ill patients is lacking. In addition, an animal model of pneumonia due to MRSA-producing Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) showed that ceftaroline was bactericidal and also significantly reduced PVL concentration in the lung [21] . All of this data could explain why better results were obtained in 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT) [22] [23] [24] comparing the clinical efficacy of ceftaroline vs. ceftriaxone. In a meta-analysis of these studies, which included 1916 patients, ceftaroline (600 mg/12 h) was superior to ceftriaxone (1-2 g/24 h) in terms of clinical recovery (OR 1.66; 95% CI 1.34, 2.06) [25] ; however, mortality rate in these studies was low (1.5% in each group) [25] .",

Several studies have reported an association between the use of the combination of \u03b2-lactams plus macrolide and lower mortality in CAP, when compared to the use of \u03b2-lactams in monotherapy [28, 29] . However, Postma et al. [30] . found that \u03b2-lactam monotherapy was not inferior to the treatment with combination of \u03b2-lactams and macrolides or fluoroquinolone monotherapy with respect to 90-day mortality in patients with non-severe CAP. The main benefits of macrolides include a reduction in pneumolysin, immunomodulation, and activity against atypical pathogens, albeit not against S. aureus [31] . An association of macrolide with levofloxacin offers activity against S. aureus, but there ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; IQR, interquartile range; ICU, intensive care unit; PSI, Pneumonia Severity Index; SD, standard deviation.

In addition, the use of fluoroquinolones is associated with severe adverse effects [32, 33] . The potent activity of ceftaroline against S. aureus, the possibility to combine it with a macrolide, and the present article showing good outcomes in patients with severe CAP highlight how such a combination could offer broad-spectrum coverage, potent bactericidal activity, and the potential benefits of macrolides. We believe that our statistical approach using a PSM is a strength in this study. There are, however, some limitations due to the final total sample size. In this study, we were able to analyze only 78 patients in each group (total N = 156). This sample size may result in a large type II error, and conclusions that can be drawn are limited. This aside, though, the rigorous approach to the study underpins our confidence in its findings and their clinical relevance. Another limitation of this study is the analysis of empiric antibiotic therapy, without consideration of dose or duration of the treatment.",

            "text": "Our data showed that ceftaroline was associated with a decreased risk of mortality in hospitalized patients with severe CAP. Ceftaroline is a very active \u03b2-lactam against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, which can be associated with a macrolide without a loss of beneficial effects. This explains why ceftaroline was recommended by current ATS/IDSA guidelines [1] in the management of CAP. Our experience supports the use of ceftaroline in patients with severe CAP. ",
