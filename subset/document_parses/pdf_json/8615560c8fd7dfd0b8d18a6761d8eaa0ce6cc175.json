            "text": "I n early 2020, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were diagnosed in the United States. 1 In March 2020, the federal government and states began to implement mitigation efforts, including recommendations for individuals to engage in health protective behaviors to prevent COVID-19. Several protective behaviors have been recommended, including handwashing/hand sanitizing, social distancing, avoiding crowded public spaces, and wearing face masks. 2 Several studies have shown these protective behaviors to be effective in slowing the spread of COVID-19. [3] [4] [5] [6] Although face mask usage increased between April 2020 (78%) and June 2020 (89%), there was no substantial change in handwashing, social distancing, and avoiding public or crowded places during the same period. 7 Research conducted in the United States and Europe has shown that engagement in health protective behaviors varies by socioeconomic characteristics, with the lowest engagement of protective behaviors among younger adults (aged 18-29 years), those with lower levels of education, and boys/men. [7] [8] [9] [10] Conversely, reports of health protective behaviors are highest among older adults, those with higher incomes, and those who report higher levels of fear of COVID-19. 7, [11] [12] [13] Race/ethnicity also seems to play a role in the adoption of health protective behaviors. For example, Whites were less likely to report wearing a face mask than Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians. 9, 14 The potential effects of COVID-19 infection for people with chronic illness, including severe COVID-19, intensive care unit admission, and mortality, may increase awareness regarding their potential susceptibility to infection and lead to higher overall engagement in health protective behaviors. 15 Prior research, however, has indicated that increases in stress related to COVID-19 may lead to maladaptive coping strategies (eg, denial, behavioral disengagement) and lower engagement in health protective behaviors. 16 The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between sociodemographic factors, chronic health conditions, fear of COVID-19, COVID-19 stressors, and the perception of risk from COVID-19 and their influence on the use of health protective behaviors among a sample of Arkansans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although studies of health protective behaviors have been conducted at the national level, none looked specifically at rural southern states, which may differ from a national perspective. Gaining insight into how these factors influence the adoption of health protective behaviors can help inform targeted health messaging and interventions for future public health emergencies. 17 ",

            "text": "The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between sociodemographic factors, chronic health conditions, fear of COVID-19, COVID-19 stressors, the perception of risk from COVID-19, and engagement in health protective behaviors among a sample of Arkansans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the majority of respondents reported engaging in high levels of health protective behaviors, including handwashing, use of hand sanitizers, wearing a face mask, and social distancing. The number of respondents reporting face mask use (97.4%) is higher than in previous nationally representative studies, in which 89% of respondents reported wearing face masks in June 2020. 7 This is likely because of the face mask mandate put into place by Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson via executive order on July 20, immediately before distribution of the survey. 20 Fewer Arkansans reported staying home when not sick or asking family and friends not to visit compared with other protective behaviors. Given that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is transmissible even in presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, 21 the lower rates of staying home when not sick and asking family and friends not to visit is concerning and was likely a contributing factor to prior surges of COVID-19 in Arkansas. 22 Although the survey did not ask where individuals were spending their time, staying home and limiting in-person contact as much as possible were recommended to avoid infection and curb the spread of COVID-19. Social isolation, such as staying home alone for long periods, however, is difficult for underresourced communities, including those with lower levels of education. For example, our results indicate that increased education is associated with engaging in an increased number of protective health behaviors. People with lower levels of education may be more likely to work in jobs in which they are unable to work from home. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of education have greater access to resources and may have had more opportunity to understand and engage with specific recommended behaviors, such as working from home. 23 Work in northwest Arkansas has shown the effectiveness of support services providing assistance with basic needs to allow people to isolate or quarantine in reducing the level of infection in an underresourced community. 24 Providing support services for underresourced communities, including provision of essential items such as food and medications, coordination with worksites, and coordination with community social and behavioral health services should be considered a vital part of future pandemic response plans. 24, 25 The number of health protective behaviors engaged in were higher for older adults, particularly for those in the 50-to 59-yearold age group, which is consistent with prior research. 7 Lower levels of engagement in health protective behaviors among younger adults (18-29 years) may help to explain the increases in COVID-19 cases in this age group. 7 The increases in cases among young adults often were followed by increases in cases among older at-risk populations. 7 In addition, engagement in health protective behaviors was higher among female and Black individuals. 9, 14 Prior research has shown sex and racial/ethnic background can influence engagement in health protective behaviors, and these results support those findings. 8, 9, 14, 26 Despite increased engagement with health protective behaviors, Black and other minority populations had a higher prevalence of COVID-19. 27 The disparities in infection rates are likely the result of existing inequalities, which lead to minority populations living in denser neighborhoods in multigenerational housing and having a higher likelihood of working in essential job categories. 28 In planning for future responses to public health emergencies, officials will need to prioritize the development of clear and targeted messaging and behavior modification tactics, especially for younger adults, White individuals, and men to encourage engagement with health protective behaviors.",

The sampling frame was limited to those who had registered with ARresearch and, therefore, may not be generalizable to populations outside Arkansas; however, the results may provide insight into the health protective behaviors adopted by individuals who are similar to the study sample. In addition, all of the measures used were self-reported and, therefore, carry the risk of social desirability bias. This limitation is reduced through the use of validated questions, and prior work demonstrated the limited effects of self-report even for sensitive questions (eg, substance use). 32 Scales and measures related to COVID-19 have continuously evolved, and given when this survey was designed, not all of the measures are what we would have chosen later in the pandemic when validated measures were more readily available (eg, the Perceived Vulnerability to COVID-19 Scale uses questions with different Likert scales). Moreover, COVID-19 and recommendations for health protective behaviors have rapidly evolved, and because of the cross-sectional nature of the study, we are not adequately able to account for changes in state policies or personal behaviors over time. Despite the limitations, this article adds to the knowledge of the engagement in and the correlates of health protective behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
