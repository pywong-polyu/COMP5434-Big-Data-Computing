In addition, antibody testing can provide additional information about past infections, and has the advantage of being easier to set up compared to RT-PCR and easy to access in the early stages of a pandemic [9] .

All the serum samples were collected from all COVID-19 confirmed and admitted patients with sufficient volume of serum remained after the routine laboratory tests in each healthcare institution. An average of 2.7 samples per patient was included (maximum number of samples per single patient was 57). The clinical characteristics of the patients were reviewed using the electronic medical records. If each patient has symptoms of various respiratory infections, such as fever, malaise, cough, sputum, dyspnea and pneumonia, as well as non-specific symptoms such as sore throat, headache, hemoptysis, nausea, and diarrhea, that case was classified as the symptomatic group, and the case without acute symptoms was classified as the asymptomatic group.

William et al. reported that the IgG level increased early only in patients with severe COVID-19, but the IgM level increased soon after symptom onset of both mild and severe COVID-19 [19] . A recent study of 37 asymptomatic patients reported that they had a significantly longer viral shedding duration and lower virus-specific IgG level in the acute phase than symptomatic patients [20] . We found a significant difference in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, after stratification by number of weeks elapsed since symptom onset, there was no significant difference in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity according to the presence and absence of symptoms.

Further researches on these would be needed. Although having these limitation, this study conducted a multiple comparative tests collecting specimens from 6 different institutions to evaluate the serological status of COVID-19 patients in South Korea. In conclusion, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody persisted, and the level increased for 13 weeks after symptom onset with high COI. Also, a decreasing antibody COI pattern in the early stages of infection (up to 5 weeks) might be related to a poor prognosis of COVID-19. As new treatments and vaccines are introduced, it is important to monitor continuously the usefulness of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. ",
