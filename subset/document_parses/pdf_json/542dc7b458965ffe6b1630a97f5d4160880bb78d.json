            "text": "Purpose To establish the feasibility of embedding a flexible, exercise-based rehabilitation program into a cancer treatment unit to allow cancer survivors early exercise support. Method A pre-post study was conducted using Bowen's Framework to describe key domains of feasibility: demand (referrals), acceptability (uptake, attendance, satisfaction), implementation (resources), practicality (adverse events, costs) and limited-efficacy (function, quality of life, self-efficacy). Participants were medically stable, adult cancer survivors receiving curative or palliative treatment for cancer at the health service. Participants completed an 8-week home or hospital-based exercise program. Data were analysed descriptively. Standardised mean differences (Hedge's g) and mean differences were calculated to determine effect size and clinical significance. Results The exercise-based rehabilitation service received 155 referrals over 6 months. Of those eligible, 73/119 (61%) commenced. Participants opting for twice-weekly, hospital-based exercise attended 9/16 (56%) sessions. Participants reported high satisfaction and there were no major adverse events. The program utilised existing resources, with the predominant cost being staff. The average health service cost per participant was AUD $1,104. Participants made clinically significant gains in function (6-min walk distance; + 73 m, 95% confidence interval 49 to 96) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 Global quality of life; + 8 units, 95% confidence interval 3 to 13). Conclusion Implementation of exercise-based rehabilitation in a co-located cancer unit was safe and feasible. Access, patient and staff education and establishing funding streams are important implementation considerations. Implications for cancer survivors Access to exercise in a cancer unit provides opportunity for early intervention to optimise function during treatment.",

Exercise improves well-being of cancer survivors, with high-level evidence demonstrating exercise reduces symptoms such as fatigue, improves physical function, mood and quality of life [2, 4] . Engaging in exercise after a cancer diagnosis is associated with reduced cancer-specific and all-cause mortality, and disease recurrence [5, 6] . Preliminary evidence suggests a possible mechanism is patients having an increased ability to tolerate systemic therapies such as chemotherapy [7] . Exercise has demonstrated efficacy across all stages of the cancer continuum including before, during and after cancer treatment [2, 8] . Therefore, recommendations suggest cancer survivors commence exercise as early as their respective conditions allow.",

Approximately 10% of people meet aerobic [9] and 13% meet resistance training recommendations [10] . Several barriers contribute to this evidence-practice gap. At a health service level, access to exercise-based rehabilitation which could support people with cancer to exercise is poor and is not part of standard care [11, 12] . This is compounded by difficult referral pathways, lack of funding and often limited clinician awareness and knowledge about the benefits of exercise and how to find suitable services [11, 13, 14] . Patient-related barriers include side effects, competing medical demands, sedentary lifestyles and practical issues like location, cost and parking [14] [15] [16] . Exercise-based rehabilitation is often not considered until after treatment is completed, when people are deconditioned [17] . Intervening with exercise-based rehabilitation within a cancer treatment unit represents an opportunity for early support, including behaviour change strategies during treatment to prevent deterioration in health status.",

Feasibility of setting up a new supervised, exercisebased cancer rehabilitation program pragmatically in a public cancer treatment unit remains largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of implementing a flexible, exercise-based cancer rehabilitation program in a hospital-based cancer unit.",

Means and standard deviations were calculated for normally distributed data and median and ranges for non-normally distributed data. Content of open-ended survey comments was grouped into themes independently by two researchers and discussed until consensus was met on the main themes using an inductive approach. Standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using pre-and post-intervention data to determine effect sizes. Cohen's d was used to describe the magnitude of the change with 0.2 representing a small effect; 0.5 a moderate effect and 0.8 a large effect [31] . Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using paired t tests to determine the clinical significance of any changes. To explore differences between program type (hospital-based or home exercise program), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used with baseline measures and time since diagnosis as covariates.

As demonstrated by this study, a broad demographic of cancer survivors participated in the program including many groups under-represented in exercise cancer trials such as males and people with advanced Table 4 Limited efficacy testing, pre and post intervention means of patient outcomes * Significant at < 0.05 **significant at p < 0.01 or haematological malignancies. Referrals were made by a variety of referrers, including doctors, indicating the program was acceptable to health professionals. Referral sources were much greater than that reported by another co-located exercise rehabilitation program where most referrals came from just two oncologists [25] . Referral rates were also higher than those previously published, with total reach of the program approximately 10% of potentially eligible patients at the health service. This rate is similar to another co-located program [25] and significantly higher than existing exercise-based cancer rehabilitation programs [11, 30] . Demand for this program is noteworthy given low numbers of referrals to cancer rehabilitation are an issue in clinical practice [11] . Success may be owed to the visibility of the program in the cancer centre, providing awareness and convenience to patients and referrers [15] . Co-location may be a particularly important consideration for developing new rehabilitation programs for people receiving treatment where additional barriers such as feeling unwell and managing multiple priorities are an issue [15] . Investment was also put into program promotion with extensive stakeholder engagement before, during and after implementation, raising the profile of cancer rehabilitation within the organisation. An advantage was that the organisation had a pre-existing sub-acute cancer rehabilitation program to help drive and promote cross-referrals. These factors may have resulted in greater readiness for implementation and culture change where exercise-rehabilitation during cancer treatment is valued [32] . Despite this program providing better access to exercise for cancer survivors receiving treatment, modest uptake of the program by potential participants was an issue. Almost half of eligible referred participants did not accept referral with the most common reasons being they were not interested or unsure of committing to a program. Uptake was lower than previous reports [33] but consistent with prior evidence people need to feel 'ready' to participate in cancer rehabilitation, and require multiple prompts before they act on a referral [34] . Uptake may also be reflective of the pragmatic sample from a public hospital setting where participants may have significant comorbidities or less interest in exercise. It is also possible not all participants participated in a conversation about exercise with their oncologist or haematologist prior to referral which may negatively affect uptake given an oncologist's recommendation significantly increases participation in exercise [35] . This highlights the importance of bi-directional education and discussion with patients about why they should participate in exercise-rehabilitation during treatment. It also questions the appropriateness of routinely referring all participants to exercise-based rehabilitation as many are simply not ready to participate. Therefore, flexible models of rehabilitation with varied entry and exit points are required [36] .",

Advantages of this model are greater efficacy of supervised training [38] and the ability to utilise pre-existing facilities and referral structures [39] . However, these programs may not be able to cater to the wide needs of cancer survivors, with issues related to program structure and access [11] . This study demonstrated the feasibility of an alternative model including home-based exercise which added greater flexibility. Cancer survivors have previously described preference for home-based exercise [40] and those participating in home-based exercise in this study achieved equivalent outcomes to those attending hospital-based exercise. Homebased exercise models could be a less resource-intensive option for implementation of cancer rehabilitation in health services. Future research could evaluate home-based models which may include telehealth, use of mobile applications and wearables for monitoring as well as assessing cost-effectiveness, uptake and exercise adherence to further aid broad implementation of exercise-based cancer rehabilitation.",

Similar to this study, recent implementation studies [24, 25] were largely reliant on philanthropic and research funding to develop and sustain cancer exercise rehabilitation programs and the volatile nature of this funding presents major barriers to ongoing sustainability [25] . The average cost per patient for this program was AUD $1,104 with the primary expense being staff. Costs were similar to other supervised exercise rehabilitation programs [41] [42] [43] . These costs may be offset by adherence to exercise recommendations being associated with lower health care expenditure in people with cancer [44] . Significant clinical improvements in patient outcomes demonstrated in this study may result in prevention of hospital readmission and reduced hospital length of stay. The average cost of a cancerrelated hospital admission in Australia varies between AUD $3561 and AUD $48,659 [45] . There is emerging evidence rehabilitation programs may provide cost savings through reduction in length of stay and readmissions [46] . Cost savings related to exercise-rehabilitation are most evident in programs delivered prior or during cancer treatment [41, 42, 47, 48] . For example, a trial of supervised exercise after autologous stem cell transplant found rehabilitation was not cost-effective [42] , whereas a trial of supervised exercise for women during treatment for breast cancer was likely to be cost-effective depending on willingness to pay thresholds [41] . Therefore, there is potential for large cost savings with early rehabilitation. More research is required to confirm benefits to health services to drive policy change and fund exercise-rehabilitation programs as part of standard care.",

There is risk of selection bias as commonly, participants seek out interventions they value. However, the pragmatic nature of the study setting included a broad demographic of participants including those typically under-represented in exercise oncology research suggesting results may be generalizable to other settings. This study focussed on feasibility which included implementation strategies, but it is acknowledged different implementation frameworks could be used to inform future research translation. The home exercise program delivered in this study was limited to written instructions without followup which may reduce the effectiveness of the home-based intervention. Adherence to the home exercise program was also not recorded due to previous non-compliance with completion of exercise diaries [30] . However, the home-based model was not the focus of this study and participants still demonstrated gains. We also did not measure baseline physical activity levels. However, participants had only modest exercise confidence and a similar demographic of participants in previous studies undertaken in the same health service demonstrated very low levels of physical activity [30, 49] . Improvement in outcomes may have been influenced by natural progression over time and supportive care provided. However, the aim of this study was not to demonstrate efficacy of exercise. It is well established from randomised controlled trials that exercise-rehabilitation improves health outcomes for cancer survivors. Participants made clinically significant gains consistent with published evidence which increases confidence improvements were related to the rehabilitation intervention.",
