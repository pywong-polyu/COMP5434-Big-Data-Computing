It was highly suspected that the outbreak started in a Huanan seafood market, a place where live animals such as bats, birds, snakes and frogs were sold (Shereen et al., 2020) . This disease is highly contagious, initially from zoonotic transmission, and later from human to human, by coughing, sneezing or having close contact with an infected person's respiratory droplets (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020; Shereen et al., 2020) .",

Mental health concepts are related to subjective well-being, autonomy, the capability of identifying one's potential, the ability to manage stress, work in a productive way and be capable of contributing to their social environment. Mental health is associated with a balance between the person and the environment. This is influenced by a series of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors (Korkeila et al., 2003) . Recent outbreaks such as SARS, Zika, MERS, and Ebola have shown that a health crisis is a stressful situation. These concerns may be related to the risk of acquiring the virus or passing it on to others, the presence of symptoms of other health conditions that could be confused with COVID-19, and physical and mental health deterioration in vulnerable populations. Other concerns are related to the uncertainty of the long-term consequences in the health, social and economic domains (Huremovi\u00e9, 2019; Inter-Agency Standing Committee, 2020; .",

The CAS-10 has a Likert type response set of 5 points (0-4). An EFA analysis with a maximum likelihood extraction method and an oblimin rotation was executed to detect the underlying factorial structure of the scale. This oblique rotation method allows factors to correlate with each other (Field, 2009) , as is the case for many psychological constructs. The Barlett's Test of Sphericity [\u03c7 2 = 1,917.893 (df = 45), p < 0.001] and the KMO Measure of Sampling Adequacy (0.804) have an acceptable performance (see Table 1 ).

The CAS-10 has a Cronbach's alpha of 0.762, which is considered acceptable (Coolican, 2004) . However, given that this coefficient is affected by the number of items in the scale, average inter-item correlations were also obtained for the overall CAS-10 items (0.436). Specifically, the Coronavirus Concern subscale had the highest Cronbach's alpha score (\u03b1 = 0.715; average inter-item r = 0.487), followed by the Exaggerated Perception (\u03b1 = 0.667; average inter-item r = 0.436) and Immunity Perception subscales (\u03b1 = 0.550; average inter-item r = 0.381).

Complementarily, respondents who live with children (age < 12) tend to endorse the Immunity Perception and the belief that COVID-19 situation is being exaggerated; such beliefs may detonate risky health behaviors in such populations. Results showed that increases in Coronavirus Concern scores are associated with increases in age and viceversa. This could be related to the fact that older age is considered a risk factor for ARDS and death (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020) . On the other side, younger age has been related to mild disease and better health outcomes (Verity et al., 2020) . That is not to say that young people are immune to the virus, therefore, adolescents and young people should receive information about COVID-19. This can be achieved through digital platforms that promote age-friendly content (United Nations Population Fund, 2020). The most intense symptoms reported by respondents were related to the obsessive-compulsive domain, followed by anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity. These findings are consistent with other studies that reported that individuals exposed to information related to outbreaks experienced higher anxiety symptoms related to health and obsessive-compulsive behavior (Brand et al., 2013) . Congruently, our study found a significant positive, although weak, correlation between Coronavirus Concern, anxiety and social phobia. Given the epidemiologic nature of COVID-19, prevention strategies are partly based on social distancing, implying that people should be at least a meter apart from each other (World Health Organization, 2020a) . In this sense, many countries around the world recommend their citizens to avoid public spaces (Public Health Ontario, 2020), therefore an increase in social phobia indicators is a natural response to such circumstances.",

Previous research suggests that these traits are highly associated with passive coping strategies (Mao et al., 2003) , however, more research is still needed to clearly understand this dynamic. Another symptom of interest corresponds to the paranoid ideation domain, which correlates positively with both the Exaggerated Perception and the Immunity Perception subscales. Respondents with higher paranoid ideation and psychoticism could distrust public media and the government position regarding the impact of COVID-19 in society, minimizing its repercussions. In this sense, prior The BSI-53 subscales measure the prevalence of symptoms, but do not constitute a clinical diagnosis. Delta method standard errors, bias-corrected percentile bootstrap confidence intervals based on 1,000 replications, ML estimator. Significant estimates (p < 0.05) are in boldface. research has determined a link between paranoid ideation, distrust (Kirk et al., 2013) , and the endorsing of conspiracy theories (Darwin et al., 2011) . A similar trend has been suggested for psychoticism and its relationship to medical mistrust and conspiracy theories during pandemic outbreaks (Moukaddam and Shah, 2020) , this could help understand the positive relationship between COVID-19 Exaggerated Perception subscale and psychotic symptoms. Although there is a clear relationship between stress exposure and psychotic symptoms (Van Winkel et al., 2008) , our research found a negative and weak relationship between Coronavirus Concern and psychoticism. This lack of concern may be explained by the positive correlation of psychoticism with Exaggerated Perception and Immunity Perception. Therefore, respondents who score higher on psychotic symptoms are also less preoccupied with the COVID-19 situation and are more likely to believe that the media exaggerates this situation and that they are not likely to get infected with COVID-19.",

This is consistent with a study that reported that people who experience anxiety symptoms have, more often, a better attitude toward seeking psychological help (Roness et al., 2005) . This could be related to the fact that anxiety symptoms can quickly progress and become harder to manage by oneself in comparison to other disorders. Immunity Perception had a negative effect on OSPT. In this sense, previous research has found that the presence of subjective needs is positively related to attitudes toward seeking psychological help (Nagai, 2015) . Translated to our study, this can signify that respondents with high Immunity Perception scores do not feel the need to seek psychological attention. However, given the small determinant coefficients of the results, other variables besides the presence of psychological symptoms should be considered to understand people's attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help (Nunes Baptista and Zanon, 2017) .",

A way to mitigate this situation could be to provide professional psychological help through the use of online resources, such as they did in China in different stages of the pandemic. In this sense, two simultaneous activities during crisis intervention may be considered: (1) mitigate the fear of the disease and, (2) help coping with difficulties in the adaptation process . Since the current pandemic is affecting mental health, the Honduran health care system should take technology as an advantage to reach patients that are experiencing these negative symptoms. Given our results, such response system should focus on interventions designed to mitigate anxiety symptoms. In this sense, recent studies have found that the use of mobile-phone applications based on coachsupported platforms are effective in treating symptoms of anxiety (Graham et al., 2020) .",

More longitudinal data is still needed on the subject to better determine the causal relationships between variables. Data collection for this research was made between the 16th and the 23rd of March, during this time Honduras reported 30 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 0 fatalities. However, as of May 27th, 2020, the country reported 4,401 confirmed cases and 188 deaths (Honduras Health Secretary, 2020), this increase in COVID-19 cases, in addition to the effects of social confinement and the restriction of liberties, are not accounted for in our research. Another limitation of our study is the non-probabilistic sampling method that was used, which may restrict the inferential capability of our results. Future studies should also explore alternative data analysis, such as non-parametric and Bayesian approaches to further corroborate the results presented in the current research. The proposed mediation model stated an unidirectional influence of Coronavirus Awareness, mental health indicators and attitudes toward seeking psychological help. However, this relationship could be bidirectional. In this sense, COVID-19 awareness may influence the prevalence of psychopathological indicators. But, such indicators may also have an impact on Coronavirus Awareness itself (as was discussed regarding depression and paranoid ideation symptoms). Further studies are still needed to clarify this dynamic. On the other hand, the BSI-53 measures the prevalence and intensity of different psychological symptoms, but it does not constitute a clinical diagnosis. Finally, given that the current research had a limited psychopathological-based approach to mental health, future studies should include positive and protective variables like resilience, subjective well-being, among other factors that respond to a more holistic, humanistic, and positive concept of mental health.",
