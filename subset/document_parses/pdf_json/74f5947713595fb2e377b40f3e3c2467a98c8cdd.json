Each name was assigned a study number in chronological order. The 294 patients in the study were selected by matching a series of randomly generated numbers.

Data for these patients were retrospectively collected from patients' clinical records.

Like many services across the UK, Lothian is experiencing increased numbers of children requiring treatment under DGA. Results from this study found that the main reason for this is dental caries in children from the most deprived backgrounds. Over the past decade, Childsmile has provided oral health promotion, with a focus on highrisk children across Scotland, including in Lothian. 6 While epidemiological survey evidence indicates a reduction in child caries rates, 7,8 this does not appear to be translating into a reduced demand for DGA services in the Lothian area. 9 The present arrangement in Lothian's secondary care actively follows up children referred to the service who do not present for treatment via the local 'was not brought' pathway 16 and provides discharge summaries on treatment completion requesting follow-up care. However, once a child is discharged from secondary care, there is no system in place to confirm continuation of this pathway in primary care, nor is there direct accessible information of their previous interactions with primary care before their referral. This interface is a potential vulnerability within the system and local collaborative working is needed to develop a more robust system to proactively follow-up children discharged after DGA. Implementation of a coordinated and accessible interface for the wider health and social care system, including primary care, secondary care and community Childsmile teams, could improve the existing system and join ongoing secondary care research with primary care.",

For instance, appropriate data linkage of GDP participation data, Childsmile activity data and child DGA data from secondary care could allow for proactive targeting by health and social services to enable active follow-up of children discharged after DGA. By sharing this information, health boards may also be able to identify practices of specific geographic areas which could benefit from additional preventative interventions. However, to successfully set up such a system, careful planning is required to avoid inappropriate information sharing and breach of personal privacy.",

However, the context of a child's life and the decisions made by the adults around them have a major influence on whether they develop dental caries. Interventions need to be holistic and take into account families' lives, culture and priorities, as well as start early in a child's life, to have an impact. Alongside Childsmile in Scotland, 5 government measures are in place to address child obesity and also child dental caries, such as the 2018 sugar tax levy 24 and the strategy for ' A Healthier Future' . 25 By building on these existing measures, and engaging with the advertising industry to promote healthier food choices and restrict promotion of less healthy foods, the population can make better food choices, especially older children who purchase their meals outside of school during lunchtime.",

In Lothian, there are no explicit clinical restrictions for the provision of restorations or extractions under DGA.
