Data analytic tools can not only improve laboratory operations, but also increase the visibility of the laboratory in the healthcare system and demonstrate the positive impact of the laboratory on patient care. In this article, we describe the creation and utility of laboratory dashboards. Several dashboards were designed to assist with pandemic response. For each dashboard, a stored procedure was created that performed a SQL query of our laboratory information system mirror database. We utilized the business analytics platform, Tableau, for data visualization. Users could modify the data by selecting a specific date range, time window, work shift, institution(s), specific test(s), and/or testing platform(s). Access was controlled by OKTA integration to the host server over the web, behind the hospital firewall. During the April 2020 surge, we saw an increase in blood gas testing and corresponding decrease in non-critical testing such as Vitamin D. At our institution, SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing was performed using four primary platforms, four in-house and one send-out. Weekly and hourly testing volumes as well as turnaround times fluctuated based on reagent availability, new testing requests, staffing, and operational changes. Productivity dashboards indicated that coagulation testing volumes were highest on the third shift and that all three analyzers may not be necessary. Further, specimen volumes and productivity of accessioning staff varied throughout the day. Phlebotomy venipuncture volumes and patient wait times also varied throughout the pandemic. A decrease in ambulatory draws was seen during the surge but after reopening draw volumes, particularly at offsite locations, surpassed prepandemic volumes. We demonstrate that data analytics and interactive dashboards are powerful tools, are helpful in response to a pandemic and lead to improved TAT, supply utilization, staffing and workflows. Furthermore, dashboards provide objective data to review with hospital leadership and promote collaboration.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 (COVID) pandemic has had a profound impact on the clinical laboratories and has highlighted some areas that could be strengthened in preparation for future pandemics. 1 One important area for improvement is data analytics. The ability to access and analyze data is critical to manage a laboratory and respond and adapt to changes particularly during a pandemic. The clinical laboratory generates a large amount of data, but many laboratories do not have the infrastructure and/or resources to maintain, retrieve, and share data. 2, 3 Data analytic tools can not only improve laboratory operations, but also increase the visibility of the laboratory in the healthcare system and demonstrate the positive impact of the laboratory on patient care. 4 Traditionally, dashboards have focused on monitoring clinical laboratory turnaround time (TAT), identifying outliers and implementing improvements. [4] [5] [6] In a two part study, Cassim et al. 5, 6 reported that a visual display improved TAT and allowed the team to identify several root causes for delays. Dashboards have also been used to track blood bank inventory, 7 improve blood product utilization, 8 monitor test ordering, 9 track quality metrics, [10] [11] [12] [13] gain efficiency in hematopathology, 14 and identify bottlenecks in anatomic pathology. 15 In one study, residents were emailed a link to a static dashboard comparing their test utilization to their colleagues. 9 The dashboard reportedly increased awareness of test utilization, but it was not dynamic and did not account for patient complexity. Similar to this study, other studies state that interactive dashboards that assist laboratory directors with resolving issues quickly by providing current data are the most effective. 4, 7, 15 Outside of pathology, dashboards have been implemented to assist hospitals in their response to the COVID pandemic by tracking telemedicine volumes, test ordering patterns, and emergency communications. [16] [17] [18] In article by Grange et al., 16 ED length of stay, personal protective equipment (PPE) on hand, number of admitted COVID positive patients, and calls per day related to COVID were tracked and monitored. This allowed incident command to make informed decisions, communicate important changes, and deploy resources. The United States government also created publicly viewable dashboards in response to the pandemic so states could access total deaths, total cases, new cases, laboratory tests, and hospitalizations. 19 In this article, we describe the creation and utility of laboratory dashboards, in particular the use of actionable data to resolve a diverse set of problems during a pandemic. Supply management was assessed using test volume dashboards. Staffing was adjusted based on test volumes, venipuncture volumes, productivity, and/or patient wait times dashboard data. Furthermore, the volume of COVID testing by platform and TAT dashboards allowed us to modify test routing and respond to new testing requests.",

Requests for ambulatory COVID testing were sent to a reference laboratory. During the pandemic, COVID testing reagents, particularly for rapid testing platforms, were on allocation (e.g., we were limited to only a certain volume of reagents per week for the hospital network) which prompted our hospital network to implement a testing ordering algorithm [called the pandemic respiratory order (PRO)] that would route patient specimens to a rapid testing platform (e.g. Cepheid) only if the patient met certain clinical criteria (e.g., symptomatic, high risk). 1 The PRO was implemented on December 8, 2020.",

In addition, we monitored volumes of the core laboratory testing ordered to manage COVID patients (e.g., blood gas, coagulation testing, blood cultures, inflammatory and cardiac markers, liver function tests, and electrolytes) to determine supply needs and staffing. To assist with staffing adjustments, it was also determined that we should monitor the volume of testing performed primarily for ambulatory patients (e.g., vitamin D) on our stand-alone (i.e., not performed on the automated chemistry line) analyzers.

We also made some proactive changes including: (1) ordering additional reagents to accommodate increasing volume of inflammatory marker testing, (2) shifting staff to benches with increasing volume and simultaneously reducing the frequency of non-urgent testing (e.g., reduce testing from five days/week to two days/week), (3) shifting testing to shifts with additional capacity (e.g., switching vitamin D testing from second to first shift to free up the second shift technologist operating the stand-alone vitamin D analyzer to assist with more critical testing on automated line and help with staffing shortages), and (4) validating alternatives for supplies such as swabs and media in case a shortage arose.

Productivity dashboards can also identify areas for improvement such as the need to switch to more efficient and/or rapid testing platforms. In reviewing the productivity of our technologists on the automated chemistry line, we noticed that number of anemia tests resulted per hour was lower than that for other automated testing with similar preanalytical and analytical times. Upon investigation, we determined that anemia testing, unlike other chemistry testing, was not being auto-verified (i.e., results meeting specified rules going directly from the analyzer to the EHR without a technologists' intervention). Therefore, we implemented auto-verification rules and confirmed the improved technologist productivity using the dashboard (data not shown).",

During the April 2020 surge, there was a slight increase in inpatient phlebotomy draws, many involving donning and doffing of PPE for COVID positive patients, leading to an increase in the amount of time to draw patients (data not shown). A corresponding decrease in outpatient phlebotomy draws was seen (Fig. 8) . The average daily draw volumes at a representative ambulatory site was 186 in February 2020 (Fig. 8) . The average volumes decreased to 113, 71, and 111 in March, April, and May 2020; respectively. As we reopened the hospital, we tracked the increase in ambulatory draws, particularly at ambulatory locations outside the city, and saw that volumes surpassed pre-COVID volumes likely due to the increase in telemedicine visits and comfort level of patients (Fig. 8) . The average daily draw volumes increased to 195, 256, 236, and 271 in June, July, August, and September 2020, respectively.

Furthermore, dashboards can ensure collaboration across the institution by providing objective data to collectively review and promote the visibility of the laboratory to leadership and administration which may assist with obtaining the proper resources. Importantly, the COVID dashboards provided a visual display of the complexity of laboratory processes (e.g., number of testing platforms and routing logic required, multiple components of TAT including collection, transport, receipt, testing, and resulting) and the impact of any interventions, particularly those that lead to a reduction in TAT (e.g., instrument interfacing, new IS build). There were additional benefits of interactive dashboards. Data requested by hospital leadership, our healthcare system, or the United States Department of Health and Human Services could be rapidly reviewed and displayed. This was a significant time savings for laboratory directors who no longer had to manually pull data. It also solidified collaborations with our clinicians and laboratory colleagues and helped ensure our participation in hospital and system decision-making. As examples, the dashboards allowed us to determine, communicate, and mitigate the impact of instrument downtime and staffing shortages on COVID TAT, to effectively justify the need for additional rapid testing platforms, to prompt new policies on test ordering to control volumes or respond to supply shortages (e.g., blood gas syringes), to demonstrate the need to adjust the PRO order to match platform capacity, to indicate how a requested change may impact operations, and to address concerns and safety reports related to laboratory performance (e.g., TAT, patient wait times).",

We learned, early in the pandemic, to create dynamic, data-rich dashboards with the ability to filter data fields. This minimized the need to modify dashboards. In addition, the dashboards were designed with a knowledge of clinical workflows and their utility. Importantly, we built dashboards based on the frequency of data refreshes (e.g., nightly), understood the limitations and took alternative approaches if nightly data refreshes were not sufficient (e.g., application to display COVID cycle threshold values). Finally, we standardized our process with testing and displaying reports that populated the dashboards to facilitate creation of new dashboards. We currently have more than 20 active dashboards in production. There were limitations to utility of our dashboards beyond the frequency of data refreshes. It was a cultural change for both the laboratory and hospital to access and filter data on the dashboards. We continue to train and remind staff to utilize the dashboards and make requests for modifications or additional dashboards. As seen with our total accessioning volume, supportive data does not necessarily translate into an improvement or workflow changes. Barriers include lack of staffing, resistance to change, limited space, and/or inadequate financial resources.",

In the future, we anticipate expanding our dashboards to include inventory management at both a local and enterprise level and developing benchmarking standards for productivity and TAT to guide dashboard review. However, dedicated IS staff to create and maintain dashboard and dedicated laboratory staff to review and implement changes will be required for success.",
