On the 9th day of hospitalization the patient's condition deteriorated. Consciousness disorders and acute respiratory disorders requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation were observed.

Not only vascular neurological complications, but also meningitis should be always considered in patients with sudden disturbances of consciousness. Anti-inflammatory treatment with the combination of corticosteroids and tocilizumab (or tocilizumab alone) pose a severe risk for secondary lethal bacterial or fungal infections. Thus, treating a high-risk population (i.e. elderly and old patients) with these antiinflammatory agents, require daily clinical assessment, regular monitoring of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, as well as standard culture of blood, urine and sputum in order to detect concomitant infections, as rapidly as possible.",

Empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone (2 g twice a day intravenously) and ciprofloxacin (400 mg twice a day intravenously) was implemented. Six hours after the onset of consciousness disturbances, the patient developed apnea. He was intubated and mechanical ventilation was started.

Numerous reports based on previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, provide clear evidence of various neurologic sequalae (i.e. encephalitis, seizures, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome), which may occur in association with respiratory symptoms [15, 16] . Neuroinvasion may take the form of viral encephalitis, confirmed by the presence of viral RNA in the CSF in single cases [17, 18] . CSF examinations in COVID-19-associated meningoencephalitis show pleocytosis with predominance of lymphocytes and increased concentration of protein, which typical for viral infections. This suggests active intrathecal inflammation [18] . In our patient result of CSF examination indicated bacterial etiology of neuroinfection. Although classic abnormalities of CSF examination typically for bacterial meningitis was observed and S. pneumoniae was isolated from blood and bronchial wash, CSF culture was negative. Similar observations have been previously reported in literature [19] . Bohr et al. in the retrospective study in 875 patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, not pretreated with antibiotics, showed positive CSF culture in 85% cases [20] . In described case, a negative CSF culture could have been the result of using antibiotics before the lumbar puncture. The results of two large cohort studies confirmed a 4-18% decrease in culture positivity when empiric antibiotic therapy was administered prior to CSF sampling [20, 21] .",
