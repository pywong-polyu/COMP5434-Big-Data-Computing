In March 2020, we completed the first national survey of psychologists' practices at the beginning of the pandemic (Sammons, VandenBos & Martin, 2020a) . That survey, initiated only one week after the United States had declared a public health emergency, was quickly followed by several other national surveys. In spite of differences in methodology, results of these surveys were strikingly similar: Psychologists had rapidly and overwhelmingly switched to telepsychology service provision, and they felt largely comfortable in their ability to do so. Early in the pandemic, practice caseloads had dropped for the majority of providers. Our earlier survey also indirectly suggested that patients had moderate levels of discomfort associated with the use of telepsychology.",

Jobes (2020) outlines some of the challenges involved in managing suicidal patients using whatever medium-with the most salient being that few graduate psychology students receive any systematic training in suicide intervention. In the absence of sciencebased training, many clinicians rely on \"suicide contracts\" or referrals for emergency hospitalization. Neither of these interventions is effective as a deterrent. Jobes describes the work of a Task Force of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention to better organize care of suicidal patients around proven standards. Such work must now be extended to the realm of telepsychology in order to increase psychologists' competence in suicide treatment and to broaden the reach of effective suicide prevention.",

The presence of firearms in the home is a known risk factor for suicide, and one that must be addressed by psychologists concerned about patient safety. The issue that a discussion of firearms removal has become so politically fraught is an almost exclusively American one, but Miller and VandenBos note that there are many other factors bound up in the decision to temporarily remove access to firearms. Proactively addressing these concerns with patients before a crisis emerges is an element of effective care. Engaging in candid discussions of the psychologist's understanding of psychosocial and intrapsychic factors affecting the patient's perception of firearms possession has the greatest chance of successfully removing lethal means. Nonjudgmental discussions of the significance of firearms ownership to the patient, consideration of occupational issues that may influence gun ownership or removal (e.g., among police officers or military members), and knowledge of local laws are all elements of maintaining both safety and the therapeutic relationship with at-risk patients.",

Current understanding indicates that most infected patients will have mild symptoms of relatively short duration and will make a full recovery. Some patients, however, have lengthier illnesses with longer term pulmonary, hematologic, and perhaps neurologic sequelae. Such individuals may be unable to return to work, either temporarily or permanently. How many patients will fall into this category cannot yet be predicted, but given the scope of infection it is highly likely that an increase in disability will result from the pandemic. Kuhlman (2020) discusses the process of Social Security Disability evaluations, as well as the role of psychologists as evaluators or as State Agency Psychological Consultants (SAPCs). In the latter role, psychologists have no contact with the applicant for disability services but objectively evaluate data leading to a disability determination. Demand for these roles will probably increase in the wake of the pandemic.",

In this year's summary, Smith (2020) notes the \"blockbuster\" nature of the most recent term. Most tragically, of course, was the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a long-time advocate for the rights of the disabled and mentally ill. This author was privileged to hear oral arguments in the case of Sell v. US, where the court held that the government did not have the right to forcibly administer antipsychotic medications to patients who were not deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. In that case, Justices Ginsburg and Kennedy were most active in challenging the government's assertion of its right to do so. My lasting impression of that debate was that one needed to be absolutely certain of their facts and the law before engaging Justice Ginsburg in an argument.",

Kansas, in which a majority of the court held that states could impose differing variants of the insanity defense in capital punishment trials. As Smith noted, however, this decision may have more academic than practical influence, since the insanity defense is rarely invoked and is even more rarely successful. More immediately important was the case of Bostock v. Clayton County, in which the court held that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. While not a constitutional decision per se, this 6-3 majority opinion extended significant protection to LGBTQ Americans. In other decisions having implications for psychology, the Court held that felony convictions must be on the basis of a unanimous jury (Oregon and Louisiana had been exceptions to this otherwise common precept), that an attempt to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) law was improperly executed, and that a Louisiana law limiting the qualifications of abortion providers was unduly restrictive.

Likewise, in the despair created by COVID-19, there are therapeutic lessons regarding resilience that may indeed be beneficial in the long run. One thing is certain: Multiple problems will strain our creativity to find optimal solutions, and in many instances there will be no \"right\" answers.
