            "text": "While digital trace data from sources like search engines hold enormous potential for tracking and understanding human behavior, these streams of data lack information about the actual experiences of those individuals generating the data. Moreover, most current methods ignore or under-utilize human processing capabilities that allow humans to solve problems not yet solvable by computers (human computation). We demonstrate how behavioral research, linking digital and real-world behavior, along with human computation, can be utilized to improve the performance of studies using digital data streams. This study looks at the use of search data to track prevalence of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI). We build a behavioral model of flu search based on survey data linked to users' online browsing data. We then utilize human computation for classifying search strings. Leveraging these resources, we construct a tracking model of ILI prevalence that outperforms strong historical benchmarks using only a limited stream of search data and lends itself to tracking ILI in smaller geographic units. While this paper only addresses searches related to ILI, the method we describe has potential for tracking a broad set of phenomena in near real-time.",

Mining search and social media data for real-time tracking (i.e., \"nowcasting\") of flu prevalence and other events has become a major focus in public health, computer science, and other disciplines 1-10 . One highly cited example of using search query data to forecast illness is Google Flu Trends (GFT). Many efforts have built upon the early work of GFT, which provided a promising real-time influenza tracking system, based on the idea that searches for the flu will increase when users are ill. While GFT showed the value of using digital streams like search data to forecast important events, it ultimately faced considerable challenges 1, 11, 12 . We pick up on two major issues identified by prior research 12 , and present methods, relying on standard techniques, to address them.",

The first issue researchers pointed out was that GFT was a problematic marriage of big and small data, since the algorithm involved over 50 million search terms narrowed down to predict a little over 1000 CDC data points 12 . This methodology doomed GFT to sweep up some false positive search terms that happened to peak at the right time and place. Rooting out false positive predictors in such a massive predictor space is a central concern in the use of search data and other big data streams, but, as a consequence, the GFT model missed its CDC target for long stretches of time 12 . Later work corrected some of the errors of the GFT approach, by incorporating reports from CDC as the season progresses, adjusting for changes in search behavior, and leveraging the properties of timeseries, to vastly improve the reliability of the forecast 9 . But the central approach-mapping a huge number of search queries to a short series of CDC data-remains largely the same.",

For systems like GFT, search query data are the primary instrument for measuring influenzalike illness (ILI) in the population. However, it is not yet clear that search query data are even a good indicator for ILI symptoms 12 . Sparse empirical evidence currently exists to support (or reject) the idea that users experiencing ILI symptoms make more searches for the flu. To generate such evidence, one would need access to a user's online searches and information about any illness symptoms they are currently experiencing. Such data would allow researchers to observe whether the presence of illness symptoms associated with the flu leads to an increased propensity to search for flu-related information. However, even with high-quality observational data from a user's online searches and reported symptoms, more information is needed. The prior distribution of search propensity is unlikely to be uniform across all demographic groups, and is likely to be correlated with ILI prevalence within groups. In addition, users experiencing ILI symptoms may make searches to find diagnostic information, but only if they cannot access that information through other means.",

Our approach captures user search data combined with survey data of flu-like symptoms to give us a granular view of the measurement properties of search data. The behavioral model based on these data demonstrates the underlying measurement value of using search data as a surrogate for flu-like symptom reports at the household level. We enlist trained coders to remove false positive predictors of flu-like experience that are otherwise challenging to do algorithmically. We leverage our behavioral model to create a weighted forecast of ILI in the US population. We find that this survey-driven approach enables us to define the demographic differences in search, detect relevant flu searches in a more systematic fashion, and adjust for demographic variance in flu search behavior when building a forecasting model. This method could be useful in tracking various other phenomena for which survey data might provide an empirical link between large-scale digital sources (such as queries or social media posts) and local/regional outcomes (such as ILI, unemployment rates, or movie ticket sales).",

To demonstrate the practical application of our model to a digital search stream, we compare its performance against strong baseline models, including a highly accurate autoregressive LASSO model of the historical signal 9 . There is a long history of epidemiological models that estimate rates of transmission through populations using a mix of network data, social media data, and clinical data 1, 2, [4] [5] [6] 8, 9, 13, 14 . Statistical models use sample data to infer population-level rates of ILI, while mechanistic models describe whole populations to simulate ILI spreading and infer rates of ILI infection 13 . Both types of modeling approaches estimate rates of ILI in different populations in order to generate advanced warnings of season start time, peaks, or duration, often to substitute for costly and time-consuming clinical measures (like the CDC flu reports). However, common metrics for model evaluation remain a topic of some debate 13 . We focus here on applying our survey results to build a tracking model that uses search queries effectively to track ILI prevalence.",

To do so, we tracked the online behavior of a set of users for an entire flu season, and identified user searches and online behaviors pertaining to ILI diagnostic information. We will discuss two models: a behavioral model based on a case-control design that maps Internet search behavior to ILI symptoms, and a tracking model that maps behavioral signals from search queries to generate predictions of flu prevalence. The behavioral model relies on a survey in concert with browser tracking to tabulate whether users had ILI symptoms during the flu season. Then, we build a flu tracking model drawing on insights from the behavioral model. We tested the flu tracking model using data from national and state-level CDC reports. Table 1 ).

We construct smoothed and re-weighted estimates of A1 searches by day and by state using multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP). MRP is a method for making predictions with non-representative and/or non-probability survey data 16 , typically at the sub-national level. This is useful for practitioners because it allows for modeling a wider array of data than models that require nationally representative data. To apply this approach, we first assign binary A1 labels to a large corpus of Bing search queries. This comprises our response variable. Next, we estimate the proportion of A1 search queries in state s within a moving time window, producing a prediction for the final day of the moving window. We re-weight each state-day prediction based on the number of zipcodes in each state belonging to each cell (stratum)(Supplementary Methods 1.8:2). MRP effectively splits the data into cells that represent unique combinations of characteristics. For example, we would identify a cell for zip codes in Minnesota with a high number of college graduates if we grouped the data by state and education.",

However, unlike the CDC data these states do not provide a total number of hospital visits as the denominator to the ILI rate. Instead, we trained our model using the raw counts of the ILI positive cases reported in the state. These state-level search signals will be especially noisy due to lower search volumes than the national level.",

In other words, we found the presence of flu-like symptoms increased the relative rate of flulike search queries (A1) by more than half, but when calculated as a change in the proportion of all searches, the difference is small.

Table 2 shows that the MRP signal improves upon the 1-week ahead MAPE (mean average percent error), RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error) compared to the history-based models (for a total period of T = 123 weeks) (all metrics look at the average deviations of model predictions, see Supplementary Information 6.8 for mathematical definitions of these metrics). As such, estimates in 2016/2017 deviated by 12.29/13.74% from the true values in these tests. For reference to a more common metric, the MRP tracking estimate correlates at 0.90/0.84 with the national ILI rate in the 2016/2017 season. Fig. 2a shows that the absolute error for the MRP signal has a lower mean and variance than other history or A1-based models. On average, the SARIMA-MRP model showed fewer outliers and a smaller median error compared to the pure history model. We conjecture that since Bing is only a portion of all search queries, our models would perform better with more search data. Additionally, if we look at h = 2-week ahead predictions (the prediction at step t + h, given the CDC data point at step t and the exogenous signal at step t + h), the MRP signal proves to be even more valuable achieving a RMSE/MAPE/MAE of 0.386/12.855/0.263 vs. 0.456/13.584/ 0.299 using only history (SARIMA). Looking at the plot for our forecasts, Fig. 2c and b show that SARIMA-MRP predictions are better aligned with the observed national ILI rate with tighter upper and lower prediction intervals for both the 1-step and 2step ahead predictions.

We find that there is substantial variation in the propensity of users to execute searches in the presence of ILI symptoms based on demographic factors. Next, we leverage these insights and integrate demographic data to account for the uneven propensity of flu search and to build an example ILI tracking model.

The model also re-weighted (biasreduced) estimates of flu-like query volumes, which brought estimates more in line with known underlying population values.

Another recall-related issue is boundary effects-where asking respondents whether they experienced flu or cough from November 1, 2014, to the present, may create errors in judgment that can only be later in time than the start and earlier in time than the beginning of the interval-so errors may pile up near the center of the interval.

We first define a labeling scheme for search queries. The scheme is designed to capture important differences in what the searcher is experiencing at the moment of executing a query, specifically flu-like experiences versus other experiences. We used simple flu-related key words to isolate a subset of queries and web pages from each respondent's web history to be labeled by trained coders. To ensure reliability of the coding, we used Kappa scores to assess intercoder reliability. Reliability on this set was Kappa = 0.865 for search queries and Kappa = 0.796 for web pages (see Supplementary Information 1.5.4).",

Based on this comparison, we retain all semantically related queries from Bing and label them according to our scheme. This allows us to identify additional flu-like queries for our time-series forecasting models. We also computed intercoder agreement and reliability scores for this set (see Supplementary Information 1.5.4) . Lag selection and model evaluation. For the SARIMA-X approach, we selected the appropriate orders (p, P, q, Q) for the model using AIC as a criterion. We set p = 2 in the Lasso-A1 model to account for seasonal effects in ILI rates. However, since we are using the Lasso penalty the coefficients of most of these lags will not appear in the final model. This approach also serves to select the appropriate lag in modeling ILI rates. Finally, we provide predictions for the 2015-2017 seasons by using a rolling 3-year period to train and predict.",

This metric is useful for understanding the average percent difference between the model's predicted values and the true values and so is fairly easy to interpret.

To do so, we downloaded each state's data in PDF form and put it into machine-readable format. These states were selected because they (1) collect and publicly post current flu prevalence rates on their official health pages and (2) make historical flu prevalence data available for long enough time spans to be useful for prediction. However, unlike the CDC data, these states do not provide a total number of hospital visits as the denominator to the ILI rate. Thus we only look at the raw counts of the ILI positive cases. Since we are predicting state-level ILI rates and search volumes can be relatively low, the exogenous search signals are often noisier than national-level signals.",
