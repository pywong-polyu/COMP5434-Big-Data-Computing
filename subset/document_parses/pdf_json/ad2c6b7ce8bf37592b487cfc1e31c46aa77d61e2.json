The evolution of COVID-19 depends not only on the pathogen but also on the genetic and epigenetic background of the host [5] . Apoptosis and/or dysfunctions of (cancer) immune cells and complex epigenetic reprogramming in immune and progenitor cells may contribute to the immunoparalysis and/or opportunistic co-infections in COVID-19 patients [5] [6] . The mortality is the highest in the elderly and in people with a pre-existing condition such as cardio-vascular disease, pulmonary disease, inflammatory disorders, hypertension, diabetes and particularly in cancer patients with active disease and (a history of) hematological tumors [6] [7] .

Important insights can be gained from serology studies to get data on the proportion of (asymptomatic) infected high-risk patients in a population . In addition, patients and health care workers may be identified that are potentially protected from reinfection by neutralizing antibodies, although currently it is not certain if and how long immunity would be present [9] . On average IgM antibodies are detectable around 7 days after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunoglobin G antibodies can be found in 75% of patients after 7 days and in about 90% after two weeks [8, 14] . As IgA and IgM antibodies often lack specificity and have a shorter half-life most serologic studies focus on IgG [8, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The exact role of IgG antibodies in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is unclear but these antibodies often have a virus neutralizing capacity [9] . We present a prospective multicenter J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f study evaluating three commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG/total Ig antibody tests on prospectively collected serum of ambulatory cancer and non-cancer patients and HCW in two Belgian oncology units during the rise, nadir and decline of the first peak SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.",

The majority of commercially available tests against SARS-CoV-2 IgG are directed to recombinant antigens covering the viral nucleocapsid protein (Abbott, Roche) or the S1/S2 domain of the spike protein (Diasorin) [16] . They have been developed rapidly over the last half year and were often introduced in clinical settings before being validated with samples in larger cohorts [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Estimates about seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in cancer populations strongly depend on the type of serologic test used, the population tested (ambulatory versus hospitalized), and timing of testing particularly related to the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic in the local general population [6] . A summary of studies performed in cancer populations is given in Table 5 . Immunoglobulin G/total antibodies directed to SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were low in our Major factors driving seropositivity are the type of hospital setting assessed, the job duties and patient contacts of the HCW, and the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the area [42] . In a nationwide Scottish linkage cohorts study comprising 158,445 health care workers and 229,905 household members it was shown that patient facing health care workers and their household members respectively have a threefold and twofold increased risk of admission with serious COVID-19 [29] . Small studies in oncology units showed seroconversion rates of 5-7.5% amongst staff members [27, 28] . Health care professionals had a significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to patients in our population. This can be explained by the lack of availability and suboptimal use of protective material until end-March 2020. We had an outbreak of COVID-19 in the oncology unit of the Antwerp University Hospital affecting some patients, medical and nursing staff before masks and protective clothing became generally available and obligatory to be used. This was managed successfully by closing the unit for a week, testing all patients and health care professionals for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, sending all asymptomatic staff on leaf for a week and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive individuals for 2 weeks, isolating the involved patients and segregating pathways [10, 12] .

Several small series have suggested that cancer patients had lower rates of seroconversion after clinical COVID-19 compared to non-cancer patients [30, 31, 32, 33] , but this could not be confirmed by others [34] . In the study of Mara et al, specifically focusing on SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in cancer patients and oncology health care workers, no difference in SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity was observed between both groups using 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette: respectively 25/29 (87.9%) vs 25/33 (80.5%; p=0.39) [26] . In addition, no differences in time from SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis to IgG detection was seen comparing cancer The Alinity \u00ae (A; Abbott) and Liaison \u00ae (D; Diasorin) commercially available assays were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while total SARS-CoV-2 Ig was measured by Elecsys \u00ae (R; Roche) ",

For the patients in the Antwerp University Hospital the informatic technology (IT) department used data mining of the electronic patient files of the hospital to register the following data for all cancer patients: COVID-19 PCR testing (positive/negative), type of cancer, stage of cancer (TNM), metastatic cancer (yes/no), relevant comorbidity disease (a. diabetes, b. hypertension, c. inflammatory disorders, d. other), type of oncology treatment (a. chemotherapy, b. endocrine therapy, c. targeted therapy, d. immunotherapy, e. radiotherapy, f. combination of above, g. no current treatment), World Health Organization performance status, Body Mass Index, tumor marker (if available), CRP (as a marker of inflammation if available), white blood cell count (if available), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin (as a marker of fibrosis and inflammation if available).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The Cobas SARs-CoV-2 test (Roche) was performed on an automated Cobas 6800 system. Classically taken nose/throat samples were used as gold standard for a RT-PCR diagnosis of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 130 patients additional mouth washes were collected for RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobinG/total Ig antibody testing. The following tests were used: LIAISON \u00ae SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) is a fully automated two-step chemiluminescent immunoassay to qualitatively detect IgG antibodies against the S1/S2 protein of SARS-Cov-2 [35]. Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA) is a high throughput immunoassay directed to IgG antibodies reactive against the nucleocapsid antigen of SARS-CoV-2, using a twostep sandwich immunoassay employing microparticle-bound antigen and acridiniumlabeled human anti-IgG [36]. The total SARS-CoV-2 antibody test Elecsys \u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) is an immunoassay for the in vitro qualitative detection of antibodies (IgA, IgM and IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma on COBAS E immunoassay analyzers. It detects antibodies (isotype agnostic) reactive against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein using a double-antigen sandwich immunoassay design employing ruthenium-and biotinlabeled antigen [36]. Tests were validated internally before starting the study. As these were commercial tests, the threshold of the manufacturers were applied to consider a test positive (Abbott >= 1.4, Roche >=1 , Diasorin >15 AU/ml). The collected blood samples were tested as a batch. Data analysis. Data were stored in a main database and cleaned and validated manually. Descriptive statistics were reported per subgroup (pediatric patients, cancer, non-cancer patients and health care workers). Proportions of positive and negative tests were reported overall and per subgroup. As patients could have several tests at different dates, it was decided to declare a patient positive if at least one positive result was found on one of these dates. A patient was negative if test results on all dates were negative. Proportions were compared between subgroups using a Fisher's exact test. For the continuous test outcomes a Kruskal-Wallis test (repeated measurements per subject were averaged) was performed. If there was an overall effect of group, two by two comparisons are made. For the analysis J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f comparing antibody to PCR tests, we only considered the cancer patients and the volunteers as the other groups are too small. We defined day 0 as the day of the first positive PCR test, if available. In case of no positive PCR tests day 0 is the day of the first PCR test. In case of several positive PCR tests day 0 is the day of the first PCR test. For the antibody tests only those were considered that were taken at least 7 days after this day 0. Tests were compared binary using a cross table, kappa and McNemar test and continuously using a Spearman correlation. Analysis was done in R 3.5.2. Ethical aspects. Informal authorization to start the sample collecting after written informed consent was already given on March 19 th , 2020 by representatives of the Ethics Committee (CME) of Antwerp University Hospital, and the study was formally accepted by the CME of the Antwerp University Hospital on March 30 th , 2020 (EC number 20/13/156, internal EDGE 001070).

They derived sensitivity and specificity from 976 pre-pandemic blood samples and 536 blood samples from patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected at least 20 days post symptom onset (collected between Feb 1 st , 2020, and May 31 st , 2020). All assays achieved a sensitivity of at J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f least 98% with thresholds optimized to achieve a specificity of at least 98% on samples taken 30 days or more post symptom onset. In a large study by Perkman et al comparing the Abbott, Roche and Diasorin tests similar specificities were found, but in contrast to the manufacturers specifications sensitivities only ranged from 83.1-89.2% [37]. It was shown in this study that at low seroprevalences, the minor differences in specificity resulted in profound discrepancies of positive predictive values: eg. at 1% seroprevalence: 52.3% (36.2-67.9), 77.6% (52.8-91.5), and 32.6% (23.6-43.1) for Abbott, Roche, and Diasorin, respectively. As in our study a good level of agreement was found between the Roche and Abbott tests, but significant differences were noted with the Diasorin test. These discrepancies may be partly explained by individual differences in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 depending on the antigenic target: the S1/S2 antigen for Diasorin versus the N antigen for the Roche and Abbott tests [35,36]. This may affect both the time frame and the extent of the antibody response. The Roche and Abbott tests probably have a high rate of similar epitope recognition. It has been hypothesized that the majority of produced antibodies are against the most abundant protein of a virus, which for SARS-CoV-2 is the N protein [16]. Boukli et al reported a high incidence (10%) of false-positive results with the Diasorin test particularly in patients suffering from acute infectious conditions, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV)infections[38]. It is suggested that they result from nonspecific immune activation rather than cross-reactivity between non-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the SARS-CoV-2 proteins used in the assay. Strikingly a moderate correlation was found between the three serologic tests in the HCW, while it was very poor or absent in the other populations in our study. This deserves further attention as it remains unclear whether this is a true phenomenon induced by certain disease or treatment related factors, or just a statistical coincidence.",

In a detailed translational study on 41 cancer (23 solid, 18 hematological) patients Abdul Jawad et al showed that SARS-CoV-2 exposed cancer patients with solid tumors develop immune response signatures similar to those of non-cancer patients [43]. However, this is not the case for patients with hematological malignancies which display heterogeneous humoral responses, an exhausted T-cell phenotype and a high prevalence of prolonged viral shedding. COVID-19 positive hematological cancer patients showed three phenotypes: (1) patients failing to mount an antibody response with prolonged viral shedding (2) patients mounting an antibody response but failing to clear virus, and (3) those able to mount an antibody response and successfully clear virus. Although numbers are low, these observations were confirmed in our study. Patients with solid tumors had an antibody response which was comparable of that of healthy volunteers, while patients with hematological malignancies did not mount an antibody response in our population (Figure 3). These patients were in most cases B-cell depleted or had a history of autologous bone marrow transplant. In fact, at least 2 of these patients did not manage to clear the SARS-CoV-2 and had several episodes of hospital admission because of disease exacerbation. Hematological cancer patients often suffer of complex immunological dysregulation which can persist life-long. This probably explains their long-term increased risk to be hospitalized and die due to COVID-19 [7]. The effects of oncological treatment on antibody response and effectivity of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 needs urgent prospective studies, particularly in B-Cell depleted patients on rituximab, autologous transplant patients and patients with extensive metastatic end-stage disease. Patients with solid and hematological malignancies should be regarded as different entities in future studies. little information on protection of patients against COVID-19. Our study highlights the importance of protecting the nursing and medical staff against a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study has several limitations. It is a cross-sectional study and blood samples were not taken at fixed time points. Clinical data were gathered retrospectively. Although it is a big study, luckily for the patients, the rate of seroconversion was low limiting the numbers of events. On the other hand, it is the first large study comparing 3 commercial tests for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/total Ig in a reallife ambulatory cancer population. More important, samples were not historic left-over samples but were collected prospectively and handled and stored with care assuring optimal quality of the laboratory analysis. Additional studies, looking at the immune response in a more detailed way on this material are planned in the future. Baldanti F.
