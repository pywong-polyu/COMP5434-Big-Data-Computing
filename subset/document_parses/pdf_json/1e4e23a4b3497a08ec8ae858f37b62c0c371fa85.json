            "text": "Machine learning (ML) outperforms traditional approaches in many molecular design tasks. ML models usually predict molecular properties from a 2D chemical graph or a single 3D structure, but neither of these representations accounts for the ensemble of 3D conformers that are accessible to a molecule. Property prediction could be improved by using conformer ensembles as input, but there is no largescale dataset that contains graphs annotated with accurate conformers and experimental data. Here we use advanced sampling and semi-empirical density functional theory (DFT) to generate 37 million molecular conformations for over 450,000 molecules. The Geometric Ensemble Of Molecules (GEOM) dataset contains conformers for 133,000 species from QM9, and 317,000 species with experimental data related to biophysics, physiology, and physical chemistry. Ensembles of 1,511 species with BACE-1 inhibition data are also labeled with high-quality DFT free energies in an implicit water solvent, and 534 ensembles are further optimized with DFt. GEOM will assist in the development of models that predict properties from conformer ensembles, and generative models that sample 3D conformations.",

A number of reference datasets provide unlabeled molecules for generation tasks 7, [24] [25] [26] [27] or experimentally labeled molecules for property prediction 23, [28] [29] [30] [31] . The molecules are typically represented as SMILES 32 or InChi 33 strings, which can be converted into 2D graphs, or as single 3D structures. These representations can be used as input to machine learning models that predict properties or generate new compounds. However, these representations fail to capture the flexibility of molecules, which consist of atoms in continual motion on a potential energy surface (PES). Molecular properties are a function of the conformers accessible at finite temperature 34, 35 , which are not explicitly included in a 2D or single 3D representation (Fig. 1) . Models that map conformer ensembles to experimental properties could be of interest, but they require a dataset with both conformers and experimental data.",

            "text": "Second, GEOM can be used to train generative models to predict conformers given an input molecular graph. This is an active area of research that seeks to lower the computation cost compared to exhaustive torsional approaches and to increase the speed, reliability and accuracy compared to stochastic approaches [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . The size and simulation accuracy of the GEOM dataset make it an ideal training set and for pre-training generalizable models. Moreover, machine learning models for conformer generation are orders of magnitude faster than the methods used to generate GEOM. Hence models trained on GEOM may be able to reproduce its accuracy on unseen molecules at a fraction of the cost. As discussed below, the CREST ensembles have high coverage of the true thermally accessible conformers. Hence GEOM is an excellent benchmark for the recall and diversity of conformer generation methods. However, the CREST statistical weights for each conformer are rather inaccurate. Therefore, benchmarks that include conformer probabilities should use the DFT weights provided in GEOM. www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/ atoms), up to a maximum of 181 atoms (91 heavy atoms). They contain a large variance in flexibility, as demonstrated by the mean (6.5) and maximum (53) number of rotatable bonds. 15% (45, 712) of the molecules have specified stereochemistry, while 27% (83,326) have stereocenters but may or may not have specified stereochemistry. The QM9 dataset is limited to 9 heavy atoms (29 total atoms), with a much smaller molecular mass and few rotatable bonds. 72% (95,734) of the species have specified stereochemistry. Table 2 summarizes the experimental properties in the GEOM dataset from the AICures dataset. Of note is data for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, and for the specific inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease. The 3CL protease has high sequence similarity to its SARS-CoV 3CL counterpart, for which there is significantly more experimental data. The similarity of the two proteases means that CoV-2 models may benefit from pre-training with CoV data, so GEOM can also be used to benchmark transfer learning methods. Another target of interest is the SARS-CoV PL protease 56, 57 . The dataset also contains molecules screened for growth inhibition of E. Coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, both of which can cause secondary infections in COVID-19 patients. Table 3 shows the species from MoleculeNet 31 that are included in GEOM. We used every compound from the physical chemistry and physiology categories. These molecules have experimental data for three physical chemistry tasks and 659 physiology tasks. The latter include blood-brain barrier penetration, qualitative toxicity, and whether a drug fails in clinical trials due to toxicity. GEOM also contains the BACE dataset 39 , which is part of the biophysics category of MoleculeNet. Each BACE molecule has an experimental binding affinity for human \u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE-1). The remaining biophysics datasets were excluded because of size, and because the AICures drug dataset is already sufficiently large. The \"recovered\" column in Table 3 shows that vacuum conformer-rotamer ensembles (CREs) were generated for over 98% of the molecules in each dataset other than SIDER. CREST CREs were also generated with an implicit solvent model of water for 99.9% of the BACE compounds. As mentioned above, these conformers were further annotated with single-point DFT energies and xTB quasi-harmonic free energies.",

For example, many missing compounds are extremely flexible. For most of these compounds, the CREST calculations ran for several days with 40 cores and did not finish. Other missing compounds failed during initial xTB optimization, often because of unusual topologies; this was most common in the SIDER dataset. Table 3 .

The exhaustive method is to enumerate all the possible rotations around every bond, but this approach has prohibitive exponential scaling with the number of rotatable bonds 60, 66 . Stochastic algorithms available in cheminformatics packages such as RDKit 64 suffer from two flaws. First, they explore conformational space very sparsely through a combination of pre-defined distances and stochastic samples 67 and can miss many low-energy conformations. Second, in most standalone applications, conformer energies are determined with classical force fields, which are rather inaccurate 47 . Enhanced molecular dynamics simulations, such as metadynamics (MTD), can sample conformational space more exhaustively, but need to evaluate an energy function many times. Ab initio methods, such as DFT, can assign energies to conformers more accurately than force fields, but are also orders of magnitude more computationally demanding. An efficient balance between speed and accuracy is offered by the newly developed CREST software 37 . This program uses semi-empirical tight-binding DFT to calculate the energy. The predicted energies are significantly more accurate than classical force fields, accounting for electronic effects, rare functional groups, and bond-breaking/formation of labile bonds, but are computationally less demanding than full DFT. Moreover, the search algorithm is based on MTD, a well-established thermodynamic sampling approach that can efficiently explore the low-energy search space. Finally, the CREST software identifies and groups rotamers, conformers that are identical except for atom re-indexing. It then assigns each conformer a probability through",

The collective variables \u0394 i are the root-mean-square displacements (RMSDs) of the structure with respect to the i th reference structure, n is the number of reference structures, k i is the pushing strength and \u03b1 i determines the potentials' shapes. A new reference structure from the trajectory is added to V bias every 1.0 ps, driving the molecule to explore new conformations. Different molecules require different (k i , \u03b1 i ) pairs to produce best results, so twelve different MTD runs are used with different settings for the V bias parameters. Conformers are defined by rotation about dihedral angles. In MTD simulations with RMSD collective variables, the biasing potential in Eq. (2) generates energy for overcoming torsional barriers. Since it takes less energy to cross a rotational barrier than to break a covalent bond, the biasing term leads to exploration of conformational space through rotation, rather than to trivial fragmentation 37, 68 . Indeed, the bare energy without the biasing term keeps the molecule from exploring ultra-high energy regions, and thus reduces the size of the 3N-6-dimensional PES to be explored, where N is the number of atoms. This also makes it more efficient at finding accessible minima than an exhaustive enumeration of dihedral angles, since the latter would include high-energy, thermally inaccessible structures.",

The GFN2-xTB method is fast enough to be used in long MTD runs, and its conformational energies are accurate to within 2 kcal/mol (see Technical Validation). The number of energy and force calculations can easily reach into the millions for a single CREST run, making full DFT prohibitive and xTB quite practical. Further, the CREST safety window of 6.0 kcal/mol ensures that the vast majority of accessible conformers should be present in the CRE. However, the typical xTB errors of 2 kcal/mol are too large for the accurate ranking of the conformers by statistical weight. This is because p is exponential in \u0394E/k B T, and at room temperature k B T = 0.59 kcal/mol, which is 3.4 times smaller than the average error. Further, the weights do not take into account the zero-point energy or the roto-translational and vibrational entropy (see below). Each of these contributions to the free energy is conformation-dependent, and can lead to non-negligible changes in statistical weight.",

This means that the original graph was likely recovered for 98.4% of all drugs. 21% of cases failed because of tautomerization (1% of all cases), and 9.4% failed because of a different reaction (usually dissociation or ring formation; 0.5% of all cases). The high success rate of the graph re-identification indicates that, in the vast majority of cases, the geometries generated by CREST were actual conformers of the species.",

            "text": "Third, we compared the CREST energies and coordinates to those from higher levels of theory. Figure 3 compares the GFN2-xTB calculations of CREST with single-point r2scan-3c calculations, both performed in water for 1,511 species in the BACE dataset. Panel (a) shows the relative energies of the two methods. The mean absolute error (MAE) of xTB is 1.96 kcal/mol, which is similar to reported values in conformational energy benchmarks 38 . The ranking accuracy can be measured with the Spearman correlation coefficient \u03c1, which lies between 1 and \u22121 (perfect correlation and anti-correlation, respectively). The Spearman coefficient is 0.47 when using all geometries from all species. However, it is more meaningful to judge the energy rankings among different conformers in a single species. Computing \u03c1 separately for each species yields the distribution in panel (b). The distribution of \u03c1 is quite wide, with an average value of 0.39 and a standard deviation of 0.35. The mean value of \u03c1 indicates moderate correlation between the methods. The correlation is significantly better than for classical force fields such as MMFF94 82 , UFF 98 , and GAFF 99 : For instance, the median \u03c1 between MMFF94 and single-point DFT for drug-like molecules is between \u22120.1 and \u22120.45, meaning that the two methods are actually weakly anti-correlated (Supporting Information of ref. 47 ). Figure 4 compares single-point DFT calculations on CREST geometries (\"SP\") with DFT results on fully optimized geometries (\"CENSO\"). Panel (a) shows the distribution of \u03c1 for conformer energies. The average Spearman correlation is 0.69 and the standard deviation is 0.27, indicating good agreement between the two methods. Indeed, the MAE between optimized and single-point relative energies is 0.54 kcal/mol, which is 3.6 times lower than the xTB error (the MAE of the absolute energy, equal to the average energy released after optimization, is 5.74 kcal/mol). Panel (b) shows that the geometries change very little during optimization, with a mean RMSD of only 0.36 \u00c5. This shows that the CREST geometries are quite good, thus validating the quality of the GEOM ensembles. The median RMSD among heavy atoms is 0.25 \u00c5; this is 2.4 times lower than the value of 0.6 \u00c5 between MMFF94 and PM7 geometries 100 for drug-like molecules 47 .",

            "text": "Similar comparisons can be made between CENSO geometries and their most similar CREST counterparts (i.e., the CREST geometry with the lowest RMSD relative to a CENSO geometry). These may not be the same as the CREST geometries used to seed the optimization. We have found that using the most similar geometries does not significantly affect the results; for example, the Spearman coefficient only climbs to 0.72 \u00b1 0.27, while the RMSD only drops to 0.33 \u00b1 0.19. Note also that the comparison of the methods only includes conformers with non-negligible weight after optimization (\u0394G \u2264 2.5 kcal/mol), since CENSO discards high-energy www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/ conformers during optimization. Hence high-energy conformers were not fully optimized and thus not included in the comparison. Figure 5 (a) compares the ordering of geometries with CREST and with CENSO. The Spearman correlation is \u03c1 = 0.43 \u00b1 0.41, which is similar to the correlation between CREST and single-point energies. This result should be interpreted with caution, however, since only the lowest-energy CENSO geometries are included in the comparison, whereas the rank correlation in Fig. 3 includes all CREST conformers. Lastly, Fig. 5 (b) compares the ordering of CENSO geometries by energy and by free energy. The correlation is quite high (\u03c1 = 0.85 \u00b1 0.18), and the MAE between energies and free energies is only 0.33 kcal/mol. Hence energies alone can be quite good for ordering conformers by statistical weight. This also means that the statistical weight errors in GEOM are dominated by xTB errors, and that the quasi-harmonic errors are comparably negligible.",

CREST version 2.9 was used with xTB version 6.2.3 to generate the initial CREs. CENSO 1.1.2 was used with Orca 5.0.1 87 and xTB 6.4.1 to refine the ensembles. Orca 5.0.2 was used for all single-point calculations. A race condition bug in version 5.0.1 meant that some CENSO energies were clearly incorrect (conformational energies above 1,000 kcal/mol), while some energy calculations failed to converge for reasonable geometries. Therefore, we discarded ensembles with failed energy calculations or conformational energy ranges exceeding 30 kcal/mol at any stage of the optimization. We also performed new single-point calculations on all converged CENSO geometries with Orca 5.0.2; 0.44% of the energies were found to be incorrect and were replaced. ",
