Recently, SARS-CoV has been demonstrated to induce cell apoptosis in Vero-E6 cells. The possible role of SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) in virus-induced apoptosis is characterized in this study. Growth arrest and apoptosis via caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities were demonstrated in SARS-CoV 3CL pro -expressing human promonocyte cells. The fluorescence intensity of dihydrorhodamine 123 staining indicated that cellular reactive oxygen species were markedly increased in SARS-CoV 3CL pro -expressing cells. Moreover, in vivo signalling pathway assay indicated that 3CL pro increased the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B-dependent reporter, but inhibited activator protein-1dependent transcription. This finding is likely to be responsible for virus-induced apoptotic signalling.",

SARS-CoV is rapidly transmitted through aerosols, and caused 8447 reported cases with 811 deaths worldwide during a short period from February to June 2003 (Peiris et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003) . Around 20% of SARS cases developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. Pathological examination of the lung indicated that bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, multinucleated syncytial cells and squamous metaplasia were found in lung tissues of SARS patients (Lang et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2003) . Abnormal laboratory findings in SARS patients included lymphopenia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and an increase in aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 in serum (Wang et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2005) .",

The SARS-CoV genome encodes for replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid. The replicase gene encodes two large overlapping polypeptides (replicase 1a and 1ab, c. 450 and c. 750 kDa, respectively), including 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase for viral replication and transcription (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . SARS-CoV replicates in Vero-E6 cells with cytopathic effects (Ng et al., 2003; Yan et al., 2004) , and also induces AKT signalling-mediated cell apoptosis (Mizutani et al., 2004) . Recently, the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) protein has been demonstrated to induce actin reorganization and apoptosis in COS-1 monkey kidney cells by downregulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and up-regulating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (Surjit et al., 2004) . As the 3C protease of the picornaviruses poliovirus, enterovirus 71 and rhinovirus induces cell apoptosis (Li et al., 2002; Calandria et al., 2004; Funkhouser et al., 2004) , the possible role of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in virusinduced apoptosis is of interest.",

A similar caspase activity profile has been reported in poliovirus 3C-induced apoptosis via caspase-3 activation (Calandria et al., 2004) . SARS-CoV 3CL pro caused a significant increase in ROS production in HL-CZ cells (Fig. 5) which, in turn, were involved in 3CL pro -induced apoptosis. Recently, ROSmediated apoptosis has also been reported in viral infections, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (Lin et al., 2004a) and influenza virus (Uchide et al., 2002) . In vivo signalling pathway assay indicated that 3CL pro increased the activation of the NF-kB-dependent reporter, but inhibited AP1-dependent transcription (Fig. 6) . This finding indicates that NF-kB, but not c-Jun, is involved in 3CL pro -induced apoptosis of human promonocyte cells. The transcription factor NF-kB is produced in response to oxidative stress, being widely proposed to be involved in the mediation or prevention of apoptosis, and ROS serve as second messengers in the induction of the transcription factor NF-kB (Bonizzi et al., 1999) . The activation of an NF-kB-dependent reporter gene induced by SARS-CoV 3CL pro (Fig. 6) was correlated with an increase in ROS production in HL-CZ cells. Consensus NF-kB sites exist in the promoters of apoptosisrelated genes and proinflammatory genes (Chen et al., 2001) , such as transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), IL-1a, IL-6 and IL-8. Interestingly, TGF-b, IL-6 and IL-8 are greatly increased in the acute phase sera of SARS patients (Huang et al., 2005) . Therefore, the activation of the NF-kB signal transduction pathway induced by SARS-CoV 3CL pro could be useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS.",

ROS production and NF-kB signalling are likely to be associated with SARS-CoV 3CL proinduced pathology. 6 . Effect of in vivo signal transduction pathway in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 3C-like protease (SARS-CoV 3CL pro )-expressing cells on the cis-reporter systems of interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), interferon-gamma-activated site (GAS), p53, activator protein-1 (AP1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). SARS-CoV 3CL pro -expressing cells and mock cells were transiently transfected with the cis-reporter plasmids pISRE-Luc, pGAS-Luc, p53-Luc, pAP1-Luc and pNF-kB, respectively. The indicated promoter activity was measured using a luciferase assay.",
