Currently, there are no vaccines or antivirals available for the prevention of CHIKV infection. Lycorine, an alkaloid from Amaryllidaceae plants, has antiviral activity against a number of viruses such as coronavirus, flavivirus and enterovirus. In this study, we found that lycorine could inhibit CHIKV in cell culture at a concentration of 10 lmol/L without apparent cytotoxicity. In addition, it exhibited broad-spectrum anti-alphavirus activity, including Sindbis virus (SINV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV), and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEEV). The time of addition studies indicated that lycorine functions at an early post-entry stage of CHIKV life cycle. The results based on two different CHIKV replicons provided further evidence that lycorine exerts its antiviral activity mainly by inhibiting CHIKV translation. Overall, our study extends the antiviral spectrum of lycorine.",

            "text": "CHIKV is a positive, single-stranded RNA virus, and the complete genome is around 12 kilobases (kb) with a 5 0 cap and a 3 0 poly (A) tail that contains two ORFs. The first ORF locating at the 5 0 two-thirds of the CHIKV genome encodes four nonstructural proteins (nsP1-nsP4) responsible for viral replication and transcription. The second ORF, found at the 3 0 -end of the genome, encodes the structural proteins (capsid (C), E3, E2, 6 K/TF and E1) that function in the assembly of new virus particles and the attachment and entry to new cells. After entry into host cells, the viral genome is directly used as mRNA for the translation of nonstructural proteins (nsP1-nsP4) that form viral replication complex to initiate the synthesis of the negativestrand RNA using viral genome as the template (Kaur et al. 2013) . The resulting negative-strand RNA then serves as a template for the synthesis of viral genomic and 26S subgenomic (sg) RNAs. Among which, the sgRNA is transcribed from the remaining 3 0 one-third of the genome with a sg promoter that is presented on the full-length negative-stranded RNA. The sgRNA is subsequently translated into structural proteins. Efforts have been made Na Li and Zhen Wang have contributed equally to this work. to develop compounds against CHIKV infection that target different steps of viral life cycle, for example harringtonine, a cephalotaxine ester derived from the Japanese plum yew, inhibited CHIKV infection by interfering with the process of viral protein synthesis (Kaur et al. 2013 ); ribavirin and 6-azauridine that are nucleotide analogs target the steps of viral RNA synthesis (Briolant et al. 2004; Abdelnabi et al. 2015) .",

For dose-dependent inhibition of lycorine on CHIKV in different cell lines or other alphaviruses, Vero, BHK-21, Huh7, A549 cells infected with WT CHIKV or Vero cells infected with WT SINV, SFV and VEEV at an MOI of 0.01 were treated with increasing concentrations of lycorine. The culture media were collected at 12 hpi for SINV and at 24 hpi for SFV and VEEV. Viral titers were quantified by plaque assay in BHK-21 cells as described previously . The antiviral activity of lycorine was expressed as 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) which indicated the compound concentration required to achieve 50% of viral titer reduction and was calculated by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software 5.0.",

For enteroviruses, it has been reported that lycorine inhibits EV71 and CVA16 infection through downregulating autophagy that is important for virus replication . Alternately, blocking the elongation of the viral polyprotein during translation is another possible mechanism of lycorine against EV71 infection in cell culture (Liu et al. 2011) . However, drug resistant selection indicated that viral protease may be the target of lycorine to inhibit viral replication of both EV71 and HCV (Guo et al. 2016) . F76L mutation in EV71 2A protease and R118L mutation in HCV NS3 protease confer the resistance to lycorine in both viruses, respectively (Guo et al. 2016) . Additionally, a single-amino acid substitution in WNV 2 K peptide was identified to confer resistance to lycorine, partially through enhancement of viral RNA synthesis or through modulation of host immune response.",

The translation of alphavirus includes both nonstructural and structural proteins synthesis which are directed by genomic RNA (gRNA) and sgRNA, respectively. The early translation of nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4) is essential for the formation of replication complex which is responsible for viral RNA replication and transcription. The translation of structural proteins derived from sgRNA happens in the late phase of the virus life cycle and plays a key role in viral assembly. Lycorine may act on the translation of both gRNA and sgRNA, and thus inhibit both viral RNA synthesis and viral assembly which result in a cumulative and strong inhibitory effect on the production of infectious viruses in cell culture.",

Such RNA viruses as alphaviruses can manipulate the cellular translation machinery for their own benefit (Jaafar and Kieft 2019) . Thus, it is very possible, plus consideration of its broad-spectrum antiviral activities, that lycorine modulates alphavirus replication through targeting host factors instead of directly targeting viral factors. It is worth to explore it in our future studies regarding the underlying mechanism by which lycorine interferes with translation machinery as well as about whether it has an inhibitory effect on host protein translation. Furthermore, it is also important to assess the possible side effect of lycorine during preclinical studies although a drug containing lycorine as an effective component has been clinically used in Russia as an expectorant to remedy chronic and acute inflammatory processes in lungs and bronchial diseases (Nair et al. 2013; Shen et al. 2018) .",

In the present study, we have demonstrated that lycorine could inhibit multiple alphaviruses replication in cell culture without cytotoxicity, which further broadened its antiviral spectrum combined with previous antiviral studies of different viral species(Zou et al. 2009;Liu et al. 2011;He et al. 2013;Shen et al. 2019;Wang et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2020).Different antiviral mechanisms of lycorine have been proposed by different groups.
