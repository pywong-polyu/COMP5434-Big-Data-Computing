We developed a mathematical model of a vaccine trial to investigate the factors affecting observed values of VE. We first illustrate parameters affecting measured , then quantify the influence of different biases on VE estimates, notably the impact of i) the build-up of immunity from undetected asymptomatic infections, ii) imperfect test sensitivity and specificity for alternative testing strategies, iii) differential detection of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, and iv) confounding of VE and probability of symptoms by age.
