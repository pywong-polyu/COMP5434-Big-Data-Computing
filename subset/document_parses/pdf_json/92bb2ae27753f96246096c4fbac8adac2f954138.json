Direct substrain comparisons are a necessary first step before implementing an RCC. We evaluated a number of premorbid addiction vulnerability traits and cocaine self-administration behaviors using a longitudinal within-subjects design. Trait impulsivity and compulsivity were greater in SHR/NCrl than SHR/NHsd, as were reactivity to sucrose reward, sensitivity to acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, and cocaine abuse liability studied under fixed-ratio and chained schedules of cocaine self-administration. Trait compulsivity correlated with the acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, which in turn correlated with cocaine taking under the chained schedule. Trait compulsivity also was the best predictor of cocaine seeking responses. Heritability estimates indicated that 22%-40% of the variances for the above phenotypes can be explained by additive genetic factors, providing sufficient genetic variance to conduct genetic mapping in F2 crosses of SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd. These results provide compelling support for using an RCC approach in SHR substrains to uncover candidate genes and variants that are of relevance to cocaine use disorders.",

            "text": "The addictions, in particular cocaine addiction, are highly heritable neuropsychiatric diseases [1, 2] . Given the nearly 2 million past-month cocaine users in the US, with ~1 million meeting diagnostic criteria for cocaine dependence [3] , new research directed at identifying genetic variants that influence cocaine addiction vulnerability will improve diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. One of the only known genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits to date in cocaine dependence was a variant near FAM53B [4] that was functionally supported by covariance between Fam53b expression and cocaine self-administration in recombinant inbred mice [5] . To date, human GWAS of SUD, especially those comprising stimulant and opioid use disorders, lack sufficient sample sizes and thus adequate power to detect the small effects of the vast majority of common variants on risk for substance use disorders [6, 7] . Mammalian forward genetic mapping studies can more rapidly achieve appropriate sample sizes and power to identify genome-wide significant genetic loci underlying behavioral traits relevant to the addictions. Nevertheless, a major limitation of many rodent genetic studies is poor mapping resolution, namely those employing F2 crosses, thus leaving investigators with highly significant loci, yet an intractable number of genes within these large intervals (typically 15-20 cM or ~30-40 Mb) that contain causal genes and variants. In addition to poor mapping resolution, one must also consider the genetic complexity of loci whereby hundreds of genes and thousands of variants typically underlie F2-derived QTLs between classical inbred strains.",

QTL and fine mapping can be used to resolve quantitative trait loci (QTLs/eQTLs) and quantitative trait genes (QTGs) in genetic crosses that segregate a low level of genetic diversity. Kumar and colleagues used an RCC between C57BL/6 substrains to map and validate Cyfip2 in cocaine sensitivity [12] . We subsequently used an RCC between similar substrains to map the same Cyfip2 locus and validate Cyfip2 as a genetic factor underlying binge-like eating [13] . Reduced genetic complexity in C57BL/6 substrains was also used to validate a functional intronic variant in the alpha-2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor in regulating Gabra2 transcript and protein expression via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing [14] . Finally, Phillips and colleagues exploited reduced genetic complexity between DBA/2 substrains to identify a functional coding variant in Taar1 (trace amine-associated receptor 1) underlying differences in the aversive properties of methamphetamine self-administration and body temperature [15, 16] .",

There are at least 8 closely related SHR substrains from different international sources, but none have been directly compared for addiction vulnerability traits. In this report, we phenotyped two substrains -SHR/NCrl (Charles River Laboratories) and SHR/NHsd (Harlan Sprague-Dawley). SHR breeding history began in 1963 at Kyoto University when the outbred Wistar stock in Kyoto (WKY) was selectively bred for elevated blood pressure [30] . Incompletely inbred F13 SHR rats were transferred to the NIH in 1966. SHR rats at NIH were subsequently fully inbred by 1969 and then distributed from NIH (SHR/N) to Charles River Labs (SHR/NCrl) in 1973 at F32 and to Harlan (SHR/NHsd), but with the date of transfer and filial generation at transfer not publicized.",

Considering that average 24hr water intake in each substrain is ~80 ml/kg [55, 56] , the excessive drinking that developed in 1hr was clearly maladaptive and exceeded the physiological need for water even after consuming 2.7 grams of food during the 1hr test sessions. Individual differences in the development of SIP are considered a means to identify a compulsive endophenotype reflecting poor inhibitory control [57] . To date, SIP has been investigated only in SHR/NCrl for betweenstrain comparisons, and results consistently showed that polydipsia associated with a FT 60s schedule of food pellet delivery was greater in SHR/NCrl than WKY/NCrl and Wistar control strains [39, 48] .",

Past research showed that Sprague-Dawley rats selectively bred for high saccharin intake acquired cocaine selfadministration faster and maintained cocaine intake at higher levels compared to Sprague-Dawley rats selectively bred for low saccharin intake [66, 67] .

Likewise, basal locomotor activity (habituation days 1-3) was comparable in SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd. This finding also is consistent with between-strain comparisons showing that SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd are similarly hyperactive relative to WKY/NCrl and WKY/NHsd, respectively [38, 51] . In contrast, novelty preference can predict severity of compulsive cocaine use in high and low novelty preferring Sprague-Dawley rats [19] , suggesting that novelty preference might be an important phenotype to study in future investigations exploring SHR substrain differences. Previous between-strain comparisons support such efforts, as SHR/NCrl exhibited greater novelty preference than WKY/NCrl and Wistar [26, 71] , but novelty preference did not differ significantly between SHR/NHsd, WKY/NHsd and Wistar [31] .",

It was somewhat surprising that impulsivity was not a significant predictor of any aspect of cocaine self-administration behavior in this study, given its prominent association with cocaine self-administration in outbred Lister Hooded rats [18, 62, 81, 82] and outbred Wistar rats [83, 84] . Although both inhibitory control traits were heritable and were correlated in SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd, the compulsivity phenotype might be relatively more important for predicting a cocaine-vulnerable phenotype in an F2 population of rats that segregate SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd alleles. Interestingly, the balance between brain circuits that promote (ventral striatum-orbitofrontal cortex) and limit (ventral striatum-anterior cingulate cortex) compulsive behavior is dysregulated in cocaine users, with the degree of circuit dysregulation positively correlated with the number of DSM-IV compulsive drug use symptoms [85] . Strikingly similar brain-behavior relationships were reported in a subset of outbred Sprague-Dawley rats that progressed to compulsive stimulant use [86] , highlighting a critical role for trait compulsivity, and perhaps prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens circuit functions, in the development of cocaine addiction.",
