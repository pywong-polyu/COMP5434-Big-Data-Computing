The importance of appearance has had very different motivating factors over time [1] . Undoubtedly, the history of cosmetology shows that people have often prioritized their appearance over health safety concerns, and warnings about risks have often been ignored [2, 3] . With the proliferation and availability of various cosmetic procedures, many of them invasive, the risk of adverse events, including infections, increases. Infectious diseases have been the main cause of occupational diseases in Poland, but the beauty industry has not been included as a major occupational area of infection risk in the register of occupational diseases [4, 5] . Unfortunately, high social pressure for a beautiful image, including by the media, does not always acknowledge the health risk issues and consequences of this burden [6] .Disapproval of natural beauty, denial of the aging process, and indifference to the economic implications of health complications (e.g., the issue of recording adverse events) impose other priorities, often relegating safety issues [6, 7] .The increasing demand for invasive cosmetic services requires safety regulations (RES AP 2008 [1] with further amendments) [8] .",

This included a trend for increased chronic forms of hepatitis B until 2016 and a subsequent decline. However, in 2017, 74% of the newly reported cases of acute hepatitis B infections in Poland, Italy, and Romania were caused by hospital instrumentation. The cases were reported as medical infections but with incomplete information regarding the routes of transmission. In 2017, the completeness of acute and chronic infection data was 29% and 13%, respectively, and (in Poland) the information was obtained retrospectively by interviewing 90% of the cases. Thus, the authors pointed out the necessity of completeness of the data on the transmission routes [17] . The epidemiological trends may be influenced by other factors such as the immigration of still high-risk groups (e.g., migrants), hindering the rapid prevention of infections [18] . At the May 2017 World Health Assembly, the World Health Organization proposed evaluating the effectiveness of the health sector's viral hepatitis elimination activities by 2030, based on a reduction in the prevalence of chronic hepatitis cases and mortality of 90% and 65%, respectively. The global efforts in the next few years will show whether the adopted targets are met and whether hepatitis viruses transmitted by blood will no longer pose a significant threat to global public health [19] .",

Among the respondents, 36% used sterile gloves, while the majority (67%) used nonsterile diagnostic gloves (Table 5) . A positive phenomenon was the significantly more frequent habit of changing gloves after a break during work (during permanent make up, 76.7%) or after a self-injury (88.2%) among respondents who gained their knowledge from medical textbooks (78%). Presently, several cosmetic procedures, including invasive ones, have become available. Beauty procedures involve almost the entire human body and are often performed with the disruption of tissue continuity [20] . A beauty salon carries a real risk ofexposing the clients and employees to bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections during procedures [9, 10, 12] . The customers, staff, contaminated materials, surfaces, equipment, and devices located in the beauty salon can be sources of infection from pathogenic microorganisms. Proper adherence to aseptic and antiseptic principles, sterilization, disinfection, and cleaning processes play vital roles in infection prevention for all invasive procedures [21, 22] .",

Only 65% of the participants perceived this risk of infection by parasites, and 64% stated the chance of infection by all the types of pathogens (Table 6) . Conclusions from medical settings pointed that incomplete knowledge of infection etiology in their clinics may translate into incorrect diagnosis of diseases, resulting in missed or flawed decisions, leading to the risk of transmission of infections [23] . In Poland, during our research, infections were the leading cause of occupational diseases (infectious and parasitic) in medical settings [13] . This group of medical professionals-despite having the appropriate educational background, being better equipped to diagnose the diseases, and being more knowledgeable about the relevant etiology and precautions-stated that it is not always possible to avoid infection transmission.According to the above-mentioned report on occupational diseases in Poland between 2008-2016, the most common occupational infectious diseases were caused by the following pathogens: hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Sarcopteshominis, Sarcoptesscabiei, influenza viruses, Bordetella pertussis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and human papilloma virus. With the advent of newer techniques and more invasive cosmetic procedures, the risk of transmission of infections, with local and systemic health consequences, for beauticians and their clients is growing, with an increasing impact on public health [9, 10, 12] .",

A significantly higher percentage of respondents had experienced injuries used disposable needles (94%), pre-filled ampoules/syringes (38%), and razors (20%) compared to respondents who had not used sharp equipment. In light of these results and the rapid increase in invasive cosmetic procedures with sharp instruments, it is worth considering better protection for cosmetic service workers, similar to that for medical personnel. Our study's results also confirmed that knowledge about the risk is a factor in initiating positive changes to limiting this risk. Respondents who participated in training on post-exposure procedures (after contact with potentially infectious biological material) were more likely to cautiously undertake their professional activities (Tables 3 and 4) .",

Since our study's aim was to analyze the educational needs of selected professional groups, the initial results of the analysis were used to prepare rich educational material on an e-learning platform [20] . This training, on a nationwide scale, washeld using educational methods such as stationary classes and e-learning. All forms of training were concluded with an examination and certification; the educational program was developed by experts and with the participation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate's office.

            "text": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020 in Poland enhanced the awareness of people on the facts that simple approaches and known procedures/rules (for example, hand and equipment hygiene, use of masks and PPE to control the routes of infection transmission, avoiding risky behaviors, and vaccination need), are necessary in the fight against communicable diseases and that prevention procedures are very important in disrupting the spread of many infections agents.This is particularly true for services involving the disruption of tissue continuity and where contact distance with the client is relatively short. The global outbreak of COVID-19 emphasized that even if the general rules to avoid spreading of infections are known, one must also be prepared against unknown infectious agents and their new pathogenicity. Moreover, in 2020, in a magazine for cosmetic professionals, an article titled \"What has COVID-19 taught us? Sustainability and not just an emphasis on profit\"drew attention to the need for ecological solutions for disposable packaging and refilling stations for cosmetics [39] . Looking optimistically at the article title, but critically at its content, it seems that confronting an infectious disease during the pandemic has maybe highlighted the lack of knowledge regarding risk of infection in the cosmetic care industry.This is aside from the fact that health safety is a broad concept and probably neither understood nor respected by all people similarly and equally. For example, there are new queries about whether the proposed reusable packaging will be personalized, and whether the cosmetic formulations used from bulk containers will be safe from microbes [40] . New developments often bring further questions and expectations, and with the existing issues unresolved, this may not help to create an atmosphere of trust among aware customers. There is probably a misunderstanding of the basic principle of global profit. True global solutions should consider both the guarantee of microbiological safety during high-risk procedures and respect for the ecological approach (waste disposal vs. re-use of waste). In Poland, a \"positive effect\" of the COVID-19 pandemic is the widely respected PPE use and decontamination requirements that are applied to most services. In addition, increased public awareness of the fact that compliance with the law and sanitary regime can stop the transmission of infections became evident through infection statistics. The dynamics of infections such as blood-borne infections are not always as high as in COVID-19 infections, with clinical signs and symptoms taking months, sometimes years, to appear. Hence, linking them to risk is often difficult, as also is attributing responsibility for the resulting infection. This was mentioned by the authors of the recent ECDC report on blood-borne diseases [17] . In 2017, most new cases of acute hepatitis B reported in EU countries were related to HAIs (e.g.,they were reported as medical infections). Due to the incomplete information on the transmission routes of registered infections (71% for acute infections and 87% for chronic infections), determining the actual source and route of transmission is difficult. The issue of HAIs also highlights the unpredictable risks due to the new features of old (drug resistance) and new pathogens (lack of recommended treatment). It is worth emphasizing that this risk appears in relation to invasive procedures in non-medical servicesas well, and that the only way to reduce the risk is by maintaining a sanitary regime.",

The cause of adverse health events in beauty salon customers should be attributed to insufficient knowledge of service providers about the risk of infections and their prevention. The introduction of legislative changes, sanctioning legislation, and enforcing compliance with sanitary standards is in the best interest of customers and employees of the cosmetic services sector and the entire beauty industry. Both the economic \"savings\" (based on partial assessment of benefits and costs) in non-medical services sector and performing of procedures involving disruption of tissue continuity with sub-standard protocols, as well as the lack of adherence to the sanitary regime, increase the risk of infections. Effective infection prevention education should be mandated, either as part of the diploma or for the continuing education, of cosmetology service workers who perform procedures with a breach of tissue continuity. Hand hygiene and post-exposure procedures should be constant and repeated elements of education at each stage. Vocational education programs should be updated based on substantive and methodical issues tailored to the resources and knowledge deficits of program addressees. More invasive procedures in the beauty service sector should adhere to aseptic rules as a standard.The project results have contributed to several public health innovations and improvements in Poland.",
