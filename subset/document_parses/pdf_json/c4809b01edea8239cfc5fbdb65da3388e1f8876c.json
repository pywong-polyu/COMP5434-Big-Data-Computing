            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) identified in 2003 has infected \u223c8000 people worldwide, killing nearly 10% of them. The infection of target cells by the SARS CoV is mediated through the interaction of the viral Spike (S) protein (1255 amino acids) and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (amino acids N318-T509 of S protein) harbors an extended excursion along its periphery that contacts ACE2 and is designated the receptor-binding motif (RBM, amino acids S432-T486). In addition, the RBM is a major antigenic determinant, able to elicit production of neutralizing antibodies. Hence, the role of the RBM is a bi-functional bioactive surface that can be demonstrated by antibodies such as the neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody (mAb) 80R which targets the RBM and competes with the ACE2 receptor for binding. Here, we employ phage-display peptide-libraries to reconstitute a functional RBM. This is achieved by generating a vast collection of candidate RBM peptides that present a diversity of conformations. Screening such 'Conformer Libraries' with corresponding ligands has produced short RBM constructs (ca. 40 amino acids) that can bind both the ACE2 receptor and the neutralizing mAb 80R.",

By March 2003, this effort culminated with the discovery and cloning of the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) and within the same year its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified (Li et al., 2003) . The SARS CoV Spike (S) binds to ACE2, which mediates viral infection (Li et al., 2003) . The S protein is a type 1, 1255-amino acid long transmembrane glycoprotein comprised of an N-terminal leader sequence (amino acids 1-12), a large extracellular domain (amino acids 13-1195) followed by a transmembrane segment (amino acids 1196-1215) and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 1216-1255) Du et al., 2009) . The extracellular aspect of S protein can further be divided into two functional sub-domains; S1 responsible for receptor recognition (amino acids 13-666) and S2 (amino acids 667-1195), which in response to S1 binding to ACE2, undergoes conformational rearrangements that enable viral fusion with the target-cell membrane (Du et al., 2009) .",

The RBD of SARS CoV was identified as a minimal 193-amino acid long sequence starting around residue N318 (Xiao et al., 2003; Babcock et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004) . However, efforts to produce smaller independently folding, functional receptor-binding peptides of S1 were unsuccessful (Babcock et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004) . The co-crystallization of the RBD bound to its receptor ACE2, revealed that the actual binding interface lies within an extended excursion juxtaposed along the edge of the core of the RBD and constitutes the receptor-binding motif (RBM, residues S432-T486) .",

Using alternative codons, two unique restriction sites were introduced one in each strand; the restriction site for KpnI enzyme in the S432-L443 strand and the restriction site for ApaLI enzyme in the S460-T486 strand. In general, compatible oligonucleotides encoding the relevant construct were designed to create 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overhangs compatible to the SfiI cloning sites of the fth-1 vector (Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2001) and annealed to create double stranded inserts that were introduced into the SfiI-digested fth-1 vector; for details, see Freund et al. (2009). Construction and analysis of 'Conformer Libraries'phage-displayed RBM linker libraries All linker libraries were cloned into the ApaLI and KpnI cloning sites of the 'loopless' RBM vector. Briefly, for the construction of the libraries, two 5\u2032 biotinylated oligonucleotides were used. The first contained the 'library' sequence flanked by ApaLI and KpnI sites compatible with the ApaLI and KpnI cloning sites of the 'loopless' RBM vector. The second oligonucleotide complemented the 3\u2032 end of the first and was extended to 'fill-in' the complementary strand using Klenow polymerase. The product was digested with ApaLI and KpnI, the short biotinylated segments were removed with streptavidin-conjugated beads, and the insert in the flow-through was collected and cloned into ApaLI and KpnI digested vector. This ligation mix was used to electroporate MC1061 cells; for details, see Freund et al. (2009) . The randomness of each library was confirmed by sequencing 20-40 randomly picked colonies. The complexities of linker libraries with linkers comprised of NNK 1 , NNK 2 , NNK 3 and NNK 4 were 7.5 \u00d7 10 3 , 5 \u00d7 10 6 , 1.4 \u00d7 10 7 and 2 \u00d7 10 7 , respectively.",

The RBD structure from the mAb 80R co-crystal is depicted in Fig. 1A . As can be seen, residues I319-A430 create a compact core structure containing two glycosylation sites (N330, N357), two disulfide bonds (yellow bars) and a central anti-parallel beta sheet (\u03b21-\u03b24) ( Fig. 1B and C) . On one side of the beta sheet exists a series of three alpha helices (blue) and on the other side a looped structure, residues N393-F416 (red) (Fig. 1B) . The RBM is an excursion spanning residues S432-T486 that lies on the edge of the core structure. The RBM contains two anti-parallel beta strands (\u03b25 and \u03b26, as indicated in Fig. 1A) , a single disulfide bond and a 16-amino acid loop (green) that tacks the RBM to the core. Finally, an extended beta strand (\u03b27, dark green) stems from residue Y491 to L504 back down through the core serving as a lynch-pin, hydrogen bonding with \u03b23 and \u03b24, and thus holding the entire structure together (Fig. 1C) . It is no surprise that previous attempts to express functional RBDs missing residues N318-N330 and thereby disrupting the disulfide C323-C348 and devoid of \u03b21, or truncations at residues G490 thus deleting the \u03b27 lynch-pin, failed to produce independently folding stable and functional structures (see for example Babcock et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004) .",

For this, all possible linkers of one to four residues were constructed and tested for mAb 80R binding. The rationale was that linkers consisting of one to four amino acids in length and comprised of all possible amino acid compositions would generate a comprehensive library of RBM conformers. Screening this library with mAb 80R would allow us to affinity select those constructs harboring a 'correct' linker length and composition that enables reconstitution of a functional binding surface. The cloning strategy used to construct the linker libraries and a summary of the library complexities are given in Fig. 3 and in 'Materials and methods' section, respectively. No mAb 80R binders were selected from screening libraries of 1-mer and 2-mer random linkers. Therefore, we conclude that although the entire theoretical complexity of linkers of 1 or 2 amino acids most probably was tested, none were able to effectively position the RBM-derived segments to assume a functional conformation. Numerous positive clones could, however, be affinity selected from both the 3-mer and 4-mer linker libraries. The amino acid sequences of the functional linkers were determined and compared as is illustrated in Fig. 4A . Of a total of 800 colonies of phage variants screened from the 3-mer and 4-mer linker libraries, 45 positive clones were identified representing 16 unique linkers. Most of the mAb 80R-selected linkers contained a glycine residue in the first position and a negatively charged E or D at position 2. For the 3-mer linkers, there was a propensity for residues E, N, P or M for the third position. The third position for the 4-mer linkers was typically P and greater variation for position 4 existed as is illustrated in Fig. 4A . Figure 4B shows the comparative binding of mAb 80R to the various constructs. In order to enable meaningful comparison, it was first necessary to confirm that the constructs expressed equally on the phage surface. For this, we probed the different phages containing the various constructs with the GIL-Ab reagent (Kaplan and Gershoni, 2012) that specifically quantifies the level of recombinant pVIII in the bacteriophage, thus showing the expression of the constructs per se when compared with their ability to bind mAb 80R (Fig. 4B) . We conclude that all constructs are expressed well on the phage surface and lack of binding is not due to lack of expression, as can be seen by comparing the initial RBM and 'loopless' RBM constructs to the GEM construct which are expressed in similar levels, however bind to mAb 80R very differently.",

We discovered that reverting the K465I mutation to wild-type, i.e. replacing the aliphatic methyl of isoleucine to the original positive charge of lysine at position 465 led to a drop in binding activity for the two linkers tested, GEM465K and EEP465K (Fig. 5) . No gain of binding was seen when the K465I mutation was introduced into the initial RBD construct (data not shown). We also noticed that reverting the mutation for both positively selected constructs GEM and EEP resulted in a decrease of construct expression, as is indicated by GIL-Ab binding (Fig. 5) . We conclude that K465I mutation is beneficial for mAb 80R binding and for the affinity selection of those phages containing it.",

The RBM is a single sub-domain of the S1 protein that is tacked onto the core of the RBD via three hydrogen bonds contributed by the 16-amino acid loop extending perpendicular to the binding surface itself. Here, we have been able to reconstitute a functional RBM containing 9 of a total of 13 contact residues involved in ACE2 recognition (see Fig. 2A ). This has been accomplished in two steps. First, it was hypothesized that the 16-amino acid loop was not only unnecessary for functional binding, but rather its presence hindered the functional folding of the RBM in the absence of the underlying core. Hence, this obstacle was removed. This, however, created a new problem, namely the need to bridge the gap between residues L443 and F460. The solution to this was to create libraries of combinatorial linkers and exploit the affinity selection using the mAb 80R as a probe. This proved to be extremely effective and numerous variations of reconstituted RBMs were produced. The fact that the novel structures were recognized by three independent conformation-sensitive probes (mAbs 80R and 11A and the natural receptor ACE2) gives credence to the conclusion that isolated RBM, detached from the core of RBD, can fold independently and assume the functional conformation required for receptor and antibody binding, provided the 'correct' linker is implemented to bridge the L443-F460 gap.",

Indeed, a few of such peptides have been reported that seem to bind ACE2 at micro-molar concentrations (Ho et al., 2006; Struck et al., 2012) . Two of these peptides are particularly interesting in view of the fact that they correspond to specific segments of the RBM. Thus for example, Struck et al. reported that the sequence 438-443 (YKYRYL) of the RBM binds ACE2 and can interfere with SARS CoV infection of Vero cells (Struck et al., 2012) . Similarly, Ho et al. published that the 12mer peptide 483-FYTTTGIGYQPY-494 is able to bind ACE2 as well (Ho et al., 2006) .

The special contribution of tyrosine residues to functional binding sites has been reported and exploited for the production of novel antibodies. Sidhu and co-workers illustrate that high-affinity recombinant antibodies can be produced in which the CDR loops are comprised of various combinations of four amino acids (YADS, Fellouse et al., 2004) or exclusively with only serine and tyrosine (Fellouse et al., 2005) . Hence, it may not be surprising that short peptides bearing three inter-spaced tyrosines can associate with ACE2, provided that they are unrestricted at their ends and free to assume unconstrained conformations, some of which may be able to adapt to the ACE2 helix. The fact remains, however, that all previous attempts to express the truncated RBDs (Babcock et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004) , as well as our initial attempts to reconstitute the RBM, failed to produce effective binders despite the presence of the same tyrosine-rich sequences of the RBM. Thus, one can conclude that the linear sequence of the RBM must fold into the correct conformation in order to assume a functional binding surface.",

This is accomplished by implementing a vast collection of random combinatorial linkers varying in length and composition. The affinity selection of conformers that satisfy the spatial orientation and display of the native contact residues has proved very efficient. The credence of this method is supported by the fact that three independent Fig. 3 Cloning strategy of the different RBM constructs. A schematic representation of the fth-1 vector; both the wild-type and recombinant (pVIII-STS) copy of the protein VIII (pVIII) genes are shown (blue and violet, respectively). The recombinant protein VIII gene contains a DNA stuffer that encodes for two stop codons and an RNA transcription terminator (hairpin structure), promoters are also indicated (Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2001) . The stuffer is removed when an insert is cloned between the two SfiI sites. The two segments of the RBM (residues S432-L443 and F460-T486) were cloned into the recombinant pVIII gene generating a 'loopless' RBM phage (the 16-amino acid loop is deleted, thus connecting the two segments of the RBM directly). Two unique restriction sites, KpnI and ApaLI, flanking the deleted 'loop' are shown. For more details, see 'Materials and methods' section.",

These three probes represent two very different modes of interaction with an extended surface of the RBM (Fig. 2B and C) . As is illustrated, the natural ligand, i.e. the viral receptor, ACE2, employs a single continuous helix that contacts 10 residues, 8 of which are contained within the RBM (spanning S432-T486), and no contacts within the 16-amino acid structural loop (Fig. 2B , highlighted green) . The mAb 80R, on the other hand, uses a totally different mode of recognition (Fig. 2C ). All three CDR loops of the heavy chain and two CDR loops of the light chain in addition to two discontinuous segments of the framework contribute 23 contact residues (9 common with those contacting ACE2). Once again no contacts are The sequences of linkers which were affinity selected using mAb 80R from NNK 3 and NNK 4 RBM 'Conformer Libraries' (left and right logos, respectively) were used as input for the MEME Suite motif analysis software (the MEME Suite: http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme, Bailey et al., 2009) .

Hence, we conclude that the affinity-selected linkers in their ability to satisfy such diverse ligand interactions must enable the RBM to assume its natural conformation. Moreover, the fact that the linkers themselves represent a common motif goes to illustrate that a distinct structure and composition of linker is required so to place the contact residues in register and position to be complemented by the binding counter-parts.",

The next task in such an effort requires the ability to produce the neutralizing epitopes as independently folded and functional bioactive peptides. Here, we have illustrated that 'Conformer Libraries' can assist in the affinity selection of functional binding surfaces. Future studies will go to test the next step of epitope-based vaccine development, i.e. are the reconstituted binding surfaces immunogenic and can they elicit protective immunity?
