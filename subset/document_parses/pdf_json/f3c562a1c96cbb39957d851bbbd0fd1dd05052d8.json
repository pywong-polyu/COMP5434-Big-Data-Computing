Disabling hearing loss affects more than one-third of people over 65 across the globe, with its prevalence continuously increasing with age, yet it remains largely undertreated due to limited accessibility to hearing health care solutions for patients (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Since the main complaint of age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) is difficulty following conversations in noisy environments, many patients regard it only a quality-of-life issue attendant on aging, and thus are reluctant to seek optimal medical evaluation and treatment, out of fear for stigmatization and high costs (3, 6) . In truth, hearing loss can significantly affect the trajectory of healthy aging through precipitating physical and mental health outcomes, such as falls and disabilities, frailty, loneliness, depression, social isolation, and beyond (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . In particular, emerging evidence indicates a connection between ARHI and higher risk of cognitive decline in older people (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , and hearing loss has markedly been acknowledged as a major modifiable risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (20) .",

            "text": "Despite advancements in understanding the hearingcognition link, challenges persist because there are many unknown aspects about this link. For example, it has already been known that ARHI and AD differ in prevalence in terms of sex-ARHI is more common and severe in men, while the incidence of AD is greater in women (21-23)-but whether sex predisposes older adults with hearing loss to greater risk of cognitive impairment is a subject of controversy. There is a lack of consensus regarding sex-differing risk in this area, when such data were disaggregated by biological sex (14, (24) (25) (26) . Although social and cultural behavior has been one explanation for these previous findings, the systematic consideration of one's psychosocial sex-the state of being an older man or woman under the influence of culture and society-remains rare. In this regard, incorporating gender into analytic models is warranted to delineate the hearing-cognition link. Gender, as defined by the American Psychological Association (27) , is related to the concept of sex (referring to the biological status indicated by, sex chromosomes, gonads, internal reproductive organs, and external genitals, etc.), but further reflects socially constructed identity, norms, attitudes, feelings and behaviors within a cultural context (28) (29) (30) (31) . Systematic reporting of sex and gender is increasingly recommended for its essential role in rigorous and accurate research, as medical research has historically centered on male subjects and physiology (32, 33) . As for its relevance in our area of research, it has been reported that societal factors impact susceptibility to and prognosis of hearing loss and cognitive decline through entrenched sex roles and expectations (e.g., attitudes toward family and work, social networks, healthseeking behaviors, mental support, and coherence to hearing and cognitive rehabilitation) (3, 11, 20, 34, 35) . Studies including gender-related variables could thus foster a more transparent and inclusive analysis with more information pertaining to sex, accounting for characteristic nuances on the gender spectrum, elucidating the psychosocial mechanism behind the contrasting risk of cognitive impairment between men and women from ARHI with other biological variables, and ultimately contributing to gender and social equity.",

Our aim was to investigate how gender-related characteristics affect the hearing-cognition association in the older demographic alongside biological sex. The analysis herein estimated the risk for cognitive impairment of participants with and without hearing impairment, and the interaction of hearing status with sex and gender. We also looked into the association between sex, gender, and cognitive impairment in the hearing-impaired participants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the role of gender and sex in the relationship between late-life hearing impairment and cognitive function.",

Surveys and cognitive assessment were conducted in English or Spanish, as the participant preferred. To fall within the scope of the present study, participants who underwent objective hearing testing were selected as the analytic sample. As HRS assigns half of the core sample for physical measures (including objective hearing testing since 2016) at each wave (38) , this means that missing data here were partly due to the sampling strategy. The HRS protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan.

The overall cognitive performance was measured as summing scores of the above items (ranging from 0 to 27), with higher scoring representing better cognition of the participant. We classified cognitive performance of respondents into two categories: normal cognition (scored 12 to 17) and cognitive impairment (scored 0 to 11) in reference to others (44) (45) (46) .",

Firstly, variables deemed as gender-related were selected from the 2016 HRS core datasets. Two investigators (J.Y. and S.S.) independently screened the HRS core variables and made the selection in concert with the four aspects of a gender construct: gender roles, gender identity, gender relationships, and institutionalized gender (28) , as well as with the recommended process for analyzing gender (31) . Discrepancies were resolved with the whole author group before identifying 13 genderrelated variables (Supplementary Table 2 ). Next, a factor analysis with the principal-component factor method was performed to reduce the dimensionality of these initial variables. Factors with an eigenvalue >1 were retained for a varimax orthogonal rotation to further increase interpretability (see original factor loadings in Supplementary Table 3) . Variables with a factor loading of 0.40 or greater for one factor and lower for the remaining factors, as well as a communality >0.40 were retained (Supplementary Table 4 ). This was followed by a logistic regression to identify the relationship between these retained variables (independent variables) and biological sex (dependent variable: female = 1, male = 0), determining which of them were associated with the reality of belonging to a given sex group. Variables not significantly associated with biological sex were omitted from the regression model sequentially until all remaining variables had P-values below 0.05 (Table 1) . Lastly, a GS from the propensity score of the logistic regression was computed, estimating the conditional probability of being female in the model when considering these gender-related variables as confounders. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve of GS compared to sex is graphed in Supplementary Figure 1 ; the area under the curve (AUC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated. The GS for each participant ranges from 0 (toward masculine characteristics) to 100 (toward feminine characteristics), and the distribution of GS of HRS participants by sex is presented in Figure 2 .",

Box plots were graphed for variables with the same median. Univariate followed by multiple logistic regression models were applied to examine the cross-sectional association between hearing acuity (independent variable) and the risk of cognitive impairment (dependent variable) in this study, as well as to explore the interactions of sex and gender with hearing acuity. Multivariable regression was performed in four models with the above covariates included (Model I: adjusted for age and sex; Model II: adjusted for age, sex, GS tertile, education, ethnicity, marital status, CVD, smoking, physical activities; Model III: adjusted for model II and an interaction term of hearing\u00d7sex; Model IV: adjusted for model II and an interaction term of hearing\u00d7GS tertile). Odds Ratios (OR) and their 95% CI were reported. To determine the relative contributions of sex and gender, we used multiple logistic regressions to evaluate the risk of cognitive impairment among hearing-impaired participants including sex and gender as exposure variables.

After controlling for age and sex, the association remained significant (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.75, 2.85, Model I).

Association Between Sex, Gender, and Cognitive Impairment Among the Participants With Hearing Impairment Table 5 shows that, in multiple regression models, including either sex or gender as the exposure variables, female sex was associated with a decreased risk of cognitive impairment among participants with hearing impairment (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.49, 0.88, Model I), so was the second and third GS tertiles (OR of GS tertile 2 = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.39, 0.79; OR of GS tertile 3 = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.37, 0.75, Model II).

Those who exhibited masculine characteristics were at greater risk of cognitive impairment from impaired hearing function, compared to those who exhibited androgynous or feminine traits. Incorporation of gender in the analytic models increased predictive accuracy, and the risk for cognitive impairment seemed to be attenuated by a more feminine GS, independent of female sex. This suggests that gender does have an impact on the hearing-cognition association. To our knowledge, the study provides the first proof of the effect of gender (the social construct of sex that reflects social roles, behavior patterns and life context) on the association between hearing acuity and cognitive impairment in late life. We have added to the evidence that hearing impairment is a risk factor for cognitive disorders among older persons with a composite score of gender and extended the psychosocial aspect of sex in shaping cognitive outcomes.",

There were studies that evaluated the sex-specific risk for cognitive impairment for older hearing-impaired people, either by analyzing prospective single-sex cohorts, mixed cohorts, or crosssectional populations (14, (24) (25) (26) (50) (51) (52) . Among the existing evidence, some did not find the association between hearing and cognition differing by sex (14, 50) , while some reported impaired hearing posed a higher risk for cognitive decline in a specific sex group (25, 51, 52) . We postulate that in these controversial findings, there may be confounding factors beyond sex dichotomy. First, much information would be missed if investigators did not consider potential gender-related variables, leading to restricted exploration of the psychosocial influence experienced by the participants. Secondly, in addition to our study, prior studies have suggested that Gender Score is not normally distributed between the two sex groups, and partly overlaps (47, 49) , indicating that gender characteristics exist on a continuum that necessitates sophisticated measures to account for its nuances. Indeed, our data suggest that there were differences between GS tertiles that did not otherwise show by binary sex groups. Also, the association of hearing and cognition was not modified by sex, but by gender, emphasizing that the cognitive outcomes from hearing functioning during the aging process could be better explained in a gender-sensitive manner.",

            "text": "The fluidity of gender is also reflected in a temporal manner: our findings confirm that the main gender influences experienced by older participants were mental status and family obligations, while for working cohorts, gender was influenced by career issues (47, 53) . This was also consistent with conclusions of another older, non-working cohort (48) . A number of environmental and socioeconomic transitions may disrupt retiring populations' health status (35) . Gender could therefore be a good candidate to reflect the contextual change in terms of time and place. Following previous arguments (48, 49) , we also identified the predictive role of gender in cognitive impairment, independent of sex. This indicates that prevention of cognitive decline among older adults with hearing problems could benefit from genderbased health assessments. By complementing the social, cultural, and psychological dimensions of sex, our analysis recognizes the gendered pattern of propensity for cognitive impairment with aging, and emphasizes the necessity of integrating gender into health research. Our findings may help explain the psychosocial mechanisms behind the risk of cognitive impairment between older men and women with hearing problems. Biological infliction and behaviors under social circumstances both gave rise to hearing and cognitive problems over time (41, 54, 55) . This is the area where gender can play a role, because it includes the psychosocial and behavioral components in addition to sex (28) . To illustrate this in the hearing-cognition context: hearing-impaired older individuals may choose to cut off activities involving hearing and talking to avoid stigma; as such, they are more likely to spend working and private time alone (56) . Unfortunately, withdrawal from social contexts and gradual loss of connectedness would further lead to faster development of cognitive decline for the older persons (57) . There was also a hypothesis that one of the causes of cognitive decline and dementia is social isolation (20, 40) . From this point to our results, our construction of GS shows that experiencing strong feelings of loneliness [derived from feeling lack companionship, left out, isolated from others, not \"in tune\" with the people around, alone, there are no people I can talk to, there are no people I can turn to, there are no people who really understand me, there are no people I feel close to, not part of a group of friends, do not have a lot in common with the people around (58, 59) ] is closely related to the masculine type of gender ( Table 1) . This probably explains why we observed that persons with hearing impairment and lower GS (socially ascribed to masculinity) had greater odds of cognitive impairment, compared to their counterparts of higher GS (socially ascribed to femininity) here (Tables 4, 5) . Contrary to the current research, other investigations (11, 35) have concluded that aged women tend to be more likely to suffer from social isolation due to hearing loss, and provided explanations from the perspective of gender-specific roles and social conventions. So, this rationale in our study remains to be fully elucidated with more evidence. Additionally, the findings here show that participants with masculine characteristics were associated with less participation in the household tasks, which is a major indicator of cognitive decline and clinical dementia (60) . But we are not sure whether declined cognition prevented these participants from fulfilling domestic chores, or whether it was their masculine traits and difficult hearing that made them reluctant to undertake such tasks. It is necessary to verify the novelty here, since domestic workload has been reported to be associated with health outcomes such as coronary heart diseases (49) .",

            "text": "Our results should be interpreted considering some limitations. The sex and gender analysis here was based on information from the HRS interviews. The sex variable was obtained through the respondents' answers, so it could be contradictory from the biological indicators of sex, based on some respondents' point of view. This answer could not provide information as to whether the interviewee had received any surgeries or treatment for the variations of internal and/or external genitals. Similarly, the Gender Score we used here was devised according to what were available in the HRS psychosocial questionnaires (59) , compromising the validity and generalizability of the measure to apply to other contexts, although the ROC curve shows fair-to-good sensitivity/specificity to separate the two biological sexes. Also, the older participants we selected for analysis were different from the excluded participants in many aspects (Supplementary Table 1) , which indicates that the missing data may not be random. To some extent, this is because, in the 2016 wave, HRS chose half of the core sample to assign to the face-to-face interview, enhanced with physical measures and following questionnaires (e.g., hearing testing and psychosocial measures), leaving large portions of missing data from the full core dataset. Still, excluding participants who did not meet the criteria of the present study could weaken estimation of the association between hearing impairment and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, no dose-response effect was confirmed in either the association of hearing impairment with cognitive impairment or the risk for cognitive impairment among participants with hearing impairment, making the use of Gender Score to estimate the chance of cognitive impairment debatable, although the c-statistics showed the inclusion of gender increased some accuracy of prediction. Even though this pragmatic approach to measure gender has been used in different cohorts (48, 49, 61) , we predict with caution that the influence of gender on cognition outcomes observed here will be repeated precisely in other older populations, until widely tested and recognized measures of gender are introduced in the future. The HRS cognitive testing here is largely instructed aurally, depending on sufficient hearing function to understand the task, which means that the results of the cognitive testing may be somewhat confounded due to hearing impairment (62, 63) . This should be given due caution because evidence found that neuropsychological assessments of some cognitive domains, which are supposed to reflect cognitive dysfunction, can be confounded by degraded hearing, including decreased central hearing (64, 65) . The absence of clinical evaluations on cognition and objective information on peripheral and central hearing capacity in the present study leaves room for bias-the differential diagnosis of other types of dementia cannot be ascertained since performance from neuropsychological instruments is not equivalent to a stringent dementia diagnosis; substandard audiometric assessment may overestimate stronger risk of cognitive decline (66, 67) ; the contribution of central auditory deficits to cognitive impairment is still unknown. We will pay close attention to the validation of our results by newly released datasets, especially from cohorts enhanced with comprehensive cognitive assessment [e.g., a subset of the HRS, the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) Project (68)]. Finally, we are unable to determine the temporal precedence of hearing impairment and subsequent cognitive decline because of the cross-sectional design of this study, and recalling bias of variables (e.g., social activities, lifestyles) and the lack of critical information (e.g., brain injury history, occupational and recreational noise exposure, ototoxic medications)-all of which could potentially bring about changes to our analytic models.",

Cognitive impairment associated with hearing loss may be attenuated by more feminine characteristics rather than female sex, and this is possibly related to their gender-specific health status and habits. These preliminary results may help researchers and physicians to gain insight into how gender is involved in geriatric conditions and encourage them to probe on gender factors, which may affect health outcomes in relation to their own work. The results should prompt physicians to be cognizant of whether behaviors and social circles of their hearing-impaired patients could affect cognitive outcomes, and to take proper measures to consider gender-diverse people, at different life stages, as they possibly experience different health risks. The results indicate that prevention of cognitive decline among older adults with hearing problems could benefit from gender-based health assessments.",
