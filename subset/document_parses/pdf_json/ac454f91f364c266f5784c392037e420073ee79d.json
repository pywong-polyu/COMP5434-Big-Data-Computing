            "text": "Since December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown causes have been reported in Wuhan. 1 Within just a few months, the novel coronavirus has developed into a global pandemic. As of March 31, 2020, over 809,000 confirmed cases were reported worldwide, of which 81,518 were identified in China. Immediately after the outbreak in Wuhan, several exported cases were confirmed in South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Iran, and the EU due to the high transmissivity of the COVID-19. 2 The most common symptoms of this epidemic were onset of fever, generalized weakness, and dry cough, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia. The incubation period of the virus in the human body is generally 3-7 days (within 14 days). 3 This new type of coronavirus is not as fatal as people thought based on the current data. At present, the mortality of COVID-19 in China is 3.67% according to the situation report by China's National Health Commission (CNHC), 4 compared with 9.6% for SARS and 34.4% for MERS reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). 5, 6 The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a huge impact on social media behaviors across the world internet community, in particular at the early outbreak in China when global attention was focused on the situation in Wuhan and Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic outbreak. China has exhibited fast Internet growth in recent years. According to the latest version of the China Internet Development Statistical Report published by China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), 7 there were 854 million Internet users (61.2% of the total population) and 847 million cell phone users as of June 2019. Meanwhile, social media has become the primary source for the vast majority of internet users in accessing news and acquiring real-time information in China and across the world. Due to the expansion of Wi-Fi coverage, the maturity of Fourth generation (4G) networks and the popular growth of Fifth generation (5G) networks, Chinese Internet users spent on average 27.9 hours per week online. At the global level, there are 38 billion netizens (over 50% of the whole population) according to the latest Internet Trends Report by Mary Meeker; the Internet penetration is 48% in Asia Pacific, 78% in Europe, 32% in Africa and the Middle East, 62% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 89% in North America. 8 With the increase in global Internet penetration, people are used to obtaining information and expressing their opinions online. Participation and attention of Internet users can to some extent represent the public reactions and attitudes to an event. As the leverage of the world's netizens is increasing, public opinion plays an important role in the appeal and participation of many public emergencies, for instance, people spontaneously started using social media to express their dissatisfaction and organize protest marches in France's Yellow vests movement in 2019. 9 In recent years, Internet search trends have been widely used in scientific researches in European and American countries. There were many previous researches based around these data, for instance, forecasting of tourism demand, 10 prediction of unemployment, 11 monitoring of public health and major mental illness. [12] [13] [14] Monitoring public reactions through Internet and major social media platforms (Twitter and Facebook) has become a popular topic, especially in the prevention and control of some infectious diseases, such as Measles, 15 Ebola, 16 and other diseases. [17] [18] [19] Similar to the situation in the regions mentioned above, researchers in many Asian countries have also verified that Internet search trends and social media data could be considered as an important and effective way for the assessment of public attention, risk perception, and behavioral responses to the epidemic outbreaks, since the outbreak of SARS in 2002 20 to the outbreak of COVID-19. [21] [22] [23] The reaction of netizens can generally represent the public response to the emergency, and people in different countries often have different concerns, which provided us a useful tool to better understand the public concerns as well as to prevent and control the epidemic outbreaks. [17] [18] [19] 24 Rational public opinion and correct information transmission from the authorities and authoritative experts can enhance persons' understanding of the outbreaks and relieve their panic. However, the transmission of much contradictory and false information may cause an information overload as well as confusion, 25 which will arouse fear and anxiety that could in turn nourish rumors. For example, it is difficult for people to understand whether face masks can be reused during the epidemic outbreaks, since a thousand posts have a thousand answers. [26] [27] [28] Today, people get information in different ways, but web search engines are a common choice for Internet users around the world. Baidu is the most popular search engine in China, 90.9% of Internet users have reported to prefer Baidu as their default search engine according to the latest Chinese Internet Search Engine Usage Research Report. 29 However, in other countries and regions outside China, people choose Google with priority selection incidence of 92.07%, according to the latest Search Engine Market Share Worldwide Report. 30 Based on quantitative analyses with data mined from both Baidu and Google indexes, this study aims to argue that Internet monitoring is a convenient and cost-effective way to assess public reactions, which can provide evidence to all governments and the public in the world to handle public health emergency problems in case of epidemic outbreaks.",

Therefore, we gathered the BAI with \" Coronavirus\" in Chinese as the keyword, from the web page of Baidu Index on March 11, 33 at the same time, we collected the daily GT as a supplementary data source by using the keyword \"Coronavirus\" from the web page of Google Trends. 34 Besides, we collected 385 rumors identified and confirmed by the Chinese authorities during the study period from Chinese National Platform to Refute Rumors (CNPRR) and Tencent Platform to Refute Rumors (TPRR). 35, 36 The former is the Chinese official rumor-refuting platform which made rumors verified and confirmed by the authority public, the latter was established by China's largest Internet company Tencent whose mission is to seek out misinformation by monitoring the Top topics ranking on social platforms and mark them so as not to be reposted.",

Daily BAI was only correlated to three indicators (by comparison, seven indicators were correlated to daily GT).

Baidu, Google, and other search engines are used by more and more scholars around the world to carry out academic research. 38, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] In this research, we used Internet search trends to probe public attention to COVID-19. This showed that both daily BAI and daily GT began to rise sharply on January 19, after the outbreak, and reached a peak in a short period of time, then the high attention lasted approximately 10 days. Afterwards, both indexes have decreased because of the initial positive effect of epidemic control. It is worth mentioning that the daily GT rose again on February 20, because the epidemic began to spread widely in other countries. Our study showed that in the early stages of COVID-19, public attention increased as new cases were confirmed, however it diminished as the cure rate rose. This suggests a rapidly spreading epidemic would promptly draw public attention which would decrease when its threat decreased. Therefore, it is necessary for government to take appropriate measures and provide more information to address public's concerns as early as possible by monitoring the public reactions through the Internet and social media. Daily GT was directly proportional to the cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative cured cases, and cumulative death cases, but daily BAI was not. The reason for this phenomenon is that the early outbreak of COVID-19 was in China, so Chinese netizens can naturally learn about the early news of the epidemic more quickly than those from other countries, Figure 5 (A) The daily BAI for keyword \"Coronavirus\" compared with new death cases from January 10 to February 29, 2020.

According to our research, the number of rumors is positively correlated with new confirmed cases and new death cases, which also has the same trend with the growth of daily BAI. Furthermore, the emergence of breaking news can often make the index of rumors reach a peak. This indicates that uncertainty and severity of the new epidemic are major factors in encouraging rumors to which public attention is easily attracted. Moreover, Internet and social media have become a vehicle of transmitting rumors. The vast majority of rumors that we collected came from social media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo. It suggests that social media was a two-edged sword. Although it can spread rumors, it was also a convenient tool for those refuting false messages if authoritative information could be released in time. In addition, if government invited experts who have received public attention to clarify misinformation during the early period of the outbreak, it would effectively help to dispel unnecessary panic and prevent the spread of rumors.",

Traditional epidemic monitoring mainly relies on data provided by hospitals, medical institutions, and Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) at different levels. [50] [51] [52] Yet, this monitoring system has some deficiencies. Firstly, the relevant data is collected and processed by each unit level by level, which may lead to a loss of important information during the process and a delay in acquiring analysis results. Secondly, a traditional monitoring method consumes a lot of manpower and resources, however the data is rarely published and made available to the public. 19, 24 Internet monitoring has largely improved the data acquisition process and can overcome these deficiencies from three perspectives. First, billions of netizens learn about the latest epidemic situation through the Internet. Data collected in this way can represent the attention of most people. Besides, the search trends were generated based on the daily search behaviors of the public, which can automatically record the public attention. Compared with traditional methods such as epidemiological surveys and telephone interviews, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] this data acquisition method can significantly reduce the time and efforts. Moreover, the data is always shared, and everyone can download it for free, which can maximize savings.",
