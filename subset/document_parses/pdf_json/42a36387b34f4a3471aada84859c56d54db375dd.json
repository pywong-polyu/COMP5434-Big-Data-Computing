Using about 30,000 observations from a large-scale representative survey from 23 European countries, this study provides two major findings. First, important policy-relevant climate change cognitions do not only differ by individuals' ideological identity (left versus right) but-independently-by their moral identity, that is, the pattern of endorsement of the moral foundations: Care, Fairness, Liberty, Loyalty, Authority, and Purity/Sanctity. In particular, controlling for ideological position, the cognitions that the world climate is changing, that climate change is human-made, and that climate change impacts are bad are significantly negatively related to stronger endorsement of the Authority and Sanctity foundations while being positively related to stronger endorsement of the Loyalty and Fairness foundations. Second, not only the ideology-related cognitive divide but the morality-related divide is larger in individuals with tertiary education, consistent with the idea that individuals with greater science literacy and numeracy use these skills to adjust their cognitions to their group identity. The finding that better education may amplify rather than attenuate the ideology and morality dependence of decision-relevant climate change cognitions sheds doubt on the proposition that better education unambiguously furthers the prospects for climate change mitigation.",

Second, even among those who are aware of the problem, a lack of knowledge about the cause and extent of climate change may lead to ignorance about which (individual and collective) actions are available and how effective different actions are. Sound knowledge about climate change and the options for ameliorating is thus an important precondition for effective climate policy.",

Indeed, educational attainment has long been identified as a consistent predictor of environment-related perceptions and concerns (e.g., Dietz et al. 1998) , and a meta-analysis of close to 200 polls and academic studies has revealed that education is one of the strongest correlates of the belief in climate change (Hornsey et al. 2016) . More recently, cognitions about the existence, origins, and impacts of climate change have been found to display a strong left-right ideological divide in many countries, with adherents to the left expressing greater belief in and concern about climate change than adherents to the right (e.g., McCright et al. 2015 , McCright et al. 2016 , Hornsey et al. 2016 , Hornsey et al. 2018 .

Specifically, individuals hold stronger beliefs that climate change has bad impacts the more they endorse the moral values of Fairness and Liberty (universalist values) and the less they endorse Authority and Sanctity (parochial values). Importantly, these relationships hold even when controlling for ideological identity (position on the left-right scale). 3 It should be noted that much of the work on ideologydependent cognition, motivated reasoning, and the moderating role of science literacy and numeracy focused on North American populations (e.g., Kahan et al. 2007 , Kahan et al. 2017a . Analyzing data from 25 developed and emerging countries, Hornsey et al. (2018) found relationships between climate skepticism and 5 ideological variables to be statistically significantly stronger in the USA than in the pool of 24 other nations. The relationships also tended to be stronger in 5 English speaking nations (other than the USA) than in the 24-nation pool, but not significantly so. At the level of individual countries, the relationship between climate skepticism and more right-leaning ideology was positive in 19 out of 25 countries (significantly so in 7 countries). While their does not seem to be evidence on the moderating role of science literacy and numeracy in the cognition-ideology relationship outside the USA (Kahan et al. 2017a) , Czarnek et al. (2020) found a significant moderating role of the related notion of educational attainment in a set of 22 European countries. With respect to the relationship between climate change cognitions and moral identity, a moderating role for science literacy and numeracy or education has not been studied as yet.",

First, it extends the evidence on the ideology-cognition-ability relationship (Kahan et al. 2017a ) from a small US sample to a large representative European sample. 4 Second, in focusing on the morality-cognition nexus, it studies a larger set of climate change cognitions than previously considered (Welsch 2021) . Third, using educational attainment as a measure of cognitive ability, it studies for the first time the role of cognitive ability as a potential moderator of the morality-cognition relationship.

Similar to the literature on the role of science literacy, the paper finds that the ideology dependence of the cognitions studied is significantly stronger in individuals with a tertiary education (that is, a bachelor degree or higher). In addition to the ideology-cognition relationships, 9 of the 24 morality-cognition relationships are also significantly stronger in individuals with tertiary education. In particular, the cognitions that climate change is human-made and that climate change impacts are bad are more morality dependent in individuals with better education than in less educated people. In contrast to the latter cognitions, the belief that the climate is changing is-on balance-less morality dependent in better educated than in less well educated people. The level of education per se is positively related to the cognitions that the climate is changing, that climate change is human-made, and that climate change impacts are bad. The role of better education in shaping climate change cognitions is thus ambiguous as better education per se improves climate knowledge but tends to amplify biases in the relevant cognitions that result from identity-protective information selection and processing.",

(2020) for a similar analysis. 5 To put this work in perspective, it should be noted that the countries included in the sample, despite being European, show considerable cultural differences. With respect to political culture, it has typically been found that individuals in former communist countries show lower levels of environmental concern decades after the collapse of communism (for a discussion see, e.g., Welsch and K\u00fchling 2017) . In addition, the more general hypothesis that individuals living in a common cultural area-the Nordic, West European, East European, or Mediterranean countries-show more similar environmental attitudes was studied but failed to find support (Welsch and K\u00fchling 2017) . Rather, this study found countries' geographic proximity, neighborhood (common border), and common membership in the European Union to be significant predictors of more similar environmental attitudes. These aspects of political and cultural geography are outside the scope of this paper.",

The ESS items used to measure endorsement of Care, Fairness, Liberty, Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity do not explicitly refer to moral foundations theory. Rather, the correspondence of the survey items to the moral foundations relies on the formulations used in the survey. Welsch (2020) shows that the moral foundations proxied this way have very similar properties (correlations with each other and with sociodemographic variables) as variables obtained from the \"Moral Foundations Questionnaire\" (Graham et al. 2011) . It may also be noted that some of the survey questions explicitly involve a differentiation between individual-focused (universalistic) and group-focused (parochial) morality. This is most salient with respect to Fairness and Loyalty, the former referring to \"every person in the world,\" whereas the latter refers to \"people close.\"",

The cognitions that the world climate is changing, that climate change is human-made, and that climate change impacts are bad are positively correlated with the level of education, but the correlations are very low (r < 0.1). These cognitions are negatively correlated with a more rightleaning ideological position (r = \u22120.098 to \u22120.127) and with the moral foundations of Authority and Sanctity while being positively correlated with the moral foundations of Care, Fairness, Liberty, and Loyalty. Some of these positive correlations are of a similar or larger magnitude than the negative ideologycognition correlations. The correlations between right-leaning ideological position and endorsement of the moral foundations are very low (r < 0.1) except for Fairness (r = \u22120.145) and Sanctity (r = 0.132). Ideological position and moral identity are thus fairly independent of each other. 6 The correlations suggest that ideological position and endorsement of the moral foundations may play independent roles as predictors of climate change cognitions, if any. This expectation was checked by means of multivariate regression analysis. Table 1 displays the results of multivariate regressions with several climate change cognitions as the dependent variables: the beliefs that the world climate is changing, that climate change is human-made, that climate change impacts are bad, and that individual mitigation behaviors are effective. As seen in the first row, all four beliefs are significantly negatively related to a more right-leaning ideological position. In addition, as shown by the interaction terms between ideological position and tertiary education, the negative ideology-cognition relationships are significantly stronger in individuals with tertiary education (bachelor degree or higher). By contrast, tertiary education per se is significantly positively related to the beliefs that the world climate is changing, that climate change is human-made, and that climate change impacts are bad, while not being significantly related to the belief that individual mitigation behaviors are effective. 7 Turning to the moral foundations, the following findings stand out: 6 Haidt (2012) suggests that left-leaning (liberal) and right-leaning (conservative) individuals endorse the universalist moral foundations in similar ways but liberals endorse the parochial moral foundations less than do conservatives. 7 The control variables female (dummy variable) and income attract significantly positive coefficients; age and poor health attract significantly negative coefficients.

Table 2 displays the sum across universalist and parochial moral foundations, respectively, of the significant coefficients from Table 1 . The overall messages are (a) that endorsement of the universalist foundations is positively associated with stronger climate change beliefs, particularly so in individuals with tertiary education and (b) that endorsement of the parochial foundations is almost unrelated with stronger climate change beliefs in individuals without tertiary education and slightly negatively associated with such beliefs in individuals with tertiary education.",

In particular, the cognitions that the world climate is changing, that climate change is human-made, and that climate change impacts are bad are significantly negatively related to stronger endorsement of the Authority and Sanctity foundations while being positively related to stronger endorsement of the Loyalty and Fairness foundations. In addition, the cognition that individual mitigation behavior is effective is positively related to Fairness (as well as Care). These findings corroborate the evidence presented by Welsch (2021) and extend it to a larger set of climate change cognitions and to a larger set of countries. 9 Similar to previous research that found the ideological divide in climate change cognitions to be larger in individuals with greater science literacy and numeracy (e.g., Kahan et al. 2012) , the present analysis found the ideology-cognition relationship to be stronger in individuals with better (that is, tertiary) education. While this is consistent with previous findings (e.g., Czarnek et al. 2020) , a novel contribution of the present work is that not only the ideology-cognition relationship but the morality-cognition relationships are stronger in better educated people. This applies in particular to the cognitions that climate change is human-made and that climate change impacts are bad. These latter beliefs are not only negatively related to stronger endorsement of Authority and Sanctity, but the negative relationships are stronger in individuals with tertiary education, With respect to the morality-cognition relationships, two comments are in order. First, the relationships tend to differ between universalist morality (positive relationship to proclimate cognitions) and parochial morality (negative relationship to pro-climate cognitions). However, the dichotomy is not clear-cut. In particular, while the parochial values Authority and Sanctity are negatively related to the beliefs of existence, human origin, and negative impact of climate change, the parochial value Loyalty is positively related to those beliefs.",

They may indicate how education affects the ideology-cognition and morality-cognition relationships, or how ideology and morality, respectively, affect the education-cognition relationship.

The argument put forward to support this view relies on the risk of losing the psychic and material support of one's peers in case of dissenting beliefs on climate change: Since a single person cannot meaningfully affect the climate, the costs of losing peer support exceed the benefit from engaging in mitigation behavior in accordance with insights from climate science.

By loosening the tie between cognitions and group identity, it may be possible for pro-climate cognitions and behavioral norms to spread between groups, eventually affecting behaviors on large scales. Examples such as the abandonment of foot-binding in China, changed fertility norms, changed norms for indoor smoking, and the declining popularity of animal foods in some western societies (Nyborg et al. 2016) suggest that similarly lowering the identity relevance of beliefs and norms may also be possible in Appendix   Table 3 Correlations * p < 0.05, ** p ",
