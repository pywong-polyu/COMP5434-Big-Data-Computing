            "text": "Ocular chemical burns are potentially blinding ocular injuries and require urgent management. Amniotic membrane (AM) transplantation is an effective surgical treatment, one of the reasons is because AM is a rich source of growth factors that can promote epithelialization and wound healing. However, growth factors will be gradually lost and insufficient after preparation process and long-time storage, leading to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. Herein, we present a modified AM (AM-HEP) for the supplement and sustained release of growth factor by surface grafting heparin for treatment of ocular chemical burns. Heparin grafting rate and stability, microstructure, physical property, and sustained release of epithelial growth factor (EGF) of AM-HEP were characterized. Biocompatibility and ability to promote corneal epithelial cell growth and migration were evaluated and compared with a biological amnion, which is available on the market in vitro. The therapeutic effects of AM-HEP combined with EGF (AM-HEP@EGF) in vivo had been evaluated in a model of mouse corneal alkali burn. The results indicated that heparin was introduced into AM and maintain stability over 3 weeks at 37 \u2022 C. The modification process of AM-HEP did not affect microstructure and physical property after comparing with non-modified AM. EGF could be combined quickly and effectively with AM-HEP; the sustained release could last for more than 14 days. AM-HEP@EGF could significantly promote corneal epithelial cell growth and migration, compared with non-modified AM and control group. Faster corneal epithelialization was observed with the transplantation of AM-HEP@EGF in vivo, compared with the untreated control group. The corneas in the AM-HEP@EGF group have less inflammation and were more transparent than those in the control group. The results from in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that AM-HEP@EGF could significantly enhance the therapeutic effects. Taken together, AM-HEP@EGF is exhibited to be a potent clinical application in corneal alkali burns through accelerating corneal epithelial wound healing.",

            "text": "Cornea is located on the outermost layer of the eye and is easily injured (Meek and Knupp, 2015) . Ocular chemical burns are responsible for 11.5-22.1% of ocular injuries (Sharma et al., 2018) . Alkali burn is the most common among chemical burns and considered as ophthalmic emergencies, which require urgent management (Reim et al., 2001; Welling et al., 2016) . Amniotic membrane (AM) is the innermost layer of the placenta and protects a fetus during pregnancy. It was reported that AM was first used to treat ocular burns in 1940, and it was not widely used until people began to use it for conjunctival tissue replacement in the 1990s (Dua et al., 2004) . Currently, AM products were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (e.g., Prokera, Amniograft and Ruiji biological AM) that are clinically used to help the ocular surface reconstruction due to its unique biological characteristics (Palchesko et al., 2018) . AM transplantation is an effective medical therapy for corneal alkali burn due to its outstanding biological performances (Maharajan et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2013) . As a temporary covering material, AM can promote corneal epithelialization and inhibit inflammation (Kobayashi et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2015) . To some extent, it alleviates the shortage of corneal donors and has become a usual biomaterial in ophthalmic surgery (Fan et al., 2016) . The biological performances of AM are due to various growth factors from amniotic epithelial cells (Brodovsky et al., 2000; Sridhar et al., 2000; Joseph et al., 2001) . However, growth factors will be gradually lost and insufficient and cannot maintain the activity after AM preparation process and long-time storage (Pereira et al., 2016) . Usually, AM needs pretreatment before use. These processes may include inactivation of bacteria and viruses, freeze drying, etc. Besides pretreatment, AM may also need to be stored and transported if it is not used immediately or used in another place. At present, the clinical use of AM is mainly divided into three types: fresh AM, freeze-dried AM, and acellular AM (Sharma et al., 2016; Bandeira et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019; Schuerch et al., 2020) . The advantage of fresh AM is the growth factors is abundant, so it has more significant effects in anti-inflammatory, inhibiting scar formation, inhibiting neovascularization, and promoting epithelial cell proliferation (Chugh et al., 2015; Sahay et al., 2019) . However, its storage time is short, which limits the production and clinical application. Freeze-dried AM can be stored for a longer period at room temperature. Compared with fresh AM, this method prolongs the preservation time, but the growth factors in freeze-dried AM still have a great loss (Paolin et al., 2016) . In addition, freeze-drying has potential damage to the microstructure of AM, affecting the mechanical strength after rehydration and limiting some applications that require high mechanical strength (Paolin et al., 2016; Palchesko et al., 2018) . The main component of acellular AM is collagen, and the content of growth factors in the matrix layer is low (Lai and Ma, 2013) . Therefore, acellular AM is more often used as a carrier for cell culture (Salah et al., 2018; Abazari et al., 2019) . The existing methods for preparing AM cannot balance storage time and activity. Whether it is stored in a dry state or in a wet state, it is difficult to keep growth factors active for a long time in the same storage environment as AM. These may lead to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects.",

            "text": "Growth factors are important regulators that stimulate cell growth, proliferation, migration, differentiation, adhesion, and ECM deposition in wound healing (Lu et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2010) . Epithelial growth factor (EGF) is a well-known potent mitogen and major pathway that initiates migration and proliferation for corneal epithelial cells (Noh, 2012; Wang et al., 2013) . It plays a key role in epithelial reconstruction after ocular surface injury. Hence, EGF is considered beneficial to the recovery of corneal alkali burn. Supplementing growth factor becomes an effective method to solve this problem. AM has abundant collagen fibers and reticular fibers, which can load and release drug or growth factors (Di Lullo et al., 2001; Denis et al., 2005) . Therefore, growth factors can be supplemented by soaking AM in solution before use to adsorb growth factor. However, AM has limited loading capacity for growth factors, which cannot meet the demands for treatment. A more efficient way to load growth factors is a desiderate problem needed to be solved. Heparin is a sulfated mucopolysaccharide, a natural anticoagulant substance in animals, and has excellent cell compatibility (Aslani et al., 2020) . Heparin has been widely used in clinic such as thromboembolic diseases, hemodialysis, and cardiovascular surgery (Ayerst et al., 2017; Aslani et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) . With the advancement of pharmacology and clinical medicine, the application of heparin continues to expand (Chistolini et al., 2020) . The negatively charged sulfate groups of heparin can bind and release various positively charged growth factors such as transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Jo et al., 2015) . It may be an effective way to supplement growth factors. But few researchers have focused on heparin-modified AM combined with growth factors for corneal alkali burn treatment.",

Heparin content of AM-HEP was much higher after chemical modification than that of AM, which was only soaked in heparin solution for the same time and non-modified AM (Figure 2C) . To further determine the graft was effective, FITR of AM after a different modification time proceeded (Figure 2D) . With the increase in modification time, absorption at 1,035 cm \u22121 [v(C-O)] and that at 1,120 cm \u22121 (SO 4 ) were obviously increased. This is because introduction of heparin brought more C-O stretching and sulfate radical. These results indicated heparin was successfully grafted onto AM and in a time-dependent manner. Then heparin graft stability was detected under different temperature ( Figure 2E) . The results showed that lower storage temperature (4 \u2022 C) was a benefit to keep the heparin content. Although high environment temperature could lead to more heparin lost, approximately only 15% heparin was released from AM-HEP under body temperature (37 \u2022 C) at 21 days.

This is because although it has been used clinically, AM has some limitations: it lacks transparency and does not have good mechanical strength. Besides, fresh AM cannot be used immediately because of the risk of carrying bacteria and viruses. From raw materials to products, freeze-drying, cobalt-60 irradiation, and other treatment processes are required, which may reduce its growth factor content, biological activity, and therapeutic effects. Meanwhile, storage conditions and time will also affect the content of growth factors on AM. Considering that the growth factors of the AM are difficult to be stored together with AM for a long time, the most direct way to increase the growth factor content of AM is to supplement the growth factors before use. In this study, we prepared AM-HEP for the supplement and sustained release of growth factor by surface grafting heparin for treatment of ocular chemical burns.",

Therefore, after verifying that heparin was successfully grafted onto the surface of the AM (Figure 2) , we evaluated the performance and structure of the AM before and after modification (Figure 3) . The heparin-modified AM is dehydrated. Since its main component is collagen and dry, it is conducive to its long-term storage and does not require strict low-temperature storage. After soaking, AM-HEP can quickly absorb water and return to the wet state. The appearance is consistent with that before modification, which is easy to use, and its light transmittance is not significantly different from that before modification. Because of the cross-linking effect of EDC/NHS, not only heparin is grafted to the surface of AM, but also the collagen of the AM can be cross-linked (Griffith et al., 1999; Vashist, 2012) . Therefore, the mechanical strength of AM-HEP after rehydration is improved. The higher mechanical strength increases the operability of AM-HEP during use, which is a beneficial change (Long et al., 2014; Majumdar et al., 2018) . At the same time, cross-linking will result in a tighter structure of collagen fibers, so the water content of AM-HEP has decreased (85%), but AM-HEP is still a material with a high water content. The water content of cornea is about 80%, so AM-HEP will not cause dryness and discomfort on the ocular surface (Patel et al., 2008) . The microstructure of the material usually affects the performance of the material. Therefore, we observed the upper and lower surfaces of the modified AM. AM-HEP maintained the natural structure of AM. The collagen fibers and the unique D-period of collagen are clearly visible (Panwar et al., 2018) . It showed that the modification process would not negatively affect the structure and performance of AM, and the higher mechanical strength and the introduction of heparin brought advantages to AM-HEP.",

From the results, AM-HEP can not only quickly absorb water, but also quickly adsorb EGF and achieve EGF sustained release in vitro (Figure 4) . After confirming that the modified AM is not toxic to cells (Figure 5) , in order to verify the biological activity of EGF released by AM-HEP@EGF, we coculture AM-HEP@EGF with CECs to observe the proliferation and migration of CECs (Figures 6, 7) . We also set a commercialized BAM group for comparison. We observed that the cells cocultured with BAM and AM-HEP@EGF proliferate faster and can significantly promote cell migration under serum-free conditions. From the product information of the commercial BAM, we know that its EGF content is about 15 ng/g, which is lower than the EGF content of AM-HEP@EGF. This should be the reason of the fastest proliferation and migration ability of CECs, which were cocultured with AM-HEP@EGF. These results indicate that EGF released by AM-HEP@EGF can maintain function and activity and promote cell proliferation and migration. For the treatment of alkali burn, the proliferation and migration of epithelial cells affect the process of epithelialization, which is very necessary for the repair of ocular surface damage.",

This indicated EGF was released from AM-HEP@EGF and acted on the ocular. The cornea treated with AM-HEP@EGF had the best transparency and epithelialization among all the groups. Compared to the control group from 1 to 14 days, the mice treated with AM exhibited increased efficacy but not as effective as AM-HEP@EGF. This may be because the content of growth factor on AM decreased after preparation process and long-time storage and led to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects (Pereira et al., 2016) . Heparinization of AM can be an effective method to adsorb EGF and maintain the active of it. AM-HEP may also adsorb growth factors with positive charge such as VEGF, TGF\u03b2, and nerve growth factor and apply to other application of tissue repair. Inflammatory factors play an important role in the healing process of corneal alkali burn. Injured corneal epithelial cells and stromal cells can release inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 after corneal alkali burn (Sotozono et al., 1997) . The increase in these inflammatory factors may induce angiogenesis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and keratinocyte apoptosis. In the present study, although AM treatment after corneal alkali burn could down-regulate TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 to some extent, AM-HEP@EGF treatment after corneal alkali burn was observed to have a better effect of down-regulating compared to AM treatment. These results suggest that AM-HEP@EGF treatments exhibited better antiinflammatory effects compared to control and AM groups after corneal alkali burn.",

Faster corneal epithelialization was observed with the transplantation of AM-HEP@EGF in vivo. The corneas in the AM-HEP@EGF group have less inflammation and was more transparent than those in the control group. AM-HEP@EGF could significantly enhance the therapeutic effects. These results demonstrated that soaking heparinization AM into growth factor solution can be an effective method to supply growth factors to AM before use and solve the problem of insufficient growth factor content in AM after long-term storage.
