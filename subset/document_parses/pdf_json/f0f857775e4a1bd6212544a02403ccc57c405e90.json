Using a mathematical epidemiological model, we project that childhood vaccination carries minimal risk and yields modest public health benefits. These include large relative reductions in child morbidity and mortality, although the absolute reduction is small because these events are rare. Furthermore, the model predicts \"altruistic\" absolute reductions in adult cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. However, vaccinating children to benefit adults should be considered from an ethical as well as a public health perspective. From a global health perspective, an additional ethical consideration is the justice of giving priority to children in high-income settings at low risk of severe disease while vaccines have not been made available to vulnerable adults in lowincome settings.",

Early in the pandemic, a study in Switzerland from February to June 2020, demonstrated that the infection fatality rate for those over 65 years was 5.6 per 100. 2 This compared with a rate of 0.0016 per 100 in those aged 5-9 years and only 0.00032 per 100 for those aged 10-19 years. 2 Data from the USA show that over 19 months, there were 349 deaths in those aged 0-17 years from a total of 606,389 deaths. 3 Based on these figures, the chances of a child (<18 years old) dying from COVID-19 was ~ 2,500 times less than that of an older American (>65 years old). Clearly, early on in the pandemic, although children were dying of COVID-19, it was at a very low rate. On the other hand, the emergence of the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 delta variant has led to increased cases in children and there is increased recognition of paediatric morbidity associated with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Nonetheless, based on these figures, the benefits of vaccination are far greater for the elderly than for children, but there is a dynamic interplay of benefits and risks that needs to be considered.",

Even if ~10% of the population were to develop immunity as a result of natural infection, then still between 70-80% of the population will need to be vaccinated and non-transmitting. There will be a need to vaccinate children of all ages, as well as adults, to reach 70-80%. Furthermore, recent reports show that the risk of household transmission is reduced by only ~50% among vaccinated people who develop breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. 7 While herd immunity is unlikely to be attainable through vaccination, higher levels of immunity will reduce the spread. Combined with social distancing and wearing of masks, we will be able to control focal epidemics. 8 5 To hasten and enhance the development of herd immunity, vaccination of children 5-11 years of age may be contemplated (~10% of the entire population). However, vaccinating young children will have limited direct benefit to them as outlined above, but this population, by being immune will protect the older and more vulnerable, and in particular the non-vaccinated.",

The flow chart for this model is shown in Figure 1 . This model accounts for vital dynamics: births ( ); aging between strata ( ); and age-specific natural death rate ( ). The model includes the following infection parameters: standard incidence ratio ( ); contact rate based on published social contact matrices 9 ( ); age-specific relative infectiousness ( ); age-specific relative susceptibility to infection ( ); duration of infection (1/ ); and age-specific infection fatality rate ( ). The effect of vaccination was modelled as relative reduction in: infectiousness ( ); susceptibility to acquiring infection ( ); probability of hospitalization ( \u210e ); and mortality ( ). To model the changes in the contact rate due to public health measures, we used a \"social distancing\" parameter, , which varied from zero (complete lockdown) to 1 (complete mixing in the population), as described in a previous modelling study. 8 The mathematical properties of this model have been previously discussed. 10 Parameter estimates are shown in Table 1 . We used realistic estimates based on vital statistics in Australia and Alberta, as well as biological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.

The vaccine efficacy in preventing hospitalization from SARS-CoV-2 was 86% (95%CI 82%-88%) in a recent analysis by the US CDC. 12 With respect to mortality benefit of the vaccine, based on national surveillance data following a nationwide vaccination campaign in Israel, BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was 96.7% effective at preventing death from SARS-CoV-2 (95% CI 96.0-97.3%). 13 ",
