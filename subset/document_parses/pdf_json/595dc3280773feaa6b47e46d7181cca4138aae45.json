HIF-1 activity depends on the availability and activity of the subunit HIF-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) [10] . HIF-1\u03b1 is an important transcription factor implicated in ischemia-reperfusion brain injury [11, 12] . Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a well-characterized target gene of HIF-1\u03b1, can promote vascular permeability, disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and induce cerebral edema [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In addition, VEGF bound to VEGF receptor subtype 2 (VEGFR-2) and induced BBB disruption [16, [19] [20] [21] . Therefore, the HIF-1\u03b1/ VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway seems to be closely associated with ischemia-induced BBB breakdown and cerebral edema. Previous studies have shown that early inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF expression can attenuate neuronal deficits and cerebral edema caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury [12, 22] . We speculated that HTTM attenuates neurological dysfunction and that cerebral edema may inhibit the expression of components of the HIF-1\u03b1/ VEGF/VEGFR-2 axis in a pig model of global cerebral ischemia following CA and CPR.",

Twenty-four healthy male domestic Beijing Landrace piglets (12-14 weeks of age, 30.0 \u00b1 2.3 kg) were food restricted overnight and had free access to water. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) administered intramuscularly, followed by ear vein injection of propofol (2 mg/kg). Three percent sodium pentobarbital injections (8 mg/kg/h) together with fentanyl (5 \u03bcg/kg/h) was given to maintain sedation and analgesia. Pentobarbital was stopped at 18 h after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), followed by intravenous injection of propofol (0.4 mg/kg) when necessary. Before the assessment of neurological outcomes, anesthesia was performed using propofol because recovery from propofol anesthesia is more rapid and complete than recovery from sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia was evaluated based on heart rate, blood pressure, corneal and palpebral reflexes, and bispectral index (Aspect Medical, Newton, MA) [24] . The pigs were intubated and ventilated with a volume-controlled ventilator (Draeger, Evita4, Lubeck, Germany) with a tidal volume of 8 to 15 mL/kg, ventilation rate of 12 to 20 breaths per minute, peak flow of 40 L/min, inspiration-to-expiration ratio of 1:2, and FiO 2 of 0.21 to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2 ) between 35 and 45 mmHg. A standard lead II electrocardiogram was used to continuously monitor cardiac rhythm. A central venous catheter was inserted in the right internal jugular vein to measure central venous pressure (CVP) and to allow the administration of fluids and drugs. One 5-F thermistor-tipped arterial catheter was inserted into the femoral artery. The arterial and central venous catheters were connected to the PiCCO system (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) for continuous hemodynamic monitoring, including mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and discontinuous measurement of cardiac output (CO). Two femoral venous catheters were inserted to place a pacing catheter for the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and to place a central venous cooling catheter for intravascular cooling (Cool Gard XP; Alsius, Los Angeles, CA). One temperature-sensing Foley catheter was intubated into the bladder after fistulation to simultaneously measure the core temperature. All procedures were performed under standard sterile conditions. Room temperature was adjusted to 26\u02daC.",

After an eightminute nonintervention interval of VF, basic life support CPR was manually performed at a ratio of 30:2 (compression-to-ventilation) by the same CPR technician. External manual closed chest compression quality was continuously controlled using a HeartStart MRx Monitor/Defibrillator (M3535 A; Philips Medical Systems, Best, Holland) to maintain optimal compressions (rate of 100 \u00b1 5/min and depth of 50 \u00b1 1 mm with complete release). Ventilation was performed using a bag respirator with room air. After 2 min of CPR, defibrillation was attempted by the delivery of a single 120-J biphasic waveform electrical shock with a Smart Biphasic defibrillator (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA). If VF persisted, CPR was then resumed for 2 min, and 150 J was used for the second and all subsequent defibrillation attempts every two minutes. ROSC was defined as maintenance of systolic blood pressure > 60 mmHg, which was sustained continuously for at least 10 min. Mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen was provided after ROSC and continued until 30 min, after which room air was used. Since neurological function recovery is unlikely after 30 min of CA, resuscitation procedures were discontinued if the pigs had no ROSC within 30 min.",

Four animals that did not achieve ROSC were not included in the statistical analysis, as the goal was to study the protective mechanism of HTTM on postresuscitation brain injury at 24 h after ROSC. The remaining 16 ROSC animals were randomly divided into two groups: the normothermic targeted temperature management group (NTTM group, n = 8) and the hypothermic (33 \u00b0C) targeted temperature management group (HTTM group, n = 8) using the sealed envelope method. Piglets in the HTTM group were immediately cooled after ROSC using the intravascular cooling instrument. The bladder temperature was reduced to 33 \u00b0C within 4 h after ROSC [7] and remained at this temperature for 12 h, followed by gradual rewarming (0.5 \u00b0C/h) to 37 \u00b0C. During induction and maintenance of the target core temperature, the piglets received a continuous infusion of pancuronium (0.2 mg/kg/h) to prevent muscle movement and shivering. The target core temperature of 38 \u00b0C was maintained in NTTM and sham piglets using an electric fan and ice bags. The NTTM pigs were treated to the same as the HTTM pigs except for cooling. The resuscitated pigs received intensive care after ROSC. The animals received acetated Ringer's solution and glucose electrolyte solution to keep MAP above 50 mmHg and CVP above 8 mmHg. If this first step failed, additional norepinephrine was administered to keep MAP above 50 mmHg.",

Two previous studies [25, 26] demonstrated that the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 was upregulated early in the rat Fig. 3 HIF-1\u03b1 , VEGF, and VEGFR-2 mRNA expression in cortical tissues 24 h after ROSC. The mRNA expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 in cortical tissue were significantly increased in the NTTM group compared with the sham group 24 h after ROSC. Compared to the NTTM group, the HTTM group had significantly decreased mRNA expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 at 24 h after ROSC. The mRNA levels were quantified via RT-PCR in the sham (n = 4), NTTM (n = 6), and HTTM (n = 8) groups, and the results are presented as the mean fold changes \u00b1 standard deviations relative to the sham group. Sham sham control group, NTTM normothermic targeted temperature management group, HTTM hypothermic targeted temperature management group. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 versus the sham group; # p < 0.05; ## p < 0.01 versus the NTTM group Fig. 4 HIF-1\u03b1 , VEGF, and VEGFR-2 protein expression in cortical tissues 24 h after ROSC. The protein expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 in cortical tissue were significantly increased in the NTTM group compared with the sham group 24 h after ROSC. Compared to the NTTM group, the HTTM group had significantly decreased protein expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 at 24 h after ROSC. The protein concentrations of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 in the cerebral cortices of the sham (n = 4), NTTM (n = 6), and HTTM (n = 8) groups were measured 24 h after ROSC using Western blots.

In addition, the expression of VEGF was significantly increased in rat brain cortical, brainstem and hippocampal tissues 24 and 48 h after CA and resuscitation [27] . In a clinical setting, Xiu et al. [28] reported that serum HIF-1\u03b1 levels increased in patients soon after acute focal cerebral ischemia and might serve as a marker of the severity of neuronal damage and the degree of recovery in ischemic diseases; the higher level of HIF-1\u03b1 was, the worse the outcome tended to be. Additionally, serum VEGF concentrations are higher in patients with focal cerebral ischemia than in controls [29, 30] , and high serum VEGF levels were associated with unfavorable outcomes [30] . In a study by Omar et al. [31] , patients with higher VEGF levels tended to have microcirculatory dysfunction after cardiac arrest. In our present study, we employed a pig model and demonstrated that the ischemia/reperfusion injury induced by CA and resuscitation led to the rapid and significant accumulation of serum HIF-1\u03b1 as early as 0.5 h after ROSC in the NTTM group, to the accumulation of serum VEGF and VEGFR-2 at 6 h, which persisted for at least 24 h, and to the accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 24 h after resuscitation in the brain cortex.",

A previous report showed that neuron-specific knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 increases hypoxia-ischemia brain damage and reduces the survival of mice subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia [32] . In contrast, brain-specific knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 attenuates brain ischemic injury in the global brain ischemia model of knockout mice [33] . Furthermore, biphasic expression of HIF-1\u03b1 was observed first at 4 to 8 h and then 2 to 6 days after cerebral ischemia [32, 34] . Early-phase expression increased apoptosis, but late-phase expression facilitated cell survival, and only early selective inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 expression provided a neuroprotective effect after cerebral ischemia [34] . In our present study, HTTM was induced immediately and after ROSC, which significantly decreased serum HIF-1\u03b1 values as early as 6 h after ROSC and decreased brain cortical expression of HIF-1\u03b1 24 h after ROSC in this porcine model, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of HTTM might involve early inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1.",

            "text": "HIF-1\u03b1 regulates many hypoxic effects through mechanisms dependent and independent of its target genes. HIF-1\u03b1 is a likely mediator of BBB disruption [35] , and HIF-1\u03b1 has been reported to increase BBB permeability mainly through the disruption of brain microvascular endothelial tight junctions [27] . VEGF is a potent growth factor that plays diverse roles in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, in addition to carrying out neuroprotective and trophic functions in the central nervous system [36] . Previous evidence [37, 38] has demonstrated that VEGF plays a beneficial role after focal cerebral ischemia, potentially decreasing infarct size and improving neurological outcomes, through either neuroprotection or the induction of angiogenesis. In addition, HIF-1\u03b1 plays a complex role in cerebral ischemia. Zhang et al. [18] have reported that the effects vary over time. Administration of exogenous VEGF promotes angiogenesis in the late (48 h) stage of brain ischemia, improving neurological recovery, whereas early postischemic (1 h) administration of VEGF exacerbates BBB leakage and the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. VEGF is one of the bestknown HIF-1\u03b1 target genes and is also known as vascular permeability factor because of its ability to induce vascular leaks [39] . Thus, one mechanism of HIF-1\u03b1-mediated BBB disruption is VEGF upregulation. VEGF increased BBB permeability by changing the redistribution and downregulating the expression of TJ proteins [21, 40, 41] . It has been reported that inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation and the expression of its downstream target VEGF protected the BBB against ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury [42] . VEGF plays an important role in early BBB disruption and vascular leakage, leading to subsequent edema after ischemic brain injury [11, 17, 18, 27] . Indeed, early administration of VEGF increases BBB permeability and worsens neurological outcome in the ischemic brain [18] . Similarly, inhibition of endogenous VEGF in the acute phase attenuates ischemia-induced BBB permeability and brain edema [42, 43] . In addition, VEGF increases vessel permeability through VEGFR-2 activation [21] . As stated above, the HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway is likely associated with BBB disruption and cerebral edema. A study on rats by Shen et al. showed that pretreatment with the HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor YC-1 alleviated BBB damage after 2 h of ischemia, accompanied by the significant inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 upregulation and by the downregulation of VEGF expression [44] . In our previous study [7] , mild hypothermia attenuated CA-and resuscitation-induced early BBB permeability and brain edema by attenuating tight and adherence junction breakdown, but the precise mechanisms of this phenomenon remain to be elucidated. In the present study on pigs, HTTM was associated with an improved neurological outcome and decreased brain edema, which is consistent with previous studies [7, 9, 23] . Furthermore, we found that the HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF/ VEGFR-2 system was rapidly activated by ischemiareperfusion injury after ROSC, which suggested that the activation of HIF-1\u03b1 likely plays a detrimental role in the enhancement of resuscitated BBB disruption and early brain edema formation via VEGF-VEGFR-2 mechanisms. Interestingly, HTTM may reduce the early expression of HIF-1\u03b1, leading to a decrease in the expression of its downstream effector VEGF-VEGFR-2. Therefore, based on the above findings, we suggest that the effect of HTTM on the HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF/VEGFR-2 system may be partly associated with the preservation of BBB integrity, reducing the increase in CA-evoked early cerebral edema and improving neurological damage after CA and CPR. To the best of our knowledge, the contribution of HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF/VEGFR-2 activation to human brain injury after CA remains largely unknown, and our present study suggests that the modulation of HIF-1\u03b1/ VEGF/VEGFR-2 axis activity may be a potential therapeutic target to reduce brain damage following CA and CPR in the acute phase.",

First, young healthy male swine models of CPR do not fully reflect the situation in human patients with underlying diseases, especially heart diseases. Second, neurons in the hippocampus were most sensitive to global ischemic injury; however, our study focused on the cerebral cortex, as it is known to play a central role in the recovery of function after CA. Third, propofol was used to induce and maintain sedation, which has been reported to have some neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic/ reperfusion injury [49] . Nevertheless, there were no significant differences observed in the amounts of anesthetics among the three groups. Finally, due to the use of an intravascular cooling treatment, it was not possible to blind the investigators to the animals' temperature condition throughout the experiment; however, two people who were blinded to the treatment assignments analyzed the serum and tissue samples and carried out all the neurological evaluations.",

Two resuscitated pigs in the NTTM group (25%) did not survive for 24 h, and all resuscitated pigs in the HTTM group survived for 24 h, but the difference in survival between the two groups did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.47). The NDS score was higher (both p < 0.01) in the NTTH group[150.0 (70.0, 177.5), n = 8] and in the HTTH group [237.5 (190.0, 371.3), n = 8] than in the sham group [0 (0, 0), n = 4] 24 h after ROSC. However, the NDS score of the HTTM group was significantly better than that of the NTTM group (p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in MAP or HR between the NTTM and HTTM groups at 0.5 h [MAP, 89.5 \u00b1 9.0 vs. 90.0 \u00b1 11.3, p = 0.92; HR, 100.0 \u00b1 8.0 vs. 105.4 \u00b1 7.9, p = 0.19], 6 h [MAP, 91.3 \u00b1 8.5 vs. 91.0 \u00b1 7.6, p = 0.95; HR, 111.0 \u00b1 12.0 vs. 109.9 \u00b1 9.8, p = 0.83], 12 h [MAP, 89.0 \u00b1 10.0 vs.87.3 \u00b1 11.3 p = 0.20; HR, 114.7 \u00b1 11.5 vs. 118.4 \u00b1 16.1, p = 0.64], or 24 h [MAP, 90.7 \u00b1 8.2 vs. 89.0 \u00b1 10.3, p = 0.50; HR, 107.8 \u00b1 12.2 vs. 108.1 \u00b1 10.5, p = 0.96] after ROSC. There were no significant differences in CO between the NTTM and HTTM groups at 0.5 h [3.3 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 3.3 \u00b1 0.4, p = 0.77], 6 h [3.1 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 0.3, p = 0.22], or 24 h [3.8 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 3.5 \u00b1 0.4, p = 0.21] after ROSC. At 12 h after ROSC, CO was significantly lower in the HTTM group than in the NTTM group [3.0 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 3.5 \u00b1 0.4, p = 0.03]. Cumulative crystalloid fluid load and cumulative norepinephrine doses were not significantly different between groups 24 h after ROSC [fluid load (p = 0.60), norepinephrine doses (p = 0.84); NTTM: 4161 \u00b1 650 mL, 4.6 \u00b1 1.3 mg; HTTM: 3957 \u00b1 720 mL, 4.5 \u00b1 1.1 mg].",
