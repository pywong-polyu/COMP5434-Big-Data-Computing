Either whole blood or apheresis donations were obtained, the latter yielding higher numbers of units per donor per collection and more frequent collections. The NorthShore University HealthSystem blood donor center purchased 2 Alyx (Fresenius Kabi) apheresis plasma collection devices and quickly implemented them in order to collect COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Apheresis-experienced and inexperienced phlebotomists operated the instruments. Donors were collected >14 days from symptom resolution and all donors were negative by SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab. Both internal metrics of performance as well as a post donation survey were used to evaluate the feasibility implementing this collection program. During the first 100 days of the collection program, 650 plasma units were collected. In particular, during the first week of the program, 38 units were collected and distributed to hospitals under the emergency investigational new drug and expanded access program. Fifty-one donors (15%) were deferred due to vital signs out of range or donor screening questions. Thirty-one donors (10%) were deferred due to positive nasopharyngeal swab. Lower than target yield occurred in 16.6% of collections due to donor reactions or flow errors. Donors rated the overall program lower, but not the staff, when they reported symptoms related to collection. In conclusion, a hospital-based apheresis convalescent plasma collection program can be rapidly implemented. Donor reaction rates and vein infiltration rates should be carefully monitored for each phlebotomist.",

By August 2020, CP was given an emergency use authorization by the FDA, likely increasing the demand for CP until a superior alternative therapy for COVID-19 is approved. 2 Both national blood collection centers and hospital blood banks have begun widespread local collection CP from donors, either by whole blood or apheresis collections. 3 Whole blood collections do not require collection instrument purchase; however, whole blood donations only yield 1 unit of CP (vs up to 4 units per collection by apheresis) and whole blood donors cannot donate more often than every 8 weeks (vs every 4 weeks or less for plasma donors). 4 On the other hand, venous access issues are more common, the cost is higher, and the collection time is longer for apheresis collections. 5 Collection of plasma by apheresis can be performed either as part of an apheresis platelet collection as concurrent plasma, or as a stand-alone plasma collection procedure. There are 2 clear advantages to a stand-alone apheresis plasma collection. First, a limited amount of plasma can be collected by apheresis during a platelet collection (typically 1 unit, compared with up to 4 units per dedicated plasma collection). Second, the kit cost for apheresis plasma collections is lower than an apheresis platelet collection kit. On the other hand, dedicated apheresis plasma collection procedures cannot be performed using a platelet collection device, which are often already in-use at hospital-based blood centers.",

Similar precautions were taken at other blood centers, however it remains unclear whether this approach is useful for individuals beyond 14 days from symptom resolution, to prevent viral transmission in the donor room or via the blood product. 6 Donors who tested negative for the virus were immediately invited to the donor room to complete a donor history screening form, vital sign check, and collection.",

Positive NP swab was a reason for deferral for 10% of donors during their initial visit, with the majority of those individuals presenting again at >28 days from resolution of symptoms; 15 male donors who had been previously transfused and 20 female donors were found to be positive for anti-HLA antibodies after collection.

Whether a donor had previously donated blood did not correlate with their rating of the overall CP collection experience or the donor room staff, however donors who had symptoms related to collection tended to rate the overall collection experience lower, P \u00bc .0005 (see Table 4 ). For donors undergoing apheresis performed by phlebotomy staff without prior apheresis collection experience, there was a slightly lower overall collection experience rating that was not statistically significant (P \u00bc .17).",

NorthShore is a 738 bed community hospital system in a metropolitan setting. Similar rapid implementation programs have been reported during prior epidemics, including Ebola. 7 This CP collection program succeeded in collected an ample supply of plasma during the spring of 2020, when national availability of CP was limited. Assuming an adequate supply of materials, it is likely that hospital-based CP collection program will continue to benefit organizations by minimizing the impact national CP shortages. In addition, having an in-house collection program shortened the time between CP order and transfusion, since the hospital itself maintained a standing inventory, that is, immediately available. Finally, NorthShore became a site for outpatient COVID-19 early disease treatment and prophylaxis trials using CP collected in this program. If these trials (or trials like them) prove that CP is useful to treat early COVID-19 disease or as a prophylaxis, it is likely that the demand for CP will increase markedly along with the value of a hospital-based collection program.",
