Research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has been conducted worldwide in the last few months. It has however overlooked gender diversity. The aim of our study was to explore social and health-related factors associated with mental health (anxiety and depression) among people who do not identify with the man/woman binomial during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. A cross-sectional study with online survey, aimed at the population residing in Spain during lockdown, was conducted. Data were collected between the 8 th of April until the 28 th of May 2020, the time period when lockdown was implemented in Spain. Mental health was measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale for anxiety, and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression. The survey included the question: Which sex do you identify with? The options \"Man\", \"Woman\", \"Non-binary\" and \"I do not identify\" were given. People who answered one of the last two options were selected for this study. Multivariate regression logistic models were constructed to evaluate the associations between sociodemographic, social and healthrelated factors, anxiety and depression. Out of the 7125 people who participated in the survey, 72 (1%) identified as non-binary or to not identify with another category. People who do not identify with the man/woman binomial (non-binary/I do not identify) presented high proportions of anxiety (41.7%) and depression (30.6%). Poorer mental health was associated with social-employment variables (e.g., not working before the pandemic) and health-related variables (e.g., poor or regular self-rated health). These findings suggest that social inequities, already experienced by non-binary communities before the pandemic, may deepen due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This strategy has meant for the population to remain at home, to reduce mobility and to keep physical distance from others. Research in Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy has highlighted the negative impact of lockdown on mental health, especially on women and the younger population [1] [2] [3] . For some people from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, intersexual, and other (LGBTQI+), lockdown has meant to live with people who were unaware of (or negatively viewed) their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some LGBTQI+ groups in Spain have made public the harm that their community has had to endure (either because of fear of retribution or the increase of discrimination by the people they live with) during lockdown [4, 5] .",

However, this approach ignores gender diversity and how individuals may assign their own gender identity (e.g., non-binary people) [7, 8] . The term \"non-binary\" could be understood as a category that includes a) people who do not identify within or in-between the man/woman classification; b) people who could experience man/woman identities separately; and c) people who do not identify their gender identity or who reject to identify with specific gender identities [9] . Non-binarism could include individuals who identify as trans and queer [10, 11] . However, not all non-binary people identify as trans and some trans people may identify within the man/woman binomial category [12] . Besides, there could be people who question the sex-gender dichotomies but do not identify with, or are unaware of, the term \"non-binary\".",

Existing studies often have as their main focus on sexually transmitted infections. National health surveys in Spain are still embedded within the man/woman binominal, neglecting gender identity [14] . The same is true for electronic health records, which only allow classifying individuals as men or women, suggesting a lack of knowledge on sexual and gender diversity populations [15] . Based on these arguments, and assuming the theoretical and methodological complexity around the sex-gender system, this study aims to explore social and health-related factors associated with mental health during COVID-19 lockdown among people who do not identify with the man/woman binomial in Spain.",

REDCap is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies, providing (1) an intuitive interface for validated data capture; (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; (3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages and (4) procedures for data integration and interoperability with external sources [16, 17] . Participants were recruited through online platforms and social networks using convenience and snowball sampling techniques through different institutions and personal accounts. The questionnaire was created by a team researcher including psychologists, statisticians and epidemiologists. We analysed if there were any incoherent answers and did not find any. The survey was piloted with people with different sociodemographic characteristics, making some changes in the survey so that it was easier to complete it. The average time to answer the survey was 10 minutes; which was clarified on the front page of the survey. Data collection was finalised when lockdown de-escalation started in Spain. This study has been informed by social determinants' and gender-based framework [18] . All members of the research team are highly sensitive towards the different axes of social inequities, and the multiple power structures that impact the population unequally.",

            "text": "This study presents an overview of the social conditions and psychological impact during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain among a group of non-binary people or people who do not identify with the man/woman binomial category. Poorer mental health was associated with social-employment and health-related variables. Results highlighted the impact of employment status-related factors (before and during lockdown) and reporting poor self-rated health. Over 40% of the sample presented anxiety and one third reported depression, especially affecting those who are younger. These findings differ from findings from the same survey in people who identified as women or men. According to these data, 31.2% women and 17.7% men reported anxiety. Depression was reported in 28.5% of women and 16.7% of men [3] . To further explore our findings, we carried out a comparison. We found statistically differences in anxiety levels between non-binary and binary people. When stratified by gender, we observed that non-binary people and people identified as women had similar anxiety levels, but we observed statically significant lower levels of anxiety in men. This suggests that having more anxiety during lockdown makes non-binary people more similar to women. According to our previous findings, social factors such as lack of economic privilege and gender could influence poorer mental health outcomes [3] . It is possible that poor mental health among surveyed people was already experienced before lockdown, particularly for people who were unemployed prior to the pandemic and that had seen their socio-economic situation negatively affected. There was also an association Table 2 Models were adjusted for age, education level, pre-lockdown employment status, employment condition as consequence of lockdown, self-rated health, fear of being infected with COVID-19 and changes in alcohol consumption during lockdown. 1 GAD 7: Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale 2 PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire between poor mental health and worsening employment status during lockdown. This is consistent with other studies that have established a relationship between unemployment and poor mental health among the general population, related to a feeling of having fewer opportunities to find stable employment in the future [21] . Also, a study conducted with trans (feminine and masculine) and non-binary people showed that employment status was a significant predictor of health. In the reported study, those who were not working had higher probabilities of having a regular or poor health, frequent days experiencing physical and mental health problems, and having two or more chronic diseases, in comparison with employed people [22] . This could be explained due to the discrimination that non-binary people experience when seeking employment [13] . In our study, there was an association between poor self-rated health and depression. There is a vast amount of evidence on self-rated health as a predictor of morbidity and mortality and its association with social inequities [23] . Other studies including non-binary people and those who fluctuate between a binary and non-binary identity, have reported high rates of depression, compared to binary people. This has been attributed to a lack of social acceptance for the diversity in sex-gender identities [11, 12] . It could be suggested that depression was experienced before lockdown, given the structural nature of power hierarchies that maintain discriminatory practices towards people with non-normative identities [24] . In relation to this, the association between depression and the increase in alcohol consumption during lockdown could be explained as alcohol may be used as a strategy to temporally disconnect from negative feelings and thoughts. This suggests challenges to train primary healthcare and public health professionals. On one hand, because people with non-normative identities encounter barriers to access healthcare systems [24] . On the other hand, because identifying problematic alcohol use is challenging for health professionals, as there is a lack of sensitivity towards social determinants of health in people who do not identify with the binomial man/woman category [12] . This leads to question approaches that consider the individual as pathologic. Instead, a framework that considers the analysis of ideologies (institutional and scientific) that maintain and reproduce inequities should be taken [24] . Regarding COVID-19 risk perception, we found an association between fear of infection and depression. In previous studies, and in our previous work, this association was only found among women [3, 25] .",

Besides, non-binary individuals have been found to be at a higher risk for homelessness and living in unstable housing, compared to binary individuals [12] . It is then essential to consider housing conditions as a fundamental axis of health when future lockdown measures are implemented. Both structural housing elements and comfort should be considered.

For the purposes of this study, we conducted a review of entry survey to assess internal consistency, for example, comparing age and education level. Another limitation is the small simple size, which meant that some estimations were statistically imprecise. Findings should then be interpreted with caution. On the other side, the small simple size did not allow to perform an intersectional analysis. This could have allowed to identify other axes of social inequities in our sample. However, the proportion of individuals that did not identify with the man/woman binomial is consistent with another study conducted in Spain with young people, which identified 70 individuals as non-binary [13] . Besides, given the study design, we are unaware of the situation that participants were in before lockdown. There are also strengths in our study, as it allows reflecting on the social conditions that people who did not identify with the man/woman binomial lived in during lockdown. These are relevant findings if we consider the high number of publications available on the COVID-19 pandemic, in which gender diversity is overlooked. In addition, this study contributes to the debate on the categorisation of sex-gender identities in health surveys and other registries, to question and challenge normative ways of classification.",

Questioning biological essentialism is thus key to this discussion. The issues of biological accounts of sex-gender, and the need for the reassessment of gender analyses are crucial [28] . Both sex and gender should not be considered unidimensional or natural proprieties of people [6, 29] . Instead, they should be seen as the result of active social processes, in which language holds socio-political connotations, which lead to the categorisation of individuals [30] . In research, identity (understood as an internal feeling of oneself) is a concept that should be made visible in data collection methods, to consider the population's diversity and their health outcomes.",

However, there are differences between binary people. People who identify as male have better mental health outcomes than non-binary people. While no differences were observed between non-binary people and women. This highlights the differences in social and economic privileges that men have over other gender identities. In fact, currently should be study how the pandemic impact exacerbated pre-existing social inequities, such as adverse social, employment and economic conditions in some population. This suggests the need to conduct studies using different methodological designs, to make pertinent recommendations. We suggest increasing the evidence on the diversity in the sex-gender system, to deepen our understanding on its relationship with health status and socio-structural determinants of health. Cultural diversity and racism should also be considered. In addition, interventions focused on challenging gender stereotypes should be promoted to reduce social inequities of health.",
