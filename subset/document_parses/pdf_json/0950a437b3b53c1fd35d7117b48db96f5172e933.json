Methods A three-limbed double-blinded randomized control trial was conducted in a Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit. Forty five preterm neonates undergoing ROP screening were included. Eligible babies were randomly assigned to one of the three groups that orally received either expressed breast milk (n = 14), 10% dextrose solution (n = 14) or sterile water (n = 17), one minute before eye examination. The outcome measure was PIPP score. Results All 3 groups were similar in baseline characteristics.

Among the analgesics studied for neonatal pain, breastfeeding/breast milk is a natural, easily available, easy to use and potentially risk-free intervention. The potential mechanisms by which breast milk might provide an analgesic effect is the presence of lactose in breast milk [23] .
