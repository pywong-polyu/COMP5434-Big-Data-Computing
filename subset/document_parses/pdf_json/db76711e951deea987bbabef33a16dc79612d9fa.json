The underlying pathogenic mechanism for thrombocytopenia are decreased production or increased consumption of platelets (including sequestration/pooling and activation/destruction of platelets). For planning diagnostic evaluation and management the neonatal thrombocytopenia is clinically classified in to early onset which occurs before 72 hours of age and late onset which occurs after 72 hours of age. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia in NICU has been reported as 22% to 35%. The prevalence is more in the preterm and ELBW infants than in term neonates. [1] [2] [3] Most cases of mild thrombocytopenia seen in low birth weight neonates secondary to intrauterine growth restriction, maternal hypertension, placental insufficiency are transient in nature, which resolves in 7 to 10 days and does not require detailed evaluation. Severe thrombocytopenia (<50 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L) in NICU is seen most commonly in preterm, ELBW, and sick neonates. Christensen et al observed thrombocytopenia among ELBW neonates at a rate more than twice that reported among the general NICU and can be associated with significant underlying causes and morbidity. 2, 3 Sepsis is the most common cause for late onset severe thrombocytopenia in preterm neonates, which results from a combination of increased consumption due to DIC and decreased production due to bone marrow suppression. Neonatal thrombosis secondary to sepsis and indwelling central line catheter has been associated with neonatal thrombocytopenia in NICU. [3] [4] [5] In term neonates the platelet destruction that results from immune mediated mechanism is the most important etiology for persistent severe thrombocytopenia.",

            "text": "NAIT causes perinatal intracranial bleed which results in mortality and severe long term neurological impairment in survivors. The well looking term baby with normal maternal platelet counts, affected siblings and fetal and neonatal intracranial bleed raise the suspicion of NAIT. 6 Other predisposing factors for neonatal thrombocytopenia are Kasabach Merrit phenomenon, chromosomal anomalies (trisomy 21, 18, 13), Turner syndrome, and medications. Sometimes evaluation may not find an etiology in 48% to 60% cases of thrombocytopenia in NICU. [5] [6] [7] Severe neonatal thrombocytopenia is uncommon in the general healthy new-born population, with a reported incidence between 0.14% and 0.24%. 1, 7 However, infants admitted to the NICU have a higher risk of severe thrombocytopenia, with a reported risk between 2.4% and 5%. 7, 8 The risk of severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L) increases with decreasing gestational age (GA). 3, 5 The risk is greatest in the most preterm infants (GA <28 weeks) as illustrated in a retrospective study of 284 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW <1000 g) born between 2003 and 2004 that reported 28% of patients had severe thrombocytopenia, 56% had platelet counts of <100 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L, and 73% of patients had platelet counts of <150 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L within the first 3 days of life. 5 Early onset severe thrombocytopenia persisting after excluding infection and immune mediated NAIT in a non-dysmorphic neonate, who needs multiple platelet transfusions and poor response to platelet transfusions should initiate work up for alternate diagnosis like inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBFS). In severe persistent thrombocytopenia the bone marrow examination is done for diagnosis. Clinical Course and bone marrow findings decide the need for genetic testing to look for rare IBFS. 9, 10 In our case we suspected CAMT from bone marrow aspiration and was confirmed by genetic study which identified missense MPL gene mutation. CAMT is a very rare disorder in extreme preterm neonates. The isolated persistent severe thrombocytopenia since birth is the common presentation of CAMT. It is characterized by the absent or reduced megakaryocytes in bone marrow without birth defects. 11, 12 CAMT is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is associated with the mutations in the myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene, MPL which encodes the thrombopoietin receptor, c-MPL and is an essential regulator of megakryocytopoiesis and platelet production. Serum thrombopoietin (TPO) levels are found increased. The usual presenting symptom of CAMT is bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, or gastrointestinal tract. [11] [12] [13] [14] Pancytopenia develops in later childhood at a median age of 3.7 years. [15] [16] [17] [18] A subset of patients experiences a transient rise in platelet counts and later onset pancytopenia. CAMT is not associated with skeletal abnormalities, which differentiates this disorder from the thrombocytopenia associated with absent radii. 14, 18, 19 The diagnosis of Type II CAMT can be made in cases with missense mutation in exon 5 of the MPL gene. However, the finding of MPL gene mutations is not required for CAMT because there are reports of patients with the characteristic clinical and laboratory findings of CAMT who do not have a MPL gene mutation. 15, 16 Patients with mutations that result in absence of c-MPL protein have earlier onset bone marrow failure compared with those patients with mutations that result in amino acid substitutions. 17 Infants and children with CAMT are at risk for life-threatening hemorrhages secondary to thrombocytopenia. Due to the risk of allosensitization leading to graft rejection associated with multiple platelet transfusions, a low platelet level threshold is set and platelet transfusion is reserved for symptomatic and high risk of bleeding neonates. 13 Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative option for children with CAMT. [20] [21] [22] In a 2005 report of 20 patients with CAMT, 15 patients received HSCT at a median age of 38 months (range 7-89 months). 23 The outcome was poor for matched unrelated stem cell transplants. In a 2015 series of 5 children who had HSCT with unrelated donor umbilical cord blood had excellent outcome. Successful HSCT from unrelated donors using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen also has been reported. 23, 24 Though the general approach in evaluation of neonatal thrombocytopenia is based on searching for immune and nonimmune mediated causes, in persistent severe thrombocytopenia the poor response to platelet transfusion and the deviation from usual clinical pattern is a clue to suspect inherited bone marrow failures syndrome in an extreme preterm neonate.",

The early onset, severity, prolonged course, the need for frequent platelet transfusions, poor response to platelet transfusion, and absence of dysmorphism should raise suspicion and mandate evaluation for rare etiology for thrombocytopenia like IBFS. CAMT is a rare IBFS which presents as early onset refractory thrombocytopenia and progresses to pancytopenia later in life. The pathogenic mechanism is mutation of MPL gene which leads to TPO insensitivity by TPO receptor resulting in amegakaryocytopoiesis. HSCT is the mode of curative treatment.",
