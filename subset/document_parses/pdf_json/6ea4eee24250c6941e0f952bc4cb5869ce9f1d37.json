The pandemic may result in a long-term disproportionate negative impact to students applying to Medical School from a low-socioeconomic background. In addition, the upsurge in Medical School applications increases the likelihood of stricter University entry criteria over the coming years. There is no current research to determine how widening participation of Medicine to students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds can be improved virtually. The aim of this study is to establish the impact of COVID-19 on students enrolled in UK widening access schemes and the role of virtual student led initiatives in widening participation. Methods: A voluntary online survey was distributed to UK Sixth Form students (N = 31) enrolled in a widening access scheme who attended Sheffield Neuroscience Society International Virtual Conference in February 2021. The event was free to attend. The five-domain survey consisted of questions determining demographics, career aspirations, impact of COVID-19, academic skillsets and an educational manipulation check.",

The five-domain survey consisted of questions determining demographics, career aspirations, impact of COVID-19, academic skillsets (preparedness to undertake a presentation) and an educational manipulation check. Importantly, delegates were asked directly how confident they were in applying to medical school. The survey consisted of Likert 10point closed ended questions, multiple choice questions and open short answer questions. The educational manipulation check of lecture content was based upon knowledge of careers, neuroscience and presentation skills which is identified as Q13-16 in the preconference survey and Q11-14 in the post-conference survey. A final question determined the opportunity for follow up, as such, application status of these students can be followed prospectively. Responses were matched with a unique code. The survey was prepared by authors and modified following the pilot survey on widening access students at the Sheffield Neuroscience Society 2020 conference.

One obstacle low-income students will encounter includes access to a reliable and stable internet connection, thus preventing students accessing relevant learning materials [4] . This exasperates the previously established disparity in educational attainment amongst social groups in the UK [18] . Additionally, teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have access to the technological devices and or the appropriate quiet learning environment [19] . Moreover, with parents working from home the only available family device may have to be used to maintain an income for the household rather than educational purposes which, in the worsening economic climate, takes priority [4] . Ultimately, the aforementioned factors impact students ability to maintain and achieve their academic attainment which is a crucial requirement for admission into medical school. The requirement for pupils to reach their target grades, typically A (the second highest achievable grade) in 3 subjects, is paramount given the conflicting evidence on how pupils will be awarded grades fairly using the government's algorithms [20] .",

Furthermore, as the event would not have to be watched live, any problems caused by a poor internet connection would not result in the student missing the event.
