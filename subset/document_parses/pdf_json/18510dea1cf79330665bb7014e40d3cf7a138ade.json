            "text": "The mechanisms by which exercise benefits patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common liver disease worldwide, remain poorly understood. A non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics analysis was used to identify metabolic changes associated with NAFLD in humans upon exercise intervention (without diet change) across four different sample types-adipose tissue (AT), plasma, urine, and stool. Altogether, 46 subjects with NAFLD participated in this randomized controlled intervention study. The intervention group (n = 21) performed high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for 12 weeks while the control group (n = 25) kept their sedentary lifestyle. The participants' clinical parameters and metabolic profiles were compared between baseline and endpoint. HIIT significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose concentration (p = 0.027) and waist circumference (p = 0.028); and increased maximum oxygen consumption rate and maximum achieved workload (p < 0.001). HIIT resulted in sample-type-specific metabolite changes, including accumulation of amino acids and their derivatives in AT and plasma, while decreasing in urine and stool. Moreover, many of the metabolite level changes especially in the AT were correlated with the clinical parameters monitored during the intervention. In addition, certain lipids increased in plasma and decreased in the stool. Glyco-conjugated bile acids decreased in AT and urine. The 12-week HIIT exercise intervention has beneficial ameliorating effects in NAFLD subjects on a whole-body level, even without dietary changes and weight loss. The metabolomics analysis applied to the four different sample matrices provided an overall view on several metabolic pathways that had tissue-type specific changes after HIIT intervention in subjects with NAFLD. The results highlight especially the role of AT in responding to the HIIT challenge, and suggest that altered amino acid metabolism in AT might play a critical role in e.g. improving fasting plasma glucose concentration.",

Moreover, clinical parameters of NAFLD, such as intrahepatic lipid content (IHL), insulin sensitivity, and liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) have also been improved with physical exercise 6-10 . Furthermore, changes in the levels of endogenous and gutmicrobiota produced metabolites including purine, tryptophan, carnitine, and steroid metabolites induced by physical exercise may be partially responsible for the exercise-related health benefits 11,12 . However, the mechanisms behind such improvements and the contribution of these metabolites in the context of NAFLD are poorly understood.",

Non-targeted metabolite profiling could likewise serve as a valuable tool for assessing metabolic differences among NAFLD patients in response to exercise and may help uncover a wide spectrum of endogenous and gut microbial metabolites altered during exercise. In this study, we utilized a non-targeted metabolomics approach to identify metabolic changes associated with NAFLD in humans upon high-intensity interval training (HIIT) across four different sample matrices-adipose tissue (AT), plasma, urine, and stool. This will enable understanding the complex nature of exercise-related benefits on health at the whole-body level combining the interplay of gut microbiota, circulation, excretion, and tissue metabolism.

When comparing the effect of the intervention between the intervention and control group, the most notable group of differential compounds was amino acids and their derivatives, including metabolites of amino acids and di-and tripeptides, as visualized in the volcano plot and the pathway analysis ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Most of these compounds increased in particular in the AT as well as plasma in the intervention group, while they decreased in the urine and stool samples (Fig. 2 , Supplementary  Table 3) . Notably, the proteinogenic amino acids (arginine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, methionine, tyrosine, threonine, and proline) increased in AT in the intervention group. In addition, other derivatives of these amino acids such as leucic acid (leucine metabolite), acetyllysine, dimethyllysine, proline-hydroxyproline, and dimethylarginine were also similarly increased in the AT in the intervention group. The most decreased metabolite in plasma after the exercise intervention was methylproline, whereas dimethylarginine, tryptophan metabolites (indolelactic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate), alanine derivative (sulfoxyphenylacetyl dehydroalanine), noradrenaline metabolite ((3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylene glycol sulfate), and glutaric acid were all increased in the plasma due to the HIIT intervention. In the urine samples, amino acids such as glutamine, ornithine, and threonine; and the derivatives such as methylindole, methylcrotonylglycine, gamma-glutamylleucine, trimethyllysine, and isatin decreased in the intervention group. Further, a lysine derivative (fructoselysine) and a methionine derivative (adenosyl-methionine) increased in the intervention group. In the stool samples, several leucine containing peptides (leucyl-leucine, threonyl-leucine, oleyl-leucine, leucyl-phenylalanine) and other glycine and histidine derivatives such as glycocyamine, glycine-betaine, and methylhistidine decreased in the intervention group, while xanthurenic acid, a metabolite in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, increased. Consistent with these findings, when the data were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst 18 , several amino acid metabolism pathways in AT, urine, and stool were changed markedly ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The differential metabolites were also correlated with various clinical parameters to further examine their relevance to NAFLD and exercise. The changes of the improved clinical parameters including fasting plasma www.nature.com/scientificreports/ glucose concentration, VO 2 max, and waist circumference were mostly positively correlated with amino acids in AT in the intervention group (Fig. 3 ). In the intervention group, waist circumference was positively correlated with leucyl-leucine in AT; dimethylarginine, methylproline, and proline hydroxyproline in plasma; and negatively correlated with xanthurenic acid in stool. Plasma glucose concentration was positively correlated with threonine in plasma; proline, leucic acid, and isopropylmalic acid in urine; and leucine in stool. Significant negative correlations of trimethyllysine in plasma; and glutaric acid and methionine in stool with waist circumference were also observed. VO 2 max was significantly positively correlated with leucyl-leucine, leucylphenylalanine, and methionine in AT; and glutamine and isatin in stool. Proline in plasma; and glutaric acid and phenylalanine in stool positively correlated with maxW. In AT, while strong positive correlations of most of the amino acids and derivatives were observed with the liver parameters ( Fig. 3) , only proline, methylproline, sulfoxyphenylacetyl dehydroalanine, and isatin correlated significantly with lipid parameters ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

Further, increased VO 2 max levels are known to confer protection against hyperglycemia and cardiovascular disease mortality 23, 24 . The drop-out rate of the whole study was low, and 18 out of 19 subjects finished more than 20 of the 24 supervised exercise sessions. The high compliance might be explained by well-designed individual training plans based on the subject's fitness at baseline.",

            "text": "Fasting plasma glucose concentration was significantly decreased, whereas insulin concentration and HOMA IR (data not shown) did not decrease significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group. The improved glucose homeostasis after exercise can be partly explained by enhanced glucose uptake in skeletal muscles via the transport protein GLUT4, leading to decreased plasma glucose concentration 25 . A non-significant result in insulin concentration can be explained by high variability as well as by the intended absence of weight loss. WC decreased in the exercise group after the intervention compared to the control group. WC is an essential indicator of central obesity and insulin resistance, and it is strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality but also all-cause mortality 26, 27 . A decrease in WC can reduce these risks and the risk of developing T2D 28 . However, the liver fat did not significantly decrease during the intervention compared to the control group. Other exercise interventions have resulted in liver fat reduction without weight loss 29, 30 .A potential explanation is that the liver adiposity was not high in the subjects participating in this study. Although they had NAFLD diagnosis, some of them were in a good control and this is why their liver adiposity was within normal range. Another explanation could be the number of exercise sessions per week. While Winn et al. and Johnson et al. conducted four and three supervised HIIT sessions per week 29,30 respectively, we had two supervised sessions per week, which might not be enough to show significant results with this number of subjects. Further, no improvement in plasma lipid profile was observed. This is likely due to the lack of dietary modification. A common Finnish diet is high in saturated fat 31 and the subjects were instructed to keep their dietary habits unchanged during the study.",

            "text": "Our metabolomics investigation combined with the pathway analysis of the identified metabolites showed significant changes especially in amino acids and their derivatives after the exercise intervention (Fig. 2 , Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 3 ). An accumulation of amino acids in AT was observed in the intervention group. Particularly interesting was the increase of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) leucine. In obese and insulin-resistant people, BCAAs are known to have reduced levels in AT and elevated concentrations in plasma 32, 33 . This causes massive decomposition of these amino acids in skeletal muscle and liver, and induces www.nature.com/scientificreports/ insulin resistance, thereby causing NAFLD progression. However, the observation of accumulated BCAAs in AT in the intervention group could imply the enhancement of mitochondrial oxidative potential of BCAAs upon exercise, which could alleviate or eliminate the accumulation of toxic catabolic intermediates of BCAAs that induce insulin resistance 32 . Other beneficial effects of increased BCAAs, in adipocytes, especially leucine, might be mediated by the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), resulting in AT morphogenesis, differentiation of adipocytes, hyperplastic growth, leptin secretion in adipocytes, and thermogenesis [34] [35] [36] . In addition, BCAAs partly play a role in mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes, which modulates the lipid metabolism as inhibition of fat synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation [37] [38] [39] . Leucine may also promote the browning of the AT via this pathway, but the results are contradictory, and further studies are warranted 40 . Besides BCAAs, other amino acids such as methionine, threonine, and tyrosine increased in AT in the intervention group. These amino acids could also contribute to enhanced lipid and glucose metabolism via the activation of the PGC-1\u03b11-PPAR\u03b1/\u0263 signaling cascade. As an example, dietary supplementation of threonine improves lipid metabolism in obese mice by PPAR-\u03b3 signaling cascade along with the down-regulation of lipogenesis expression levels and up-regulating of lipolysis expression levels 41 . Physical exercise also promotes the activation of the PPAR-\u03b3/PGC-1\u03b1 axis. This causes irisin release, thereby promoting the browning of beige fat cells in white adipose tissue, enhanced thermogenesis, increased energy expenditure, and maintenance of glucose homeostasis 42, 43 . The increase of threonine levels in vivo in the intervention group could be partially responsible for these beneficial effects; however, further studies are warranted 44 . Similarly, the increase of tyrosine levels as observed from the metabolomic and pathway analysis ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ) could also contribute towards the exercise-related benefits. The hydroxylation of phenylalanine results in the formation of tyrosine. Tyrosine could then be used as a catecholamine precursor, which plays a vital role in improving athletic performance and regulates lipolysis in AT 45, 46 . Therefore, the reduced levels of phenylalanine compared to tyrosine could imply increased tyrosine production to account for the need for catecholamines during exercise 47 .",

Amino acids are generally higher in the urine samples of NASH patients than people without NASH due to the abnormalities in the amino acid metabolism 16 . A decrease of amino acids and their derivatives in urine found in this study could imply lesser hepatic damage and lower release of amino acids from the liver. The reduced presence of peptides in the stool could imply an increased gut microbiota diversity, associated with exercise and could promote an improved protein degradation 48 . The produced branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) can modulate glucose and lipid metabolism [49] [50] [51] . In addition, propionylcarnitine was increased in plasma. It is an SCFA esterified to carnitine and diffuses through the serosal membrane into the circulatory system to reach mainly skeletal and cardiac cells 52, 53 . Therefore, it could be a potential marker for SCFA production. Its bioavailability is better than carnitine, and it can ameliorate cardiovascular dysfunction and metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance 54 .",

Mardinoglu et al., previously reported a correlation of methylproline with hepatic steatosis in the plasma samples. Also, plasma methylproline levels were significantly changed between subjects with high and low steatosis 56 . In addition, methylproline is a gut microbiota produced metabolite 57 . Therefore, we propose that exercise-induced change in gut microbial composition or function could alleviate NAFLD by decreasing the levels of this compound. However, more studies are warranted.",

Indolelactic acid acts as a ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and is expressed by immune cells that regulate intestinal immune homeostasis 58 . The activation of AhR promotes the production of interleukin-22, thereby stimulating mucosal defense by inducing antimicrobial proteins 58 . Moreover, AhR activation also decreases glucose and triglyceride levels in serums of subjects with obesity and metabolic syndrome 59 . Thus, an increase of indolelactic acid in the intervention group's plasma could alleviate NAFLD by enhancing the stimulation of mucosal defense, modulating inflammatory responses, and glucose homeostasis in an AhR-dependent manner. Similar observations of increased indole lactic acid levels in plasma samples have been reported after a maximal exercise cycling test 60 .",

            "text": "Perturbations in lipid metabolism contribute towards NAFLD development 61 . Specific species of these lipids, such as glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, have been involved in oxidative stress, insulin resistance, inflammation, and cell death 61, 62 . SMs are the most abundant sphingolipids and are known to regulate insulin and glucose homeostasis 63, 64 . In particular, very long-chain sphingolipid species (C < 22) are known to protect against glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance development 65 . In this study, very long chain SMs including SM d31:1, SM d32:1, SM d34:2, SM d35:2, SM d36:2, SM d(18:2/15:0) increased in plasma in the intervention group, further highlighting the potential of these increased SMs in terms of improved insulin/glucose homeostasis. However, due to the diversity of SM species, some are also known to be mediators of insulin resistance and could disturb glucose homeostasis 63, 64 . Further, altered levels of SMs are implicated in the development and severity of NAFLD 14,61,66 , however, the results have been inconsistent. As an example, increased SMs in the plasma samples of obese children with hepatic steatosis have been reported by Draijer et al. 67 . On the contrary, Zhou et al. reported decreased levels of SMs in NASH patients compared to their non-NASH counterparts 66 . In addition, the results of exercise intervention studies related to the SMs have been inconsistent. While one study found no differences in serum sphingolipids after exercise 64 , another study showed significantly decreased concentrations of plasma ceramides (C14:0, C16:0, C18:1, and C24:0) and improved insulin sensitivity after exercise 68 . Although this could be explained by the diversity of SMs, further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of individual SM compounds in exercise. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Physical exercise also modulates lipid metabolism by inducing tissue-specific alterations 69 . Significant increases in phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) and a significant decrease in phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lyophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), and lyophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) have been reported in obese children with steatosis 67 . In this study, we saw an accumulation of phospholipids in AT and plasma and their decrease in stool in the intervention group, which were also elaborated. We also observed marked changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism in the pathway analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Similar observations of increased hepatic lysophospholipids as a result of physical exercise were reported by Hoene et al. 69 . Li et al. who conducted a similar intervention study as ours, found that in the serum samples, the changes in PE, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidic acid (PA) contents were contrary to our results in plasma 63 . This could be because these lipid species are heterogeneous and can have different effects related to fatty acyl chain composition 63 .",

Elevated levels of total bile acid in serum, plasma, urine, liver, and stool have been previously reported in NAFLD and NASH subjects 13,71-73 . However, there are uncertainties regarding the nature and amount of change in bile acids in NAFLD 74 . Although not extensively studied in NAFLD subjects, exercise, in general, has been reported to decrease bile acid concentrations in the blood and stool [75] [76] [77] [78] . Our study observed a decrease of bile acids in AT and urine. In the plasma and stool samples, this decrease was nominal. Although the observation of decreased bile acids after the intervention is well in line with earlier studies with a similar setup [75] [76] [77] , it is difficult to suggest why they were decreased in all sample matrices in our current study. Possible mechanisms are related to the fact that exercise likely reduces the amount of lipids, and this could, in turn, reduce bile acid synthesis while increasing bile acid absorption efficiency. This could cause lower amounts of bile acids to be excreted in the feces 78, 79 . However, the observed lower level in AT and urine as presented here has not been demonstrated before. More studies are warranted to elucidate mechanisms across different sample matrices.",

Similar observations of reduced glycoursodeoxycholic acid after endurance and resistance exercise and reduced glycodeoxycholic acid levels after resistance exercise were reported by Morville et al. 76 . Exercise, therefore, likely alters gut microbiota by decreasing glycine metabolizing bacteria, thereby reducing the levels of these glyco-conjugated bile acids. Moreover, decreased glycine levels after a bout of exercise in urine and blood were reported 75 . Similar observations of reduced (but non-significant) glycine levels were also found in our study ( Supplementary Fig. 4) .

            "text": "Altogether, in this study, the exercise training induced improvements in waist circumference, fasting glucose concentration, VO 2 max, and maxW. The changes in these clinical parameters were strongly correlated with changes in metabolites during the exercise training. However, more studies are warranted to examine the relevance of these correlations in the context of effects of exercise in NAFLD. Furthermore, the changes in the identified metabolites during the intervention were mainly significantly correlated with the changes in the liver parameters rather than with lipid and glucose parameters. Especially in AT, stronger positive correlations of amino acids and their derivatives were observed with IHL, ALT, AST, \u03b3-GT, particularly in the intervention group. While \u03b3-GT was elevated and worsened non-significantly, all other clinical parameters improved nominally in the intervention group after 12 weeks. Nevertheless, it suggests that adipose tissue metabolism seems to have an essential role in the relationship between glucose homeostasis and exercise without weight loss and might play a crucial role in NAFLD improvement. Moreover, in plasma, several metabolites, especially SMs which have a central role in glucose and lipid metabolism, were positively correlated with significantly increased VO 2 max and/or maxW. Very long-chain sphingolipid species (C < 22) have protective effects against glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance development 65 . Moreover, some long-chain sphingolipids have been reported to be useful markers of fitness and response to exercise in coronary artery disease 86 ; however, their role in NAFLD is poorly understood. Therefore, the positive correlation of SMs with fitness parameters could possibly indicate an improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism in NAFLD with increased exercise intensity. In addition, the lipid metabolites including bile acids were altered independent of classic markers of lipid metabolism, i.e. concentrations of LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. This could possibly mean that the relative risk reduction in NAFLD and CVD with exercise training is not limited to classic markers of cardiometabolic health. This might further support the potential additive benefits of exercise to various drug therapies.",

            "text": "Several studies have highlighted that exercise benefits patients with NAFLD, however, the metabolites, mechanisms, and pathways still remain poorly understood. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to study the metabolic changes in NAFLD subjects due to physical exercise across various sample matrices. In addition, we provided a comprehensive metabolic readout across four different sample matrices and highlighted that the altered amino acid and lipid metabolism might contribute to the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise in NAFLD patients. Notably, as seen in Fig. 4 , the majority of the metabolite alterations were sample typespecific, highlighting the importance of whole-body metabolic homeostasis and interplay with gut microbiota, circulation, excretion, and tissue metabolism, which cannot be studied if focusing on single sample specimens. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ This study showed that a 12-week HIIT exercise intervention has beneficial ameliorating effects in NAFLD subjects on a whole-body level, even without dietary changes. Even without significant weight loss, HIIT decreased plasma glucose concentration and waist circumference, which is an essential indicator of central obesity and is associated with insulin resistance. Further, HIIT increased exercise parameters (VO 2 max and maxW), which are known to protect against hyperglycemia. The decreased plasma glucose concentration was also implicated at the metabolite level, wherein concentration of plasma SMs, which are involved in regulating glucose homeostasis, were increased. The observed accumulations of amino acids in plasma and AT; and decreased urinary and fecal excretion in the intervention group could further indicate their improved utilization and glucose metabolism. In addition, our study provided several hints of exercise mediating metabolic benefits by inducing changes in the gut microbial composition or function, including SCFAs and indole lactic acid which are involved in regulating energy and glucose balances. Although we profiled a wide range of metabolites across various sample matrices in NAFLD subjects upon exercise, further validation in larger studies would strengthen the observed results. Moreover, complementing this study with comprehensive genomic and gene expression analysis could help in further exploration of the mechanisms behind NAFLD improvement. Additionally, animal models could be employed to examine the relevance of the correlations observed in our study. Furthermore, metabolic profiling of muscle and liver tissue might help further advance our knowledge about exercise-induced inter-organ crosstalk in NAFLD. Moreover, the metabolomics analysis is still limited because of the incomplete availability of MS/MS spectral libraries for annotation of all the significant metabolites, resulting in a relatively large number of features that could not be annotated, warranting future studies to investigate the changes occurring in these compounds along with providing confirmation to the identifications. The study had, however, limited number of subjects. Also, the oral glucose tolerance test, providing a body's response to a glucose load, could not be performed due to practical issues related to very binding schedule to the participants. Overall, our results indicate that AT might play a critical role in improving plasma glucose concentration and mediating exercise-related benefits. Further, without significant weight loss and dietary changes, exercise might ameliorate NAFLD conditions by regulating glucose metabolism and promoting alterations in amino acid, lipid, and bile acid metabolism upon exercise.",

While being hypothetical, maxW4 was useful for defining the presumably optimal intensity for work intervals at HI. The intervention group performed HIIT sessions involving five bouts of 2-4 min work intervals (at 85% of maxW4) interspersed by 3 min of active recovery (at 20% of maxW4) period twice per week on nonconsecutive days for 12 weeks.

The effects of the intervention, time, and their interaction were modeled as fixed effects, and subject ID was used as a random effect. The interaction term reflects the difference in changes during the intervention between the control and the exercise intervention group. The significance of the regression coefficients was tested using a t test with Satterthwaite's approximation for degrees of freedom. Confidence intervals were constructed using parametric bootstrapping percentile intervals with 1000 simulations. A raw p-value < 0.05 was used as a criterion for further investigation and annotation of signals. Further, we also selected only those features which had an MS/MS spectrum available and had an average peak area of at least 10,000 per sample type, including altogether 5067 features (469 plasma, 670 AT, 3020 urine, and 1008 stool).",

The non-targeted metabolic profiling analysis was performed as described by Kl\u00e5vus et al. 94 . Briefly, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (Vanquish Flex UHPLC system, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (Q Exactive Focus, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used. Here, each sample (1 \u00b5L per injection) was analyzed using reversed-phase (RP) chromatography (Zorbax Eclipse XDBC18, 2.1 \u00d7 100 mm, 1. ",
