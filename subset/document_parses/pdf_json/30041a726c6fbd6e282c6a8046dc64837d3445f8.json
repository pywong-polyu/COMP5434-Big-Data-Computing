Precarious work schedules -characterized by long shifts, non-daytime hours, intensity and unsocial work hours -are increasingly prevalent. Relations between precarious work schedules and poor health are not well understood, and less is known about how to attenuate this relation. We examined the indirect effects of precarious work schedules on fatigue and depressive symptoms through sleep quantity. Two moderators -schedule flexibility and sleep quality -were examined as buffers of these associations. Workers from the Departments of Correction and Transportation in a northeast state (N = 222) took surveys and reported on demographics, work schedule characteristics, schedule flexibility, sleep quality and quantity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms. Results revealed that precarious work schedules had indirect effects on fatigue and depressive symptoms through sleep quantity. Schedule flexibility moderated the relation between precarious work schedules and sleep quantity, such that workers with greater schedule flexibility had more hours of sleep. Sleep quality moderated the association between sleep quantity and fatigue and depressive symptoms, such that workers reported greater fatigue and depressive symptoms when they had poorer sleep quality. Findings have direct applicability for developing initiatives that enhance Total Worker Health\u00ae through individual and organizational changes.",

By the age of 40, nearly 90% of U.S adults have worked a non-standard work schedule (Presser & Ward, 2011) . Unlike standard work schedules, non-standard work schedules consist of hours that are typically non-daytime, irregularly scheduled, or both (Winkler et al., 2018) . Beyond non-standard work schedules, Americans are also working longer hours. As of 2010, 18.7% of workers reported working more than 48 h per week and 7.2% reported working 60 or more hours per week (Alterman et al., 2013) .",

In this cross-sectional study, we examine two unionized workforces in the public sector \u2212 corrections and transportation \u2212 who experience extended and irregular schedules in the context of their full-time employment, to understand how schedules affect their well-being. Over our many years of using participatory action research (PAR) with these populations (Cavallari et al., 2019 (Cavallari et al., , 2020a (Cavallari et al., , b, 2021 Cherniack et al., 2016; Dugan et al., 2016 Dugan et al., , 2021 Dugan et al., , 2022 , the topic of extended and irregular work schedules has consistently emerged as a worker health concern, both due to prolonged exposure to workplace hazards and adverse effects on health, including sleep . In addition to this study being observational, it is a rare example of translational PAR research in which the selection of study variables was informed by worker input with the intent of identifying and testing modifiable factors that, if found to ameliorate the adverse effects of schedules on sleep and well-being, may serve as the basis for occupational health interventions.",

Moreover, we explore two modifiable factors (moderators) -schedule flexibility and sleep quality -as buffers of these associations that may alleviate the adverse impact of extended and irregular work schedules. This study model was specifically selected because although workers perceive extended and irregular work schedules to be an intractable reality that inevitably reduces wellbeing and sleep hours, they consider certain factors to have real-world potential for change within their workforce and in the context of their organization. Specifically, increasing schedule flexibility as a modifiable organizational factor, and improving sleep quality as a modifiable individual factor, were identified by workers as acceptable and feasible points of intervention, and thus they hold promise for later implementation success (Dugan & Punnett, 2017) .",

This is noteworthy because common measures, such as overtime characterized by work hours alone, do not capture the time of day when extended hours or discretionary time occurs, nor do they capture the intensity of work schedules. Schedule characteristics have mainly been studied individually in relation to health (in isolation from one another; van de Ven et al., 2016; Winkler et al., 2018) , and have not been assessed as comprehensively as we do, as a confluence of broad schedule characteristics that in combination with one another can concurrently affect a worker's health.",

Prior research has linked shift work to fatigue, which is a state in which a person feels very tired, weary or sleepy, due to sleep loss and disruptions in circadian rhythms (Caldwell et al., 2019; Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, 2017; Dorrian et al., 2011) . Workers who get less than 5 h of sleep in the 24-h period before work, or less than 12 h of sleep in the 48 h prior to starting work, have an increased risk of fatigue (Dawson & McCulloch, 2005) . Most research on fatigue has been focused on a few occupational groups such as nurses, medical residents, truck drivers, rail workers, and nuclear power plant workers (Caldwell et al., 2019) . However, fatigue is important across all occupations, as it is linked to health and safety risk (Dawson & McCulloch, 2005) due to its association with decreased cognitive function, impaired performance, and increased error rates (Dawson & McCulloch, 2005) .",

Chronobiological, physiological, social, and behavioral pathways have all been proposed to explain the relation between extended and irregular workdays and unfavorable health outcomes, such as fatigue and depressive symptoms, with insufficient sleep quantity as one of the more likely culprits (Winkler et al., 2018) . Sleep quantity is defined as the amount of time a person spends in a sleeping state (Barnes et al., 2012) . According to the effort-recovery model (Meijman & Mulder, 1998) , sufficient sleep is essential for good health because it allows the central nervous system to recover from the effort expended and energy depleted by daily life activities, including work (\u00c5kerstedt et al., 2009) . Regular, sufficient sleep restores a person's alertness, memory capacity, and mood (\u00c5kerstedt et al., 2009) . Insufficient recovery over time may result in sustained activation (Sluiter et al., 2001) in which workers must function in a chronic suboptimal psycho-physiological state and are likely to experience fatigue, poor physical and mental well-being, burnout, and work performance breakdowns (Eden, 2001; Elfering et al. 2002; Lundberg & Lindfors, 2002; Sonnentag, 2001 Sonnentag, , 2003 Sonnentag & Zijlstra, 2006) .",

            "text": "Along with stress, irregular hours are one of the main causes of disturbed sleep (\u00c5kerstedt et al., 2009) . Sleep quantity is largely dependent on time, which is increasingly scarce due to the growing demand for 24/7 work (Litwiller et al., 2017) and the rise of precarious employment. According to conservation of resources (COR) theory, people have a limited amount of resources to allocate to activities associated with various life domains (i.e., work, family, sleep), and the loss (or threat of loss) of these resources can result in stress and strain (Hobfoll, 1989) . Time is considered a critical finite resource (Dugan & Barnes-Farrell, 2017 , 2020 Hobfoll, 1989) . Extended and irregular work schedules can threaten time resources and lead to feelings of time scarcity, as they are not aligned with the social activity in any society and are often inconsistent with the daily schedules of a working family's household (H\u00e4rm\u00e4 et al., 2015) . The loss of time can be a source of stress when it interferes with workers not being able to use time resources to fulfill other life demands (family), or constrains opportunities for recovery and health behaviors such as sleep (Greenhaus & Parasuraman, 2002; Sonnentag, 2001 Sonnentag, , 2003 . In an effort to manage time resources and fulfill responsibilities across all life domains, people may choose to get fewer hours of sleep to have more time available for their work and family demands (Barnes et al., 2012; Winkler et al., 2018) . Research supports this proposition in that night and early-morning shifts, quick returns, extended shifts (> 16 h) and long weekly working hours (> 55) are all associated with short sleep durations and increases in sleepiness (Sallinen & Kecklund, 2010) . Both shift work and working more than 48 h per week are risk factors for sleep disorders (Ribet & Derriennic, 1999) .",

This approach does not account for the interrelatedness of the various work time characteristics present in today's workforce (H\u00e4rm\u00e4 et al., 2015) . In reality, many workers have work schedules that are simultaneously rigid, irregular and unstable, such that they have little control over work hours, short advance notice, and frequent fluctuations in work schedules . Scholars have coined this grouping of work time characteristics as precarious work schedules and have urged researchers to measure various aspects of precarious work schedules including number of hours, nonstandard work timing, intensity, and social aspects of work hours (i.e., non-work free time, control, predictability, variability) (H\u00e4rm\u00e4 et al, 2015; . Unlike precarious employment which is temporary and insecure, with inadequate pay, benefits, and legal protections, precarious work schedules can affect workers with permanent full-time jobs in sectors where employment has historically been secure, well-compensated, and even unionized.",

Consistent with COR theory (Hobfoll, 1989) , flexibility may reduce stress by placing less of a temporal demand on workers, and also permits workers to manage their time resources so that they can engage in other important life activities such as getting physical exercise, eating a healthy diet, engaging in leisure activities, fulfilling personal and family obligations, and getting sufficient sleep (Allen, 2002; Costa et al., 2004; Crain et al., 2019; Dugan & Barnes-Farrell, 2020; Grzywacz et al., 2007) .",

Schedule flexibility falls under the overarching concept of control, and a particular form of flexibility, withinworkday flexibility, has shown promise in supporting worker well-being. It has been associated with longer sleep hours (Grzywacz et al., 2007) and increased happiness (Golden et al., 2014) . Within-workday flexibility is also associated with larger reductions in stress and improvements in concomitant sleep difficulties than other forms of flexibility (e.g., opportunity for compressed workweek), likely due to having a higher degree of flexibility (i.e., it is short-notice flexibility) (Haley & Miller, 2015) .",

One study showed that although workers with highly variable, company-controlled working hours experience sleep problems, these effects are weaker when employees have more schedule flexibility and autonomy (Janssen & Nachreiner, 2004) . Another study of various work time characteristics showed that control moderated the relation between night-shift work with sleep quantity and sleep disturbance (i.e., working 4 + hour night shifts weekly with low time control resulted in shorter and more disturbed sleep), but did not moderate other work time characteristics (i.e., short inter-shift intervals, weekend working, unpaid overtime) (Tucker et al., 2015) . Therefore, the influence of schedule control is complex and more research is needed to better understand its impact, as well as the effects of particular forms of schedule control, such as within-workday flexibility.

            "text": "Sleep quality and sleep quantity are distinct constructs. Sleep quantity, as previously explained, is the amount of time a person is asleep, whereas sleep quality is defined as how well a person sleeps (Crain et al., 2018) . However, the constructs are related; a meta-analysis found a small but positive significant relation between sleep quality and sleep quantity (\u03c1 = 0.16) (Litwiller et al., 2017) , and sleep quantity has been described as a component of sleep quality (Buysse et al., 1989) . Sleep is integral to health, with previous studies reporting the synergistic effect of sleep quantity and quality on health outcomes such as impaired fasting glucose and glycemic control (Lou et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014) . Sleep is also essential for mental well-being, and both sleep quantity and quality have been associated with fatigue (\u00c5kerstedt et al., 2014; Patterson et al., 2010) and mental disorders such as depression in multiple populations (Bhati & Richards, 2015; Le Grande et al., 2016; Zhai et al., 2015) . Crain and colleagues (2018) recommend that sleep quality and quantity be studied together, suggesting the potential for an interaction between sleep quantity and quality. Few studies have examined the interactive effect of sleep quantity and quality in predicting health outcomes. For example, Barnes and coauthors (2015) found support for an interactive effect such that when both sleep quantity and quality were high, ego depletion was lower (p = 0.01) (Barnes et al., 2015) .",

Both sleep quantity and quality are important for energy resources (Crain et al., 2018) and there is merit in considering their effects simultaneously when drawing conclusions about workers' sleep health. For example, a worker who reports getting 8 sleep hours that are of poor quality may feel more tired in the morning relative to a worker who reports the same quantity of sleep but of higher quality. Second, unlike sleep quantity which is highly dependent on time, sleep quality can be improved through sleep hygiene behavior and other practices such as exercise, yoga, and relaxation techniques that make it a more amendable factor and a potential intervention point (Robbins et al., 2019) . Therefore, we propose to examine the interactive effect of sleep quality and sleep quantity on health outcomes (see Fig. 1 ):",

These state workforces were selected due to their exposure to precarious work schedules. Although employment at DOT and DOC is unionized and has historically been secure and permanent, workers experience extended and irregular schedules in the context of their full-time employment in hazardous and mandatory service jobs, where employers have increasingly imposed work schedules that not only have extended hours, but are irregular (unpredictable, variable) and also mandatory due to the round-the-clock nature of critical public safety needs. The DOC manages correctional facilities (state prisons and jails) which function 24/7 with staff assigned to shifts, though overtime is common and often on short notice. The DOT maintains the state's roadways, requiring staff to work extended and irregular hours during storms and road construction projects. We build upon a preexisting history of PAR with both of the organizations/populations in this study (at least ten years each) and will use findings to directly inform interventions for future implementation (Cavallari et al., 2019 (Cavallari et al., , 2020a (Cavallari et al., , b, 2021 Cherniack et al., 2016; Dugan et al., 2016 Dugan et al., , 2021 Dugan et al., , 2022 Suleiman et al., 2021) .",

Early worker involvement in studies prior to developing interventions is especially important in PAR as it improves intervention effectiveness by ensuring that investigators do not miss critical aspects of the psychosocial and workplace contexts that determine health. It also results in interventions designed to be relevant, feasible, appropriate, acceptable and scientificallycredible to end users, and have a greater likelihood for implementation success (Dugan & Punnett, 2017) .",

            "text": "As background, the WorkTime Study started with a workforce needs assessment (focus groups and surveys of workers) to better understand the different aspects of working time exposures for both DOC and DOT workers, and mechanisms by which schedules affected health (e.g., reduced opportunities for sleep, health behaviors, and family/social life). Focus group findings elucidated the effect of precarious schedules on insufficient sleep (see Suleiman et al., 2021) and were instrumental in the development of a contextually-relevant survey for further needs assessment of these worker populations . We then used an intervention planning tool to facilitate the brainstorming of intervention ideas with workers to address the root causes of their health concerns. Specifically, workers identified modifiable individual and organizational factors that could serve as the basis for designing Total Worker Health\u00ae interventions to alleviate the impact of precarious work schedules. (Total Worker Health\u00ae initiatives address health problems related to workers and workplaces to simultaneously protect and promote worker health [National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2020]). This paper's hypotheses were informed by the ideas workers generated for intervention, two of which pertained to improving sleep and increasing schedule discretion (flexibility). We specifically chose to examine these variables as moderators in an effort to provide an empirical basis of support for selecting these topics as the focus of future implementation efforts. The PAR method provided relevant information about the worker groups in this study that would have been unknown using conventional research approaches, and without which our future interventions may have been derailed. For instance, we learned from workers that although precarious schedules were employer-imposed, they are also often embraced by workers concerned with financial insecurity who frequently volunteer for overtime to increase income (often knowingly at the expense of their sleep health), and are protective over their ability to work as many hours as possible (Dugan et al., , 2022 . Thus, with worker input, we were able to avoid backlash that could have resulted from initiatives aimed at changing current scheduling practices, and identify points of intervention (moderators/ buffers) that were more immediately acceptable to the worker population. Workers helped us to understand that more education and awareness about the health effects of precarious schedules are needed to obtain worker buy-in prior to initiating any change to current scheduling practices.",

Significance of the indirect effects was evaluated using 95% confidence intervals, such that an indirect effect was considered significant when confidence intervals did not include zero (Hayes, 2017) .

Specifically, we predicted that the indirect effect would be weaker for those with high schedule flexibility and good sleep quality. The results are presented in Table 3 . The indirect effects of precarious work schedules on depressive symptoms through sleep quantity were conditional on within schedule flexibility and sleep quality (Index of moderated mediation = -0.035, BootSE = 0.018, Boot-LLCI = -0.074, BootULCI = -0.005). As shown in Table 3 , the indirect effect was significant when schedule flexibility was high or average and sleep quality was poor. The indirect effect was strongest when schedule flexibility was high and sleep quality was poor. The indirect effect was conditional on schedule flexibility and sleep quality, but not in the hypothesized direction, providing partial support for Hypothesis 4b.",

Our measure permits us to gain an understanding of the confluence of work time factors that can interfere with sleep and well-being. Using a single design with indirect effects and moderation that depicts relations among variables as a system of conditional and interactive effects among work schedules, control, sleep, and mental health processes, we found that precarious work schedules have indirect effects on both fatigue and depressive symptoms through sleep quantity; we also found evidence of two moderators. Specifically, we found that an organizational factor, schedule flexibility, moderated the relation between precarious work schedules and sleep quantity, while an individual factor, sleep quality, moderated the association between sleep quantity and fatigue and depressive symptoms.",

This physiologic mechanism explaining the association between precarious schedule characteristics and poor health consequences has been supported in previous studies (Winkler et al., 2018) . Evidence suggests that precarious work schedules mainly cause sleep loss (Ohayon et al., 2010) , and insufficient sleep can in turn lead to acute fatigue (\u00c5kerstedt et al., 2014) as well as chronic diseases (Kecklund & Axelsson, 2016) and chronic conditions such as depression (Zhai et al. 2015) . In addition to sleep quantity, work-family conflict has been previously reported as a significant mediator between precarious work schedules and employee health and well-being (Cho, 2017; Haines III et al., 2008) . This finding may explain the important role of sleep quantity in translating precarious work schedules into negative acute and chronic health outcomes among employees. For example, when practicing irregular or non-standard work shifts, employees may suffer sleep loss (e.g., borrowing sleep time to meet their work and family demands), which in turn contributes to poor health outcomes such as fatigue and depressive symptoms. To further inform health interventions, future studies should assess the degree to which out-of-work activities interfere with having a suitable sleep schedule and evaluate sleep hygiene practices as a possible solution.",

Specifically, we found that workers with less precarious work schedules and greater schedule flexibility had the greatest number of sleep hours. Previous studies have reported a positive effect of schedule control on employee sleep quantity and quality (Brossoit et al., 2020; Takahashi et al., 2012) , as well as its buffering effect in the association between night shift and sleep quantity and disturbances (Tucker et al., 2015) . Berkman and colleagues reported that employees whose managers were supportive of work-family needs, such as providing flexibility with work schedules, had longer sleep duration and lower cardiovascular risks (Berkman et al., 2010) . Another study also suggested that the health effect of nonstandard work shifts such as stress, burnout and well-being, is less severe if it is chosen or determined by employees (Buessing, 1996) . Schedule control has previously been reported as a moderator in the association between work hours and work-family interference (Hughes & Parkes, 2007) . One unexpected finding from our study was that a proposed moderation did not take the form that we hypothesized (Hypothesis 2); specifically, the negative relation between precarious work schedules and sleep quantity was stronger for those with high schedule flexibility. The form the moderation took suggests that work schedules with a high degree of precariousness are associated with lower sleep quantity, regardless of how much schedule flexibility the worker has. Therefore, although flexibility may buffer the potential negative effects of work schedules with lower levels of precariousness, for workers with higher levels of precariousness, alternative solutions for increasing sleep hours, such as reducing levels of schedule precariousness or offering alternative forms of schedule control, need to be considered. Future research should examine the effectiveness of organizational efforts that improve time control including flexible work arrangements and other innovative scheduling practices (Kossek et al., 2014; Swanberg et al., 2011) .",

Our results also confirm research that shows associations of both sleep quantity and quality with fatigue (\u00c5kerstedt et al., 2014; Patterson et al., 2010) and mental disorders (e.g., depression) in multiple populations (Bhati & Richards, 2015; Le Grande et al., 2016; Zhai et al., 2015) . We extended prior work on the role of sleep quantity and quality in health by conducting an empirical examination of interactive effects of these variables on depression and fatigue.

These findings, embedded within a larger PAR study, enabled us to identify organizational and individual points of intervention, which is in line with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Total Worker Health\u00ae approach to protecting and promoting worker health (NIOSH, 2020). Sleep quantity had a significant intervening role, while schedule flexibility and sleep quality had significant moderating roles in these associations. The study suggests that when translating findings into practice, employers should avoid designing work schedules with excessive precarious features, and should consider initiatives to attenuate or buffer the consequences of precarious schedules, including organizational policies that increase schedule flexibility or worker health education on improving sleep quantity and quality. This is in keeping with expert consensus that a multi-level approach to managing occupational sleep-related fatigue is optimal, and should include work scheduling strategies that permit opportunities for rest breaks and adequate sleep, as well as training programs to educate workers about best practices for sufficient recovery and sleep (Wong et al., 2019) .",

In this study, with worker input, we identified schedule flexibility and sleep quality as moderators in the relation between precarious work schedules and worker health, and these were generally perceived as feasible and acceptable points of intervention. For example, schedule control can be improved through the implementation of common flexible work arrangements and culture change initiatives in organizations (Kelly & Moen, 2007; Kelly et al., 2011) . Organization and employer support may greatly improve employees' schedule control and reduce the potential negative impact of precarious work schedules (Hughes & Parkes, 2007) . Sleep quality may be improved through healthy sleep hygiene practices and other sleep promotion interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (Robbins et al., 2019) , or complementary and integrative health strategies (e.g., yoga, meditation) that have been found to be effective in pilot tests at DOC (Sarris & Byrne, 2011) . Taken together, study findings suggest that targeted interventions, such as evidencebased shift system designs that reduce precarious work schedules, organizational and management support on working hours tailored to and selected by employees, and evidence-based education and training programs improving sleep quality should be implemented in the workplaces to improve short-and long-term health and safety of employees (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2012).",

Future analyses of longitudinal and experimental data are needed to verify the study findings. Second, although the sample was moderate in size, the data was collected from two occupations within one state. Furthermore, these two populations were a unionized, full-time workforce with full benefits, and the precarious nature of their schedules may not compare to workers whose precarious schedules co-occur with a precarious employment situation that includes an inadequate number of work hours, low pay and few benefits. The homogeneity of our sample makes our findings a conservative test of our hypotheses; it is likely that we would find stronger effects among workers with more precarious schedules, or different groupings of precarious schedule characteristics, or wider variability in schedule control. A nationally representative sample of data from across multiple occupations is needed to understand the generalizability of these results to the broader U.S. population and to understand heterogeneity in these associations between subpopulations of workers. Also, due to the analytic technique we used where multiple imputation was not possible, we had missing data which further means that generalizability of results is a limitation, and we will need to replicate our findings with other samples. We acknowledge the limits of our flexibility measure, in that it only captures one aspect of flexibility (i.e., ability to take time off during the workday) rather than other types of flexibility that exist, such as the ability to change work start/end times, or the ability refuse work beyond the usual scheduled hours. We also acknowledge that there is a moderately (but not excessively) strong correlation between fatigue and depression; however the inclusion of both variables is beneficial as it provides comprehensive coverage of the well-being content domain. Finally, although the measures were reliable and well-validated scales of work, sleep, and health, they were self-reported by workers rather than being directly observed or verified through multiple reporters and therefore may suffer from bias.",

Hypothesis 1a proposed that precarious work schedules are indirectly related to fatigue through sleep quantity (Fig. 1). Precarious work schedules were positively related to fatigue (B = 0.137, SE = 0.063, LLCI = 0.012, ULCI = 0.261). Precarious work schedules were negatively related to sleep quantity (B = -0.364, SE = 0.086, LLCI = -0.534, ULCI = -0.194), and in turn sleep quantity was negatively related to fatigue (B = -0.180, SE = 0.048, LLCI = -0.274, -0.085). Therefore, precarious work schedules were indirectly related to fatigue through sleep quantity (Indirect Effect = 0.065, BootSE = 0.022, BootLLCI = 0.027, BootULCI = 0.111). These results provide support for Hypothesis 1a.",
