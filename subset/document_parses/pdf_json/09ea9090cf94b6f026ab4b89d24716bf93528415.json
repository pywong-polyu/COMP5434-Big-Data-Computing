Then, the subsequent CR3022-CAR positive NK-92 cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Sorted CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells were maintained for 2 months to verify CAR expression (data not shown). The generation of CR3022-CAR is schematically described (Fig. 1b) . 293T cells were transfected with a combination of plasmids containing CR3022-CAR in the SFG backbone, RDF, and PegPam3, as previously described 17, 18 . The SFG retrovirus particles were used to transduce NK-92MI cells. After 4-5 days, NK-92MI and CR3022-CAR cells were stained with CD56 and human IgG (H+L) and the CAR expression was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1c) . Greater than 98% of CD56 + CR3022-CAR + NK-92MI cells were observed (Fig. 1) . In summary, we have successfully established the stable membrane expression of CR3022-CAR-NK cells.",

Surprisingly, 293T-hACE2 cells showed a weaker binding efficiency with the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, compared to that of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells, indicating that the binding activities of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI is superior to the natural receptor of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In summary, CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells can specifically and strongly bind to the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles.",

To test this, we first transfected the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into 293T-hACE2 cells (commonly used cell line for studying the SARS-CoV-2 virus) by transfecting these two cells with an RBD encoding plasmid ( Fig. 4a and Fig. 5 ). Greater than 90% of transfection efficiencies on 293T-hACE2 cell were obtained. The expression of RBD proteins on 293T-hACE2 cells were verified by flow cytometry (Fig. 4b and Fig. 5 ). After successful establishment of these 293T-hACE2-RBD target cells, we tested whether CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells can be activated by these target cells using the conventional CD107a assay. Expectedly, the surface level expression of CD107a molecules on CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells after co-culturing with these 293T-hACE2-RBD target cells were significantly increased, which was measured by both the percentage and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD107a on CR3022-CAR-NK92-MI cells, compared to cells cocultured with the parent cells alone (Fig. 4c) . In addition, the production of TNF-alpha and perforin were greatly increased on CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells after co-culturing with these 293T-hACE2-RBD target cells (data not shown).",

Overall, these key activating and inhibitory receptors between parental NK-92MI and CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells are similar, indicating the stable characteristics of NK-92MI at pre-and post-transduction stages.

Although these findings support the therapeutic potential of CR3022-CAR-NK cells for treating severe COVID-19 patients, there are several limitations presented in the current form of study. First, we use the NK-92 cell line in this study. NK-92-mediated immunotherapy is currently undergoing phase I/II clinical trials 21,22 . However, NK-92 cells must be irradiated prior to infusion to prevent permanent engraftment because of malignant potential of NK-92 cells. Second, we use pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles, which is different from the natural SARS-CoV-2 virus. Future studies using natural SARS-CoV-2 virus in the ACE2-transgenic mouse model are needed to test the efficacy and toxicity of CR3022-CAR-NK cells.In conclusion, development of this novel CAR-NK cell therapy for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity will be required to reduce patient risk and enhance the benefit of these expensive and time-intensive therapies. The studies here characterize the biology of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells, test the efficacy of CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI using in vitro assays, and finally, define the efficacy of eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells by CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells. This work pioneers the use of CR3022-CAR-NK cells to treat SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and will lead to the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for patients presenting with severe COVID-19, and combined with other broadly neutralizing antibodies, will support the development of a universal, \"off-the-shelf \" CAR-NK based-immunotherapy for COVID-19.",
