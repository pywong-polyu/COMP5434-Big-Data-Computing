Within Australia, community service organisations, alongside government initiatives, have played a notable role in responding to the social impacts of the pandemic such as increased unemployment, mental health issues and social isolation [3, 4] . While working to meet increasing community needs, organisations were also required to rapidly restructure service arrangements in accordance with social distancing guidelines [3, 5] . This led many to implement telehealth as a means of ongoing service delivery [3] .",

            "text": "Telehealth is defined as the \"delivery of health care services, where patients and providers are separated by distance\" [6] (para. 1). Wade [7] distinguishes between two forms of telehealth: asynchronous and synchronous; the former involves no 'real-time' interaction between provider and client (e.g., emails), while the latter is characterised by simultaneous interactions (e.g., telephone and videoconferencing). Although telehealth is commonly conceptualised in a medical context, its meaning has extended over time to include broader understandings of health and well-being [5] . Alternative phrases have emerged with this expansion; telepractice is regarded as more general term that encompasses the use of information and communications technology [ICT] to deliver services across a range of fields [8] . In this study, the terms telehealth and telepractice are used interchangeably to mean the use of synchronous communications, particularly teleconferencing and telephone, to deliver community services. Community services can be broadly defined as agencies that assist people who may be experiencing vulnerability by supporting their well-being and relationships, access to resources, and social participation [9] .",

A recent review of telehealth literature from the last decade found that although some studies reported telepractice outcomes to be equally, if not more, effective, the \"strength of this evidence is unclear\" [8] (p. 4). Even so, it is widely agreed that telehealth is a promising mode of service delivery with distinct advantages [7, 8, [11] [12] [13] . Commonly reported benefits for service users include improved access to services; enhanced quality, frequency or timeliness of services; reduced costs; and increased convenience [8, [11] [12] [13] . Telepractice has also been found to benefit practitioners, allowing greater \"access to continuing education and professional development activities, [and] the ability to provide an enhanced local service\" [12] (p. 277). Along with advantages, the barriers and challenges associated with telehealth have been described within the literature. These have notably included clinician and provider preferences for in-person services, limited resources and funding, insufficient infrastructure, lack of reliable connection or broadband, and ethical and legal concerns (e.g., data security and privacy) [8, 11] .",

The workers commented on the benefits of increased accessibility, improved communication between agencies and professionals, and a greater work/life balance when using flexible modes of service delivery [5] . However, practitioners also had concerns about ICT issues, communication with service users, and the overall quality of services [5] . While Sanders [5] offers insight into the experiences of practitioners, the paper does not provide information about the service areas under comment. As the human service sector is diverse in terms of practice and client needs, research which explores the contextualised experiences of service workers could contribute to the ongoing discussion of telepractice in this field.",

This is noteworthy as other fields and disciplines, such as medicine, have noted that service users, alongside providers, have widely embraced telehealth [18, 19] .

Considering this, the aim of this study was to investigate the service response to COVID-19, and how it impacted staff and clients' experiences of providing and accessing regional community services. As telepractice emerged as a key means of ongoing service delivery, this paper captures the response to two core objectives: (i) to explore clients' experiences of using telehealth to access community services; and (ii) to understand staff's experiences of delivering community services via telehealth.

This was common across staff and client subgroups with an array of attitudes identified, including enthusiasm for telepractice, neutrality, and a strong preference for traditional in-person services. Participants' experiences seemed, in part, to be shaped by previous experiences with telehealth and levels of comfort and ability using technology. This is congruent with recent research, such as B\u00e9k\u00e9s' and Aafjes-van Doorn's [38] study of psychotherapists' engagement with telehealth which found past experiences with online modalities were associated with positive attitudes towards telepractice. In the current study, staff members' attitudes also appeared to be shaped by their perception of whether telehealth was beneficial to clients, whether they encountered technological challenges, and personal characteristics such as openness to change.",

However, the online platform extended the reach of the program which could enable geographically isolated women to access the service. The current study yielded some suggestions from clients about the structure of online support groups, such as decreasing the duration of sessions to account for the increased tiredness arising from videoconferencing [39] and decreasing the number of participants to allow for greater interaction. The dearth of studies about the use of telehealth to facilitate support groups for new and expecting parents indicates that further research is needed in this area.",

Clients also suggested that they were more conscious of what they discussed with their counsellor when using telehealth and felt restricted in how open they could be. These results reflect those of Callis et al.

[1] (p. 20) compared this to other service types, such as food and financial services; 56.7% of WA families accessing food support reported that the services \"met their needs just as well or more\" than prior to COVID-19.

In the case of ER, previous studies have found that individuals who access these services often report feeling discomfort and embarrassment when seeking support [40] . It is possible that the higher degree of anonymity afforded by telephone appointments offered clients a greater sense of comfort and encouraged self-disclosure. Literature also notes that some groups are more likely to access ER, including those from low-income households, people with disabilities, sole-parent families, and people receiving pension [41] . Individuals from these groups may experience difficulties accessing traditional services due the cost of fuel or transport, mobility issues, or caring responsibilities. Thus, it is possible that the transition to phone appointments was received positively by ER clients as it increased the convenience of accessing the service. Further research exploring the perspectives of ER clients should be undertaken to elicit a clearer understanding of the perceived effectiveness of telehealth in this area.",

The reasons clients were accessing counselling (e.g., lack of informal support systems, experiences of trauma, anxiety) appeared to influence their experiences and perceptions of telehealth. This points to the need for discussions about how providers and organisations can tailor service delivery to the needs of individuals.

Individuals' experiences varied widely, both within and across service areas. To cater for the multiplicity of needs and circumstances, providers must consider several key factors on a case-by-case basis. Existing literature [43] describes the importance of the following factors: clinical appropriateness, quality (of both the care and technology), safety (regarding informed consent, levels of risk, and security of the telehealth system), and practicalities (including clients' levels of digital ability and whether clients have the necessary hardware/technology). McClean and Fowler [44] add to this the significance of the service relationship, staff characteristics (confidence, competence, and training), and the characteristics of clients and their circumstances. The current study supports the pertinence of these elements, while also suggesting the importance of an additional factor: clients' self-assessment of service modalities. Clients articulated which modes of practice were appropriate for their needs, preferences, and specific context. This demonstrates that service users are an important source of knowledge for determining the suitability of telehealth for them and speaks to the need for collaborative processes which view clients as partners in service delivery rather than passive recipients. This study accords with others [45] in asserting that clients' views and preferences cannot be assumed, and that ongoing review of telehealth is needed to accommodate for service-users' changing situations and needs.",

While van Galen et al.'s [46] work is situated within a medical context, their assertion that telehealth requires different communication competencies and thus additional training appears to resonate with community services context. In particular, the current study points to the need for supporting clients to speak openly, ask questions, and feel comfortable during moments of silence. Building on recommendations made by Sansom-Daly and Bradford [45] and Gordon et al. [47] , it appears important to address expectations of telehealth with clients prior to the first session, explicitly naming and exploring some of the above experiences (e.g., \"some people find it uncomfortable to have silences over the phone, I'm wondering how you think that would be for you?\"). While some providers described using test sessions or 'dummy runs' to familiarise clients with the technology, practitioners should also utilise this opportunity to discuss any concerns the client may have about telehealth, explore their individual needs and circumstances, and create a plan for if they encounter technical difficulties during the session.",

With anticipations that telehealth will be delivered at higher rates in the foreseeable future [14] , it will be critical for community service organisations and providers to carefully consider the digital divide and issues of equity moving forward. This is also an important issue for future research; additional studies exploring clients' experiences are needed to develop of full picture of how technological equity can be supported within the community service space.

            "text": "Two divergent discourses emerged regarding the future role of telehealth within the community service sector. Among participants, there were some that viewed telepractice as an opportunity to enhance services and increase options for clients and practitioners. Others, however, expressed relief that service delivery could revert to traditional face-toface modalities, indicating that they would sparsely utilise telehealth in the future. These opposing perspectives are evident in recent literature, with Sanders [5] reporting that regional human service workers were divided when discussing the utility of telehealth. The current study reflects this, with some providers confident that an increased use of telehealth would benefit clients. Staff and clients involved in FDR discussed the value of integrating videoconferencing into service provision beyond COVID-19, conceptualising it as an alternative to phone mediations for those living rurally to offer the added benefit of visuals. It was also seen as a tool for increasing client safety when mediating parties have high levels of conflict.",

This view of telehealth has been observed across numerous professions, with Slavova-Azmanova et al. [50] (p. 9) suggesting that there is a \"dichotomy of acceptance for telehealth but preference for face-to-face\", which is particularly evident in rural settings. This is shown in the present findings, with some clients and staff expressing a strong preference for in-person services despite their recognition of telehealth's benefits.",

To accommodate for the range of experiences and perceptions of telehealth, consumer choice should be prioritised. The current study was undertaken in the context of telehealth being rapidly and 'forcibly' implemented; as transition to a state of 'COVID-normal' occurs, it will be essential for organisations to re-examine telehealth systems using a client-centred lens. Additionally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are yet to be guidelines developed regarding telepractice in the context of community services. The creation of such a resource may be beneficial for providers in delivering telepractice beyond COVID-19.",

There was substantial variation in participants' experiences and perceptions of telehealth. Staff found the rapid digitalisation to be beneficial in some respects, such as increasing the accessibility of services for some clients and providing more options for practice. However, this was accompanied by an acknowledgement of challenges and complexities, such as safety concerns related to family violence and confidentiality, issues of equity for clients who lack ICT or reliable broadband and navigating client hesitance. For both staff and clients, emphasis was placed on the importance of relationships and communication. Clients, for the most part, found telehealth to be accessible; however, they raised issues regarding the suitability of telepractice for their needs and circumstances. Based on these results, several suggestions were made for providers, organisations, and researchers to move towards a greater individualisation of telepractice which caters for clients' diverse contexts and multiplicity of needs.",
