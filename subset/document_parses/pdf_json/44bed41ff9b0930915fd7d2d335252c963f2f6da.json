This study aimed to share the learning experience of an oral pathology laboratory course using either the virtual microscopy with digitalized virtual slides (virtual slide learning) or real microscopy using traditional glass slides (glass slide learning) among dental students. Materials and methods: Thirty-eight undergraduate dental students who took the compulsory course entitled \"oral pathology\" in the School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University were included in this study. The questionnaires were filled and final test was taken by these students after finishing the teaching of oral pathology laboratory course using either virtual or glass slide learning. The data were collected and analyzed statistically. Results: Our results showed a significantly higher acceptance rate (all P-values < 0.001) and a significantly better histopathological diagnosis ability (P < 0.01) among dental students using Journal of Dental Sciences 16 (2021) 840e845 the virtual slide learning than those using the glass slide learning for the oral pathology laboratory course. Conclusion: Virtual microscopy has many advantages over real microscopy in oral pathology laboratory course teaching. Based on the results of our study, we believe that the virtual microscopy with digitalized virtual slides may gradually replace the real microscopy with glass slides for the learning of oral pathology laboratory course. We foresee that the virtual microscopic images of the patients' specimens may be added in the patients' digital medical charts in addition to the images of computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and sonography in the future. \u00aa 2021 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China.

            "text": "The contents of dental practices are prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases in the oral and maxillofacial region with medical and dental knowledge. The dentists also provide the consultation for oral health. 1 In fact, general dentists still have the responsibility of discovering and diagnosing common diseases in the oral and maxillofacial region, uncommon but life-threatening diseases (such as oral cancers), and rare odontogenic tumors or cysts (only dentists have professional training for diagnosis and treatment of these types of diseases). Therefore, it is generally accepted internationally that dental students and dentists should still learn the oral pathology course. 2e5 However, a major challenge for educators today is how to teach the oral pathology course and what contents in the field of oral pathology have to be included for teaching the undergraduate and graduate students in dental schools, so that the curriculum is relevant to a practicing dentist and a dental specialist. Teachers of oral pathology are ultimately responsible for the patients, who have the right to expect dentists to have a broad knowledge of oral pathology that can be extended beyond the most common oral lesions or conditions. 4 In the School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University, the oral pathology laboratory course is scheduled in the first semester of the third year of undergraduate students for 4 h per week, and the class size is usually within 40 students. For the past 60 years, standard classroom teaching of oral pathology laboratory course using the real optical microscope to observe prepared tissue sections on glass slides is carried out in our dental school. With recent advances in the technology of virtual microscopy, it is now feasible for microscopic glass slides to be transformed into digitized virtual slides, and then the dental students can study the oral histopathology course through a computer at any places with the broadband internet available by means of a virtual microscopy. 6 In 2015, a teaching improvement plan for our oral pathology course was developed to update traditional glass slides to digitalized virtual slides with the use of virtual microscopy system. Thus, we got the opportunity to compare the students' acceptance rate and changes in oral histopathological diagnosis ability after finishing the teaching of oral pathology laboratory course using either the real microscopy with traditional glass slides (so-called glass slide learning) or the virtual microscopy with digitalized virtual slides (so-called virtual slide learning). The use of virtual microscopy system can provide better quality and more stable virtual microscopic images, so that students do not need a conventional optical microscope and can still learn the oral pathology laboratory course through virtual slide learning method using the stored virtual microscopic images in a server computer.",

Good-quality, clear, and representative tissue sections and their histopathological images are the foundations for an excellent learning of the histopathology.

The virtual slides provide good-quality histopathological images without color-fading problem as that in glass slides. In addition, students can freely review the virtual slides by using free image processing software at any time and any place with broadband internet available after class. The results of our study indicate a significantly higher acceptance rate (all P-values < 0.001) and a significantly better histopathological diagnosis ability (P < 0.01) in dental students using the virtual slide learning than in dental students using the traditional glass slide learning. Another study also showed the same results that dental students rated all aspects of web-based study in oral pathology laboratory course as highly useful. In addition, students' satisfaction with the virtual laboratory was high, suggesting that the dental students like virtual microscopy more than traditional optical microscopy for learning the oral histopathology. 6 The previous study concluded that the students appear to enjoy web-based study, and virtual microscopy has significant advantages over real microscopy in oral and maxillofacial histopathological education. 6 Moreover, the results of the present study also indicate that the virtual microscopy enables oral histopathological learning become time-efficient, user-friendly, convenient, helpful, easy, and interesting.",

Therefore, virtual slides of new cases of different disease entities can be accumulated continuously without occupying a large physical space, and they are easier to organize, archive, classify, and read than traditional glass slides. Furthermore, virtual microscopy simultaneously provides a free image processing software, and there is an imageoperating App that can be downloaded to a computer, an iPad, or a mobile phone for easy-reading of the virtual slides. Unlike physical optical microscopy (there is a high cost for a regular maintenance and replacement), students can review the virtual slides after class without being restricted due to no physical optical microscopy at home. With the high acceptance rate of virtual microscopy by the students and the significantly increased histopathological diagnosis ability after virtual slide learning, it is worthy to fully digitalize all traditional glass slides into virtual slides for further improving the current histopathology teaching methods.",

The ultimate goals of these two courses are to let students be able to apply the knowledge of clinical features and histopathological manifestations of oral and maxillofacial diseases to the final diagnosis and treatment of the patients. The future trend of the learning of oral pathology and diagnosis is to set a learning platform that integrate clinical information, radiographic features, and virtual microscopic images of the oral disease cases together, so that not only students but also general practicing dentists can review the cases with complete information, and know how to reach a final diagnose and how to carry out the precise treatment for the patients. We expect that the use of this integrated platform through the internet may increase students' interest in learning oral pathology and diagnosis, and may improve their overall diagnostic ability of oral and maxillofacial diseases.",
