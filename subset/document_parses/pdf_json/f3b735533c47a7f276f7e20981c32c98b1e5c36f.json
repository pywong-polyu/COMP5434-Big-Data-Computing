[1] It was caused by novel coronavirus, which was later termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. As the infectious agent was a novel virus, for no previous therapeutic or preventive vaccines were available. The nonpharmacological measures such as hand hygiene and social distancing are the only available measures of prevention. [2] Many of the countries across the world employed harsh stay in home measures and isolation of high-risk population to interrupt the transmission of the infection. Government of India also imposed a voluntary curfew on March 22 followed by 3 weeks long lockdown with stay in home order which was subsequently extended as lockdown version 2.0 and 3.0. [3] The prolonged lockdown and modified work from home have compelled many people across world to stay at home for an unusually prolonged period. The disruption of daily routine life along with other factors, such as loss of wages among daily wage laborers, cancellation of schools among children, loss of recreation among adults, and exposure to stressful news, infodemic, social isolation among the old age population during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected mental health among population of all age groups. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Many government and society guidelines have advocated many measures such as healthy nutrition, healthy recreation, and avoidance of excessive news exposure to protect and improve mental health among the vulnerable population and mitigate the effects of isolation. Most of the advices for maintaining healthy recreation are didactic and lack proper enabling environment to be applicable. The stay at home orders along with fear of infection has reduced the chances of healthy recreations such as outdoor walking and running. The avoidance of gathering has reduced the feasibility of group sports or group exercise such as yoga or meditation.",
