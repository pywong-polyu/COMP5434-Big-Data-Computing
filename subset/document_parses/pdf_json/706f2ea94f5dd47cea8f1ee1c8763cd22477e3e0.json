In accordance, in the current study, we evaluated long-term humoral immune response in a large cohort of MS vaccinees using a targeted quantitative SARS-COV-2 IgG antibody assay reported to highly correlate with neutralizing antibodies (Mendrone-Junior et al., 2021) .

As the COVID-19 pandemic is going on, our findings are encouraging showing that MS patients either untreated or treated with various DMTs successfully developed antibodies up to 6 months following the vaccination. It is of note that the timing of the vaccinations could result in different immunity states in relation to different variants, as mRNA vaccines were reported to provide lower protection against SARS-COV-2 infection after the Delta variant (Nanduri et al., 2021). Our findings are innovative indicating that humoral immune response was achieved in a large cohort of vaccinated MS patients treated with various DMTs including alemtuzumab, cladribine, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, and teriflunomide up to 6 months following m-RNA PfizerBNT162b2 vaccination. The present findings further validated our previous study showing that the majority of patients treated with fingolimod and ocrelizumab failed to mount this protective IgG response . In the current study we have shown for the first time that MS patients treated with ocrelizumab that successfully developed humoral immunity as compared to ocrelizumab-treated MS patients that failed, were younger at the time of vaccination by a mean of 7 years, were vaccinated after a longer period of time from the last ocrelizumab dosing, and also had higher ALC. Taken together these findings suggest that by one month extension over the 6 months from the last dosing, successful humoral immunity was achieved. This extension resulted in higher ALC and contributed to CD20 lymphocyte repopulation and thus the ability to generate IgG from plasma cells changed the immune outcome.",

In accordance, it is important to note that not all vaccinated healthy subjects, similarly to untreated MS patients, developed cellular immunity within 2 to 4 months following the second vaccine dose. Only ~40% of vaccinated healthy subjects and untreated MS patients, all with positive anti-SARS-COV-2 IgG, developed SARS-COV-2 RBD specific memory B-cells, and only ~55% demonstrated memory T-cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 and/or IL-2 in response to SARS-COV-2 peptides. These findings imply that an additional booster dose might be needed to induce immune memory in higher percentages of the population. Similarly to our data, SARS-COV-2 specific memory B cells were found in ~50% of 33 healthy subjects, one week post the second vaccine dose (Goel et al., 2021) , and CD4 T cell response against RBD was observed in 5/9 (55.6%) of healthy vaccinees, 7 days after PfizerBNT162b1 first vaccine dose (Sahin et al., 2020) . Ocrelizumab-treated MS patients failed to mount cellular B-cell response but developed specific T-cell memory response similarly to vaccinated healthy subjects and untreated MS patients.
