There is a rich philosophical literature on the inferiorizing effects of \"crimmigration\"-that is, the growing criminalization of unauthorized migrants and the state's use of uniquely harsh law enforcement methods against them. Yet there is less interest in the existing racialized division of migrant labor. Low-skilled Latino/ a/x migrants disproportionately perform \"dirty\" and \"difficult\" work that citizens do not wish to perform. Theoretically, this division of labor is compatible with a more permissive immigration system that legally admitted far larger numbers of low-skilled migrants to continue \"doing the dirty work.\" Indeed, many have assumed the desirability of such a system. Against this, I argue that \"crimmigration\" and the racialized division of migrant labor cannot be conceptually disentangled. Rather, they are mutually constitutive in reproducing background conditions that constrain the social equality of low-skilled migrants, as well as others perceived to be such. \"Crimmigration\" has not only excluded migrants, but enabled states to include them on socially unequal terms: as an instrumental and fungible source of cheap labor. Drawing on Alasia Nuti's (2019) valuable observation that \"banal\" historical mechanisms like stereotypes and social scripts can play a crucial role in maintaining present-day injustice, I show that stereotypes of migrants as workers in lowskilled occupations, as well as the expectation that they continue to take on those jobs, also profoundly undermine immigration justice.",

Despite their essential labor contributions, they are often treated as inferior and undesirable by receiving states, especially in comparison to highly-skilled migrants. One major source of such social subordination is the United States' crimmigration system. Specifically, crimmigration refers to the combination of immigration enforcement with criminal law enforcement (Mendoza 2018) . Under the present crimmigration regime, violations of immigration law have resulted in criminal punishments, with immigration-related crimes being the single most common type of crimes prosecuted in federal courts (Hern\u00e1ndez 2013) .",

Immigration enforcement may be carried out by local and state police, who may attempt to enforce immigration law through \"stop and search measures\", or actively cooperating with ICE by detaining undocumented migrants or alerting ICE to their presence. Significantly, low-skilled Latino/a/x migrants have been most severely affected by crimmigration laws. Over 90% of immigrants that are currently detained, prosecuted, and removed under US immigration law are of Latin American origin (V\u00e1squez 2015) . Against crimmigration, some scholars have argued that the US has much to gain from choosing to include more low-skilled migrants, rather than criminalizing and deporting them. In particular, low-skilled migrants might be a potent source of economic benefit. For example, in a New York Times op-ed titled \"The Danger From Low-Skilled Immigrants: Not Having Them\", the economist David Card noted that \"10 years from now, there are going to be lots of older people with relatively few low-skilled workers to change their bed-pans\u2026That is going to be a huge problem\" (Porter 2017) .",

As I argue in this paper, crimmigration and the racialized division of migrant labor cannot be conceptually disentangled.

Historically speaking, crimmigration has not only excluded migrants, but enabled states to include them on socially unequal terms: as a source of highly exploitable labor for the United States.

            "text": "My argument proceeds in this order. Section 2 begins by explaining the argument from economic benefit (AEB) and the appealing rationale it provides for ending crimmigration practices. However, I contend that the AEB has its limits. In particular, it may inadvertently reproduce and entrench the social subordination of low-skilled migrants. Section 3 explains why crimmigration ought to be regarded as an ongoing form of historical injustice experienced by Latino/a/x persons; that is, an injustice with clear-cut historical origins. Adopting a historical lens, I note the origins of crimmigration and its long-term disparate impact on Latino/a/x populations in the US. To deepen my analysis of historical injustice, Sect. 4 introduces and expounds on Alasia Nuti's framework of \"historical-structural injustice\", which I will use to critically evaluate the AEB. Relevantly, Nuti argues that \"historical-structural injustices\" can persist even after historical injustices have seemingly come to an end. In this vein, Sect. 5 argues that even if the AEB is successful in ending crimmigration, it ultimately risks reproducing injustice in more insidious forms. Firstly, it fosters the demeaning attitude that low-skilled Latino/a/x migrants are instrumental and fungible. Secondly, the AEB may reinforce \"model migrant\" stereotypes that affect both low-skilled workers and Latino/a/x persons more generally. I conclude by noting that, if unaccompanied by further justifications that relate to the US's unjust history of exploiting low-skilled migrants, the argument from economic benefit may profoundly undermine immigration justice.",

As a starting point, many. theorists have accepted the premise that admitting greater numbers of low-skilled migrants would have adverse economic effects on receiving states in the Global North. For example, Stephen Macedo (2011) and Javier Hidalgo (2010) have cited economic studies indicating that immigration has negatively impacted the opportunities of low-skilled citizens who belong to marginalized groups, like African-American men. There is also some evidence that, owing to citizens' widespread negative attitudes towards them, the admission of low-skilled migrants puts strain on social welfare systems by diminishing social trust and solidarity within the state. However, both Macedo and Hidalgo readily acknowledge that immigration can have substantial economic benefits for immigrants themselves, many of whom originate from the Global South, even if they may create net disadvantages for receiving states. As Hidalgo writes, \"[h] istorical evidence supports the view that immigration can be a potent force for reducing poverty and inequality\" (ibid).",

One popular solution, shared by several economists and political theorists alike, is to advocate the use of guest worker programs. Under these programs, which are operational in liberal states like the United States, Canada, and Australia, low-skilled migrants are temporarily admitted to perform labor on the condition that they accept serious limitations on their rights, including restricting rights to family reunion, rights to some social benefits, and rights to seek employment outside of a particular sector (Bertram 2019) . The rough idea, here, is for immigrants to reap the benefits of working overseas and for receiving states to contribute towards the alleviation of world poverty while, at the same time, minimizing the purported ill-effects of lowskilled migration on their societies.",

Their geographic mobility helps local economies respond to worker shortages, smoothing out bumps that could otherwise weaken the economy. Immigrant workers help support the aging native-born population, increasing the number of workers as compared to retirees and bolstering the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. And children born to immigrant families are upwardly mobile, promising future benefits not only to their families, but to the US economy overall. (2019) In short, there is a growing recognition that low-skilled migrants are actually vital to the US economy: they help, rather than harm citizens. For example, it has been pointed out that the sickening of migrant workers in farms and meatpacking plants, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, would lead to serious food shortages across the US (Purdy 2020) . Even prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, it had been acknowledged that putting a stop to undocumented migration might lead to severe shortages across several low-skilled industries and ultimately shrink the US economy. 3 We also have reason to believe that crimmigration has already contributed to labor shortages in the construction industry. In turn, this affects the supply of affordable housing for Americans. 4 All in all, the negative consequences of crimmigration for the US's economy may arm us with a strong incentive for abandoning its commitment to crimmigration and giving low-skilled migrants more legal pathways to migrate to the US. Firstly, quotas on low-skilled migrants could be lifted, and existing guest worker programs significantly expanded. Secondly, current undocumented migrants could have their status legalized. Thirdly, the US might adopt a region-specific policy of free movement. For example, the right to freely enter the US in search of work might be granted to citizens from the countries that currently provide it with the highest supply of low-skilled migrants. With \"free movement\" in place, low-skilled migrants could be granted a larger bundle of rights than those typically allotted to guest workers, such as the ability to change employers while maintain legal residence in the US.",

However, crimmigration laws indirectly discriminate against low-skilled Latino/a/x migrants. Because they comprise the most populous group of undocumented migrants in the US, they are disparately surveilled, targeted, and punished by immigration authorities. While \"Mexican appearance\" can be used as a legitimate consideration for being \"stopped and searched\" by immigration authorities, coordinated immigration raids have also been carried out in workplaces that employ large numbers of Latino/a/x migrants. For example, in 2019, US immigration officials also conducted the largest workplace raid in at least a decade, arresting 680 majority-Latino workers in seven Mississippi chicken processing plants-chicken production being a sector that predominantly employs \"Latino immigrants eager to take whatever work they can get\". 7 Those rounded up were forced to leave their children in the care of friends, neighbors, and strangers in some cases. 8 A historical perspective on crimmigration and its uses will shed light on why lowskilled Latino/a/x migrants are primarily targeted. Over the years, crimmigration has (at least in part) been employed for the purposes of maintaining an underclass of low-skilled 5 The term \"menial labor\" is sometimes used in a derogatory sense, to describe work that is lowly and lacks value and prestige. Here, I use it to describe work that is poorly valued by society regardless of its actual necessity or importance. 6 A 2017 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017) showed that foreign-born workers were considerably more likely than the native-born to be employed in low-skilled occupations. The division of labor between citizens and non-citizens is also reflected in the most recent US census data, which indicates that industries associated with menial work are heavily reliant on immigrant labor (Migration Policy Institute). Within the set of \"foreign-born workers\" itself, while the vast majority of foreign-born whites worked in managerial or professional positions, the majority of foreign-born persons of Latino/a/x origin were concentrated in low-status industries like service, construction, and maintenance (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2013). 7 See: https:// apnews. com/ bbcef 8ddae 4e430 3983c 91880 559cf 23 8 See: https:// editi on. cnn. com/ inter active/ 2019/ 08/ us/ missi ssippi-ice-raids-cnnph otos/ index. html Latino/a/x workers. Starting from the acquisition of Mexican and Puerto Rican territories, Latino/a/x persons became essential to the economic success of the United States, primarily though their performance of low-skilled labor (V\u00e1squez 2015) . Nevertheless, their labor contributions failed to chip away at widespread beliefs about their racial inferiority and undesirability, such as anti-Mexican rhetoric that revolved around \"allegations of ignorance, filth, indolence, and criminality\" (Ngai 2004) . Matters worsened after the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924, which primarily associated Mexicans with illegal immigration. This was due to the Johnson-Reed Act's focus on numerical restrictions and the new enforcement aspects it introduced, such as inspection procedures, deportation, the Border Patrol, criminal prosecution, and new categories of so-called irregular immigration (Ngai 2004 ). One could be deemed \"illegal\", for example, for avoiding entry requirements like formal admission and inspection, which required a head tax and visa fee (ibid). Trapped in the web of new enforcement rules, thousands of undocumented Mexican immigrants were officially deemed to be \"undocumented\", and the \"undocumented Mexican laborer who crossed the border to work in the burgeoning industry of commercial agriculture emerged as the prototypical illegal alien\" (ibid).",

Guest worker programs that were introduced to reduce rates of so-called \"illegal immigration\", such as the 1942 Bracero program, \"aggravated the very condition [they were] supposed to alleviate\" by demonstrating the economic appeal of short-term migrant workers that employers bore little responsibility for (Zatz 1993). Rather than expanding opportunities for legal migration, the US caused another spike in \"illegal migration\" by introducing the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which placed new yearly numerical caps on migrants from every country in the world. These numerical caps did not explicitly discriminate against migrants of Latin American origin. In practice, however, they imposed new quotas on Latin American migrant workers who had previously not been subject to such restrictions. Once again, this policy change resulted in a large influx of undocumented workers from Latin America. Mexican migrants were especially affected because, despite their geographical proximity and historical ties, Latin American countries were formally treated as the same as all other countries (Mendoza 2018) . Worse still, the Bracero program was phased out between 1965 and 1967 and terminated completely by 1968 (Massey and Pren 2012) . Under the Bracero program, an enormous supply of Mexican migrants had become well-entrenched in employer practices and migrant expectations. Consequently, the curtailing of avenues for legal entry failed to interrupt the flow of migration and simply led to larger numbers of unauthorized migrants (Massey and Pren 2012) .",

Under the Reagan Administration, public spending on border control rose to unprecedented levels, whether it was used for the purchase of high-tech surveillance equipment or channeled towards Border Patrol (ibid). Notably, Border Patrol became the designated agency for enforcing \"drug and contraband smuggling\", and its dual purpose led to the belief that undocumented migrants were criminal drug traffickers (ibid). Similarly, the Clinton Administration oversaw the implementation of Operation Gatekeeper, which constructed fences and militarized the southern border where it was most likely to be traversed (Ong Hing 2015). Operation Gatekeeper was publicly characterized by President Clinton as an initiative about \"stopping crime, toughening the penalties for the criminals, and giving our law enforcement people the tools they need to do the job\" (Vasquez 2015). The readiness to associate unauthorized migration with criminality was also reflected in the Bush Administration's 2005 program, \"Operation Streamline\", which required the federal criminal prosecution and imprisonment of every migrant who attempted to enter the US without authorization through the southwest border (Vasquez 2015) .",

Quoting Nuti, \"[s]tructures of nationality, sexuality and class are only a few of the various ways in which our world is organized and that create some of the non-voluntary social groups generally existing within societies\" (ibid). As we can see, our membership in particular structural groups and its consequences for our \"privileges, burdens, power, and different statuses\" is generated by our positionality within particular social structures. My embodied experience-the benefits I enjoy and the burdens I endure-stems from the intersection of my various social identities (e.g. being an Asian woman who has been categorized as a \"highly-skilled migrant\" in the United States).

As she writes, we should understand (i) as: structural groups characterized by (1) a systematically unjust history of formal discrimination and exclusion that, although (2) decried by societies and now recognized as having been unjust, (3) is reproduced through other means. (Nuti 2019) In contrast, some structural groups are non-historical. This means that, even if they are \"formed by the accumulation of many lawful actions, decisions, and rules\" that together create unjust conditions, they do not arise from a history of formalized discrimination and exclusion (Nuti 2019) . Non-historical structural groups may include war veterans who suffer structural injustice despite not being singled out for state-sanctioned unequal treatment in the way that women and African-Americans have. At the same time, it is possible for history to play a significant role in the formation of certain groups, but for them to differ from historical-structural groups in certain regards. Here, Nuti primarily has national groups in mind (ibid). Unlike historical-structural groups like women, persons of color, and working-class people, whose continued existence is (to a great extent) dependent on historical and present-day injustices, national groups are far more likely to exist independently of the injustices they may have faced.",

In other words, intimate-partner violence cannot be viewed as random or arbitrary violence that takes place in a historical vacuum; rather, it must be understood as one of the primary means through which hierarchical gender roles of the \"past\" are informally reproduced. Furthermore, it is precisely because gender discrimination is outlawed that intimate-partner violence is wielded as a means of keeping women \"in their place\"; the formal recognition of gender equality simply calls for \"subtler means\" to be deployed against them (Nuti 2019 ).

On Reed-Sandoval's view, the vulnerable state of being socially undocumented tends to overlap with \"visible race and class markers\" (ibid). Persons tend to be treated as socially undocumented when they are perceived by others as working-class and Latino/a/x, and this is an experience that can be shared in common amongst low-skilled Latino/a/x migrants despite fine-grained differences that stem from their nationality. That said, the above objection is not without its merits.

The concept of instrumentalization is a rich one, and I want to flesh out its meaning. To be clear, while instrumentalization always involves the use of another person, the two concepts are not identical. According to Paulus Kaufmann, \"A uses B if and only if A interacts with B because he believes that B's presence or participation can contribute to the realization of his goal but that this goal does not essentially refer to B\" (2011). In other words, I am only used by another person if they interact with me to further their goals, rather than mine; you do not \"use\" me if you interact with me to realize your goal of making me happy. While it is not inherently wrong to \"use\" others, we need to differentiate between morally permissible and impermissible instances of use. Similar to the oft-quoted Kantian sense of treating someone \"merely as a means\", to instrumentalize someone is to treat them as a \"mere tool\" for the purposes of another (Nussbaum 1995) . The person may be treated as valuable insofar as their existence or presence enables you to achieve a particular end, but they are not regarded as valuable in themselves, outside of their ability to help produce the desired result.

Similarly, I treat you as fungible if I behave as though our relationship is not uniquely valuable to me, and that you can easily be replaced with another companion of my choice. I can do so unthinkingly (\"It doesn't matter if you can't go the party, since A is going to be there\") or with deliberate spite (\"Do you really think you're so special? I could replace you anytime I wanted\"). Certainly, instrumentality and fungibility can come apart; I may instrumentalize my very favorite pen, which will be of no use to me when it runs out of ink, but feel very strongly that it cannot be replaced by any other model.

Yet, in many cases, fungibility seems to be a conceptual extension of instrumentality. My valuing of something or someone only insofar as they can help me achieve a particular goal-in other words, my failure to attribute to them any kind of value outside of their usefulness to me in a given context-makes it likely that I will view them as replaceable by another object or person that can be put to the same purpose. If I am truly only concerned about being served a particular meal, the chef's specific identity will not matter to me as long as the dish meets my culinary standards. Moreover, if it is easy to hire adequately-trained chefs, I may willfully hire and fire my personal chef with the knowledge that I can usher in a new employee the next morning. Much like the case of instrumentalization, fungibility may be directly connected to a lack of concern for an object's condition or well-being. If the pens that suit my needs are plentifully available, I can treat my pen carelessly with the knowledge that it will be effortlessly replaced. Treating objects as fungible is not necessarily wrong; it is difficult, however, to see how treating persons as fungible could ever be morally neutral. Returning to the case of the chefs, if I see them as inherently replaceable, their health and safety may not matter to me very much (or if at all). From my perspective, it will not matter if any particular chef gets burned on-site, or falls severely ill, if I can hire a new chef at the snap of my finger.",

Low-skilled Latino/a/x migrants, particularly those who are undocumented, are often treated as instrumental and fungible. As I outlined in Sect. 3, crimmigration originated from a series of laws and practices that were designed to maintain the cheap labor and temporary status of low-skilled Latino/a/x migrants. The dominant attitude of the US state has been that migrants are necessary for performing important forms of labor, but at the lowest possible price, with little concern (or any at all) for the rights and interests of the migrants themselves. In a recent example, many undocumented field workers have found themselves categorized as \"essential workers\" who must continue working despite the stay-at-home directives that are intended to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. These workers have been told that they are \"critical to the food supply chain\" and therefore need to continue working for the good of the public, while simultaneously remaining deportable by immigration authorities. In sum, they are regarded as necessary yet disposable in the same breath. Even if undocumented workers are no longer threatened by crimmigration policy, these disrespectful attitudes may persist in other harmful forms.",

If permissive borders are contingent on economic benefit, the country would have a strong reason to tighten up immigration controls or even demand that present migrants return to their countries of origin, lest they cause more harm to the economy, even if this policy shift would be detrimental to migrants' well-being. 9 Unless the argument from economic benefit is supplemented by a further argument about migrants' rights and interests as sources of value in themselves, there is little incentive for states to take those into consideration. Secondly, suppose that a particular migrant is no longer as economically \"productive\" as they used to be because they have sustained an injury in the workplace, or have simply become less physically nimble due to age. Assuming that there remains a sizable supply of low-skilled migrant laborers from sending states, there also remains little incentive for the US to care for sick or injured workers or even to allow them to remain in the country.

There may be a residual sense that low-skilled labor is more appropriate for Latino/a/x migrants (amongst others), not white citizens, as it is the kind of dull, simple, rote work that is suitable for those with supposedly less developed rational capacities who must rely on the command of their superiors. 10 In addition, Latino/a/x migrants may be portrayed as \"stereotypical noble immigrants\" (Padilla 2009) who are hardworking, self-sacrificing, and enthusiastically willing to perform servile tasks for (presumably white) US citizens.",

At a more macrocosmic level, however, the \"model migrant\" stereotype can be strategically deployed to deny low-skilled migrant workers greater rights or compensation by pointing to their inherent industriousness and suitability for low-skilled labor. There is a close parallel here to the case of gender, and how the gendered division of labor (which disproportionately foists caregiving responsibilities on women) is justified by appealing to stereotypes about women's intrinsically caring and maternal nature.",

Nonetheless, there is a potential price to pay. The supposedly more \"positive\" stereotype may simply give way to microaggressions that revolve around false assumptions about their occupation, educational levels, or work ethic.

Arguably, it relies on a problematic assumption about the station of Latino/ a/x migrants in US society-chiefly, the expectation that they are responsible for \"doing the dirty work\". The ongoing characterization of migration as a quick fix for future labor shortages not only fails to interrogate why workers are in short supply, due to long-standing devaluation of certain \"essential\" occupations, but also promotes disrespectful attitudes towards low-skilled Latino/a/x migrants. Such migrants may continue to be perceived as instrumental and fungible, rather than persons with their own rights and interests.

Rather, the thrust of my claim is that, if states adopt more inclusionary policies towards low-skilled Latino/a/x migrants, they must include them on equal and respectful terms that would directly address the historical exploitation of their labor. 13 For example, undocumented Latino/a/x migrants could be granted legal status, and current guest workers could be granted a more extensive bundle of rights (e.g. labor mobility, the right to be accompanied by one's family, and the right to future naturalization) on the official grounds that they have been seriously exploited in the past. These policy changes, then, would be justified on the grounds of corrective justice, rather than migrants' instrumental benefits to the receiving state. These reforms might simultaneously be justified by public recognition and understanding of the value of low-skilled migrant labor, as well as their entitlement to legal and political protections while performing it. 14 This would be a very different kind of argument from merely pointing to the useful purposes that their presence may serve, while neglecting to emphasize that they must also be treated as equal members of society.",

I have noted that undocumented \"essential workers\" ought to be granted legal status simply because of the necessary labor they perform for citizens, with the expectation that dangerous and risky work should continue to fall upon their shoulders (rather than those of citizens). Nonetheless, the pandemic has clearly strengthened the US's obligation to grant legal status to undocumented \"essential workers\". To properly attend to historical injustice, the US must address the serious injustice that many low-skilled migrant workers have suffered over the course of the pandemic. Many migrant workers' poor employment conditions have exposed them to the virus. For example, prolific employers of low-skilled migrants have often failed to enforce social distancing measures or to appropriately shut down plants even when workers had tested positive, leading to enormous outbreaks of the virus. 15 In addition, legal status might also be necessary to ensure low-skilled Latino/a/x migrants' access to healthcare, should they or their family members contract the virus.
