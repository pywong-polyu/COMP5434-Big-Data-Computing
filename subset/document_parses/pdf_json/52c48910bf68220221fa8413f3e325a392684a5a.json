            "text": "In visual search tasks, responses to targets on one trial can influence responses on the next trial. Most typically, target repetition speeds response while switching to a different target slows response. Such \"priming\" effects have sometimes been given very significant roles in theories of search (e.g., Theeuwes, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 368, 1628Sciences, 368, , 2013. Most work on priming has involved \"singleton\" or \"popout\" tasks. In non-popout priming tasks, observers must often perform a task-switching operation because the guiding template for one target (e.g., a red vertical target in a conjunction task) is incompatible with efficient search for the other target (green horizontal, in this example). We examined priming in inefficient search where the priming feature (Color: Experiments 1-3, Shape: Experiments 4-5) was irrelevant to the task of finding a T among Ls. We wished to determine if finding a red T on one trial helped observers to be more efficient if the next T was also red. In all experiments, we found additive priming effects. The reaction time (RT) for the second trial was shorter if the color of the T was repeated. However, there was no interaction with set size. The slope of the RT \u00d7 Set Size function was not shallower for runs of the same target color, compared to trials where the target color switched. We propose that priming might produce transient guidance of the earliest deployments of attention on the next trial or it might speed decisions about a selected target. Priming does not appear to guide attention over the entire search.",

To be sure, there are visual processes that can be carried out across many items over a wide portion of the visual field (Whitney & Yamanashi Leib, 2018) and it is possible to respond, at above chance levels, to the gist of a scene (Greene & Oliva, 2009; Oliva, 2005) or to the presence of a category like \"animal\" (Li et al., 2002; Thorpe et al., 1996; Thorpe et al., 2001) . Nevertheless, if you want to pick up a pen or find a woodpecker in a tree, you will need to search for it. In cases where identification of a target item requires that the eyes fixate on that item, the rate of search will be, at best, on the order of three to four items per secondthe rate of voluntary saccadic eye movements. If eye movements are not a limiting factor, the rate of search is still constrained. Estimates of the maximum rate will depend on one's model of search (e.g., are observers searching through distracting items with or without replacement? Horowitz & Wolfe, 2005) , but that estimate will fall somewhere in the range of 20-50 items per second (Wolfe, 2021) .",

One solution is to propose parallel processing of groups of stimuli (Hulleman & Olivers, 2017; Palmer et al., 2000; Pashler, 1987 ). An alternative is to propose a pipeline or \"carwash\" architecture in which items are selected in series, say, about Significance Broad claims have been made for the role of priming in the guiding of attention (e.g., Theeuwes, 2013) . Most supporting work has involved tasks with salient single targets or foils. Here we clarify the role of priming by using an inefficient search for Ts among Ls. Priming by the color or shape of the preceding target does speed RT if that feature is repeated on the next trial. However, that priming does not increase the efficiency of search. Feature priming might transiently guide the first deployment of attention giving priming a real, but perhaps not central, role in visual search. Alternatively, it might speed decisions about the target. once every 50 ms, but then identified over the course of 200-300 ms, meaning that several items can be in the process of identification at one timea serial-parallel hybrid model (Wolfe, 2021) .",

            "text": "Regardless of the precise details, it is clear that visual search proceeds in a capacity-limited manner to deploy attention from object to object until a target is found or the search is abandoned. These searches are often very fast. Many search tasks are so effortless that we don't typically think of them as searches. The act of eating the next pea from the dinner plate may require searching for the fork and searching for the peas but, even though the visual world contains a vast number of possible objects of attention, such searches will be done without the diner consciously noting the search. This is possible because the deployment of attention is not random. It is \"guided\" (Wolfe et al., 1989) by multiple sources of guidance (Wolfe & Horowitz, 2017) . We can very briefly summarize a few of these. Stimulus salience will guide attention in a \"bottom-up\" manner (Nothdurft, 1993) . One could imagine that a shiny fork in an otherwise matte scene might attract attention in this manner. The searcher's goals can guide attention in a top-down manner to items that have the basic features of the target (Egeth et al., 1984) . If the goal is to acquire some peas, top-down guidance to green items would be useful. Knowledge about the scene would make a notable difference in this fork and peas example (Biederman et al., 1973; Henderson & Ferreira, 2004; Vo et al., 2019) . Forks are found next to the plate. Peas are on the plate, not on the walls or the floor. Finally (but not exhaustively), the prior history of search can influence subsequent search. Though it has not been studied in the dining context, other research suggests that, having acquired some peas for the preceding mouthful, searchers would be a little quicker to acquire more peas than they would be if they switched to acquiring potatoes. This last form of guidance, known as \"priming,\" is the topic of the present paper.",

The observers needed to indicate if the left or the right vertex of the target diamond was clipped off. The color of the oddball item and the other distractors items could be swapped or could remain the same, randomly, from trial to trial. Maljkovic and Nakayama found that observers were a bit faster if the colors remained the same from one trial to the next compared to the condition where the colors were swapped. This was the case, even though a search for a red item among homogeneous green items is about as simple a search as one can get and even though the color varied randomly from trial to trial. This basic finding has been replicated with a variety of different features including orientation (Hillstrom, 2000) , shape (Lamy et al., 2006) , and size (Huang et al., 2004) .

What you found on the last trial (or what you rejected on the last trial) does influence your next search. However, most searches in the real world are not part of the repeated series of the same type of search. You look in the kitchen drawer for the can opener. If you know that the can opener has a yellow handle, it seems plausible that you can guide your attention in a top-down, goal-directed manner to yellow items regardless of whether your immediately preceding searches were searches for something yellow, or not. In fact, the claim is less dramatic than it seems. In most cases, this is a claim about the first deployment of attention and/or the first deployment of the eyes during search. It is not necessarily a claim about all deployments across an extended episode of searching. Because the great bulk of the literature on priming and visual search involves singleton search, the first deployment of attention may be the only deployment of interest. Observers are typically making some response concerning a unique singleton; often a highly salient color singleton (Lamy & Kristj\u00e1nsson, 2013) . For that initial deployment of attention, it makes sense to ask if the top-down intentions of the observer make any difference. Figure 1 illustrates the point. If the task was to specify the orientation in the item of a unique color, \"run\" trials like #2 would tend to be somewhat faster than trials where the colors \"switch\" from the previous trial, as in #3. If the task were to give the orientation of the item in the less salient diamond item, salience and priming would combine to misdirect attention to the color singleton first on many trials.",

The slope of the reaction time (RT) \u00d7 set size function is a standard measure of search efficiency. If all the items were the same color, the slope for an \"inefficient\" search for a T among Ls would be around 20-40 ms/item for relatively large items that do not require fixation on each item. If it were known that the target T was red (as in trials 1 and 2 of Fig. 2) , search would be \"guided\" to red items and the slope would be~50% of the unguided version (Egeth et al., 1984; Wolfe et al., 1989) . This is cartooned in Fig. 3A . If the T is always red, then the red T on one trial could prime search for the red T on the next trial. In principle, no goal directed, top-down guidance would be required. To test this hypothesis, we need to do priming experiments with something other than singleton search tasks. Accordingly, this paper reports on a series of experiments with a structure like Fig. 2 . Observers are asked to report the orientation of the stem of a \"T\" (left or right) in a succession of trials where a T is present on every trial. The color (or, in Experiments 4 and 5, the shape) of the T is irrelevant. However, that color can repeat, as in frames 1-2 in Fig. 2 , creating a \"run\" trial or it can switch, as in frames 2-3 in Fig. 2 .",

Many of the relevant studies involve conjunction searches. In those experiments, observers were typically searching for a target with one of two combinations of color and orientation. For instance, the target might be either red and vertical or green and horizontal while the distractors are green-vertical and red-horizontal items. It is known that such two-target tasks are typically much slower than simple conjunction search tasks (Wolfe, 1992) . Several studies found additive (3C) priming effects in such experiments (Hillstrom, 2000; Kristj\u00e1nsson et al., 2002) . Becker and Horstmann (2009) found a modest change in slopes (3D).

            "text": "These conjunction experiments differ in one important way from the standard priming of pop-out (PoP) experiments. In PoP, the observer's task and target remain the same across the trials (e.g., observers would report the orientation of the line in the diamond or, perhaps, in the color singleton (see Fig. 1 )). In the conjunction experiments, in contrast, the target changes on Switch trials. This would also change the relevant feature guidance. Imagine that you were searching for a red vertical target. You could guide your attention towards stimuli that are red and/or vertical and you would find the target fairly efficiently (Wolfe et al., 1989) . If the target on the next trial was also red and vertical, those guiding settings, if preserved, would continue to work. If you knew that the target was in Fig. 1 Examples of a sequence of singleton searches of the sort popularized by Theeuwes (1991) Fig. 2 A sequence of inefficient search trials in which observers would report on the orientation of the T, present on every trial one color subset, you could make a volitional change in your top-down guidance (e.g., Kaptein et al., 1995) . If the target had switched to green and horizontal, the initial guidance for red and vertical would fail. At that point, you could change your guidance to green and horizontal and conduct another efficient search, albeit a search slowed by the failed search for red vertical. Alternatively, one might decide not to guide attention at all, leading to inefficient search. In Wolfe (1992) , the two-target conjunction task produced shallow slopes that were several hundred ms slower than search for just one type of conjunction targets. This suggests that observers choose to do two sequential guided searches rather than abandoning guidance and performing a single, unguided search for a target. The task switch from one set of guiding signals to another may well account for some of the very large priming effects seen in the earlier conjunction priming papers.",

There is no need for any deliberate task switching when the color of the T switches from one color to the other. Any difference between Run and Switch trials would be more akin to the PoP effects seen in the singleton experiments. In the five experiments presented below, the data favor the answer illustrated in 3C. There is evidence for priming in search tasks and that priming appears to be transient, speeding response but not decreasing the slope of the RT \u00d7 Set Size function. A very similar task was used by Lamy et al. (2008) in a study focused on contextual cueing in clinical populations (schizophrenia and depression). Their observers also looked for a T among L in displays with a color variation that was not relevant to the task. Observers were faster when the target color repeated on successive trials and this priming effect did not interact with the display set size (as in Fig. 3C ). The point was mentioned briefly in that paper as it was not a primary focus. In the present paper, we examine this question in detail.",

Firstly, they provide evidence for a modest (20-40 ms), but clear color priming effect in a relatively inefficient search task where the color is irrelevant to the search. As noted earlier, the bulk of the search priming literature concerns singleton searches where the actual search is extremely efficient. The first deployment of attention is often the only relevant deployment of attention in such tasks. In the present experiment, observers are making multiple deployments of attention. The data are consistent with a priming effect that only influences the first of those deployments, as if the observer was saying (implicitly): \"Oh, the last target was red. I guess I will start with a red item.\" The data are also consistent with an effect that occurs after the search is complete, as if the observer were more willing to commit to the final response if the irrelevant color of the current target matches the color of the previous target. Experiment 1 does not produce the very large priming effects seen in some of the conjunction priming experiments. We assume that this is because, in our task, switch trials did not require a switch in target type (the target was always a T). Only the target color might change between trials.",

There was a 50% chance that the target color on the next trial would match the color on the current trial. In Experiment 2, we changed the transition probability to 25% so that the color of the current trial was a fairly reliable predictor of the color of the next trial. If the target was red on one trial, there would be a 75% chance that the target would be red on the next trial. In keeping with our power calculations, we aimed for 12 observers, but thirteen were tested and are reported here. All other aspects of the methods were the same as in the localization version of Experiment 1. The experiment was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ht5rj/) where the data are also posted. Figure 5 shows that the results for Experiment 2 are very similar to those for Experiment 1. In this case, the main effect of the Run/Switch variable was marginal (F (1, 12) = 4.392, p = .0580, partial-eta-squared = .268). There was the usual effect of set size (F (2, 24) = 31.83, p < .0001, partial-eta-squared = .726). With nearly identical slopes in the Run and Switch conditions, the interaction of Run/ Switch with set size remains insignificant (F (2, 24) = 0.1592, p = .6595, partial-eta-squared = .013). Because the probability of a Switch was only 0.25 and the chance of a Repeat was 0.75 on each trial, Experiment 2 produced a significant number of runs with lengths from 1 to 5 (where a run of 1 is a Switch trial). This allowed us to test the possibility that priming might alter the slope of the RT \u00d7 Set Size function after multiple trials of the same color. However, an ANOVA with run length as a factor showed no systematic effect on slopes (F(8, 96=1.704, p = .1072, partial-eta-squared = .124). This analysis does produce a significant main effect of run length (F(4, 48=3.258, p = .0192, partial-eta-squared = .214).",

That is, perhaps searching for a red T is no more efficient than searching for a T with predictive color stimuli. If that were the case, it would not be surprising if priming failed to improve the efficiency of search. Accordingly, in Experiment 3, we included a standard guided condition as a control condition. In that condition, observers looked for a red T on every trial. Knowing that the target was always red, they should guide toward red item (Egeth et al., 1984) . We made several other methodological changes in thinking that they might enhance priming. Figure 6 cartoons a sequence of trials. In this experiment, observers search for a T that can be red, green, or black. This means that, if priming guides attention to the primed color for the duration of the next trial, only one third of the letters will be in the primed color and it should be easier to see an effect on slope of the RT \u00d7 Set Size functions. We also changed the response. Now all letters were tilted and observers were instructed to report if the stem of the T was tilted top-left or top-right. Observers answered by pressing the corresponding keys on the keyboard (either the left or right arrow key). If they responded incorrectly, the trial was removed from analysis. Observers were tested for 20 practice and 300 experimental trials. The probability that the color of the T would remain the same on the next trial was 50%. In addition to this block of trials, observers ran a second block of trials in which all Ts were red (standard guided condition). Observers were told explicitly to search for red Ts in this \"Guided Search\" condition. Observers were tested for 20 practice and 300 experimental trials in the Guided Search block, as well. Block order was randomized across observers. In all other particulars, Experiment 3 replicated Experiments 1 and 2. The experiment was inadvertently not pre-registered. However, the data are posted at OSF (https://osf.io/qvd87/). Figure 7 shows that the basic priming results were replicated again. There is a clear priming effect of about 80 ms (F(1, 9) = 27.87, p = .0005, partial-eta-squared = .756), but, as before, it is additive with Set Size. There is no evidence for an RT \u00d7 Set Size interaction as there would be if there was a slope difference between a Run and Switch trial (F(2, 18) = 0.09, p = .91, partial-eta-squared = .011). To assess whether these stimuli produce standard color guidance, we use all the trials, Run and Switch, to create an \"Unguided\" function (dotted line in Fig. 7) and we compare that to the results for the Guided block of trials in which all of the targets are red. Note that the distractors were identical in the Guided and Unguided blocks of trials. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 7 , there is a very robust effect of color guidance: both as a main effect (F(1, 9) = 36.97, p = .0002, partial-eta-squared = .804) and, importantly, on the interaction of guidance with set size (F(2, 18) = 5.995, p = .0101, partial-eta-squared = .400). The interaction reflects the decrease in the slope of the RT \u00d7 Set Size function from 34 to 20 msec/item. If guidance were perfect, we would expect the slope to be reduced to about 11 msec/item because only 1/ 3rd of the items would be relevant in the guided search. Nevertheless, the results clearly show a robust effect of color guidance. Fig. 6 Example of a sequence of trials for Experiment 3",

The sustained feature guidance that we are failing to find here would be an example of an early, feature priming effect in which the color of the previous target guides the deployment of attention on the current trial. The alternative response-or retrieval-based account, proposes that priming occurs after the target is found but before the response is made (Huang et al., 2004) . The observer checks on the last response and their response is faster if that response is the same as that previous trial, slower if it is not. One marker for this late-stage account is an interaction between feature repetition and response repetition. We can look for that interaction in the data for Experiment 3 since the orientation of the target T is unrelated to its color. An ANOVA with Stimulus color and Response direction as factors shows the main effect of stimulus priming (F(1,11) = 10.9, p = .007, partial-etasquared = .50). There is no main effect of response repetition (F(1,11) = 0.80, p = .39, partial-eta-squared = .07). The critical interaction of stimulus and response does not quite reach the 0.05 level of significance (F(1,11) = 4.4, p = .06, partial-etasquared = .29). This suggestive result can be seen as generally supportive of Lamy et al.'s (2010) \"dual-stage account of inter-trial priming effects\" in Priming of Pop-out, where they argue that both feature priming and late response checking contribute to the pattern of RTs.

The shape of the T on one trial did not predict its shape on the next trial and each stimulus fit into a 50 \u00d7 50-pixel box. The stimuli were placed in a pseudorandom manner starting from the center column of the display. The first stimulus was placed at a random vertical position within the boundaries of the center column and each subsequent stimulus was placed in the columns directly adjacent to it. In this way, the display expanded in size from the center column. This process produced displays of roughly constant density but of different spatial extent. Larger set sizes occupied more real estate than smaller set sizes because they filled more columns.

We can only speculate about why the search was so inefficient. One possibility is that these stimuli produced particularly severe peripheral crowding effects (Levi, 2008; Strasburger, 2020) . Another is that these Ts and Ls were oddly hard to identify. In any case, the data are roughly consistent with a search in which observers needed to fixate on items at random until they stumbled upon the target. In a similar vein, it is surprising that the Sharp stimuli are harder to report than the Dot stimuli. It is possible that it was harder for observers to decide on the orientation of those items.

If priming had a transient effect on an attentionguiding \"priority map\", it could bias the first item selected in search. Guided Search (Wolfe, 2021) and many other models (Miconi et al., 2016; Moran et al., 2013; Schwarz & Miller, 2016; Scolari et al., 2014) propose that attention is deployed to the peak of a priority map (Fecteau & Munoz, 2006; Serences & Yantis, 2006 ) that receives input from several sources (Wolfe & Horowitz, 2017) . Awh et al. (2012) focused on three of those sources: Physical salience (bottom-up guidance), Current goals (top-down guidance), and Selection history (priming). Simple accounts of feature guidance would predict that guidance by a basic feature would bias attention toward that feature for the entire guided search. In that case, priming would be expected to bias the entire search toward the primed feature. This would have produced a reduction in slope on Run trials; the result that was not seen here.",

One of the puzzles concerning the role of bottom-up salience in visual search is why observers do not get fixated on salient but irrelevant elements in an image. Consider a chest X-ray, for example. A radiologist may be looking for the faint hints of pneumonia (low contrast and diffuse). The ribs, the spine, and the heart are all much more salient but the radiologist has no trouble directing attention to more task-relevant features. Similarly, in natural scenes, one would not want attention to get stuck on the highlights on glossy cars while you are looking for a street name (Einhauser et al., 2008; Henderson et al., 2007) . One possibility would be to attend to each salient item and then inhibit that location, allowing attention to less salient items (Klein, 1988 (Klein, , 2000 . However, the data indicate that we lack the ability to reliably inhibit all rejected distractors (Horowitz & Wolfe, 1998 . Moreover, in the radiology example, one would not want to assume that the radiologist looks at and inhibits all the salient bright spots before turning to the subtle stimuli that are the actual objects of the search.",

They argue that bottom-up salience has a transient impact on the priority map as is cartooned in Fig. 12A (red) . Salience effects rise rapidly, producing various attention capture effects, but then fade quite rapidly declining to a lower level though, presumably, not all the way back to baseline. It is probably a good idea to attend to highly salient items in the current scene, but then to let top-down, user-driven goals come to dominate an ongoing search in a more sustained manner. After all, the observer's goals for search ought to be sustained across the entire search. If you are looking for a red car, it would be foolish to stop guiding to red after the first deployment of attention. In Fig. 12A (blue), we show sustained topdown guidance by goals rising to a plateau and remaining there. It rises comparatively slowly since there is evidence that it can take a substantial period of time for top-down guidance to reach full strength (E. M. Palmer et al., 2019 ).",

The shapes of the time courses in Fig. 12 should not be taken as anything more than a cartoon. The idea is that priming would bias the first deployment of attention and/or of the eyes to items with the primed feature but that the attention guiding effects of this bias would fade fairly rapidly during search. An introspective feel for this sort of priming may be experienced in \"hybrid foraging\" tasks (Wolfe et al., 2016) like searching for specific pieces in a box of LEGO (Hout et al., 2022; Sauter et al., 2020) . Initially, the box is a jumble of pieces, but when you find one red window frame, suddenly the other red window frames seem to pop-out with increased saliency (Theeuwes and Van der Berg, 2013) . That salience is useful if you want to collect multiple LEGO windows. It can be overridden by top-down command, if it is time to look for something else.",

One way of thinking about search is as a series of decisions that can be modeled as diffusion processes (Hawkins & Heathcote, 2020; Ratcliff, 1978 ). An item is selected and information begins accumulating as to its identity as, in this case, a target, T, or a distractor, L. We can imagine that the threshold for concluding that an item is a \"T\" is higher when the color switches (orange) and lower when it does not (green). Higher thresholds take longer to reach on average. As a result, Switch trials will be longer, on average, than Run trials. In this account, the color of the target would not be expected to have an effect on the distractor threshold (shown in red). Distractors on each trial are some mix of target and non-target colors. Any effects of priming from the previous target attributes would be similar on each trial, regardless of the features of the target on the current trial. Thus, it would take about the same amount of time to reject a distractor on a Run trial as on a Switch trial. Since there is not a priming effect on each distractor, there is no effect of set size on RT.",

A number of researchers have endorsed the idea that there is a checking step before the observer is willing to commit to confirming the presence of a target. One could conceive of this as an act of retrieval from episodic memory as the observer seeks to confirm that this is what they were asked to find (Huang, Holcombe, & Pashler, H., 2004) . The target that was retrieved on the last trial could influence retrieval on the next trial, with faster retrieval for repeated responses. Of course, the priming effect does not need to be entirely attributed to an early process or a late process. As Lamy, Yashar, and Ruderman (2010) propose, both processes could be active. One way to look for evidence of a late process of checking on response is to look for an interaction between feature and response factors. In the present experiments, Experiment 3 shows a marginally significant interaction while Experiments 4 and 5 do not. However, these experiments were not designed to discriminate between early, late, or combined accounts of priming. So, while the data could be seen as favoring an early, transient feature priming account (e.g., Becker, 2007) , the data should not be seen as definitive on this point.",

(2002) invoked this sort of pre-search, perceptual processing to explain why it took longer to search a messy desktop stimulus than a clean one. In the present experiments, a perceptual account seems unlikely, because the visual stimuli are essentially identical (on average) on Run and Switch trials. Given that the task is the same on every trial, it is hard to see how an early visual pre-processing step could be influenced by the status of the preceding trial.",

In the two versions of Experiment 1, the motor response was related to the color in the 2AFC version (Fig. 4B ), but not in the Localize version (Fig. 4A ). If the additive priming effects were the result of motor response priming, we might expect to see the most robust priming effects when the priming feature was response related (Becker, 2007) . In fact, the priming effect is, if anything, a bit smaller in the 2AFC condition of Experiment 1 (avg = 27 ms) than in the Localize condition (avg = 40 ms). The difference is not significant (p = .33) and that difference would be in the opposite direction from the predictions of a motor response priming account. In Experiments 3-5, where motor response and color repetition were decoupled, there was no statistically reliable main effect of the motor responses. Moreover, a robust response priming effect might be expected to be larger (Miller, 1998) .",

One could reasonably assert that \"Feature-based attention \u2026 is all bottom-up priming\" (Theeuwes, 2013) , if one was talking about that first deployment. Even in that case, there is an argument, discussed in the introduction, about whether this bottom-up priming is completely dominant.
