Due to its rarity and uncertain definitions, people seek information about delayed ejaculation on the internet. YouTube is one of the largest video platforms preferred global for gathering medical information. We aimed to determine the quality of YouTube videos on delayed ejaculation. YouTube search was performed with the keywords \"delayed and retarded ejaculation\", and we recorded the first 400 videos according to relevance. The search results were saved in the playlist, and the first 400 videos were evaluated by two independent urologists. DISCERN and Global Quality Scale (GQS) were used to assess the reliability and quality of videos. Repeated (n = 17), off-topic (n = 279), non-English videos (n = 37), and videos with no audio (n = 16) were excluded from the study. The remaining 51 videos were evaluated. DISCERN and GQS scores were statistically significantly associated with video durations (r = 0.329, P = 0.018 and r = 0.349, P = 0.012; respectively). A statistically significant association was also observed between and DISCERN and GQS scores with video power index values (r = 0.466, P = 0.001 and r = 0.422, P = 0.002; respectively). 62.7% (n = 32) videos were low quality, 23.5% (n = 12) were intermediate quality, and 13.7% (n = 7) were high quality according to the GQS. Most of the YouTube content on delayed ejaculation was of poor quality. Physicians should be aware of this situation, and take the lead in bringing high-quality videos about delayed ejaculation to the community.",

However, due to the lack of randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled studies, no drug has been proven to be superior or effective regarding DE treatment [6] . Furthermore, there is no European Medicines Agency-or Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for treating DE. There is very little literature on the psychological aspects of DE and also little empirical evidence on psychological treatment efficacy. People thus may tend to seek information on the internet.",

In terms of ranking the same video list by two independent urologists and so that the previous search history does not affect the new search, we deleted the search history, when the YouTube search was performed from different computers. In addition, we have also canceled the memberships of previously subscribed medical YouTube channels so that they do not affect the search process. Since we aimed to evaluate the videos on delayed and retarded ejaculation, it was essential for the results of the study to find the videos most related to delayed and retarded ejaculation. Therefore, it was listed the first 400 videos by relevance (YouTube's default option). The search results were saved in the playlist, and the first 400 videos were evaluated by two independent urologists (TT and MY).

Although YouTube videos are easy and free to access, there is no mechanism by which to check their quality and accuracy. Anyone who is a member of YouTube can upload videos. These uploaded videos may be of poor quality and full of misleading information. On the other hand, 75 percent of internet users worry about whether such internet information is reliable [26, 27] .

Videos should therefore provide high-quality information within a reasonable period of time. VPI values correlated positively with GQS and DISCERN scores in our study.
