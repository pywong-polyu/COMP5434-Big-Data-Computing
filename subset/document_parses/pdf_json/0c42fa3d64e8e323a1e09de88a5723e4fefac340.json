            "text": "In Japan, suicide mortality has been improving from 2009; however, suicide remains one of the leading causes of death. Although previous studies identified solid relationships between governmental financial support for social welfare systems and suicide mortality, little attention is paid to how specific regional policies, designed according to regional cultural, economic, and social welfare situations, affect suicide mortality. Therefore, the present study analyses the relationships between the regional governmental expenditure of six major divisions and suicide mortality across the 47 prefectures in Japan from 2009 to 2018 using fixed-effect analysis of hierarchal linear regression with robust standard error. The expenditure in \"public health\", \"police\", \"ambulance/fire services\", \"welfare\" and \"education\" is associated with reduction in suicide mortality, at least in some statistical indicators, whereas expenditure of \"public works\" indicated the influence of increasing suicide mortality or had no effect. Welfare expenditure was the most predominantly effective among the six major divisions of regional governmental expenditure. In the welfare subdivisions, expenditure of \"child welfare\" and \"social welfare\" was effective in a reduction in suicide mortality, but expenditure of \"elderly welfare\" surprisingly contributed to increasing suicide mortality. Child welfare expenditure negatively impacted suicide mortality in wide-ranging generations of both males and females; the positive effects of elderly welfare expenditure reached were limited as working-age populations increased, but unexpectedly did not affect the suicide mortality of elderly populations. The relatively increasing expenditure of elderly welfare with the relatively decreasing child welfare are unavoidable due to the Japanese social issues associated with a declining birth rate and ageing population. Furthermore, the budget of that regional government that can modify its expenditure structure by making its own policies is limited since most regional governmental expenditure is composed of essential expenditure for maintaining and operating regional social welfare systems. Although severe social situations in Japan are still unoptimised, the present results suggest that scientific-evidence-based redistributions of welfare expenditure in regional governments can at least partially improve Japanese society and welfare systems.",

            "text": "Suicide is a major global public health concern, since suicide mortality is approximately 800,000, and the annual global-age-standardised suicide rate is 10.53 per 100,000 population [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Japanese public health concerns associated with suicide are more serious. Suicide victims in Japan rose to more than 30,000 deaths in 1998 and continued for a decade (at a maximum of 40.1 deaths per 100,000 males in 2003) [6] [7] [8] [9] . Following the collapse of the asset bubble in 1991 with the Asian economic crisis in 1997, macroeconomic status in Japan deteriorated, including increasing unemployment rate accompanied by increasing suicide mortality in Japan in 1998. During the early 1990s, suicide mortality of males in Japan was lower than that of European countries (17) (18) per 100,000 population); however, in spite of the improving macroeconomic status in Japan between 2003 and 2008, higher incidences of suicide mortality of Japanese males were sustained from 1998 to 2008 [6, [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, to clarify the impact of regional governmental policies on suicide mortality, the present study analysed the relationships between regional governmental expenditure of six major divisions, namely, \"public health\", \"public works\", \"police\", \"ambulance/fire services\", \"welfare\" and \"education\", and overall gender-and age-specific suicide mortality across the 47 prefectures in Japan between 2009 and 2018 using fixed-effect analysis of hierarchal linear regression with robust standard error.",

BDSR publishes annual suicide data on the basis of the following age groups disaggregated by gender: younger than 20 years old (10s), 20-29 (20s) , 30-39 (30s) , 40-49 (40s) , 50-59 (50s), 60-69 (60s), 70-79 (70s), and over 80 years old (80s) [11] . Annual prefectural suicide mortality is calculated by dividing suicide mortality per prefecture by the prefectural population (denominator) of the same years, obtained from the Regional Statistics Database: System of Social and Demographic Statistics of the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (SBMIAC) [28] . To eliminate small prefectural population artifacts, prefectural suicide mortality was calculated by using the empirical Bayes standardised mobile ratio method by using the empirical Bayes estimator for the Poisson/gamma model (v2.1) (National Institute of Public Health, Wako, Japan) (https://www.niph.go.jp/soshiki/gijutsu/download/ebpoig/index_j.html (Access on 14th August 2021) [29] . Annual standardised death rates for the suicide mortality (SDR) of males, females and both together were calculated on the basis of the Japanese age-dependent population composition in 2009 for males and females.",

Therefore, to explore the more detailed effects of education expenditure on suicide mortality, the replacement of the independent variable, education expenditure, into six subdivisions of education expenditure was analysed with a hierarchical linear-regression model. The hierarchical linear-regression model detected similar relationships between Models 2 and 3 ( Figure 5 ). The financial expenditure of health, and ambulance and fire services was negatively related to the suicide mortality of males and females together, males, and females ( Figure 5 ). The hierarchical linear-regression model also detected negative relationships between the subdivisions of education expenditure of prefectures and municipalities, and suicide mortality ( Figure 5 ). Kindergarten and elementary school expenditure was negatively related to the suicide mortality of males and females together, males, and females ( Figure 5 ). Social education expenditure was negatively related to the suicide mortality of males and females together and males alone, but not to that of females ( Figure 5 ). financial expenditure per capita of prefectures and municipalities, and suicide mortality ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ). The financial expenditure of public health, ambulance and fire services, and education was negatively related to the suicide mortality of males and females together, males, and females ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ). These results suggest that the increases in expenditure per capita of public health, ambulance and fire services, and education reduce suicide mortality, whereas the financial expenditure of public works, police, and welfare probably does not contribute to suicide mortality (Table 2 ).

The SLPFS also publishes subdivisions of welfare expenditure [30, 31] . Models 1-3 did not detect a significant effects of welfare expenditure; however, Model 3 results showed the importance of more fragmented analysis. Therefore, to explore more detailed effects of welfare expenditure on suicide mortality, the independent variable in Model 3, welfare expenditure, was replaced by four subdivisions of welfare expenditure, and they were analysed by hierarchical linear-regression model. Contrary to Model 3, the hierarchical linear-regression model detected clearly different effects of the financial expenditure of prefectures and municipalities between Models 3 and 4 ( Figure 5 ). Regarding welfare-subdivision expenditure, the expenditure of both social and child welfare was negatively related to the suicide mortality of males and females together, males, and females, whereas the expenditure per capita of livelihood welfare was not related to suicide mortality at all ( Figure 5 ). Contrary to our expectation, expenditure of elderly welfare was positively related to the suicide mortality of males and females together, males, and females ( Figure 5 ). related to the suicide mortality of males and females together, males, and females ( Figure  5 ). The hierarchical linear-regression model also detected negative relationships between the subdivisions of education expenditure of prefectures and municipalities, and suicide mortality ( Figure 5 ). Kindergarten and elementary school expenditure was negatively related to the suicide mortality of males and females together, males, and females ( Figure 5 ). Social education expenditure was negatively related to the suicide mortality of males and females together and males alone, but not to that of females ( Figure 5 ). Regarding the subdivisions of education expenditure, in Model 3, elementary school expenditure was related to the suicide mortality of males and females together, males, and females. In Model 4, the negative effects of elementary school expenditure were not detected ( Figure 5) . Similarly, in Model 3, kindergarten school expenditure was related to the suicide mortality of males and females together, males, and females, whereas in Model 4, the negative effects of kindergarten school expenditure on suicide mortality of males were not present ( Figure 5 ).",

Increasing expenditure ratios of public health and police contribute to decreased suicide mortality, but an increased public-works expenditure ratio elevates suicide mortality. The expenditure ratios of ambulance and fire services, welfare, and education did not affect suicide mortality. Contrary to the expenditure ratios, regarding the expenditure amounts of major divisions, increasing the expenditure of public health, ambulance and fire services, and education reduces suicide mortality, whereas the expenditure amounts of public works, police, and education do not affect suicide mortality. These tendencies were also consistent in analysing the dependent valuables with suicide mortality disaggregated by gender. Both police and ambulance systems play important roles in responding to suicide crises in the community [38] . Education and welfare expenditure also contributes to the prevention of suicide [26, 39] . Furthermore, the increasing expenditure of public works on infrastructure is traditionally considered to contribute to the improvement of economic and mental wellbeing via the generation of employment opportunities [37] . These discrepancies between the present results and previous findings suggest that the importance of analysing independent variables by both using the expenditure of the six major divisions and including the more detailed expenditure of subdivisions using hierarchical linear-regression model analysis.",

Therefore, in order to analyse the effects of regional financial expenditure on suicide mortality in more detail, we added the expenditure of subdivisions of education, which was a significant or negatively effective factor on suicide mortality in Model 3, and the expenditure of subdivisions of education with welfare in Model 4. In Model 3, the negative effects of public health and ambulance-and fire-service expenditure on suicide mortality were not affected by education-subdivision expenditure. Regarding the expenditure of education subdivisions, increasing kindergarten and elementary school expenditure reduces suicide mortality, but other subdivisions of junior and senior high schools and special schools did not affect it. The effects of social education expenditure on suicide mortality were clearly detected in the different responses of males and females since social education was negatively related to suicide mortality of males but did not affect that of females. Social education expenditure is composed of the construction of new and the improvement of existing educational facilities, and the salaries of educational officers for operating these facilities [30, 31] . Generally, Japanese females are less resistant to community-based contacts than males are [6, 12] . Furthermore, males are more socially affected than females are [40, 41] , resulting in enriching prefectural social community support programmes, including enlightenment programmes, to prevent male suicide mortality [8, 9, 12] . Therefore, the expenditure of social education probably reduces male suicide mortality by providing males with contact opportunities with the community to protect from isolation.",

The negative effects of elementary school expenditure on suicide mortality of males and females together, males alone, and females alone was removed by the additions of welfare subdivision expenditure. The negative effect of kindergarten school expenditure on the suicide mortality of males was also removed by the addition of welfare subdivision expenditure. In spite of a declining birth rate, the discrepancy of the results of Models 3 and 4 suggests that child care is a more severe burden issue of Japanese people than what our expectations were. Child welfare, kindergarten, and elementary school expenditure probably provides welfare support that is necessary for children and places to accommodate children during working hours, respectively. Japanese women are traditionally forced to play subordinate roles due to limited resources for childcare support and are prone to social isolation due to social childcare demands [6, 8, 9, 12] . Indeed, the enhancement of economic and social participation and the contribution of females reduce the suicide mortality of working-age females, but increase the suicide mortality of working-age males (20-50s), the elderly, and school-age populations [8] . In other words, vulnerable sociopsychological resources for childcare support in Japan negatively affect the work-life-family balance of both females and males [42] . These metamorphoses of the protective effects of education subdivision expenditure on suicide mortality are shown in the fact that the protective effects between social welfare and social education, and between child welfare and kindergarten education probably have a similar impact, but the impact of welfare is stronger than that of education. Therefore, the effects of welfare and education subdivision expenditure are dependent on the life-work-family balance.",

The discrepant effects of livelihood welfare expenditure on suicide mortality between the USA, England, and Japan are possibly dependent upon governmental systems for welfare. In Japan, social welfare is mainly for individuals with several disabilities. When social welfare cannot provide sufficient economic support, livelihood welfare provides additional support for individuals. Furthermore, livelihood welfare is composed a number of subdivisions, including assistances of life, housing, education, medical, pregnancy, and long-term care [43] .

However, the inhibitory effects of kindergarten and elementary school expenditure on suicide mortality were removed by child welfare expenditure. A survey of local public finance settlement published the expenditure of special, kindergarten, elementary, junior high, and senior high schools, and they were calculated per pupil. The results that education expenditure decreases the suicide mortality of both school-age populations and caregiver populations indicate the importance of social resources and places for children during working hours in the establishment of the life-work-family balance of individuals. Indeed, the suicide-preventive effects of education expenditure were removed by child welfare expenditure. Child welfare expenditure, which was composed of expenditure associated with subsidies for medicine, elimination of waiting lists and allowance, was calculated by the expenditure per individuals younger than 18 years in the survey of local public finance settlements. Against the Japanese social crisis of the declining birth rate and ageing population, according to the Outline of Measures for Society with Decreasing Birth Rate adopted by the Cabinet in 2015, child welfare expenditure has been increasing. Therefore, increasing child welfare expenditure contributes to the improvement of suicide mortality due to a reduction in the burden associated with child care [44] .",

In Model 5, the suicide mortality of males (10s) decreased with increased expenditure of special schools; in Model 6, the suicide mortality of males (10s) decreased by increased public health expenditure but not by that of special schools. The previous literature cannot explain the mechanisms of the complicated suicide mortality of males (10s) influenced by regional expenditure; however, this finding suggests that the countermeasure of physical or mental disabilities in males needs improvement. In Model 5, the suicide mortality of females (10s) was not affected by expenditure; in Model 6, the suicide mortality of females (10s) decreased with increased junior high school expenditure. A previous study reported the suicide mortality of females (10s) is caused by school-related motives, saying that it was negatively related to the minors rate per household, but positively to dual-income household rate [8] . Taken together with previous findings, the present results suggest that the enhancement of a substantial daily communication environment probably plays important roles in the mental health for school-age females.",

The special account of medical care for the elderly and the operating spending of welfare centres for the elderly are more than 80% in elderly welfare expenditure in many prefectures [30, 31] . Long-term care assurance reduces the suicide mortality of elderly females (80s), and of both males and females caused by health-related motives, which is most frequent suicide pattern in Japan. In 2017, the means of savings and liability per household were JPY 18 million and JPY 5 million, respectively. The means of savings and liability per household of elderly (older than 70 years old) were JPY 23 million and JPY 1 million, respectively; however, the means of savings and liability per household of populations younger than 40 years olds were JPY 6 million and JPY 11 million, respectively [45] . Therefore, the increasing expenditure of elderly welfare increases the suicide mortality of insolvent generations. In other words, reasonable and evidence-based welfare redistribution is required.",

We analysed the expenditure of the major six divisions according to public finance law on suicide mortality; the demonstrated results indicate that the targeted composition of regional financial expenditure probably defines more the expenditure impact on suicide mortality disaggregated by gender and age. Furthermore, we could not detect the impact of livelihood welfare; however, the most dominant livelihood protection in livelihood welfare includes financial, social, medical, and educational support for economic and socially vulnerable individuals (disabled, elderly, and young individuals). Therefore, to clarify the practical sociopsychological pathomechanisms of suicide, more fragmented regional financial expenditure should be restructured according to targeting, and its impact on suicide mortality disaggregated by gender and ages should be analysed.",

The expenditure of public health, police, ambulance and fire services, welfare, and education contributes to a reduction in suicide mortality, at least in some statistical indicators; however, the expenditure of public works displayed no impact or increased suicide mortality. The most effective expenditure in the major six divisions was that of welfare. In the expenditure of welfare subdivisions, child and social welfare expenditure was effective at achieving a reduction in suicide mortality, but elderly welfare expenditure contributed to increasing suicide mortality. The negative effects of child welfare expenditure reached a wide range of male and female ages, whereas the positive effects of elderly welfare expenditure were limited in the increasing in the working-age population positively, but surprisingly did not affect suicide mortality of elderly populations. Regional financial expenditure is essential for maintaining and operating social welfare systems, and it is difficult to drastically revise expenditure independently constructed via policies by regional governments, in addition to the declining birth rate and ageing population in Japan. Even if the relative increase in elderly welfare expenditure and the relative decrease in child welfare are unavoidable due to the social concerns associated with the declining birth rate and ageing population in Japan, we should explore the rational redistribution of welfare expenditure based on socioeconomic and sociopsychological findings.
