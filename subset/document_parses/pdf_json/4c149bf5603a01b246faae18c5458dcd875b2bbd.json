            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Infected people can spread SARS-CoV-2 to other people through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. A person may also get COVID-19 by touching a surface that has SARS-CoV-2 on it, followed by touching their own nose, mouth, and eyes. 1, 2 Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an essential component to safeguarding against COVID-19 crossinfection. Therefore, PPE is a current hot topic, probably the most talked about and sensitive subject during the current COVID-19 for healthcare workers working with COVID-19 infected patients. The shortage of PPE and inappropriate use of the equipment are the main problems related to PPE in the healthcare setting. 3 At the beginning, COVID-19 infected many healthcare workers, posing a big challenge for epidemic control. For instance, as of early March, there were over 2600 infected, with 13 dying in Italy as of March 20, 2020, and the infected number increased to 3300, and at least 22 died in China. 4, 5 Among the 19 staff members positively diagnosed with COVID, 88.3% developed psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period in Wuhan. 6 Although worldwide, millions of people stay at home to minimize the transmission of severe COVID-19, healthcare workers go to clinics and hospitals, putting themselves at high risk of COVID-2019. 4 As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerates worldwide, access to PPE for healthcare workers is a key concern. Medical staff are prioritized in many countries, but PPE shortages have been described in the most affected facilities. Some medical staff are waiting for equipment while already seeing patients who may be infected with COVID-19 or are supplied with equipment that might not meet requirements. In addition, they are anxious about spreading the infection to their family, which puts their personal safety at risk. 4 One of the precautions to be applied by healthcare workers during caring for patients with COVID-19 is the use of appropriate PPE. The WHO recommends implementing safety protocols for healthcare workers. However, basic PPEs are not always available in many health facilities dealing with COVID-19 patients. Many health facilities around the globe do not have access to an appropriate number of human resources and diagnostic and/ or therapeutic protocols to care for patients suffering from COVID-19. 7 Healthcare workers are dedicated to working in close contact with infected people with inadequate PPE during an outbreak of COVID-19. The majority of reported COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers might be due to poor safety procedures, inadequate access to PPE, diagnostic protocols, and inappropriate use of PPE. Therefore, this study was aimed at evaluating reality and perception about access to personal safety among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in a public hospital in West Shoa. As far as researchers' knowledge is concerned, there are limited studies on the access of personal safety during the COVID-19 pandemic in the study area. Hence, the study findings might help to highlight whether there is a need for essential PPE to care for suspected and/or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the study area to protect healthcare workers in the workplace.",

A descriptive cross-sectional study design was done on 100 randomly selected participants using the lottery method, using the study participant identification card as a sampling frame. All healthcare workers who were working and available during the data collection period were included in the study. The sample size was determined by the single population proportion formula and using the following assumption: The proportion (P) of previous study participants who had access to disposable gowns was 67.3% (Latin); the maximum acceptable error/margin of error (d) was 5%; and the level of significance was 0.05 = 1.96. Then the minimum sample size after adding a 10% non-response rate is 372. Then, proportional allocation was used to select the number of healthcare workers from each hospital.",

Our study aimed to assess the reality and perception of personal safety among health professionals in West Shoa, Ethiopia during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Many studies show that adequate training, proper use, and uninterrupted accessibilities of adequate PPE reduce the risk of infection when treating cases of COVID-19. 8, 9 Our results show that about 236 (65.4%) workers received training on COVID-19 infection prevention and controls. This finding is in line with the studies conducted in Ethiopia. 10 This may be due to the fact that both the studies were conducted in the same country that is using similar guidelines and policies to train human power. Inadequate PPE may put HCPs at risk of contracting the virus and infecting other healthcare workers and their families. This problem did not only exist in Ethiopia; it was also reported in China 11 and other countries. This study's findings showed that the majority of the healthcare workers had access to hand sanitizer, surgical face mask, and disposable gloves. However, there are healthcare workers that do not have access to KN95 face masks and facial protective shields as per WHO recommendation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding is similar to a study done in Latin America that reported access to PPE such as hand sanitizer (95%), disposable gloves (91.1%), disposable gowns (67.3%), disposable surgical masks (83.9%), N95 masks (56.1%), and facial protective shields (32.6%). In line with a study conducted in Latin America, our study findings showed that the majority of study participants had access to personal safety procedures and policies and had access to COVID-19 diagnostic and management processes. 7 When asked whether they had received adequate information regarding the use of PPE to protect themselves from contracting COVID-19, only 34.9% of the healthcare workers reported that they had always received adequate information. The remaining respondents never, rarely, or sometimes received such information. This funding is similar to a study conducted in April, 9, 12 suggesting the main reasons for this difference are frequent changes due to in national and international guidelines about the use of PPE during the course of a pandemic and a lack of clarity in information. Moreover, this study finding showed that the majority of respondents perceived there to be inadequate help from their hospital and nearby governmental health authorities regarding their wellbeing. The finding is similar to a study done in Latin America that reported healthcare workers in that country had inadequate help from healthcare authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. 7 Finally, this study had some limitations. First, the study focused on more general populations of healthcare workers rather than those who might have direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Secondly, the results of this study are based on a self-reported questionnaire using a cross-sectional design that might not represent the true situation. Lastly, the study was not designed for hypothesis testing since it is difficult to generate outcome variables but mainly to generate descriptive information.",
