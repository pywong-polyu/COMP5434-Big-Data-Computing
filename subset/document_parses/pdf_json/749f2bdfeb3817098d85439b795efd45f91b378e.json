Initial investigations included a complete blood count (with a differential count), clotting profile (prothrombin time, activated partial-thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio) and serum biochemical measurements (electrolytes, renal and liver biochemistries, C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase, glucose and procalcitonin). These laboratory assessments and chest radiography were performed regularly as clinically indicated. A real-time reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to detect a conserved region in the E gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 as well as other bat-associated SARS-related viruses (Sarbecovirus) as screening. (1) All positive samples were sent out to Public Health Laboratory Services Branch Centre For Health Protection, Department Of Health for confirmation by realtime RT-PCR targeting at SAR-CoV-2 specific RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase gene region. Microbiological workup, including sputum and blood bacterial culture, nasopharyngeal aspirate for respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens, and urine for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella antigen tests, were performed as appropriate.",
