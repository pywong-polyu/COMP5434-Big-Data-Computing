            "text": "Social scientists and psychologists take interest in understanding how people express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as natural disasters, political unrest, and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the first major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. We find that the optimistic, annoyed and joking tweets mostly dominate the monthly tweets with much lower portion of negative sentiments. The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities.",

            "text": "There has been unprecedented growth of information via social media which has been of interest to social scientists and psychologists in a better understanding of the human condition, psychology [1] [2] [3] [4] and mental health [5] . Social media platforms such as Twitter has been used as a medium for data acquisition for research in psychology and behavioural science [6] . It has also been used as a tool for predicting personality type [1, 2] , and understanding trends and backgrounds of users online [7, 8] . There has also been interest regarding how people express sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as natural disasters, extreme political viewpoints [9] , and terrorism [10] . For instance, in the case of a terror attack in Kenya [10] , Twitter became a crucial channel of communication between the government, emergency response team and the public. Sentiment analysis involves the use of natural language processing (NLP) [11] methods to systematically study affective states and emotion understanding of individuals or social groups [12] [13] [14] . We note that deep learning, which is a machine learning method, has been prominently used for NLP tasks. Apart from research in psychology, sentiment analysis has a number of applications such as understanding customer behaviour [15] , clinical medicine [16] , building better prediction model for trading stocks [17] , and elections such as the US Presidential campaign in 2012 [18] . Recently, there has been a trend of using deep learning-based language models [19] with training data from Twitter for sentiment analysis [20, 21] . One of the earliest works began using NLP methods such as n-grams with hash tags for building training data and machine learning methods such as Adaboost for sentiment classification [20] . Deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks have been used for sentiment analysis on Twitter [22] .",

Social media has played a significant role during COVID-19 which has driven researchers for analysis with NLP and machine learning methods. A study that used sentiment analysis via deep learning reported that World Health Organisation (WHO) tweets have been unsuccessful in providing public guidance [35] . There has been a study on sentiment analysis to study the effect of nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 outbreak in India where it was found that people took the fight against COVID19 positively and majority were in agreement with the government for the initial nation-wide lockdown [36] . Social media posts and tweets brings another level of understanding when combined with sentiment analysis. An example of topic modelling examined tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic identified themes such as 'origin of the virus', and 'the economy' [37] . Topic modelling has been used with Twitter based sentiment analysis during early stages of COVID-19 and sentiments such as fear was dominant [38] . In region specific studies, tweets from the United States was used to determine the network of dominant topics and sentiments [39] . Further work was done in case of China via bi-directional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) language model for trend, topic, and sentiment analysis [40] . Further region specific studies include community sentiment analysis in Australia [41] and sentiment analysis in Nepal [42] , where majority positive sentiments were found with elements of fear. In Spain, sentiment analysis reviewed how digital platforms created an impact during COVID-19 [43] . A study of cross-language sentiment analysis of European Twitter messages during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic found that the lockdown announcements correlate with a deterioration of moods, which recovers within a short time span [44] .",

Moreover, we use the BERT model to compare the results from LSTM and BD-LSTM models and then use the best model for COVID-19 sentiment analysis for the case of India. We use three datasets, which include India, along with the state of Maharashtra (includes Mumbai) and Delhi. We compare the monthly sentiments expressed covering the major peak of new cases in 2020. We present a framework that focuses on multi-label sentiment classification, where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once.

Word embedding can be obtained using methods where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. The process generally involves a mathematical embedding from a large corpus with many dimensions per word to a vector space with a lower dimension that is useful for machine learning or deep learning models for text classification tasks [46] . Basic word embedding methods such as bag of words [49] and term frequency inverse document frequency [50] do not have context awareness and semantic information in embedding. This is also a problem for skip-grams [51] that use n-grams (such as bigrams and tri-grams) to develop word embedding, and in addition allow adjacent sequences of words tokens to be \"skipped\" [52] .",

[53] proposed word2vec embedding which uses a feedforward neural network model to learn word associations from a text dataset which can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words given a partial sentence. It uses continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) or continuous skip-gram model architectures to produce a distributed representation of words. The method is used to create a large vector which represent each unique word in the corpus where semantic information and relation between the words are preserved. It has been shown that for two sentences that do not have much words in common, their semantic similarity can be captured using word2vec [53] . The limitation of word2vec is that it does not well represent the context of a word. Pennington et al. [54] proposed global vectors (GloVe) for word embedding as an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words by mapping words into a meaningful space where the distance between words is related to semantic similarity . GloVe uses matrix factorization to constructs a large matrix of co-occurrence information to obtain representation that showcase linear substructures of the word vector space. The embedding feature vectors with top list words that match with certain distance measures. GloVe can be used to find relations between words such as synonyms, company-product relations. Due to the awareness in ethics in machine learning, there has been a major focus on ethical issues in NLP. A recent study showed that GloVe can have gender biased information; hence, a gender neutral GloVe method has been proposed [55] .",

In this way, two independent LSTM models allow both backward and forward information about the sequence at every time step. This enables better access to long range state information which have been useful for word embedding [67] and several other sequence processing problems [67, 69, 70] .",

Transformers also use an encoder-decoder architecture and have mostly been used for NLP tasks such as translation and text summarising [71, 72] . In comparison to conventional RNNs, transformers do not require data to be processed in a sequential order since the attention operation provides context for any position in the input sequence. BERT is a pre-trained transformer-based model for NLP tasks which has been used to better understand user behaviour in Google search engine [73] . BERT can be used for a number of other NLP applications such as clinical data processing [74] . The original BERT [73] has two models: 1.) BERT-base features 12 encoders with 12 bidirectional self-attention heads, and 2.) BERT-large features 24 encoders with 16 bidirectional self-attention heads. These are pre-trained from unlabeled data extracted from a corpus with 800 million words and English Wikipedia with 2,500 million words, respectively. Word2vec and GloVe are content-free models that generate a single word embedding representation for each word, whereas BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word which makes BERT one of the best language models. Hence, BERT is suitable for our sentiment analysis tasks using tweets during rise of COVID-19 cases in India.",

We choose COVID-19 tweets from while of India along with two states which have been amongst the highest states of COVID-19 cases in 2020 (Maharashtra and Delhi). We process Twitter data obtained for India and related state as follows. We note that special phrases, emotion symbols (emoji's) and abbreviations are present in tweets, since language in social media has been rapidly evolving. Hence, we have to transform them for building the language model. Table 1 shows other words and emotions that are transformed. We note that since this is a case of India, where English is used in combination with some key indigenous Indian languages (such as Hindi). Hence, we transform certain words, emotions and character symbols expressed in other languages as well. Note that we use hand-labelled sentiment dataset (Senwave COVID-19 dataset) [45] which features 11 different sentiments labelled by a group of 50 experts for 10,000 tweets worldwide during COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this dataset, \"official report\" is classified as a sentiment although it is a topic. The next step involves converting each word into its corresponding GLoVe embedding vector, where each word is converted into a vector (300 dimensions in our case). We select GLoVe embedding since it has shown good results for language models with sentiment analysis in the literature [54] . The aforementioned vector from each word thus obtained is passed on to the respective LSTM models for training once the model architecture has been defined as shown in Figure 1 . We first evaluate our trained After training, the best model is chosen for prediction of COVID-19 tweets from India. Note that the framework features multi-label classification which has the ability to provide more than two outcomes at once; i.e. a tweet can be optimistic and joking at the same time. models (LSTM, BD-LSTM, and BERT) and then use it for COVID-19 sentiment analysis using test data (India, Maharashtra, and Delhi). As shown in Figure 1 , the trained model is used to classify 11 sentiments such as \"anxious\", \"sad\", and \"joking\". It is essential to have the right metric to evaluate the model for the given application. The outcome of a misclassification in a multi-label classification is no longer a correct or an incorrect instance as opposed to binary classification or multi-class classification [75] . In multi-label classification, a prediction that features a subset of the actual classes are considered better than a prediction that contains none of the actual classes; hence, this needs to be captured by the metric that captures the loss or gives a score. As given in the literature [75] , multi-label classification evaluation is typically based on 1.) binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss [76] which is a softmax activation combined with a cross-entropy loss; 2.) Hamming loss [75] which calculates loss generated in the bit string of class labels using exclusive or (XOR) operation between the actual and predicted labels and then computes the average over the instances of the dataset. The Jaccard coefficient score [77] provides a measure of the overlap between actual and predicted labels with their attributes capturing similarity and diversity. Furthermore, label ranking average precision (LRAP) score [78] finds the percentage of the higher-ranked labels that resemble true labels for each of the given samples. F1-score conveys the balance between the precision and the recall. F1-score has been prominent for understanding class imbalance problems [79] . In application to multi-label classification, two types of F1-scores are predominantly used. F1-macro is computed using the F1-score per class/label and then averaging them, whereas F1-micro computes the F1-score for the entire data considering the total true positives, false negatives and false positives [80] . We use a combination of these scores to evaluate our model results for the first phase of the framework where the respective models are trained.",

There is a similar pattern for case of Maharashtra (Panel b). The case of Delhi (Panel c) is slightly different as the first peak was reached in July with increasing tweets that declined afterwards and did not keep up with the second peak of cases in September. This indicates that as more cases were observed in the early months, there was much concern which eased before the major peak was reached and the number of tweets were drastically decreased. There could be elements of fear, depression and anxiety as the tweets decreased drastically after July with increasing cases, which we analyse in the following section. Figure 3 shows a visualisation of the number of bi-grams and tri-grams for the case of India. In case of bi-grams (Panel a), we find that the term \"corona -virus\" is mostly used followed by \"covid -19\" which are essentially the same. Next, it is interesting that the terms \"folded -hand\" are mostly used followed by \"positive -case\" and \"socialdistancing\". The term \"folded -hand\" shows Indian social and religious symbol that denotes keeping the faith, giving respect and also a sign of acknowledgement and appreciation. We note that the \"folded hand\" is an emotion icon (emoji) used predominantly in social media, and hence been processed as a text during prepossessing (Table 1) , which is actually is not a bi-gram from a semantic viewpoint. In order to provide better understanding of the context of the tweets, we give examples in Table 3 . In the case of tri-grams (Panel b), we find more information in tweets such as \"backhand -index -pointing\" which is an emoji; hence, we provide some of the tweets that fall in this category in Table 4 .

Note that a combination of emoji's such as \"backhand -index -pointing\", \"smiling -face\", and words have been used. (March to September 2020). In the case of India (Panel a), we notice that the \"optimistic\", \"annoyed\" and \"joking\" sentiments are the most expressed which also follows in the case of Maharashtra and Delhi (Panel b and c). We notice that the BERT model seems to capture more sentiments expressed when compared to the LSTM model, particularly the \"optimistic\", \"anxious\", and \"annoyed\" sentiments. We find that negative sentiments such as \"pessimistic\", \"anxious\" and \"sad\" have been least expressed. We find \"optimistic\" sentiment as the most prominent sentiment which is followed by \"annoyed\" and \"joking\". It is simpler to label \"optimistic\" and \"thankful\" as a positive sentiment, but it becomes increasing difficult when it comes to the sentiments \"joking\" and \"surprise\", when context information is not available. Hence, it is insightful to review the sentiments such as \"joking\" and \"surprise\" in relation to other sentiments expressed. We find a similar trend in the case of Delhi and Maharashtra (Panel b and c) which are subsets of data from India (Panel a), the only major difference is the number of tweets which is significantly lower due to their respective population. Since the BERT model provided the best results for the training data, we provide the results by the BERT model henceforward.",

These heatmaps essentially indicate how two sentiments have been expressed at once and provides more insights regarding the context of the negative and positive sentiments given in Figure 5 . Note that in Figure 5 , we found that the third most prominent sentiment has been \"joking\"; however, we were not sure if it is positive or negative sentiment. As shown in Figure 6 , we find that most tweets that are associated with \"joking\" are either \"optimistic\" (8680) or \"annoyed\" (10323), and some are also \"thankful\" (889). A much lower portion (below 500) are either \"empathetic\" or \"official report\" while \"joking\". Next, we review the sentiment \"optimistic\" and find that majority are either \"thankful\" (14230) or \"joking\" (8680). The \"optimistic\" tweets with negative sentiments are relatively minor, such as \"pessimistic\" (772), \"denial\" (143), and \"sad\" (349). Furthermore, a significant portion are also \"empathetic\" (2533). It is not common for one to make a statement that is optimistic and pessimistic at the same time; hence, this could be a wrong prediction by the model. However, it seems the model is making the right prediction when we look at the heatmap for the hand-labelled training datasets (Figure 4) , where such combinations of sentiments have been labelled by experts. We show examples of tweets of this case and compare with those that are optimistic and thankful in Table 5 . Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the number of occurrence of a given sentiment in relation to the rest of the sentiments for the case of Maharashtra and Delhi, which follows a similar pattern when compared to case of India (Figure 6) ). We note that the Senwave dataset which shows tweets worldwide ( Figure 4) follow a similar pattern than the case in Indian datasets when it comes to sentiments such as \"joking\" and being \"optimistic\" or \"joking\" and \"annoyed\". Senwave dataset also features cases of being optimistic and pessimistic at the same time (226 cases). This could be due to sentiments expressed in two opposing sentences in a tweet. We can infer that since such patterns are part of the training data, it cannot be an error in predictions when looking at the Indian datasets. Figure 9 provides a visualisation of the distribution of tweets with number of combination sentiments. We find that around 60% of the tweets have a singular sentiment. Moreover, about 25% of the tweets have two sentiment attached them and 14% have no sentiment attached to them. Furthermore, a small number of tweets have 3 or more emotions attached to them which indicates that much often, people do not show multiple emotions at the same time.",

As shown in Figure 9 , majority of the tweets have one sentiment, both in hand-labelled (Panel a) and predicted datasets (Panel b). This is followed by two sentiments, while a minority have 3 sentiments. We note that there is a significant portion of tweets with no sentiments and there are no tweets of more than three sentiments at a time. The study of emotions with technology has gained much interested in last decade which gave much progress in understanding sentiments. Trampe et al. [86] presented a study of everyday emotional experiences through an experience sampling smartphone application that monitored real-time emotions of more than 11,000 participants and found the group experienced at least one emotion 90% of the time with joy as the the most frequent emotion, followed by love and anxiety. The type of emotion would be highly dependent on the study region which featured Europeans with majority French participants. Cowen and Keltner reported [87] twenty seven distinct categories of emotions bridged by continuous gradients by data from emotionally evocative short videos with varying situational content. These studies contributed to better understanding of emotions given historical viewpoints about context and definitions of emotions and associations between them [88] [89] [90] [91] . However, we did not find any study that reviews the number of emotions that can be expressed at a time in relation to catastrophic events that keep changing with time, such as the rise of COVID-19 cases.",

Humour is expressed differently in different cultural groups, i.e. a tweet that may be humorous in USA may not be taken as humorous in India due to cultural and language dimensions. There are several studies about the effect of humour in changing cultural or regional settings [92] [93] [94] . A good example is that in orthodox Chinese literature, humour was not expressed due to religious taboo in ancient Buddhism which later eased with Zen Buddhism [95, 96] ; however, the Hindu literature had a different or eased attitude towards humour as expressed in ancient Hindu texts [97] . Although historic textual composition cannot be related to how tweets are expressed in India, it is important to note the cultural and language differences in how humour has been expressed.",

Social media networks have been active in monitoring how people express themselves in order to limit the rise of anti-vaccine sentiments. Furthermore, our framework's training data is based on tweets expressed worldwide, whereas the test data is based on tweets from India during the pandemic. There is a large language diversity in India and at times, people express themselves with a combination of languages with geographic and culture specific jargon.

We selected tweets from India as our case study and reviewed tweets from specific regions that included Maharastra and Delhi. We took advantage of COVID-19 dataset of 10,000 hand-labelled tweets for training the respective deep learning models. Our investigation revealed that majority of the tweets have been \"optimistic\", \"annoyed\" and \"joking\" that expresses optimism, fear and uncertainty during the rise of the COVID-19 cases in India. The number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak of new cases. Furthermore, the optimistic, annoyed and joking tweets mostly dominated the monthly tweets with much lower number of negative sentiments expressed. We found that most tweets that have been associated with \"joking\" were either \"optimistic\" or \"annoyed\", and minority of them were also \"thankful\". In terms of the \"annoyed\" sentiments in tweets, mostly were either \"surprised\" or \"joking\". These predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities. The major contribution of the paper is the framework which provides sentiment analysis in a population given the rise of the COVID-19 cases. The framework can be used by officials for better COVID-19 management through policies and projects, such as support for depression and mental health issues.",
