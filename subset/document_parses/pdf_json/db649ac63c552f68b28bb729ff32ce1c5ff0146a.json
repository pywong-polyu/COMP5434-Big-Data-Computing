Since then, coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly across different continents with a large number of people being infected in a short period of time, thereby challenging the healthcare system capacity and resources throughout the planet, such that on March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic [2] . Countries adopted different response strategies according to the speed of contagion and local characteristics of affected cases [3] . Intriguingly, significant differences have been reported in the demographics, clinical features, admission rates, need for intensive care admission, and overall outcomes among different countries and settings [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The arrival of the virus to Latin America posed a great challenge and became a focus of attention and concern for the WHO [9] . The first case of COVID-19 in Argentina was reported on March 3rd, 2020. A national lockdown was imposed on March 20th, 2020 with various levels of implementation across the country, and is still in effect at the time of submission. To contain the COVID-19 spread, the government implemented a national lockdown as of March 20th, 2020, with various levels of implementation across the country, and is still ongoing at the time of submission. On July 31st, 2020, the Ministry of Health released a report stating the reinforcement of the health system by increasing the number of ICU beds by 40%, including professionally trained staff and critical care support infrastructure. Twelve new modular hospitals were opened in the geographic areas where most COVID-19 cases seemed to be concentrated. On January 10 th in 2021, the Ministry of Health reports indicated a total of 1,714,409 confirmed cases, with 1,504,330 patients having recovered and 44,417 had died.",

Furthermore, there is only a paucity of studies reporting the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients in Latin America [11, [14] [15] [16] . The COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant challenge particularly in low to middle-income countries (LMIC) of the region, as interventions such as social distancing are challenging if not virtually impossible to implement in large overcrowded urban areas, and issues such as concurrent dengue outbreaks and limited testing capacity may further impede efforts to stop the spread [17] . Understanding features associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and adverse prognostic factors is therefore crucial to guide local health authorities in their quest to allocate their resources more efficiently and avoid over-stressing the already constrained healthcare system. The goal of the present exploratory study is to describe the clinical characteristics and severity of disease at the time of their initial evaluation of a large cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 over the initial 6 months since the first case was declared in Argentina, and to report on patient outcomes while assessing for potential underlying risk factors associated with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or with death.",

Notwithstanding the fact that the majority of the C1 cases occurred in young subjects with no comorbidities, multivariate analysis identified a cluster of risk factors associated with adverse outcomes with many of these being similar to those reported elsewhere [4] . The most frequent symptoms in this large cohort were fever and cough, followed by headache and odynophagia, with anosmia and dysgeusia being less frequent, and predominantly occurring among milder cases (please note that these two symptoms were only included in the case definition several months later). Nevertheless, hospital admission was required in 20% of the cases, while ICU care was reported in a small percentage of patients, albeit accounting for approximately 50% of the mortality. Although only a minority of cases had a clinical or radiological diagnosis of pneumonia on admission, a diagnosis of severe pneumonia was associated with poorer prognosis. Patients admitted to ICU were older with a male predominance. Age, comorbidities, and several symptoms on initial evaluation-particularly coma, dyspnea and confusion-were also associated with ICU admission or death.",

However, the ICU mortality rate in this study was high (56.2%). ICU mortality in COVID-19 patients varies widely among the published case series, ranging from 16% to 78% [20] . The CFR of 5.3% reflects the inclusion of cases with complete data, which were also the most severe. A less stringent CFR estimate including all the cases (i.e., C1 and C2) would have resulted in a CFR of 2.7%. Reported CFRs varied from 0.2% in Germany to 7.7% in Italy [21] . The CFR in this study may reflect a younger population with less burden of comorbidities, hospital admissions with a broader case definition, lower pressure on the healthcare systems as cases mostly concentrated in large metropolitan districts with more resilient healthcare systems and expanded hospital bed capacity, attenuated community transmission and improved adherence to lockdown measures during the period covered by this study. However, the ongoing propagation of the outbreak and the ensuing strain on healthcare may lead to radical changes in CFR, since more vulnerable healthcare systems in smaller towns and provinces with less resources may be more adversely impacted and more stressed [22] , similar to the observed trends in other countries in the region [23] .",

Frequency of these symptoms was higher in our series than the pooled prevalence of 15.0% presented in a systematic review of the literature [31] . Table 3 . Association between clinical features of cases and adverse outcome (Intensive care unit admission or death) (n = 207079, p values < 0.05 unless specified otherwise). Presence of tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, a clinical picture of pneumonia, or the presence of respiratory failure or severe pneumonia were indicative of poor prognosis. Similarly, neurological symptoms such as mental confusion, coma, and seizures were also associated with higher mortality. The presence of encephalopathy in COVID-19 has been attributed to tissue hypoxia, metabolic derangements with agitation and confusion, and these were reported in 5.1% of cases [32] . In this study the prevalence of confusion, coma and seizures was 1.5%. In our series, only 3.5% of cases had radiologic or clinical evidence of pneumonia on initial evaluation. While a majority of COVID-19 patients presented with mild illness and are not diagnosed with pneumonia, opacities in CT have been reported in up to 55.4% of non-critically ill patients [10, 33] . Previous case series have reported that computed tomography is more sensitive than chest X-ray for the detection of pulmonary involvement [34] . Initial chest X-ray may be normal in up to 63% of patients who may later develop clinical or radiological signs of pneumonia [35] . The low frequency of diagnosis of pneumonia may reflect a limited use of CT scans in the evaluation of mild cases in our clinical settings.

The factors associated with such unique susceptibility are unclear and may reflect genetic elements altering the immune response to the virus [36, 37] . Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and smoking were present in a lower proportion than findings from local population-based studies. The National Risk Factor Survey found a self-reported prevalence of hypertension of 34.7%, as well as 25.3% for obesity, 12.7% for diabetes and 22.5% for current smokers [38] . It is plausible that the exposed population during a period of national lockdown was composed mainly of those employed in essential activities, and this group would therefore be younger and suffer from less comorbidities than the general population.

After an adjusted analysis, the association with these risk factors remained significant in line with the findings of other studies [13, 39, 40] . Our findings suggest that comorbidities and age were independently associated with adverse outcomes, thereby corroborating other studies [11] . Asthma has been found to be prevalent among patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 but has not been consistently associated with a poorer prognosis [6, [40] [41] [42] . Our results are in line with these findings, albeit pointing to reduced risk for asthmatic patients, as heterogeneously reported for other countries of Latin America as well [43] . A history of smoking was not associated with the composite adverse outcome. Meta-analyses have found that current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications, disease progression and a higher mortality rate [44, 45] . Considering that the prevalence of smoking in our population is lower than reported by national surveys (22.5% in adults), smoking status may have been unreported in proportion of our sample yielding underestimates of its potential contribution.",

Such possibility could, if of significant magnitude, affect the overall frequency of complications or adverse outcomes related to infection with the virus. In addition, referral and clinical bias could also be a limitation for our study. Indeed, we had no access to hospital record data to include laboratory results or detailed clinical course. Data on symptoms and comorbidities can be incomplete due to the nature of a registry based on point-of-care case report forms. Furthermore, definitions of comorbidities and clinical diagnosis were not standardized. Given that the case definition used to decide whether to perform an rt-PCR test evolved, data on symptoms were subject to variability. Cases with atypical presentations, such as apyrexia or anosmia could have been missed in the initial stages of the pandemic since they were not considered in the case definitions. As previously mentioned, in the early stage of this registry a significant proportion of suspected COVID-19 cases were admitted to hospitals regardless of severity, consequently increasing the proportion of admitted cases. Associations obtained from our regression model should not be considered causal, as some degree of unmeasured confounding and reporting bias can be expected, particularly in the context of a cross-sectional design.",
