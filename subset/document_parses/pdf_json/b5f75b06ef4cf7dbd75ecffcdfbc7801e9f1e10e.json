We tested three commercial sVNT (a qualitative immunochromatographic test and two quantitative immunoassays named YHLO and TECO) together with a conventional anti-spike IgG assay (bioM\u00e9rieux) in comparison Despite the good correlation between the anti-spike antibody titer and the titer of NAb by PRNT 50 , our results highlight the difficulty to distinguish true NAb among the anti-RBD antibodies with commercial user-friendly immunoassays.",

The qualitative test was rapidly discarded because of poor sensitivity and specificity. Areas under the curve of YHLO and TECO assays were, respectively, 85.83 and 84.07 (p-value >0.05) using a positivity threshold of 20 for PRNT 50 , and 95.63 and 90.35 (pvalue =0.02) using a threshold of 80. However, the performances of YHLO and bioM\u00e9rieux were very close for both thresholds, demonstrating the absence of added value of sVNT compared to a conventional assay for the evaluation of the presence of NAb in seropositive subjects. In addition, the PRNT 50 assay showed a reduction of NAb titers towards different VOC in comparison to the 19A strain that could not be appreciated by the commercial tests.",

In recent months, a large number of commercial immunoassays have been developed for the detection of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (1, 2) . However, the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies does not indicate whether the antibodies are able to neutralize the virus that has been reported to have a role in the protection from COVID-19 both in animals and humans (3) . The gold standard for assessing the ability of antibodies to prevent the virus from entering into susceptible cells is the virus neutralization test (VNT) (4), but it requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory and takes approximately 10 days to complete. This has led to the development of SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNT) that are more simple and rapid; these are based on the competition between patient antibodies and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein for binding to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that mediates the entry of the virus into susceptible cells (5) .",

A threshold of 20 and of 80 was used (PRNT 50 \u2265 20/80); the threshold of 20 of the live virus neutralization assay was considered as the detection limit of this assay. Thus, samples with PRNT 50 titers below 20 are considered as negative for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, the PRNT 50 threshold of 80 was a cutoff value assumed to discriminate high from low NAb titer.",

The two other quantitative sVNT assays evaluated in the present study were found to be more sensitive but their specificity was extremely low since, at the manufacturers' cutoff, most samples (TECO assay) or all of them (YHLO assay) from convalescent individuals with no detectable NAb using the live virus neutralization assay were positive for NAb with sVNT. It can be postulated that part of the antibodies detected by these ELISA are able to interfere with the interaction between ACE receptor and the viral RBD but not to prevent cell entry of the virus; this may be related to the affinity/avidity of antibodies that is reported to be low after primary infection or first vaccine dose (11, 12) , and is likely to be even more the case for the population included herein who were sampled 6 months after infection. Despite this low specificity, these assays correlated with the live virus neutralization assay as also found in other studies (5, 6, (13) (14) (15) . The low specificity could also be attributed to a lack of sensitivity of live VNT but it is rather unlikely that decreasing the threshold below 20 would be clinically relevant, such low titer having little chance to be protective in vivo (16) . In addition, the manufacturer positivity threshold was determined using pre-pandemic serum without any anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",

Our data from ROC curves would indicate that, for the detection of NAb, a threshold of 70 IU/ml and 30 AU/ml should be applied for the TECO an YHLO assays, respectively. However, these data have been obtained from infected subjects late after infection, at a time where antibodies are decreasing (17) . This could explain the low frequency of sera with detectable NAb using the VNT, and also the discrepancy in terms of specificity between our results and previous ones using samples earlier after infection (18) (19) (20) (21) . With time, waning of antibodies could have more impact on the blocking of infection than interference with ACE binding. The study of Von Rein et al (22) suggested that the correlation between sVNT and VNT was greater at higher level of neutralization titer and they concluded that sVNT are only useful when inhibition was above 50%, which is more consistent with our data. Most of the previous studies used the cPASS assay from GeneSript,showing the correlation of competitive immunoassay to live VNT, with good sensitivity and specificity compared to VNT (5, 6, 9, 14, 15, 19, 20, 22, 23) . Only a few studies reported results with the TECO (15, 20) or YHLO assays (7, 8, 21) . Of note the study of Chan et al (21) found a diagnostic cutoff, with the YHLO assay, of 27,7 AU/ml, which is closed from ours of 30 AU/ml.",

            "text": "Other studies have compared VNT and sVNT with assays detecting IgG binding to RBD or S proteins and observed a correlation between them (6, 8, 9) . Fisher et al. (6) found that the correlation between sVNT and antibody binding assay is better for samples with high than low PRNT. Others studies have shown that the correlation between VNT and antibody binding assays was lower than between sVNT and antibody binding assays (9) . It remains that high-throughput live virus neutralizing assays is not possible, and for this binding or competitive antibody immunoassays could be used but caution should be taken when interpreting the result, regardless of the assay used. Despite the high performance, based on the AUC of the ROC curve, of the two competitive automated immunoassays evaluated in our study, taking VNT as gold standard, we did not demonstrate any added value of sVNT compared to serological assay detecting anti-RBD IgG for evaluating the presence of Nab in seropositive subjects. These results highlight the difficulty to distinguish the Nab among anti-RBD IgG using a standard immunoassay. This difficulty could be further extrapolated considering the antibodies able to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using serum collected one month post full vaccination in patients with high Nab titers, we confirmed the diminution of Nab titers against different SARS-CoV-2 variant compared to initial strain. Nevertheless, the RBD coated in these competitive sVNT is not adapted to virus evolution and are not able to detect the decrease of NAb titers. To date, VNT remains the only way to detect Nabs against VOC. Taking together, from our data and those previously published, the predictive value of surrogate neutralization assays is still not obvious in all population (infected and/or vaccinated, after priming or boost immunization, early versus late after immunization). In addition, sVNT are not able to predict neutralization of variant, and thus improvements are needed before they can be considered equivalent to VNT to detect NAbs able to protect from infection.",
