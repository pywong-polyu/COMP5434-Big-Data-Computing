Suspected cases of COVID-19 are presented with dry cough or chills or sore throat with shortness of breath with or without fever 2, 3 . Altered mental state is also reported as an atypical manifestation of COVID-19. 4 Some high-risk individuals include immunocompromised patients, people with underlying diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, liver and kidney disease, malignancies, respiratory diseases, and obesity. 5 Acute respiratory syndrome is the main indication of the disease, which in severe cases includes 20%-41% of hospitalized patients. 6 Hypercoagulability, and pulmonary embolus along with increased D-dimer are associated with worse prognosis of the infection. 7, 8 Patients with COVID-19 presented with acute respiratory failure and severe pulmonary involvement require intubation 9 Indications for intubation include severe hypoxia (PaO 2 < 40-SpO 2 < 60), severe respiratory distress, moderate-to-severe respiratory acidosis, respiratory rate greater than or equal to 36, and disturbed hemodynamics such as hypotension without response to fluid therapy and associated with bradycardia. 10 Many patients with acute respiratory failure die despite intubation and ventilation ( 11 During the Iran-Iraq War in Iran 12 percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) was used instead of intubation for a number of patients suffering from acute respiratory syndrome and pulmonary involvement due to chemical bombardment, which turned out to be an appropriate therapeutic response. 13, 14 Due to the lack of response | 1015 MARZBAN-RAD et Al. to appropriate treatment in many patients with COVID-19, herein we present the cases of PDT after intubation failure.",

To perform PDT, after performing the necessary specialized consultations in terms of cardiac conditions, by placing the roll under the chest, the neck is placed hyperextension, where half of the trachea is outside the thoracic entrance. The patient is then placed under local anesthesia by injecting lidocaine in the anterior and middle-lower part of the neck. After lubricating tracheostomy tube and the dilator, a small gauge needle is inserted in the trachea between carotid cartilage and sternal notch. A sheath is passed over a guided wire, after which the guided wire is withdrawn. A 1-cm incision is made, where after dilation of the soft tissue, tracheotomy tube is placed. One skin suture is made on each side of the tube to secure it.",
