At the beginning, the current pandemic aroused many questions for patients with RDs, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In these patients, many factors associated with the disease were matter of concern, such as the well-establish role of viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus) in SLE pathogenesis(6-8), the higher susceptibility to infections(9), the risk of SLE flares after viral and bacterial infections (10) , the presence of organ damage directly caused by SLE, the use of glucocorticoids (GCs), and immunosuppressive regimens.",

The comparisons of continuous variables between groups of patients were assessed through Welch two sample t-test or Mann Whitney nonparametric test, as appropriate. The association between categorical variables was assessed by performing Chi square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. In order to identify subjects with similar profile and the association among the categorical variables, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was carried out (22) . This multivariate analysis can also be seen as a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA) when the variables to be analysed are categorical instead of quantitative (23) . No further modelling was conducted because of the limited number of individuals in each level of the investigated outcomes. A p value lower than 0.05 was considered as significant.",

It seems now evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a viral phase and a subsequent immunological response, supporting the hypothesis that the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is a result of the heterogeneity in the immune reaction to the virus itself. The critical aspect of the most severe form of COVID-19 is the loss of the immune tolerance, leading to an exacerbation of the inflammatory components (the so-called cytokine storm) (24) . In this regard, several therapeutic immunomodulatory approaches (e.g., tocilizumab), usually administered in RDs, have been considered in the context of COVID-19 (25) . While overall results are still inconclusive, probably due to variability in dosing and heterogeneous inclusion criteria, it seems that some anti-rheumatic agents could have a role in the management of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

She was treated with low-dose prednisone and hydroxychloroquine. Two years later, corticosteroids and antimalarial treatments were progressively stopped as sustained remission had been achieved. Regular follow-up visits confirmed persistent clinical remission with mild complement reduction, ANA positivity, and inconstant anti-DNA positivity since 2020. In March 2020 she developed malaise, cough, and fever (maximum 38.5\u00b0C -no swab for SARS-CoV-2 performed -no specific therapy prescribed). In May 2020 fever and cough recurred, a lung computed tomography (CT) showed bibasilar consolidations, (swab for SARS-CoV-2 negative, SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, CRP 6.4 mg/dL). The suspicion was SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia since the patient had been treated with several courses of antibiotic therapy with incomplete resolution of the clinical manifestations and persistence of bibasilar consolidations. In July 2020 she received a diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis and levothyroxine was started. At the end of November, for a new recurrence of chest pain, fever, and cough (swab for SARS-CoV-2 negative), a new lung CT was performed with evidence of multiple parenchymal consolidations and several nodules (Figure 1). A transbronchial lung biopsy revealed severe granulomatous inflammation with some multinucleated giant cells.

Here, we have reported the case of a female patient with a mild form of longstanding SLE in stable remission who developed a severe and atypical form of vasculitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This may suggest that in patients with an altered immunological substrate, SARS-CoV-2 may trigger immunological manifestations different from those expected.Our study has some limitations, namely the number of patients included and the retrospective study design. Laboratory parameters were available only for some patients (e.g., IL-6 were available for less than half of the patients) and at different time points after the SARS-CoV-2 infection: these aspects prevented the drawing of conclusions about the impact of the infection on inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, ferritin\u2026). In addition, because of outcoming information, our behaviour (e.g., increased GCs, immunosuppressant suspension) might have changed over time and among centres towards SLE patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The analysis is part of a study to collect observational data from SLE patients, that was approved by the Ethics Committee Comitato Etico Milano Area 2 (approval no. 0002450/2020). All consecutive adult patients (over 18 years old) referring to participant centres with a diagnosis of SLE who had SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. All patients provided written informed consent. SLE diagnosis was made in accordance with the 1997 SLE classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology or those of the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology(18,19). Patients were considered to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection if a direct PCR on swab and/or a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 resulted positive. Patients were excluded if they had an overlap syndrome (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and SLE).Data regarding demographics, clinical and serological features of SLE, including organ involvement, disease duration, autoimmune profile, on-going treatment, disease activity before and",
