Traditional power dynamics favoring the knowledge production mechanisms within academic institutions rather than knowledge generation by the members of minority communities persist due to the systemic racism that continues to shape and impact legislation, relations, and health outcomes in these communities [2, 3] . As a result of this power dynamic, researchers have excluded minority populations by labeling them as hard to reach, and are just recently beginning to create methods and strategies to meet the needs of people of color [4] . However, these methods are largely gleaned from Black adult women, and thus relegate youth and Black men even further into the margins.",

Being overweight or obese can lead to chronic health conditions in life, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and even death [6] . The ASPIRE Study, with funding from the National Institute of Nursing Research, seeks to test an intervention using technology and individualized health coaching to achieve weight loss, increase exercise, and overall healthier nutrition habits in Black young adults aged 17 to 25.

To address this need, the research team identified potential student groups and local organizations within the local community college network. To identify these groups, the research team pulled contact information from the college's student club list, looked for affiliated social network pages, and browsed upcoming events on the college website. Additionally, the project's Community Advisory Board (CAB), made up of students, faculty, and staff with the goal of appropriately informing research activities and data dissemination in the college community, has played an integral role in identifying clubs, initiatives, and resources that will expand the reach of recruitment efforts.",

In creating recruitment flyers, the project assistant looked at examples of successful research flyers, while also considering specific elements such as color, use of messaging, and photographs that would appeal to the target audience. These flyers were presented to the team of co-investigators, as well as the CAB, and have been modified according to feedback. The flyers are accompanied by one of eight possible gain-framed messages, inviting students to participate in the study for various beneficial reasons (see Table 1 ). Gain-framed messages incorporate the benefits of performing a specific behavior, whereas loss-framed messages focus on the negative consequences of not performing the behaviors and typically activate feelings of racial discrimination [4, 9] . Each gain-framed message incorporates a different theme of behavior change that has proven salient in research recruitment efforts with men and Black women respectively [11, 12] . Each week, the project assistant sends a flyer paired with a message to 100 Black students at the community college, as well as a different flyer-message pair to another group of 100 students. Additionally, the coordinator sends follow-up emails with new flyer-message pairings to approx. 200 students from the previous week(s).",

People of color have been disproportionally affected by the coronavirus, and thus, we prioritized minimizing disease risk through exclusively recruiting individuals through online, passive methods, and conducting eligibility screenings over the phone [13, 14] . Through convening our CAB, we developed online recruitment methods, such as engaging on social media accounts and delivering presentations at online meetings of student organizations. We have also amended subject lines in our emails to emphasize the accessibility of the study by labeling it as an \"at home fitness program.\" Recruitment has been active since December of 2020. The team has emailed approx. 2300 students, and has yielded slightly above a 3% response rate, which is on par for similar direct mailing messaging campaigns [10] . Efforts have been made to stratify email lists by gender in an attempt to specifically target black males with flyers and messages that have been designed for them. These emails include images of black men participating in exercise and messages focusing on building muscle and personal/community empowerment [15, 16] . Stratified by gender, the overall response rate for women is just over 2%, while the response rate for men is just above 0.5%. The most effective frames by perceived gender identity were Muscularity and Bulk (1.3%), and Community Impact and Empowerment through Health Knowledge (1.3%) for contacts that the research team perceived to be male. For contacts that the research team perceived to be female, the most effective frames to date are Physical Appearance (2.1%) and General wellbeing (1.8%).",
