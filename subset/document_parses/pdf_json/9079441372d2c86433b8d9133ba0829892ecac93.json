Inevitably, without proper control measures, viral diversity increases and multiple infectious exposures become common, when the pandemic reaches its maximum. This harbors not only a potential threat overseen by simplified theoretical arguments in support of herd immunity, but also deserves attention when assessing response measures to increasing numbers of infection.",

The simulations are adjusted to reflect roughly the situation in the USA. We assume a phase of general contact reduction (\"lockdown\") at the beginning of the epidemic and additional case-isolation measures. We study the hypothetical effects of varying enhancements in morbidity and mortality, different likelihoods of multi-infected individuals to spread multiinfections and different susceptibility to multi-infections in different disease phases. It is demonstrated that multi-infections lead to a slight reduction in the number of infections, as these are more likely to get isolated due to their higher morbidity. However, the latter substantially increases the number of deaths. Furthermore, simulations indicate that a potential ",

Thus, overemphasizing the merits of herd immunity while downplaying its dangers. Typically, the implicit assumption of permanent immunity is made, but the decline of antibody levels and cases of COVID-19 reinfections suggest that immunity can be only temporal [12] . Moreover, elevated mortality due to shortages in healthcare resources including hospitals and ICUs is not accounted for and neither is the effect of permanent health damage and their derived long-term medical costs-for example medical costs for illnesses of the respiratory system in the Federal Republic of Germany amount to almost 5% of the healthcare costs in 2015 (see [13] , Chapter 4). Furthermore, indirect costs burdening the social system, e.g., expenses for working disabilities, are nethermost properly addressed. Importantly, an uncontrolled pandemic spread will render the virus endemic, facilitating the emergence and spread of novel variants that differ in their contagiousness and response to antibodies [14] [15] [16] .",

Travel and contact restrictions that reduced contacts by 55% were assumed from day t Dist 1 \u00bc 50 (early March). These were lifted on day t Dist 2 \u00bc 115 (mid-May), after which a period of relief (with contact reductions of 22%) was assumed until t Dist 3 \u00bc 190 (late July). Afterwards, a 'hard lockdown' started, which was as severe as the original restrictions (55%). This lockdown was sustained until October 1st (t Dist 4 \u00bc 255), followed by a moderate relief (contact reductions of 45%) during the US elections until November 5 (t Dist 5 \u00bc 290). A second \"hard lockdown\" (65% contact reductions) was assumed after the US election until thanksgiving holidays (t Dist 6 \u00bc 309). During the holidays, a relief period (55% contact reduction) was sustained for 7 days (until t Dist 7 \u00bc 316), after which the hard lockdown was continued with 60% contact reductions until December 10 (t Dist 8 \u00bc 325). Then a severe pre-holiday-season lockdown started (70% contact reductions) for 10 days (until t Dist 9 \u00bc 335). Contact reductions were relieved (55%) during the holiday season from December 20 (t Dist 9 \u00bc 335) until January 8, 2021 (t Dist 10 \u00bc 354). Finally, a hard lockdown with 65% contact reductions was assumed until mid-April 2021 (t Dist 11 \u00bc 450), reflect more restrictive epidemic management under the new administration. For simplicity-and to be able to study the effect of the vaccination-after day t Dist 11 \u00bc 450, all general contact reductions were lifted in the simulations in the default scenario.

Fig 7A-7C shows the outcome of simulations assuming five different levels of general contact reduction beyond day t = 450 until the end of the simulations. The effects fall into two categories: (i) for p Dist below 30% a third wave occurs in the next winter; (ii) for p Dist above 45% incidences stay low throughout the simulated interval until day 900. The effect of general distancing results in a delay of the epidemic peak, whose height depends on seasonal fluctuations in R 0 , with higher R 0 leading to a higher peak (cf. [35] ). The less restrictive distancing after t = 450, the earlier the \"third wave\". Without any distancing it would peak before the seasonal effect of R 0 is maximal, while low levels of distancing would delay the peak until the onset of the flue season. This would result in higher numbers of infections and higher mortality. In this case multi-infections are disproportionally increased as multi-infections mostly occur if many individuals are infected at the same time. Also, a contact reduction of p Dist = 30% after day t = 450, yield a higher epidemic peak compared with the default case of no contact reductions after t = 450. However, the peak occurs in spring 2022 when R 0 is declining, so that the overall number of deaths is lower. Nevertheless, high epidemic peaks are undesirable, because they overwhelm the health care system. For distancing of p Dist = 45% the number of infections are low almost until the end of the simulation period but a peak may occur later. Also, the compound effects of multi-infections were investigated by contrasting the scenarios of Fig 7A-7C with the analogous situations in which multi-infections do not differ from single-infections in terms of morbidity (f Sick \u00bc f Sick ), mortality (f Dead \u00bc f Dead ), symptoms resulting in isolation (f Iso \u00bc f Iso ), and in causing multiple-infections (m \u00bc 0), as shown in Fig 7D-7F . The compound effects of multi-infections lead to slightly lower epidemic peaks, slightly fewer infections, but considerably higher mortality (cf. Fig 7A-7C with Fig 7D-7F) .

Frontline healthcare workers are exposed (i) relatively long to infected individuals, and (ii) to multiple infective contacts with different patients within a short time period. Such infections can lead to a higher viral load upon infection [18] , or super-infections with different viral variants during the course of the disease [20] . Notably, higher viral loads have been associated with more severe disease [17, 44] -in line with a high number of severe infections among healthcare workers [45] . A similar logic applies to persons in initial epicenters of the global pandemic, e.g., in skiing resorts in northern Italy [46, 47] . Multiple infectious contacts and longer (average) exposure to the virus is initially restricted to certain risk groups, but will become common during the pandemic peak.

[35] , http://covidsim.eu/), which incorporates general contact reduction during 'lockdowns' and case isolation. The model was extended to distinguish between single-infections, i.e., infections characterized by less viral diversity and lower viral load upon infection, and multi-infections.

In populations, in which age structure can be neglected this is sufficiently accurate. For models with an explicit age structure we refer to [49, 50] . In general, age structure can be modeled explicitly in a rather simple way. Important is that the contact behavior between age groups is modeled explicitly (not assumed to be random-such a model would be equivalent to a model without age dependency, but stratified into age groups), (iii) the complexity of the model, as R 0 has to be defined by the next-generation matrix (which can be done rather easily), but the description becomes much more complex.

However, the reduction in the number of infections has to be interpreted with caution: overall mortality is still higher due to multi-infections. Moreover, more infections are severe leading to an increased demand for medical care and potentially long-term health damages. Estimates of case fatality and disease severity at the onset of a pandemic, when multiinfections are rare, will therefore be underestimated. This also includes the estimated demand for medical capacities, treatment costs, and long-term costs due to permanent health damages. Our results show that depending on the level of further general distancing, epidemic peaks may be shifted into the flu season, leading to higher (and narrower) peaks. This disproportionally increases the number of multi-infections and hence deaths. The effects are mediated by (i) the increase in mortality in multi-infections, (ii) the likelihood of acquiring a second infection during the various infected phases (before immunity) is reached, and (iii) the increase in the likelihood of developing symptoms. Concluding, increased mortality due to multi-infections is a potential threat.",

After spring 2021, we investigated different levels of general contact reductions. Importantly, as default, we assumed no contact reductions after spring 2021 to illustrate how the epidemic would develop without interventions (reflecting a strategy aiming for herd immunity, i.e., no general contact reductions but sustained case isolation). Comparing this scenario with different levels of sustained contact reductions illustrated the importance of seasonal fluctuations in the base reproductive number. Namely, general contact reductions, shift the epidemic peaks. An epidemic peak that is shifted into the onset of the flu season is undesirable, as it will lead to a higher and narrower peak. In such a situation, multi-infections might lead to increased overall mortality, besides the fact that the healthcare system is much more challenged. Shifting epidemic peaks into the fading flu season leads to a substantial reduction of the number of cases, multi-infections, and mortality. The simulations have to be interpreted with caution. Seasonal fluctuations are unpredictable as well as human behavior during a pandemic. Therefore, our results elucidate qualitative mechanism rather than precise quantitative predictions.",

Therefore, the number of superinfections and derived deaths can further increase. Moreover, we did not consider selfimposed distancing measures, i.e., as the number of cases increases, individuals will avoid contacts, have a higher propensity to wear facial masks, etc. This has two reasons: (i) anticipation of human behavior would be speculative and can never be adequately captured by a model; (ii) we wanted to explore the effect in a scenario that aims for herd immunity.
