Objective: This study investigated the antiviral effects of YHPG in H1N1 influenza virus (IFV)-infected mice and its possible mechanism. Materials and methods: ICR mice were intranasally infected with 10 LD 50 viral dose of IFV and then oral administration of YHPG (6, 12, and 18 g/kg) or oseltamivir (positive control) once a day for 2 or 4 consecutive days, six mice in each group. The lung, spleen and thymus indexes of IFV-infected mice, the expression of viral loads and pathological changes in lung tissues were performed to evaluate the antiviral effects of YHPG. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot assays were used to determine the expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3. Results: LD 50 in mice was 10 \u00c03.5 /0.02 mL. YHPG (6, 12, and 18 g/kg) dose-dependently decreased the lung index and viral load; the inhibition ratio of lung index was 5.31, 18.22, and 34.06%, respectively. Further detection revealed that YHPG (12 and 18 g/kg) significantly attenuated lung pathological changes, and increased the spleen and thymus indexes. Moreover, YHPG significantly down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of Bax and caspase-3 in lung tissues of mice infected with IFV, and up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2. Conclusions: YHPG has significant antiviral effects in IFV-infected mice, partially by inhibiting influenza virus replication and regulating the occurrence of apoptosis induced by influenza virus infection, suggesting that YHPG may be a promising antiviral agent with potential clinical application prospects.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are major pathogens in humans and animals, and with their ability to cause seasonal epidemic and occasional pandemics in the human population that are responsible for significant morbidity and high mortality, they pose a considerable burden on the global health care systems (Paterson & Fodor 2012) . In addition, viral diseases cause many serious agricultural diseases throughout the modern era of veterinary medicine, and pose serious threats to the food animal production, which then have negative impacts on human health (Arzt et al. 2010) . The recent emergence of the avian influenza A virus (H7N9), the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09), the avian influenza A virus (H5N1), and severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), are important causative agents of viral pneumonia and have a significant impact on the national economy (Shinya et al. 2012; Simonsen et al. 2013; Kang et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2020) . Currently, the existing antiviral medications approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for management of influenza virus infections mainly include M2 ion channel inhibitors (e.g., amantadine and rimantadine), neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., zanamivir and oseltamivir) and RNA polymerase inhibitors (e.g., ribavirin) (Okomo-Adhiambo et al. 2013; Fatima et al. 2016 ). Despite their availability, possible side-effects, drug resistance, and compliance are the potential problems of these drugs (Okomo-Adhiambo et al. 2013; Wan et al. 2013) . Furthermore, the influenza A virus is susceptible to antigenic drift or antigen transformation and recombination, resulting in the emergence of new subtypes and lack of immunity in most populations (Wan et al. 2013) . For the influenza virus, theses pandemic strains that have been extensively altered by antigenic variation have prevented the production of universal vaccines (Sherbany et al. 2014 ). In addition, the high cost of effective and convenient therapeutic agents has also limited their clinical application. Therefore, there is still an urgent need to develop new anti-influenza drugs.",

            "text": "Apoptotic cell death is essential for embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and a well-functioning immune system, with aberrant apoptosis contributing to numerous disease conditions (Dewson & Kluck 2010) , and apoptosis is a genetically controlled process distinct from necrosis. It is characterised by chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, membrane vesicles, cell shrinkage, and finally formation of apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis can be triggered by a variety of physiological and pathological stimuli, and it widely exists in several immunosuppressive diseases of humans and animals (Puerto et al. 2010 ). Influenza A virus infection has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanisms of apoptosis are highly complex, involving an energy-dependent cascade of molecular events (Herold et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014 ). Viral infection and viral replication activate multiple cell signalling pathways. Influenza A virus infection induces typical apoptosis involving two main apoptotic pathways: the extrinsic or DR pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, which may be linked to each other . Influenza A virus generally causes caspase-dependent apoptosis based on caspase-3 activation, which participates in a tightly regulated proteolytic cascade (Wong 2011) . The BCL-2 family of proteins regulates apoptotic cell death in many cell types, and the balance between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic family members determines cell death or survival by controlling apoptosis (Tuzlak et al. 2017) . However, there are few studies about the possible apoptotic molecular mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of influenza A virus infection in vivo. For the above reasons, the regulation of apoptosis has become an important target for anti-influenza treatment.",

            "text": "The use of herbal medicine has been accepted in many countries including areas where healthcare systems have been improved, and medicinal plants as complementary therapies and as preventive medicine are becoming more and more popular in modern society (Mehrbod et al. 2018) . Traditional Chinese medicine, due to its minimal side effects, multi-target and multi-channel characteristics, has become the popular choice in the treatment and prevention of influenza virus infection. Ma-Huang-Tang (MHT), the prestigious and typical formula first recorded in Zhang Zhongjing's Treatise on Febrile Disease, is considered to be the classical prescription for virus infection and has been traditionally used to treat serious infectious diseases, including cough, pneumonia, and viral diseases (Saita et al. 2011; Nagai et al. 2014 According to the basic composition principle of Chinese traditional prescriptions -'monarch, minister, assistant, and guide', it has been reported that several components of YHPG and their constituents play antiviral and anti-apoptosis effects against several viruses. The flower buds of Lonicera japonica have the activity of inhibiting Coxsackie virus B3 and influenza virus in vitro (Kashiwada et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2015) . Ephedrae herba is a Japanese herbal medicine, which has a certain effect on the infection of influenza A virus infection in vivo and in vitro (Mantani et al. 1999; Kubo and Nishimura 2007) . Radix Puerariae Lobatae is proven to have antiviral activity against HRSV-induced plaque formation in airway mucosa mainly by inhibiting viral attachment and internalisation . Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma is an effective agent for antiviral, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis and inhibiting the influenza virus replication (Peng et al. 2013; Lin et al. 2015) . And the last, glycyrrhizin interfered with the replication of influenza virus, inhibited the expression of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, interfered with H5N1-induced apoptosis and reduced virus uptake in vitro (Wolkerstorfer et al. 2009; Michaelis et al. 2011) . In previous research, YHPG has been shown to inhibit the reproduction of H1N1 influenza virus in embryonic eggs as a mixture of six herbs in different proportions (Peng et al. 2005 ). In addition, YHPG has obvious protective effects on IFV-infected mice associated with alleviation of lung injury, regulation of cytokine production via NF-jB p65 activation and inhibition of TLR4-MyD88-TRAF signalling pathway in vivo (Peng et al. 2016a (Peng et al. , 2016b . In vitro, YHPG also has certain antiviral effects in IFV-infected RAW264.7 cells, which might be associated with regulation of inflammatory cytokines production, inhibition of TLR7-MyD88-IRF7 signalling pathway, activation of NF-jB p65, and modulation of the protein expressions of key effectors in the Type I IFN and PRRs signalling pathways (Du et al. 2017 (Du et al. , 2018 . Clinically, the Phase II and Phase III clinical trials of YHPG have been proved to treat infectious disease with good curative effect. But to date, the possible antiviral mechanism of YHPG against IFV-induced lung injury in apoptosis respect remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral effects of YHPG against H1N1 influenza virus infection in the ICR mouse model, and mainly investigated its possible mechanism focus to key targets Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 in apoptosis signalling pathway. Table 1 ), YHPG granules were prepared by water-extraction and ethanol-precipitation, and the quality control of YHPG was also performed by HPLC, as reported in our previous research. HPLC analysis was carried out at 210 nm for the determination of eight active components in YHPG, containing L-ephedrine (0.73 mg/g), D-pseudoephedrine (0.407 mg/g), chlorogenic acid (1.92 mg/g), amygdalin (6.37 mg/g), puerarin (4.35 mg/g), polydatin (1.79 mg/g), glycyrrhizic acid (0.692 mg/g) and emodin (0.329 mg/g), respectively (Supplementary Figure 1) (Peng et al. 2016a (Peng et al. , 2016b .",

Chinese herbal medicine has been used for the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases for thousands of years, especially in China and many other Asian countries clinical practice (Dan et al. 2013; Choi et al. 2016; Zhong et al. 2016 ). Compared with great majority of antiviral drugs consisting of a single component, Chinese herbal compounds with multiple components are considered to have multiple biological activities and multiple targets. Moreover, TCM has been widely accepted by some places in poor financial condition, especially in the treatment of chronic diseases (Zhang et al. 2012) . At present, the traditional Chinese herbal compounds used for the respiratory viral infection account for the majority of antiviral drugs on the market. Oseltamivir carboxylate, widely used in the treatment of influenza virus A or B infection, has high bioavailability and penetrability and is sufficient to inhibit viral replication (Zhu & Markowitz 2009; Davies 2010) . However, the emergence of oseltamivir resistance and the global spread of influenza viruses during the 2007-2009 emphasise the need for sustained surveillance of antiviral drug susceptibilities (Samson et al. 2013) . WHO recommends the use of oseltamivir as an antiviral western medicine against global influenza virus pandemic' outbreaks. In order to scientifically estimate the antiviral effects of YHPG, oseltamivir was used for a positive control in this study. As a modified Chinese herbal compound, YHPG has a variety of pharmacological effects, with the advantages of high efficiency, low toxicity, convenient utilisation and quality control. Previous researches have shown that YHPG has distinct antitussive, antiinflammatory and antibacterial effects (He et al. 2014; Wan et al. 2016) . Further, antiviral studies has demonstrated that YHPG has significant effects on ameliorating influenza virus-induced inflammation, inhibiting TLRs/MyD88 mediated NF-jB signalling pathway, and inhibiting influenza virus replication (Peng et al. 2016a (Peng et al. , 2016b . However, the antiviral effects and its possible mechanism of YHPG in the apoptosis signalling pathway are still obscure. In this experiment, we performed the antiviral effects of YHPG, then selected the key targets Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 in the apoptosis signalling pathway to explore its possible mechanism on mice with influenza viral pneumonia.",

As mentioned in the methods, a large number of studies have shown that lung index plays an important role in indicating the severity of lung tissue pathological damage in mice with influenza viral pneumonia (Deng et al. 2013) . After the influenza virus invades the body, it will cause damage to immune organs, which may lead to the occurrence of apoptosis (Wong 2011) . The spleen index and thymus index can be used as indicators of immune function to reflect the immune status to some extent. Pathological analysis revealed that inflammation and consolidation of IFV-infected mice increased significantly, which was consistent with our research (Qu et al. 2016 ). In addition, we also found that YHPG could inhibit influenza virus replication, reduce the expression of M1 gene, and M1 gene indicate the synthesis of influenza viral gene (Choi et al. 2017) . Therefore, it can be concluded that YHPG has significant antiviral effects in mice infected with influenza virus by regulating the lung index, spleen index and thymus index, inhibiting influenza virus replication, and alleviating lung pathological lesions.",

            "text": "Induction of cell apoptosis is a complex multi-factor reaction in the host defense and pathogenesis of IFV, and different influenza virus strains have different ability to induce cell apoptosis (Liu et al. 2014 ). As we know, apoptosis is an initiative process, which involves a series of functional significance associated with cell proliferation, influenza virus transmission, inherent host defense, and lung tissue damage during the viral replication cycle such as genes activation, expression and regulation (Herold et al. 2012; Pei et al. 2014) . Apoptosis also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, and too much apoptosis may lead to degenerative diseases and too little apoptosis may result in malignant cell death; moreover, defects may occur at any point in the apoptosis signalling pathway (Wong 2011) . Influenza virus usually causes caspase-dependent apoptosis activated by caspase-3, leading to nuclear export of newly synthesised viral nuclear protein (NP) and increased influenza virus replication (Takahashi et al. 2013 ); in addition, antiviral drugs may dampen apoptosis of H1N1-infected cells by reducing the functional activation of caspase-3 (Zhang et al. 2017) . Furthermore, the mitochondrial pathway is the main pathway of apoptotic cell death, mainly controlled by Bcl-2 family proteins, and the family members mainly include Bcl-2 and Bax, which have both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic effects (Dewson and Kluck 2010) . And the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax is considered to be a key indicator for estimating homeostasis states and mitochondrial membrane potential in cell survival (Malla et al. 2010) . To further understanding the antiviral effects of YHPG on lung epithelial cells of IFV-infected mice through inhibition of apoptosis, we used real-time PCR, immunohistochemical analysis and Western blot assays, which belonged to semi-quantitative, quantitative and qualitative analysis, to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3, which are the key targets in apoptosis signalling pathway (Puerto et al. 2010) .",

Compared with influenza virus infection control group, YHPG (12 and 18 g/kg) or oseltamivir significantly down-regulated the expression of Bax and caspase-3, and significantly up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. That suggests that YHPG could protect lung tissue of IFV-infected mice from apoptosis, and its possible antiviral mechanism might be associated with regulation of the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 in the key targets of the apoptosis signalling pathway.",

Although the exact antiviral mechanism of YHPG through inhibition of apoptosis remains to be further explored, our results suggest that YHPG exerts antiviral effects via regulating Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 associated with apoptosis in mice with influenza viral pneumonia, which may provide an effective and alternative approach for therapy of influenza virus infection in clinical trials.",
