Complex surgery, intensive care, transplants and immunosuppressive treatments all would be impossible if infection could not reliably be controlled. In the community, pneumococcal pneumonia still kills the debilitated, but no longer threatens the likes of Jane Austen's Marianne Dashwood. Along with earlier improvements in public health, modern medicine has made early non-violent death rare in advanced societies. Mean, median and modal life expectancies have converged (Figure 1 ) then extended. 1 The caveat is that latelife years of ill health have extended too, 2 giving a growing frail elderly population with chronic illness and cognitive decline, particularly in Europe, North America and East Asia. 3 These citizens are the frequent victims of opportunist Gram-negative bacteria, with accumulating resistance (Figure 2 ). 4 Until 2020 this medical edifice grew without major viral challenge. Influenza pandemics in 1958-59 and 1968-69 killed many but were terminated by a mixture of strain 'burnout' and vaccination. 5 HIV took a grim toll but was largely avoidable by personal precautions and now is medically manageable. SARS-CoV-2 has changed the dynamic, whether temporarily or more permanently.",

Laboratory escape is plausible too, as Wuhan hosts centres for coronavirus research, but is hotly disputed. 6 During January to February 2020, outbreaks occurred in China. By February/March infection was spreading in Iran, then Europe. The USA was hit next, with major outbreaks in the northeast, particularly New York and New Jersey. Extensive spread followed in the southern USA, Latin America and India. The pandemic peaked in northern Europe and the north-eastern USA in the early spring, with subsequent declines in infections, hospitalizations and deaths through the late spring and summer before a resurgence in the northern autumn and winter. Argentina, with the seasons reversed, showed the converse pattern, with peak deaths in October, at the end of the southern winter. With some exceptions, including a current (January 2021) upsurge in South Africa, these patterns broadly support the view that SARS-CoV-2 is transitioning from being a 'new pandemic virus' to an 'endemic winter respiratory virus', joining the four long-established coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) that account for 10%-20% of common colds. 7 A few countries, notably Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand, have effectively isolated themselves from the pandemic by a combination of entry restrictions and strict containment efforts whenever small clusters have been detected. Central Africa has been little affected.",

            "text": "Like other single-stranded RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is highly mutable, with over 20 000 sequence variants described. There is current concern about particular variants, including types that first circulated extensively in the UK (VUI202012/01 or B1.1.1.7), South Africa (1.351) and Brazil (P1). These appear to spread more efficiently and, in some cases, may have modifed vaccine-relevant Incidence of E. coli bacteraemia in England and Wales, by age. Data source: PHE. 4 Livermore i6 epitopes (see below); there are no substantiated data to indicate that they are more lethal. 8 Most COVID-19 infection is mild, inconsequential, and self-limiting. Many only learn that they have been infected when they are found seropositive. Even when virus is detected by RT-PCR, half record no symptoms. 9 Among those who do develop symptomspredominantly fever, cough and shortness of breath along with loss of taste and smell-recovery generally follows after 1 week. But, for a minority, pulmonary symptoms worsen, necessitating hospitalization and, in extremis, supplementary oxygen or ventilation. 10, 11 Death occurs in 40%-50% of ICU cases, 12 increasing with age, male gender, obesity, dementia, diabetes and cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. 13 Estimation of fatality rates is fraught, since most mild infections pass unrecorded. In October 2020, the WHO suggested that c. 10% of the world's population had been infected, 14 and that deaths had then reached 1 million. This indicated an infection fatality rate of around 0.13%. Ioannidis, 15 using seroprevalence data as the denominator, estimated 0.15%-0.2%. These statistics are reassuring but carry four caveats: (i) the proportion is significantly higher in countries with a large elderly population; (ii) sufficient severe cases can arise to overwhelm local or national ICU capacity, again especially if there is a large vulnerable elderly population; 16 (iii) outbreaks in elderly care facilities can kill extensively, as in the UK, Sweden, New York, Italy and Spain; [17] [18] [19] and (iv) even low mortality rates translate to numerous deaths in large populations. The aspects have dominated political debate, media coverage and policy response. As of this writing (January 2021) the UK NHS has around one-third of its beds occupied by patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, including more than half of its ICU beds, and is clearly showing stresses, emphasized in rolling 24 h news bulletins. Cold review of actual numbers gives a different perspective. From a UK population of 67 million, roughly 1.1 million (2%) were estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in early January, 20 and just 3000-1 citizen in 22 000-were sufficiently sick to need ICU care. In other words, the central issue is a shortage of ICU beds for the minority who become severely ill, and staff to support them, not that COVID-19 has a high fatality rate.",

            "text": "Most governments across Europe, North America and South America have enacted repeated 'lockdowns', closing the economy, confining populations and mandating social distancing. Reductions in deaths are attributed to these actions in China (strict lockdown), Europe and New York (varying strictness). 21 There is, however, considerable scope for scepticism. In the initial spring wave, UK deaths peaked on 8 April, 22 whereas lockdown began on 23 March, suggesting that new infections were already declining, assuming 19 days from infection to death (5-6 days incubation, .8 to hospitalization, 6 to death). Moreover, there is a remarkable similarity between the spring trajectories of death rates per million population between France, with a strict lockdown, the UK, with a less severe lockdown and Sweden, which had no lockdown beyond general advice on social distancing and restrictions on large events and bar-counter service ( Figure 3 ). The likely explanation is that viral seasonality, not lockdown, underpinned the declines in each country. In an extensive analysis, De Larochelambert et al. 23 reviewed deaths against lockdown stringency for 160 countries, finding little relationship and concluding that death rates largely reflected whether a country was in the temperate zone, typically had few deaths due to communicable diseases, and had a large elderly population for whom life expectancy was no longer extending. Strict lockdowns in seven Danish counties, enacted following discovery of a new variant in mink, had no greater effect than milder restrictions in four adjacent counties; 24 death and infection trajectories in North and South Dakota are almost superimposable, despite more extensive business closure restrictions (and mask mandates) in the former. Lockdowns have only worked convincingly where they were enforced very strictly against outbreaks that were tiny in global Others note that bacterial coinfection is rarer than in influenza 28 whilst a Swiss study found that 'early' antibiotics, before ICU transfer, had little benefit. 29 Some hospitals initially administered hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin against COVID-19 itself, though any benefits, and their mechanism, are disputed and the therapy has fallen into disfavour. 30, 31 ICU COVID-19 patients are usually intubated and face the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, mostly involving the Enterobacterales, Staphylococcus aureus and non-fermenters typical of this infection. Across five UK ICUs we found Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella aerogenes unusually prevalent in COVID-19 patients, 32 whereas a single-hospital French study found an excess of non-fermenters. 33 Ventilated COVID-19 patients often receive multiple antibiotic courses. At the height of the pandemic, stewardship policies were overridden, 26 with ICU capacity increased. A Spanish hospital reported increased antibiotic use. 34 Such data lead to concern that resistance may proliferate in hospitals as a result of COVID-19 pressures, though with scant evidence that it has actually done so. Resistance drivers in the community potentially may increase too. More general practice consultations are remote, and pre-COVID-19 studies suggest that US community physicians are more willing to prescribe antibiotics when consulted online for children 35, 36 though not for adults. 37 Delivery of childhood vaccines has been disrupted, 38 favouring resurgence of multiresistant vaccine serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Disruption of TB treatments will promote recrudescence, resistance and transmission of resistant variants, potentially leading to future treatment difficulties. This is an issue e.g. in India, where TB kills over 420 000 p.a., or around 2.5-fold more than COVID-19 to date (January 2021). 39 Dentists-long discouraged from antibiotic use-were reduced to the options of antibiotics, analgesics and extraction, with aerosolgenerating procedures forbidden. 40, 41 However, countervailing forces apply, reducing pressure for resistance. First, much non-COVID-19 hospital activity ceased during peaks of COVID-19 activity. 42 In some jurisdictions, particularly the USA, hospital staff were laid off. 43 The complex patients who are most vulnerable to multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria were no longer hospitalized. In the UK more people died at home and in care homes rather than in hospitals, where they likely would have received antibiotics. 22 IV antibiotic use in English hospitals, measured as DDDs, was 32% lower in April-May 2020 than in April-May 2019 (P. Howard, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, personal communication). Similarly, wholesale IV antibiotic shipments to US hospitals, as DDDs, declined 30.7% in the same comparison (A. Carr, Needham & Company LLC, personal communication) with only 4/36 products showing increases. These data suggest reduced use, though we cannot exclude distortions from stock management inside hospitals, and the decline was only 6.9% if the month of March was added to the comparisons. A more recent report, comparing January to November 2020 with January to November 2019, indicates reduction in unit sales of systemic antibiotics as follows: Spain, 2.1%; France, 3.6%; Germany, 9.3%; Italy, 14%; and the UK, 14.5%. 44 Reports of Escherichia coli bacteraemia to England's mandatory surveillance in the July to September quarter of 2020 were 13.4% below those of the same quarter of 2019, sharply reversing a rising trend. 45 The likely explanation is that many septic patients, who ordinarily would present to A&E, are failing to do so and are failing to receive IV antibiotic therapy. They may be represented among the persistently increased numbers of citizens presently dying at home rather than in hospitals. 46 Changes in incidence are much less marked for bacteraemias involving pathogens that are mostly healthcare acquired, specifically K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

Social distancing and travel restrictions reduce opportunities to catch and import 'super gonorrhoea'; 52,53 though closure of genitourinary medicine clinics 54 will facilitate the spread of any already circulating, and a study in Milan indicated no reduction in presentations for acute syphilis and gonorrhoea in early 2020 compared with 2019. 55 Social distancing and masks may impact community transmission of respiratory infections, reducing demand for antibiotics. The elderly often acquire pneumococci from grandchildren 56 and will not do so if families cannot meet. In Italy, discontinued medical monitoring of otitis media-prone children led to reduced antimicrobial prescriptions in the late winter, without apparent harm. 57 A final aspect, of uncertain impact, is the COVID-19-directed use of personal protective equipment.

Substantial vaccine failure (or unrealistic demands for complete suppression) could be met with indefinite restrictions on social interactions along with extensive track and trace systems.

Repeated exposure, together with modestly protective vaccines, should progressively reduce disease severity, especially among the young, who would age with SARS-CoV-2 as we all do with the four long-established coronaviruses. The difficulties with this model are (i) how best to protect the present cohort of mostvulnerable elderly, who lack both prior exposure and the ability to adapt, and (ii) how to re-educate a public that has been 'trained' to believe COVID-19 to be far more lethal than is actually the case. 66 There is one tantalizing hint of how a future that accepted spread might unfold: the 1889-94 'Russian influenza' pandemic. This is conventionally attributed to H2N2 or H3N8 influenza A, 67,68 based on the serology of elderly patients tested decades later. An alternative hypothesis is that coronavirus OC43 was responsible, having evolved apart from a bovine coronavirus shortly beforehand. 69 Like COVID-19 and unlike influenza, the 1889-94 infection selectively killed men, spared children 70 and caused loss of taste and smell. 71 Unlike earlier influenza epidemics it gave repeating similarly sized waves over 5 years, a point thought unusual at the time, and which seems exceptional compared with any influenza epidemic in the preceding 200 years or the subsequent 130. 72,73 Such a prolonged pandemic fits a model whereby prior exposure to other coronaviruses gives partial cross-protection, as now postulated for SARS-CoV-2, 74,75 but with cohorts regaining vulnerability as immune responses diminished, and perhaps experiencing more than one OC43 infection as immune-escaping mutants were selected. This is speculation, but the parallels are intriguing.",

Unless additional hospitals can be commissioned, and (the greater challenge) staffed, there will be considerable workload pressures, which are correlates of increased nosocomial infections, 78 antibiotic use, and resistance.

In the short term, the pressures would be rather different and would continue to resemble those that have pertained in the pandemic itself, both in respect of hospital workload being dominated by COVID-19 and with reduced hospital capacity caused by the needs (i) to socially distance beds, (ii) to cohort patients according to COVID-19 status, and (iii) for numerous staff to self-isolate following track and trace alerts. These factors may drive a shift to outpatient antibiotic therapy and long dosage-interval antibiotics, followed by rise in use, selection pressure and bacterial cross-infection once COVID-19 comes under control and hospitals move to clear their backlog.

On 29 September 1918, the troopship SS Leviathan cleared New York with 11 800 aboard. When she docked at Brest 10 days later, 2000 were sick with influenza, 1000 were stretchered ashore and 80 were dead; 15 more died in France. 97 For comparison, a COVID-19 outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt infected at least 1200 from a complement of 4000. 98 One died. The 1889-94 pandemic killed 125 000 in the UK, 27 000 in its 1889-90 wave. This was from a population of 33 million, or around half of today.

Sharp reductions in COVID-19-unrelated medicine, IV antibiotic use and travel are reducing short-term selection pressure nationally, though selection may be locally increased in stressed ICUs. The longer-term effects depend on the success of vaccines or, if they fail, on our response to this failure. If vaccines succeed overwhelmingly, a hectic period will follow as hospitals address a backlog, with some patients sicker than had they been treated earlier. Resulting pressures will promote resistance. If vaccines fail, or if unrealistic hopes lead to a perception of failure, a more atomized society will persist. This will favour oral, OPAT and long t1 =2 antibiotics, reducing hospital-centred selection and cross-infection. Travel will be reduced, limiting import of resistance. But such an approach is unsustainable except in an island choosing indefinite isolation. The d\u00e9nouement, sooner or later, will be relaxation, further COVID-19 waves, perhaps by vaccine-evading variants, then recovery and normalization.",

Newer antibiotics, including cefiderocol, address these.",

During 2020 the lira fell 85% on the dollar, inflation hit 50% monthly and the government was unable to pay healthcare providers. Hospitals suffered blackouts.
