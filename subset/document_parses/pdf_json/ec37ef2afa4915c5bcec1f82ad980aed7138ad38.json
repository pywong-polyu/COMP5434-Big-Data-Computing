The causes of LDH have not been fully elucidated but most likely involve a complex combination of mechanical and biological processes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a tool most frequently used for LDH because it can show abnormal soft tissue areas around the spine. Deep learning models may be trained to recognize images with high speed and accuracy to diagnose LDH. Although the deep learning model requires huge numbers of image datasets to train and establish the best model, this study processed enhanced medical image features for training the small-scale deep learning dataset.",

Some reports pointed out that 70-80% of adults have experienced lower back pain (Paolucci et al., 2019) . People experience lower back discomfort, sudden pain, or continuous stabbing sensation, and sometimes even more serious LDH symptoms that affect their daily activities and working performance.

            "text": "August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 708137 (Mbarki et al., 2020) . We used the object detection method with the dataset of sagittal view LDH images as a preliminary study. Despite LDH covering the most common clinic cases of lumbar disc bulging, protrusion, and extrusion (Y. J. Hung et al., 2014) , this study focuses on the detection of LDH regions rather than the prediction of symptoms with YOLOv3. Some reports showed an association among disc morphology, disc bulging, and protrusion at the L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 levels (Breton, 1991; I. Y. Hung et al., 2021) . Many asymptomatic people over 40 years old show disc bulging and protrusion (Brinjikji et al., 2015) . The introduction of severe LDH symptoms was insufficient to support deep learning in this study. The subjects were from market labor and general outpatients, presenting primarily lumbar bulging and protruding, to a lesser degree extrusion and sequestration. Therefore, YOLOv3 trains the object detection model with the lumbar disc regions from L1 to L5 associated with disc morphology features at the lumbar disc. It could be the reason for the results of high mAP and AP in this section. This result shows the future utility of this technology as well as possibilities to affect clinical workflow. From our point of view, this form of deep learning detection does not aim to replace any medical personnel but provide support in clinical decision-making through giving quickly accessible, additional information to speed initial investigation, and helping to focus on areas of interest. This will increase diagnosis speed and certainty before the team interdisciplinarily arrives at a decision regarding future operation or treatment (Yang et al., 2021) .",

The proposed method presents the ability to detect lumbar disc herniation and predict abnormal locations automatically. This method displays the high possibility of initial rapid tests in realtime and auto-detection of the lesion for the clinical diagnosis. This study employed YOLOv3 to detect small part object problems as LDH MRI with a limited dataset of 50-550 images.
