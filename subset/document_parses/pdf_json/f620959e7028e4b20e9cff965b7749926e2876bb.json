Crystal data reveals that Au (I), released from Au22Glutathione18 (GA), covalently binds thiolate of Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . GA directly decreases SARS-CoV-2 viral replication (EC50: ~0.24 \u00b5M) and intrinsically down-regulates NF\u03baB pathway therefore significantly inhibiting expression of inflammatory cytokines in cells. The lung viral load and inflammatory cytokines in GA-treated COVID-19 transgenic mice are found to be significantly lower than that of control mice. When COVID-19 golden hamsters are treated by GA, the lung inflammatory cytokines levels are significantly lower than that of Remdesivir while their lung viral load are decreased to same level. The pathological results show that GA treatment significantly reduce lung inflammatory injuries when compared to that of Remdesivir-treated COVID-19 golden hamsters.",

The SARS-CoV-2 M pro has been used as critical drug target for COVID-19 treatment as it plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and organic compounds have developed to yield a Michael adduct with Cys145 of the catalytic dyad of M pro (8, 9) . We speculated that Au (I) ion would yield a Michael adduct with Cys145 of M pro as previous reports showed that the Au (I) ion, released from gold compound, inactivates Echinococcus Granulosus Thioredoxin Glutathione Reductase via covalently bind with Cys519 and Cys573 (10, 11) . While gold compound, like Auranofin (AF), have previously been approved for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment as it well suppresses inflammatory cytokines of patients (12, 13) , no such treatment is currently available for COVID-19 treatment in vivo. Here, we propose a novel compound, Au22Glutathione18, for COVID-19 treatment via directly inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication and intrinsically suppression of inflammation cytokines expression. We set out to investigate if this gold cluster possesses therapeutic properties in mitigating the effects of COVID-19 infections.",

According mass spectra studies and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, the Au22Glutathione18 (GA) molecule formula is proposed in Figure S1 . We firstly study if gold compound (AF or GA) associates with hydrophobic domain surround the catalytic dyad of M pro via molecular dynamic (MD) simulations (SI 2). In this theory study, the crystal structure of M pro was obtained from the PDB database (PDB 6LU7). The AF and GA molecular structure were performed by using GaussView 5.0 and Gaussian 09 software packages. As shown in Figure 1A , there is one hydrophobic cavity with its volume over 500 \u00c5 3 in each M pro monomer, which surrounds the catalytic site of Cys145 (green or purple region of M pro monomer). In this work, we utilized AF or GA as ligand to complex with M pro . For the AF-M pro or GA-M pro complexing system, we studied the root-meansquare deviation (RMSD) to learn the binding stability. Obviously, the AF-M pro or GA-M pro reached binding equilibrium at about 10 ns, and the binding conformation remained stable afterwards ( Figure S2) . The average binding energy of AF-M pro and GA-M pro was ~50.47 kcal/mol. and ~722.94 kcal/mol., respectively ( Figure S3 ). The GA (yellow) and AF (orange) bind to the hydrophobic cavity around the Cys145, and this makes Au atom very close to S of Cys145 ( Figure 1B) . In AF-M pro system, Van del Vaals force plays main role to keep system stable where the Glu166 and Gln189 of M pro interact with AF via hydrogen bonds. While the electrostatic force contributes the main interaction in GA-M pro system in Figure 1B , Arg4, Arg40, Lys137 and Arg188 of M pro formed four salt bridges with glutathione of GA (with yellow S atoms).",

After M pro was fixed in chip, serial dose of gold compound (AF or GA) was introduced into solution and the time dependent optical signal were tracked. As shown in Figure 1C Figure S4 , and Table S1. In Figure 2A , the M pro molecular structures treated with AF or GA are highly similar, and share most features of the crystal structures of the apo SARS-CoV-2 M pro determined recently (8, 9) . However, crystal structural analysis showed that the densities of two Au (I) ions were found clearly to be very close to the thiol residues of Cys145 and Cys156 ( Figure 2B ). The position of two Au (I) ions was confirmed by applying the anomalous difference Fourier maps, two Au (I) ions are defined as Au(I) 1 and Au (I) 2, respectively. In Figure 2C and Figure S5 , the Au-S bond length is 2.3\u00c5 in M pro , such short bond length confirms that AF or GA can release Au (I) ions which covalently bind to the thiolate of Cys145 and Cys156 of M pro . The thiolate of Cys519 and Cys573 residues of Echinococcus Granulosus enzyme covalently interacts with Au (I) ions were previously reported (10), which supports Au (I) irreversibly interact with thiolate of Cys145 of the catalytic dyad of M pro in this study. Further temperature factor analysis shows that the occupancy of Au (I) ion is partial and the occupancy factors is about 33% for Cys145 and 11% for Cys156, indicating that the Au (I) ions released from AF or GA are gradually bind the thiolate of Cys145 and Cys156 of M pro molecules in solution.",

To further verify the covalently binding of Au (I) to the S atom of Cys145 and Cys156, we calculated the interaction energies between Au and M pro protein using density functional theory (SI 6) method. Our analysis showed that the bond dissociation energies (EBD's) between Au (I) and Cys145 are ~ 46.1 kcal/mol. and that of Au (I) and Cys156 are ~ 26.5 kcal/mol. In (Figure 2D .

The reported mice intraperitoneal LD50 for AF was approx. 33.8 mg/kg.bw (19) , and that for GA more than 2000 mg/kg.bw (all mice survived, see SI 8). The SD rat intraperitoneal LD50 for AF was found to be approx. 25.5 mg/kg.bw (19) , while that for GA approx. 576 mg/kg.bw (SI 8). Together, these animal toxicity and aforementioned cell toxicity data ( Figure S8 ) strongly suggested that GA is safer for mice/rats treatment than AF. We therefore continued investigation of GA in a COVID-19 transgenic mouse. To evaluate whether GA inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and suppress lung inflammation injury, the Ad5-hACE2transduced mice were generated according to recently published methods (20) . Briefly, eighteen BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups, namely GA (GA treated COVID-19 mice), NS (0.9% NaCl treated COVID-19 mice), Mock (0.9% NaCl treated mock infected-mice), all mice were anesthetized with pentasorbital sodium and transduced intranasally with 2. (Figure 4B) . We found that the average number of viral RNA copies in lung of GA-treated mice was ~10 4 , significantly lower than the average number found in NS-treated infected mice ~ 10 5 (Figure 4C) . The histopathological changes in mice lung tissues were assessed by grading the injuries in accordance with the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria (INHAND) scoring standard. As shown in Figure 4D , the GA-treated mice significantly reduced histopathological scores (~1.8) compared with that of NStreated mice (~3.0). We further evaluated the therapeutic effects of GA using histopathological analysis of mouse lung tissues. As shown in Figure 4E , mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed severe lung inflammation following treatment with NS, the alveolar septum, bronchus, bronchioles and perivascular interstitium were significantly widened, along with an infiltration of higher numbers of lymphocytes and a small number of neutrophils. In addition, a small number of lymphocytes and exfoliated epithelial cells localized in the lumen of local bronchioles following NS treatment. Treatment with GA significantly abrogated lung inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, the local alveolar septum, bronchi, bronchiole and perivascular interstitial widening significantly decreased. Although we still observed mild lymphocytic infiltration, the mucosal epithelium of bronchus and bronchioles was intact, and we failed to observe foreign bodies in the lumen in lung of GA treated mice.",

The lungs of hamsters were assessed by grading the injuries in accordance with the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria (INHAND) scoring standard. As shown in Figure 5D and 5E, the average histopathological score of virus-infected hamsters in NS group was approx. 3, the alveolar septum, bronchus, and perivascular interstitium were significantly widened, along with an infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils. For hamsters infected by SARS-CoV-2, treatment of Remdesivir in dose of 25mg/kg.bw got histopathological scores approx. 2.7, briefly the alveolar septum, bronchus, and perivascular interstitium were obviously widened, along with an infiltration of some of lymphocytes and neutrophils. Treatment of GA in dose of 10mg/kg.bw got pathological scores, approx. 2.3, and treatment with GA in dose of 20mg/kg.bw pathological score was approx. 2.0. GA treatment significantly decreased lung injury in comparison of Remdesivir treated SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters.

According histopathological results, GA in dose of 10 mg/kg.bw or 20mg/kg.bw is with better therapy outcome than Remdesivir in dose of 25mg/kg.bw. Next, we measured the level of SARS-CoV-2 spikes and inflammatory cytokines in lung of the hamsters using immuno-fluorescent imaging. As shown in Figure 5F , the SARS-CoV-2 spike expression level in GA and Remdesivir treated COVID-19 hamster was significantly lower than those found in NS group, and the spike level in lung of Remdesivir group is significantly higher than that of GA group. For inflammatory cytokine level in lung of virus infected hamsters, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 of Remdesivir or GA-treated rat were significantly lower than those found for NStreated hamsters, and the IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 in lung of Remdesivir group is significantly higher than that of GA group. As SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the lungs of GA or Remdesivir treated COVID-19 hamsters are in the same level, these immune-imaging results clearly demonstrated that GA intrinsically suppresses inflammatory cytokine expression in lungs of COVID-19 hamsters, the GA is with better outcome in suppression inflammatory cytokines expression when compared with Remdesivir.",

GA treatment resulted in none measurable side effects. Neither movement, out-looking, sleeping, nor eating behavior appeared to be affected. When we stained tissue sections with Hematoxylineosin (HE), we could not detect any pathological changes in GA-treated mice or GA-treated hamsters in Figure S8 , indicating that our treatment dose of GA was safe. Next, we analyzed Au element distribution in lung, brain, liver, spleen, heart, and kidney using an ICP-MASS approach. Table S2 and S3. The distribution of gold in lungs, hearts, livers, kidneys, brains, and spleens can be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment, as it potentially inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and direct suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines therein (15, 16, 17) .",

According immuno-fluorescent observations, GA significantly suppress the lung inflammatory cytokines expression, this is attributed to GA directly inactivate NFkB pathway and further reduce inflammatory cytokines expression level in lung. The key factor that need to be considered when designing a drug for COVID-19 treatment is its toxicity. Our study showed that GA is characterized by very mild cytotoxicity and very low mice/rat acute toxicity. These features render GA an ideal candidate for safe and effective COVID-19 treatment. (E) Low dose of AF (0.6 \u00b5M) and GA (0.6\u00b5M) significantly inhibit IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 inflammatory cytokines expression in RAW macrophages (unpaired t-test, ***p<0.001, **p <0.01, *p <0.05).

This SPR data implied that GA is with stronger affinity with M pro when compared with that of AF, and this experimental result matches the aforementioned molecular dynamic simulations where the average binding energy of AF-M pro was ~50.47 kcal/mol. and that of GA-M pro is the ~722.94 kcal/mol.. Although theory and SPR studies revealed gold compound can tightly bind the M pro , we do not know the final product form of GA-M pro and AF-M pro . To clarify this issue, strep tagged-M pro (strep-M pro ) were expressed in HEK293F cell and high concentration of GA were introduced in cell culture media, this would produce final Au-M pro adduct in cytoplasm (SI 4). AF were directly introduced to none strep tagged-M pro (M pro in Apo form) solution to get final Au-M pro adducts as HEK293F cell could not bear toxicity of high concentration AF in cell culture media (SI 4). After gold compound treated M pro was purified, ESI mass spectra was used to check the final product of GA-M pro or AF-M pro . In Figure 1D, both GA and AF treated M pro finally produce Au-M pro adduct where one Au atom is added to one M pro . These studies verified that GA or AF firstly associated with M pro and finally produce Au-M pro adduct in one Au atom per one M pro manner. Au (I), released from gold compound, covalently binds the thiolate of Cys145 of M pro via experimental crystal structure studies In order to examine molecular structural basis of gold compound inactive M pro in vitro/vivo, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 M pro experimental crystal structures in the M pro crystal incubated with AF (AF incubating form), M pro crystal incubated with GA (GA incubating form), and M pro crystal only (the native form), see details in SI 5,",
