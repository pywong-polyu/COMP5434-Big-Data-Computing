Given the broad socioeconomic and health impacts of the pandemic, increased incidence of psychological distress and mental health disorders are among the anticipated consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic [e.g., (3) (4) (5) ]. Past evidence that societal crises (e.g., economic recessions; natural disasters) were followed by increases in mental health and substance use problems (6) , and preliminary evidence of elevated levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic [e.g., (7) (8) (9) ], have led to calls for research to evaluate mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) reported that \u223c1 in 5 individuals who consume alcohol reported increases in alcohol consumption relative to the period prior to the pandemic, although the majority did not report an increase in alcohol consumption (13) . These findings are consistent with predictions that circumstances surrounding the pandemic may lead to increases in consumption for some people, but no change or decreases for others (4) , making it important to understand factors coinciding with increases in consumption.",

            "text": "Of numerous contextual factors that could increase risk for alcohol use during the pandemic, changes in psychological distress and mental health symptoms are important considerations. The unprecedented consequences of COVID-19, including widespread unemployment and lost income, health-related concerns, and mandated social isolation are likely risk factors for increases in depression and other forms of psychological distress among the general population. Behavioral theories of depression posit that reductions in access to environmental/social rewards, and/or increases in reward-limiting stimuli (i.e., environmental suppressors) predict risk for depression (14, 15) . Measures designed to assess access to environmental reward have been developed, and evidence supports the relation between diminished environmental reward and elevated severity of depression [e.g., (16) (17) (18) (19) ]. By design, population-based approaches to virus control have imposed significant environmental and contextual constraints for large portions of the population, resulting in widespread changes to daily routines and social interactions. By way of constraining daily routines and reducing access to typical sources of social or environmental reinforcement, strict social distancing measures may increase the risk for psychological distress and/or depressive symptoms for some individuals.",

Increases in negative affect, including depression symptoms and/or generalized distress in response to challenges surrounding the pandemic, might lead to increases in alcohol consumption. As a result, some have predicted a drastic increase in alcohol relapse among vulnerable populations (10) . It follows that environmental constraints related to social distancing measures might indirectly result in increased alcohol consumption, by way of increases in depression or psychological distress. Perhaps consistent with these predictions, research during the SARS epidemic found that almost one third (31.2%) of individuals quarantined had positive screens for depression (21) , and among hospital employees, alcohol use disorder symptoms were positively associated with having been quarantined and working in a high-risk location (22) .",

Solitary drinking (i.e., use of alcohol alone vs. in social contexts) is positively associated with greater incidence of alcohol-related problems (23, 24) . Notably, frequency of solitary drinking (compared to drinking in social contexts) is positively predicted by severity of depressive symptoms (25) . To the extent that environmental constraints may limit social drinking opportunities and increase depression symptoms, solitary drinking is likely to increase under social distancing conditions. Additionally, changes in drinking contexts (e.g., bar closures) may call for studying alternative indices of alcohol motivation, such as alcohol demand. Alcohol demand refers to the reinforcing potential of alcohol based on hypothetical resources (e.g., economic) that an individual would allocate to obtain alcohol (26) . Greater alcohol demand is associated with alcohol-related problems and alcohol consumption (27, 28) . Importantly, dynamic changes in demand have been observed in response to stress manipulations (29) , and alcohol demand in solitary contexts predict problems associated with alcohol use beyond alcohol demand in social contexts (30) . Together, these results suggest the importance of considering change in alcohol demand as an outcome during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

According to the Self-Medication Hypothesis (32, 33) drinking to cope with negative affect (i.e., coping motives) is a critical mediator between situational increases in negative affect and subsequent increases in alcohol use and associated problems. The self-medication hypothesis has also been used to explain the relationship between depression and alcohol use/problems [reviewed in (34) ]. Evidence further suggests a mediating role of coping motives in the association of peritraumatic distress and alcohol-related problems [e.g., (35) ]. While coping motives are central to the self-medication hypothesis, other domains of drinking motives include enhancement motives (i.e., drinking to enhance positive mood), social motives (e.g., affiliation with peers) and conformity motives [e.g., peer pressure; (36, 37) ]. Notably, coping motives uniquely predict heavier drinking and related alcohol problems when controlling for other domains (31, 38) .",

For instance, if social distancing requirements constrain environmental reward, increased psychological distress or depression [e.g., (41, 42) ] might result in escalations in coping motives for drinking and ultimately increased alcohol use. Similarly, increased severity of fear and anxiety specifically related to COVID-19 might predict escalations in negative reinforcement drinking, consistent with the self-medication hypothesis and with past research [e.g., (43) ].",

(44) found that maladaptive coping was associated with selfreported increases in alcohol use among health-care workers. Additionally, in hospital employees, endorsement of using alcohol to cope with the SARS outbreak was positively related to alcohol use disorder symptoms (22) . This research is limited, however, to samples directly impacted by the disease (e.g., healthcare workers, those in quarantine) and there is a paucity of research in general samples. Of note, early research published in the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted differences in psychological response to the pandemic associated with race. For example, Fitzpatrick et al. (45) found greater levels of COVID-19 related fear in Asian and Hispanic participants, relative to their counterparts. The psychological impact of the pandemic on nonmajority groups is potentially further exacerbated by pre-existing disparities in mental health, disproportionate impact of the virus on minority groups, and discrimination (46, 47) . Information on changes in psychological distress and related outcomes (e.g., depression, substance use) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their association with race, may be used to direct intervention efforts in this and future public health crises.",

First, following recommendations to study changes in substance use and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic (4), we aimed to assess self-reported differences in mood, environmental reward, drinking motives, and alcohol outcomes (e.g., quantity/frequency, solitary drinking; alcohol demand) in the period immediately preceding widespread social distancing measures, as compared to the period when these measures were in place. Exploratory analyses also examined whether any of these outcomes differed as a function of self-identified racial group. The second aim was to examine perceived changes in coping motives and depression symptoms as accounting for the relation between perceived change in environmental reward and psychological distress with alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional design using a single online survey assessment was employed to test these aims. Based on self-medication theory (32) and behavioral theories of depression [e.g., (15) ], two primary hypotheses were tested. First, we predicted that individual differences in environmental reward during COVID-19 would predict severity of depressive symptoms, which would in turn predict coping motives and alcohol consumption. Second, we predicted that COVID-19-related psychological distress would predict greater endorsement of coping motives, which would in turn predict greater quantity/frequency of alcohol consumption.",

Because some states were in the process of 're-opening' at (or soon after) the start of data collection, it was important to anchor responses to the 30day period after the start of the mandate, rather than the past 30 days.",

Two subscale scores can be derived: reward probability (e.g., \"I feel a strong sense of achievement\") and environmental suppressors (e.g., \"Changes have happened in my life that have made it hard to find enjoyment\"). Subscale scores are obtained by summing the scores on 10 constituent items. The 10 items that contribute to the environmental suppressors subscale are reverse scored before being summed. As such, higher scores on these two subscales represent greater reward probability and fewer environmental suppressors, respectively. A single total score was also obtained by summing the two subscale scores. Higher scores on this aggregate score represent both increased access to environmental reward and decreased presence of environmental suppressors. The RPI has previously demonstrated high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity (66) .

For example, participants reported a greater frequency of binge drinking, but no change in the quantity and frequency of alcohol use.

In the context of behavioral theory of depression and self-medication theories, the first set of mediation models tested environmental reward as an indirect predictor of alcohol QF post-social-distancing through severity of depressive symptoms and drinking to cope. Results suggested that: (1) lower levels of environmental reward predicted greater severity of depressive symptoms; (2) greater severity of depressive symptoms predicted higher levels of coping motives, and; (3) higher coping motives, in turn, predicted greater levels of alcohol consumption. In addition to the total sequential mediation effect, both severity of depressive symptoms and drinking to cope also independently mediated the effect between environmental reward and alcohol QF. The second mediation model, derived from the self-medication model, examined coping motives as a mediator of the relationship between COVID-19-related distress (secondary to and alcohol use post-social-distancing. The data supported our hypothesis for both typical alcohol QF: (1) higher levels of COVID-19-related distress predicted greater levels of coping motives that, in turn; (2) predicted higher levels of alcohol use post-social-distancing. In exploratory analyses, the results of the two mediation models replicated using post-social-distancing frequency of binge drinking at the primary outcome. Collectively these results are generally consistent with the behavioral theory of depression and self-medication hypothesis, where restrictions in environmental reward predict increases in the severity of depression (15, 16) and drinking to cope is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between negative affect (e.g., depression) and alcohol use (32, 33) .",

For example, behavioral economic theories of substance use disorders posit that the decision to use or abstain from a drug is the result of a joint influence of internal motivational states and availability of alternative reinforcers in the environment (72) . Human research provides confirmatory evidence of the inverse relationship between availability of alternate reinforcers and alcohol use/problems [e.g., (73) (74) (75) ]. In the context of social-distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that changes in alcohol use and alcohol demand are directly influenced by changes in availability of alternative reinforcers. However, as highlighted in a recent review the RPI does not explicitly measure substance-free reinforcement (76) and so the present data cannot be parsimoniously interpreted within choice theory frameworks. Nonetheless, behavioral theories of choice are likely well-suited to studying the effects of mandated social distancing on substance use and in reconciling the discordant results of changes in alcohol demand reported here.

We did, however, observe a significant indirect effect of COVID-related distress on solitary drinking frequency through coping motives, and a direct effect of environmental reward on solitary drinking frequency post-social-distancing. Regarding the latter, lower levels of post-social-distancing environmental reward were associated with greater frequency of solitary drinking. This pattern of results suggest that differences in external contextual factors, in addition to select internal context factors (i.e., COVID-19 related distress through alcohol motives), are relevant for predicting solitary drinking in the context of COVID-19 emergency measures. This finding is in partial agreement with other recent research examining alcohol use in the context of COVID-19. Specifically, in another study of alcohol use during the early stages of the pandemic, living alone (an external context factor) predicted increased solitary drinking, whereas internal context factors did not (77) . Because past research has demonstrated that increased frequency of solitary drinking predicts increases in alcohol-related problems (24, 78) it is imperative to understand which specific environmental factors during COVID-19 may elevate individuals' risk to develop this pattern of drinking.",

            "text": "Ultimately, one significant implication of these findings is to highlight factors that may be associated with risk for elevated rates of alcohol use disorders during the pandemic. Such risk factors include, for example, the elevated frequency of binge drinking and solitary use of alcohol post-social distancing compared to pre-social distancing. Both binge drinking and the use of alcohol in solitary contexts are considered risky patterns of alcohol use, in part due to their relation to future alcohol-related problems [e.g., (24, 79) ] To the extent that interventions mitigate constrained environmental reward secondary to social distancing, they might have beneficial effects in preventing escalations in alcohol consumption and the increased frequency of risky drinking patterns. Behavioral activation (BA) interventions represent an appealing option, as they are effective in targeting both depressive symptoms and substance use (80) . Moreover, such interventions can effectively be delivered remotely, via smartphone technology, enhancing the potential utility to a broader population [e.g., (81) ]. In the context of COVID-19, the implementation of a BA-oriented intervention is therefore not only theoretically justified, but has the potential for feasible wide-spread implementation. Smartphonebased interventions that incorporate coping-skills training, psychoeducation, and related interventions have also been developed [e.g., (82) ] that might be useful as adjunct therapy for individuals whose changes in alcohol use are driven by coping-related motives. Future research will be required to determine the efficacy and utility of such interventions in these contexts.",

            "text": "There are key limitations of the present research that should be noted. First, our research employed a crosssectional approach that required participants to selectively report on two distinct timeframes, which may introduce bias. For example, a negative retrieval bias may selectively enhance accessibility of negatively-valanced events for some individuals [e.g., (83) ]. Similarly, simple demand characteristics of the questionnaire due to the timeframe instructional set (i.e., anchor of items batteries to pre-social-distancing and postsocial-distancing) might provoke unintentional bias and unduly influence individuals' responses (84) . Second, the use of a cross-sectional approach precludes any inference about causality or changes over time. Third, sample representativeness and participant eligibility criteria restricts generalization of results to the general population. For example, we selected participants based on a minimum frequency of past-year drinking history and an age >21 years old. As a result, we cannot extend conclusions about findings from this sample to individuals with less frequent patterns of drinking, those abstaining from alcohol, underage drinkers, those with remote histories of alcohol use, or alcohol na\u00efve individuals who started drinking during the pandemic or immediately prior. More broadly, our use of a convenience sample from MTurk limits generalizations to the general population due to sample representativeness. Future research will be essential to address these limitations to confirm the replicability and generalizability of the findings reported here.",

All variables shown in the model correspond to post-social-distancing scores. Environmental reward indirectly significantly predicted alcohol QF through three unique paths: sequentially through depressive symptoms then coping motives; coping motives only, and; depressive symptoms only. Path coefficients are unstandardized b values. Sex and race were included as demographic covariates. Pre-social-distancing covariates included: environmental reward probability, depressive symptoms, motives (coping, enhancement, conformity, social), and alcohol QF.indirect sequential effect of environmental reward on binge frequency through severity of depression and coping motives (b = \u22120.003, SE = 0.001, 95% bootstrap CI [\u22120.005, \u22120.001]).

Consistent with the first model, there was no direct effect of environmental reward on binge frequency (p > 0.05). Conversely, there were no significant indirect effects in the exploratory model with frequency of solitary drinking specified as the primary outcome (all bootstrap CIs contained zero).

None of the other covariates reached the threshold of statistical significance (all p > 0.05). For the exploratory analyses examining binge and solitary drinking, we first conducted the mediation analysis with postsocial-distancing frequency of binge drinking specified as the outcome. There was a significant indirect effect of COVIDrelated distress on binge frequency through coping motives (b = 0.093, SE = 0.029, 95% bootstrap CI [0.043, 0.155]).
