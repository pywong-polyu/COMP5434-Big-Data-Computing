            "text": "Viral nervous necrosis (VNN), also called viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER), is a viral disease affecting a high number of fish species of great interest in aquaculture, such as sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) and gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) [1] . The etiological agent of this disease is the nervous necrosis virus (NNV), which belongs to the Nodaviridae family, Betanodavirus genus. NNV is a naked virus and presents bisegmented positive-sense single-stranded RNA. RNA1 encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), whereas RNA2 encodes the capsid protein (CP). According to a variable region in the RNA2 segment (named T4), NNV has been classified into four species: striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV), red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus (BFNNV) [2] . Furthermore, reassortants presenting combinations of RGNNV and SJNNV segments have been isolated from different fish species [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Thus, Olveira et al. [4] reported the isolation of a reassortant from Senegalese sole, named SpSsIAusc160.03 (hereafter wt160), with a genome composed of RGNNV-type RNA1 and SJNNV-type RNA2 segments (RGNNV/SJNNV). This reassortant provokes high mortality in this fish species and exhibits differences in the 3' non-coding region (NCR) of both segments when compared to the reference strains of each species [4, 8] . Regarding RNA1, four different positions were observed, whereas five differences were found in the RNA2 [8] . Two of the differences observed in the 3'NCR of the RNA2 are located at positions 1408 and 1412, sited in a stem-loop structure (3'SL), which is essential for replication [9] . Their reversion to SJNNV-type nucleic acids resulted in ca. 70% decrease in sole mortality compared to the wild type virus. This effect on the virulence has been attributed either to an impaired interaction of RNA2 with host proteins, or to a differential immune response [9] .",

The Venn diagram method was used for the comparative analysis of DEG datasets obtained 2 and 3 days after the infection with all the viruses considered (Figures 4A and 5A, respectively) (Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics; http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/ accessed on 24 May 2021). According to these diagrams, the number of deregulated DEGs shared by all virus-infected groups was lower at 2 days (23) than at 3 days p.i. (37) (Figures 4A and 5A ). The correlation coefficients were obtained by confronting fold change values recorded in fish infected with each mutated virus and in wt160-challenged fish were calculated using the RQ software (Applied Biosystems TM , Carlsbad, CA, USA). According to this analysis, the infection with the RNA2-double mutant induced the most differentiated immune response at both time points (r value: 0.946 at 2 days p.i. and 0.972 at 3 days p.i.), whereas the highest correlation coefficient was recorded for the r3093 group at both time points (r value: 0.986 at 2 days p.i. and 0.985 at 3 days p.i.)

Most of the genes expressed in all virus-infected groups were related to the interferon (IFN)-I pathway (viral recognition, regulation of IFN-I-dependent immune response, JAK-STAT cascade and IFN-stimulated genes), virus response genes (VRGs) and protein ubiquitination ( Figures 4C and 5C ).",

The stability of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing at the end of the experimental challenges. The transcriptomic study has been performed using an OpenArray \u00ae platform previously designed [10] . In general, the total number of deregulated DEGs after the infection with all the viruses has been similar; most of these genes were upregulated, with the total number of DEGs slightly higher at 3 than at 2 days p.i. This result is not consistent with the results previously obtained after wt160intramuscular injection [10] , which induced a higher number of DEGs at 2 than at 3 days p.i. in the head kidney. However, it should be considered that the viral administration in both studies was different. According to Souto et al. [11] , at the initial phase of the mortality curve, the titre of wt160 in brains from intramuscularly injected sole was higher (1.2 \u00d7 10 9 TCID 50 /g) than in bath-challenged fish (1.3 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /g), which could stand for an earlier immune response after the intramuscular injection. In fact, in the present study, at 2 days p.i., we have recorded the downregulation of certain genes non-deregulated after intramuscular injection (gilt, magel2, ctsz and birc5) [10] (Figure 6 ). According to these results, the downregulation of these genes after wt160 intramuscular injection could have taken place earlier. In fact, recently, Peruzza et al. [12] has also described the downregulation of immune genes after the infection of gilthead seabream larvae with a RGNNV/SJNNV strain at the initial phase of the infection (6 and 12 h p.i.), suggesting that his mechanism favours the immune evasion by the virus Specifically, in the present study, gilt and magel2 were exclusively downregulated after the infection with the most virulent virus, the wild type strain. In mammals, the gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) is involved in the processing and presentation of antigens into the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II [13] . Similar functions have also been described for several orthologous fish genes [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, it has been described that GILT controls the replication of murine leukaemia virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [22, 23] ; therefore, the gilt downregulation detected in wt160-infected animals could contribute to increase viral virulence.",

The results obtained for seabass are similar to those described in the present study, c3 expression returns to basal levels at 3 days p.i. [26] , whereas in gilthead seabream, the overexpression of c3 remained high for longer [26] . On the other hand, in humans CFHR3 has been described as an enhancer of the complement activation, competing with the inhibitory complement factor H, and enhancing the formation of C3 convertase, resulting in C3bi, a subproduct of C3b, an inductor of phagocytosis and inflammation [27] . The upregulation of both c3 and cfhr3 could partly explain the lower mortality recorded by the double mutant infection through the induction of an early inflammation response, which, due to the return to basal level of expression of both complement factors at 3 days p.i., is inefficient for controlling viral replication.",

The gene eomes is related to CD8 + T-cell differentiation. The involvement of T-cells in the immune response against nodavirus infection has been previously reported in Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) by \u00d8vergard et al. [28] , who described the upregulation of CD8\u03b1 and CD8\u03b2 transcripts in the brains of challenged fish. On the other hand, apoD encodes a lipocalin, which has been described in higher vertebrates as a protector of neurological disorders, controlling peroxidated lipids [29] and regulating inflammatory processes involved in neuronal damage [30] . In addition, it has been reported that apoD is upregulated in mice during acute encephalitis induced by the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and produced T-cell infiltration into the brain, which is correlated to an increase in mouse survival rate [31] . Therefore, the upregulation of eomes and apoD recorded in the head kidney of r1408-1412-infected fish could indicate a systemic immune response to protect Senegalese sole from neuronal damages, reducing inflammation, and, therefore, could be related to the decrease in mortality observed after the infection with the double mutant.",

Mutations also provoked some differences in viral replication-the number of copies of r3073 RNA1 was lower than that recorded for the wt160-infected group at all time points assayed. However, this result did not cause a reduced immune response, since the number of deregulated genes after the infection with both viruses, r3073 and wt160, was similar. This result suggests that a low amount of r3073 RNA is enough to induce an efficient immune response in fish. Similar results have been previously reported for the infection of sole with a nonpathogenic viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) isolated to this fish species [32] . Regarding the replication of r3093, a 24 h lag was observed compared to wt160 replication. This delay seems to provoke a lag in the immune response, since r3093 infection deregulates the lowest number of genes at 2 days p.i. (25 upregulated and 1 downregulated) (Figure 3) , whereas the number of deregulated genes 3 days after the infection with this virus was similar to that recorded in the other infected groups.",

The grass carp reovirus (GCRV)induced gene 1 was detected in UV-inactivated GCRV-infected crucian carp (Carassius auratus) blastulae embryonic cells (CAB) [38] , as well as in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) [39] [40] [41] . Sun et al. [42] reported that gig1 is an ISG that only exits in fish lineages, and that GIG1 protein suppressed GCRV replication in cultured fish cells. According to the results obtained in the present study, it seems that an early expression of this gene, together with the expression of other interferon-related genes, does not control viral infection; however, a constrained expression seems to decrease virulence. This hypothesis is related to the idea previously reported by several authors, suggesting that a strong and early immune response, rather than the control of betanodavirus infection, is responsible for the aggravation of the disease [10, 43, 44] .",

Specifically, the infection with the RNA2-mutant provoked the most different immune response compared to the one elicited by the wild type virus, highlighting the exclusive and high upregulation of genes related to the complement system. Regarding RNA1-mutants, these viruses induced the most similar immune response to the one provoked by the wild type virus; however, some differences have been found. For instance, RNA1-mutant replication is delayed 24 h compared to the wt160 replication, which could be responsible for the lag observed in the induction of the immune response, compared to the wt160 group. Most of the genes expressed in all virus-infected groups were related to the IFN-I system, VRGs, or to the ubiquitination; however, some genes are exclusively expressed after the infection with the RNA1-mutants, such as the early induction of pkr, which could be also involved in the early detection of viral infection, and the downregulation of il17rc, which could establish a balance in the immune response to avoid an increase on the disease's severity due to a strong immune response.",
