As noted for the primary BNT162b2 series, local reactions and systemic symptoms were more frequent in persons 55 years or younger than in older individuals. 1, 7 M a n u s c r i p t Significantly, more local but fewer systemic reactions were reported following the third versus the second vaccine dose. The median pre-booster anti-S1 IgG titers were higher in persons who reported local and systemic reactions than for those who reported no symptoms, as was also reported recently by Rechavi et al. 8 This finding suggests that humoral immune priming is associated with local and systemic symptoms after booster vaccination. Previous studies have shown that the humoral response to an mRNA vaccine persisted longer in the regional lymph nodes than in peripheral blood. Turner et al. 9 found that while circulating IgG and IgA-secreting plasmablasts in peripheral blood that target the S protein declined and became undetectable three weeks after the second immunization, S-binding B cells and plasmablasts persisted in the germinal centers of draining lymph nodes on the side of immunization for at least 12 weeks after immunization.",
