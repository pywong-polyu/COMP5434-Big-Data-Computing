We conducted a survey to study the changes in the clubfoot treatment practices, Achilles tenotomy methods, and the role along with the possible impact of teleconsultation during this pandemic. Methods A web-based survey was conducted using a questionnaire prepared on Google forms. The link for this questionnaire was sent to Indian Orthopaedic specialists with a special interest in clubfoot management via a social messaging platform. Results 127 eligible responses were analysed. Of them, 67% respondents were in practice for more than 10 years. During the study period, 30.7% of doctors did not perform any casting; 66.9% performed casting in 1-5 cases per week and only 2.4% performed casting in more than five cases per week. A statistically significant difference was noted in the number of doctors who performed casting in less than five cases per week and the doctors who performed casting in more than five cases per week, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 30.7% of doctors deferred doing Achilles tenotomy during the study period, and among those who performed one, a significant number of them avoided tenotomy under general anaesthesia. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted clubfoot treatment practices during the lockdown period in India. Significant reductions in the number of cases, and a reduction with changes in Achilles tenotomy practices were noted too. However, whether this had any adverse influence on the eventual outcome in these feet is yet to be determined.",

On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared this rapidly spreading viral disease as a global pandemic. Following this, a period of national lockdown in India was implemented from March 25, 2020. It was divided into different phases from Phase 1 to Phase 4, with some relaxation in the last two phases of the lockdown depending on the caseload in a particular zone; the lockdown was officially considered over on May 31, 2020 [2, 3] . During the lockdown period, it became difficult for the parents of children with clubfeet to bring their child to the hospital for the periodic casts. After the lockdown period, gradual reopening was resumed with some relaxations except in the containment zones during the unlock period 1.0 (from June 1 to June 30, 2020) [4] .",

This constitutes large numbers in terms of cases, and require special treatment for its management. The Ponseti method of correction, which is the gold standard of clubfoot treatment, requires weekly corrective casts, Achilles tenotomy for correcting residual equinus in most of the cases, and maintenance of correction in Foot Abduction Orthosis (FAO). Weekly hospital visits during the correction phase and periodic hospital visits during the maintenance phase are required for satisfactory treatment of the condition. During the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic, CTEV was considered a nonurgent condition, surgeons and hospitals delayed correction casting and the subsequent management. However, the delay was not uniform all across the countries and few doctors and hospitals did continue to offer clubfoot treatment. As such, the extent to which clubfoot management changed is unclear and has not been assessed yet. This survey was conceptualized to study the same.",

This questionnaire included questions about the experience of the participant, the volume of new clubfoot cases handled per year, presentation of clubfoot cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, tenotomy protocol before and during the pandemic, management of cases in the different stages of Ponseti correction, and maintenance of bracing protocol.

This is probably because many of the teaching institutes/medical colleges in India were converted into dedicated COVID-19 care centres, and manpower and resources were diverted for treating the COVID-19 cases. Likewise, corporate multi-speciality hospitals were also asked to prepare for the huge inflow of COVID-19 cases, which probably led to a reduction in the number of casting appointments. Due to a lack of public transport and travel restrictions during the lockdown, many parents probably were unable to reach the clinics, which may have contributed to the significantly lower rates of the casting during the study period.",

The reason may be that the first cast was applied while the baby was in the hospital during the immediate postnatal period or that the parents were sufficiently anxious about the early correction of the deformed feet and accessed treatment at the nearby clinic/ hospitals. However, only 37.8% of doctors were able to change casts weekly, signifying that parents did experience difficulty in reaching the hospital during the lockdown period.",

The global recommendation is to perform Achilles tenotomy in the outpatient clinic [9] [10] [11] under local anaesthesia. Yet in India, it is interesting to note that in pre-COVID times, 75% of doctors were performing this procedure in the OT under local or general anaesthesia. During this on-going COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended that aerosol-generating procedures like intubation be avoided to protect operation room staff and doctors. Thus, the shift towards the outpatient setting is a welcome collateral effect of the pandemic and should be encouraged even post-pandemic to reduce costs and unnecessary OT utilization, besides being safer for young babies who may not tolerate GA [12, 13] .",

For clubfoot cases, teleconsultation has a potential role in prenatal counselling for the neonatal diagnosis of CTEV, and during maintenance phase on FAO, tele-video-consultations allow evaluation of maintenance of correction and suggestions for periodic brace change. This can be supplemented by educational videos that can help parents to learn how to manipulate the feet of newborn babies in their homes.
