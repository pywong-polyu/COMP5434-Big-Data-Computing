Amidst the global COVID-19 vaccination campaign, vaccine-related side effects are of ongoing concern and investigation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, three main conditions in adults have surfaced in association with receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. These include thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare syndrome involving venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and myocarditis. While a number of GBS cases in adults have been published, to our knowledge, only one pediatric case of COVID-19 vaccine-related GBS has been reported. Herein we describe a case of sensory predominant GBS following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in a 16-year-old female presenting with bilaterally ascending upper and lower extremity numbness and paresthesia.",

            "text": "The emergence of a global pandemic from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to a rapid development of multiple vaccines. Considering the severity of the pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorizations allowing vaccine dissemination to the public. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were approved in December 2020. Shortly after in February 2021, the Janssen vaccine was approved for use. While the Moderna and the Janssen COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use in persons 18 years or older, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for administration in persons 5 years or older. 1 With data provided through the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and United States Department of Health and Human Services have reported three main adverse events in association with COVID-19 vaccines. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) 4 -a rare syndrome involving venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia -and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) 5 have been reported in connection to the Janssen vaccine. Myocarditis has been reported in connection with the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. 6 Of the reported side effects seen in the pediatric population, myocarditis remains the predominant adverse event. Dionne. et al. first reported seven 14 to 19-year-old males who developed symptomatic myocarditis following their second Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine dose. 7 In the adult population, GBS has especially been associated with the receipt of the Janssen vaccine. Over 98 cases of GBS in people 18 years and older following the receipt of Janssen vaccine were reported to VAERS between February and June 2021. Due to an unexpectedly high number of GBS cases, the FDA issued a warning in July 2021. 8 Classically, GBS is characterized by progressive ascending weakness, as well as sensory disturbances and diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes. GBS related to COVID-19 vaccination has been described to have variable clinical presentation, ranging from facial and/or limb weakness to sensory disturbances such as paresthesia and numbness. 9 Although neurological involvement with COVID-19 infections among pediatric patients has been reported, 10 to our knowledge, only one pediatric case of vaccine-related neurological side effects exists in the literature 11 . As vaccination efforts progress, the continued reporting of adverse events will allow the CDC and the FDA to closely monitor and assess the safety of the vaccine. To that end, we describe a sensory predominant variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome in a pediatric patient presenting to the emergency department two days after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.",

Within a few days, she noticed persistent paresthesia in her feet and hands as well as difficulty with running while playing sports. For the next three weeks, her symptoms continued to worsen with paresthesia up to her elbows and knees, decreased sensation in bilateral lower extremities, and difficulty with gait especially going up a ramp or stairs.

There was prolonged latency and slowed conduction velocity in multiple sensory and motor nerves (Table 1) , consistent with partially-compensated demyelinating polyneuropathy without active denervation consistent with a history of GBS.

            "text": "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) is a rare, immune-mediated polyneuropathy with an annual global incidence of 1 to 2 per 100,000 person-years. 12 Symptoms classically associated with GBS are symmetric weakness and diminished sensation or paresthesia, but clinical presentation is diverse and multiple variants have been identified. The course of the disease is progressive for 1 to 3 weeks after onset of symptoms, with the most concerning complication being respiratory insufficiency. Prognosis is difficult to ascertain, as there is a wide range of rate and extent of recovery. Some patients make complete recovery while 20% of severely affected patients have limited mobility 6 months after the disease onset. 13 Majority of the cases of GBS are preceded by an acute illness such as an upper respiratory infection or diarrhea. Specifically, cobacter jejuni has been identified to be the organism associated with about 30% of GBS cases. 14 In 1976, mass immunization against influenza A H1N1 subtype A/NJ/76 was associated with increased incidence of GBS. Since then, no other vaccines have been shown to be a clear trigger of GBS. 15 With rapid vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2, the concerns for GBS first arose with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/ AstraZeneca), which is not approved for use in the U.S. Recently, through the analysis of VAERS data, Janssen/ Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was also reported to have a small but statistically significant increase in risk for GBS with an estimated absolute rate increase of 6.36 per 100,000 person-years in adults. 5 However, authors caution that this finding is a preliminary result due to the nature of the reporting system and GBS cases that are considered presumptively positive.",

She presented with a stocking-glove distribution of paresthesia and mild ataxia without any weakness or ophthalmoplegia. Initial differential also included Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, vitamin deficiency, and Miller Fisher syndrome. Imaging and lab findings were most consistent with the diagnosis of GBS with predominantly sensory presentation. Idiopathic or asymptomatic infectious causes of GBS cannot be completely ruled out, especially in the absence of more extensive diagnostic testing; however, with the recent vaccination and absence of any other clinical signs or lab findings, the vaccine is most likely to be the trigger for our patient. It is also important to note that the patient made full functional recovery three months after initiation of symptoms. To date, this is the first case reported of GBS in a pediatric patient after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As we expand the vaccination to younger populations, further study is needed to establish a causal link between the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and GBS.",
