Where the former disturbed each and every economic, social, and environmental activities. Also, the natural resource commodities demand has been reported fluctuating with many downs and ups. The pandemic has expanded throughout the world's economy, first in the industrialized nations and now reaching developing economies. It is undeniable that emerging economies are at a disadvantage throughout this procedure, not only because their health conditions and health services are not as advanced as those in industrialized countries but also because their macroeconomic conditions are not strong enough to resist such a longterm socioeconomic crisis (Demi\u02d9rcan \u00c7akar et al., 2021) . Those nations are poorer and allocating resources to the health sector is difficult for them. Compared to emerging economies, the developed world has also been hit hard by the pandemic's severe impacts. As a result of the global economy's long-term lockdown and slowdown, all industrialized nations had a negative rate of economic growth in the following years (Demi\u02d9rcan \u00c7akar et al., 2021) . However, the Covid-19 affects economic growth, adversely affects the financial market, and enhances inflation in the European Union (EU) economies (Erdogan et al., 2020a (Erdogan et al., , 2020b .",

For all the developing and developed countries, energy remains the essential factor of production, such as labor and capital. Also, energy use is among the basic factors determining economic growth and development (Adegboyega et al., 2021) . The relationship between natural resources volatility and economic growth is important because it may cause a change in the macroeconomic policies and the level of welfare in a country. For instance, an increase in the natural resource commodity prices, the oil and gas prices in specific, could reduce the output in many ways (Yildirim and \u00d6 zt\u00fcrk, 2014) . Firstly, these oil and gas price shocks lead to lower aggregate demand, as the increase in the oil and gas price leads to redistribution of the income among the net oil importing and exporting economies. Secondly, the rise in oil and gas prices may reduce capital and labor productivity due to the allocated budget constraints of the firm. Thus, higher oil and gas prices lead to minimizing energy consumption. Moreover, this minimal energy consumption level precedes enhancement in unemployment due to real wager reduction (Ferderer, 1996) . Hence, a real wages reduction contributes to unemployment and decreases the country's real gross domestic product (GDP).",

However, the current decline in oil, natural gas and other natural resources is primarily due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The recent pandemic and the subsequent global economic lockdowns have disturbed the supply chains and declined the aggregate demand globally (Vidya and Prabheesh, 2020) . It is reported that a sharp reduction in the consumption of oil because of the lockdown environment drastically declined the prices of crude oil in the global market, specifically from US $ 61 in January to US$ 12 in April 2020 .

Secondly, this study specifically analyzes the mediating role of Covid-19 pandemic, which the earlier studies ignored. Thirdly, this study utilized the most updated dataset, providing policy insights favorable for overcoming this panic of economic and natural resources' rents uncertainty. Moreover, this study holds more importance because it is one of the pioneering studies that provide empirical estimates and policy implications in the Covid-19 era while using the cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributive lags (CS-ARDL) model, augmented mean group (AMG) and common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG) estimators.

(2021) via employing a panel auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to unveil the short-run and long-run symmetric effects. The empirical estimates show that the recent commodities boom effect between 2004 and 2014 varies from previous phenomena. This illustrates the learning effect from the earlier experiences. Besides, the non-linear ARDL estimates reveal that asymmetric effects exist for the commodity price shocks. In addition, the study provides evidence that positive changes exert greater influence on per capita income in the long run. At the same time, the negative shock affects only economic growth in the short-run. At the same time Lin and Bai (2021) studied oil prices and uncertainty in the economic policy for oil-importing and exporting economies. Employing the vector autoregressive framework, the study reveals that economic policy uncertainty fluctuates in response to oil price shocks, whereas the oil prices respond negatively to uncertain economic policies. Besides, the empirical findings suggest that the oil price shocks have a smaller fluctuation to economic policy uncertainty in the oil-importing economies than the oil-exporting economies. Similarly, in case of the Nigerian economy, Monye Michael and Omogbiya Shulammite (2020) found a negative and significant association between oil prices and economic growth while analyzing the primary data with a sample of 320 respondents.",

Using the PMG and ARDL estimating approaches, the results asserted that the volatility of resources prices is harmful to economic growth in the long-run, in all the resource-dependent economies. However, in the short-run, the natural resources commodity prices volatility impact is inconsistent on economic growth. In continuation to the prior literature, Adegboyega et al. (2021) investigated oil prices, non-renewable energy, and economic performance for the case of Nigeria throughout 1980-2013. The study used ordinary least square (OLD) methodology and the unit root and cointegration tests and provided evidence concerning cointegration among economic growth, non-renewable energy consumption, and oil prices. However, in the short-run, natural gas and coal consumption do not influence real economic growth. Concerning the impact of natural resources commodity prices, i.e., oil prices, on the stock market development, Khan et al. (2021) investigated Pakistan's time series data between 1985 and 2017. The study used a dynamic simulated ARDL estimator and revealed that oil prices, foreign direct investment (FDI), and remittances inflow positively contribute to stock market development, while exchange rate adversely affects the development of the stock market.",

The study concludes that financial deepening played a crucial role in mediating the positive influence of natural resources on economic growth. On the contrary, Yasmeen et al.

(2020c) , this study concludes that financial development does not play any significant role in transforming the negative impact of natural resources on economic growth. Using the second generation panel data methodology, Shahbaz et al. (2019a) unveil that natural resources significantly and positively affect economic growth in resource-abundant economies. However, resource dependence adversely affects economic growth of these regions over the period from 1980 to 2015. Besides, another study by Shahbaz et al. (2019b) investigated the US economy and provided contrary results. The estimated results conclude the validation of the resource curse hypothesis. However, oil prices and capitalization promote economic growth in the region. In addition, extensive literature provides contradictory results regarding the positive or negative influence of natural resources on economic growth. However, studies have also confirmed the influence of natural resources on environmental quality. Such studies include Umar et al. (2020) , Ulucak and DanishOzcan (2020) , and Erdogan et al. (2021) , which empirically demonstrates that both natural resources abundance and dependence significantly promote environmental degradation by enhancing carbon level and carbon footprints. Still, there is a contradiction in the empirical findings regarding the environmental effect of natural resources. In this regard, DanishUlucak and Khan, 2020 analyzed BRICS economies over the period 1992-2016 and concluded that natural resources are playing a positive role in environmental sustainability.",

Using APARCH process, the study uncovers the bidirectional causal association among stock market performance and oil performance. Besides, a substantial spillover effect has been observed running from crude oil price volatility to stock market return. Besides the prior studies that signify the natural resource commodity prices and economic performance linkage, Rubaszek (2021) identified the forecasting of crude oil prices via dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and vector autoregression models. The results unveil that the oil sector DSGE model provides more efficient results at real oil price estimations than vector autoregression and random walk by following two principles as the author provided in the study.",

However, dependence of one country on other countries results in similarity in some respects, while differentiate in some other features. However, these countries, if possessing the homogenous characteristics may provide biased results while empirically analyzing them. In this regard, the current study assessed the slopes heterogeneity of the selected panel economies, i.e., G7, to avoid biased estimates.

This mixed order allows current study to the cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lags (CS-ARDL) model, which is efficient in tackling mixed order data and provides both short-run and long-run estimates. The CS-ARDL approached is first proposed by Chudik and Pesaran (2015) . Whether the data series is stationary at I(0), I(1), or both, and whether it is cointegrated or not, the CS-ARDL provides robust estimates (Okumus et al., 2021) . Since this approach belongs to the CCE family, where the lag dependent term and lagged cross-section terms are taken into consideration: therefore, the CS-ARDL approach allows for cross-section dependency (Chudik and Pesaran, 2015) . Besides, this approach allows for the mean group estimations when the slopes are heterogenous. The mean group version of the CS-ARDL model is based on enhancing each cross-section of ARDL assessment using cross-sectional means which are proxies for unobserved common factors and their lags (Chudik et al. (2017) . Additionally, this approach tackles the weak exogeneity issue, which is common while taking the lag dependent term in the model (Okumus et al., 2021) . CS-ARDL can be obtained via the following regression:",

In this regard, in the presence of slope heterogeneity and cross-section dependence, we employed the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) proposed by Eberhardt and Teal (2010) and Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG) proposed by Pesaran (2006) . Additionally, both the AMG and CCEMG efficiently perform the estimations even in the presence of non-stationarity and unobserved common factors (Khan et al., 2020a) . The CCEMG considers the time-variant unobserved common factors with the heterogenous slope parameters and tackles the identification issue. Besides, it also equates both independent and dependent variables for each cross-section to eradicate the cross-section dependence's caused spillover effect, not by just including the trends or time dummies (Liddle, 2018) . This approach provides strong estimates to both the strong and weak factors for infinite and limited numbers with the global shocks, such as financial crises, oil price shocks, and/or local spillover effect (Chudik et al., 2011) . Moreover, the AMG estimator is an alternative CCEMG approach, including year dummies, tackles the unobserved common factors, and deliberately considers it a common dynamic process (Eberhardt and Teal, 2010) . Also, the AMG estimator considers the slope heterogeneity and cross-section dependence along with the structural breaks.",

This indicates that across the time, the economy reports growth as moving from 1990 towards 2020. Besides, the minimum value is reported as 9.91E +11 and the maximum value is accounted as 1.83E +13 , this indicates that the G7 economies follow the growth trend in the 31 years span. Regarding the NGR, the mean value is reported greater than the median value. That is, the mean value is accounted for 0.162859 as a percentage of GDP and the median value is reported as 0.023744 as a percent of GDP. This leads to concludes that natural gas consumption is reported as increasing in the selected time span. Besides, the maximum and minimum values of the NGR is reported as 2.183876 and 0.00 percent of the GDP, which indicates that across the selected 31 years, the natural gas contribution to the GDP in the shape of rents increases.",

Their maximum and the minimum values also show the volatility in the CPIE. The range of the CPIE indicates that the energy related inflation goes from the minimum value of \u2212 18.39721to the maximum of 17.13092, which could also influence the economic activities.

The current study investigates the influence by constructing two models, where the one specifically identifies the influence of Covid-19 via dummy variable. Concerning Model-1, NGR and ORR are found to influence economic performance positively. However, the TNR and CPIE are found to affect economic performance adversely. Specifically, a one percent increase in the NGR, the economic performance is increased by 0.659 and 0.529% via AMG and CCEMG estimators, respectively. Similarly, a one percent increase in the ORR increases the economic performance by 0.0395 and 0.0595%, respectively. This indicates that the natural gas rents and the oil rents are playing an important role in economic growth. Current findings are consistent to the earlier findings of Khan et al. (2021) . Concerning the TNR and CPIE, both the AMG and CCEMG estimators provide similar impact of these variables on economic performance. Specifically, a one percent increase in the TNR decreases economic growth by 0.485 and 0.286%, respectively. Similarly, an increase of one percent in the energy related inflation decreases economic performance by 0.142 and 0.150%, respectively.

As revealed by the law of demand, an increase in the prices of the commodity reduces its demand.

Although the impact remains the same, still a minimal change in the magnitude values have been observed. However, the results are found significant at 1%, 5%, and 10% level. Besides, the dummy variable for the Covid-19 (D-2019) indicates negative influence of the natural resources' commodity prices on economic performance. The results of both AMG and CCEMG provide a similar impact of Covid-19 on economic performance. Specifically, a one percent increase in the Covid-19 accidents (including Note: Significance of 1%, 5% and 10% is denoted by ***, ** and *. The multicollinearity is checked via Variance Inflating Factor (VIF) and it is reported that the cumulative sum is near 1, which indicates no collinearity. cases, deaths, lockdowns, etc.), the natural resources commodity prices significantly reduce economic performance by 0.196 and 0.188%, respectively. The D-2019 findings are found significant at 1% level. This indicates that the Covid-19 pandemic is hazardous to human health and economic growth by converting the natural resources commodity prices affect into negative. Besides, the volatility in the natural resources' commodity prices is negatively affecting economic growth. Moreover, current study also examined the panel causal linkage between the variables' under-consideration. The long-run estimates of the AMG and CCEMG identify each exogenous variable's specific impact on the dependent variable. However, these tests do not provide any causal association that exists among the variables under study. In this regard, the estimated results of the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) Granger panel causality heterogeneous test are provided in Table- 6. The estimated results reveal that all the variables are found in bidirectional causal relationship. The p-value suggests that the values are significant at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels. Thus, it is important to note that any policy targeting NGR, TNR, ORR and CPIE would significantly influence the economic performance in the G7 economies. Besides, the policies concerning economic growth also influence the volatility in the natural resources commodity prices. Therefore, the natural resources commodity prices hold importance concerning any policy change as it directly influences economic performance of the G7 economies.",

As the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak affects each country across the globe. Hence, it is impossible to express that the advanced economies, specifically the G7, would not be affected. Besides, the locked-down environment in each country reduces economic activities and industrial manufacturing. This significantly reduces the demand for oil, natural gas, and other natural resources across the globe. Hence, reducing energy demand in the Covid-19 period would cause fluctuations in the natural resources' rents. This volatility in the natural resources' rents could also influence economic performance of the countries. In this regard, the current study investigates the volatility of natural resources and economic performance in both the pre and post-Covid-19 pandemic periods. In this concern, the current study investigates the panel data covering the period from 1990 to 2020 for the G7 economies. As both the cross-sectional and time-series data in consideration, therefore current study utilized panel data approaches, including the Pesaran and Yamagata (2008) (2007) panel unit root test. These tests confirm that the sloped coefficients are heterogeneous and cross-sectionally dependent. Moreover, the panel unit root test reveals that the data is of mixed order, i.e., the GDP is stationary at I(1), while TNR, NGR, ORR, and CPIE are found stationary at I(0). This mixed order of integration leads to the adoption of a suitable and efficient estimator.",
