The method is based on the idea of measuring the frequency of tweets supporting and encouraging social distancing. The hashtags were identified based on qualitatively searching hashtags in Twitter, Google, and websites (e.g., https://www. digitaltrends.com/social-media/all-the-hashtags-you-needto-know-about-social-distancing/). We selected the hashtags that had a higher chance to be supportive and encouraging tweets. This process provided a list of 18 hashtags such as #StayHome utilized to support or encourage social distancing (Table 1) . For example, an American actor, Morgan Freeman, posted a tweet containing #StayHome (Figure 1) . We have collected the frequency of the hashtags in US from Jan, 2020 to May 26, 2020 (Figure 2) . We used Brandwatch, a third-party social media data provider, to obtain the data. The data will be available on the web site of the first author (Figures 1 and 2) . provides insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. This report shows movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.

Our evaluation analysis shows a meaningful correlation (p < .05) between the total frequency of the 18 hashtags and the Google movement trends (Figure 4 ). This evaluation shows that there is a positive correlation (R > 0) between the frequency of hashtags and residential movements and a negative correlation (R < 0) between the frequency of tweets and non-residential movements. Our findings show that US people used more supportive and encouraging hashtags for social distancing when they were at residential places and practiced social distancing and utilized less supportive and encouraging hashtags for social distancing when they were not at residential places. So, the frequency of hashtags can be used for quantifying social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
