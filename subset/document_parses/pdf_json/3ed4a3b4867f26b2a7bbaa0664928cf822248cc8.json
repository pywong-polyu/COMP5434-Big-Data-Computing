Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand the perspectives of United States PGY1s regarding the impact of the pandemic on these experiences. Our secondary aims were to understand how desire to practice medicine was impacted by the pandemic and whether PGY1s felt that they were able to meaningfully contribute to the COVID-19 response as students. Method: We conducted a national, cross-sectional study of PGY1s who had recently graduated from medical school in 2020. A survey was distributed to PGY1s from across specialties, in programs distributed throughout the United States. It included questions about medical school training during the pandemic, impact on graduation timing and transition to internship, concerns about caring for patients with COVID-19, desire to practice medicine, and ability to meaningfully contribute to the pandemic. Findings are presented using descriptive statistics and univariate logistic regression models. Results: 1980 PGY1s consented to participate, 1463 completed the survey (74%), and 713 met criteria for this analysis. 77% of PGY1s reported that the pandemic adversely affected their connection with their medical school communities, and 58% reported that the pandemic impeded their preparation for intern year. 4% of PGY1s reported graduating medical school and practicing as an intern earlier than their expected graduation date. While the majority of PGY1s did not have a change in desire to practice medicine, PGY1s with concerns regarding personal health or medical conditions .55] p < 0.0001), the health or medical conditions of others in the home .77], p < 0.0001]), and PGY1s with children , p < 0.0001) were more likely to report a decreased desire.",

On March 17th, 2020, the Association of American Medical Colleges and Liaison Committee on Medical Education released a joint statement recommending the suspension of medical students' participation in activities that involve patient contact [3] . Although this policy has since been revised [4] , it had immediate and significant ramifications on the clinical experiences of medical students. Additionally, given the need for physical distancing, in-person lectures were either cancelled or transitioned to virtual formats [2] . Although exemplary innovations in medical student education occurred [5, 6] , there was also a loss of many traditional learning opportunities that are vital to medical school training and the transition to residency [7] .",

Trainees are categorized by their postgraduate year and new doctors in their first year of residency are referred to as post-graduate year 1 resident-physicians (PGY1s).

Some lost scheduled medical school opportunities designed to better prepare them for their internships, such as critical clinical rotations [8] or internship preparatory experiences [9] [10] [11] . Some faced challenging decisions, such as whether or not to graduate early and practice as a doctor prior to their internship start date [12, 13] , a unique option that was available to some students in order to assist with the pandemic response. Intern orientations are typically a time when new interns meet their co-interns and receive critical training aimed at easing the transition to internship. In the setting of physical distancing, these orientations were significantly altered and often held virtually. In addition, graduating medical students entered a residency training environment significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic [14] . Lastly, many trainees had concerns about their personal risk of COVID-19 infection [15] , especially at the onset of the pandemic when information about COVID-19 was still evolving.",

The study's baseline survey captured demographic information and information on specialty and residency program. Nineteen questions were added to the current year's baseline survey (51 questions) to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affected medical school training and transition to residency (Supplemental Content Survey 1). These questions evaluated impact to medical school training, impact on graduation timing, transition to internship, concerns about taking care of patients with COVID-19, desire to practice medicine and ability to meaningfully contribute to the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions were designed by the study team, comprised of members with collective expertise in clinical research, survey design, medical school education, and residency training. A member of the study team (A.S.W.) performed cognitive interviewing and pilot testing with four graduating medical students to refine the instrument before deployment. This led to the adjustment of wording to several question to improve clarity and the removal of questions that were challenging to answer and deemed less important. We estimate that the total survey took approximately 10 min to complete.",

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize responses from the study sample. The distribution of continuous variables was assessed to determine the most appropriate descriptive presentation. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on components of medical school training, change in desire to practice medicine, and satisfaction with ability to respond to the pandemic were collected using 5-point Likert-type scales (Supplemental Content Survey 1). The study team decided to a priori dichotomize these variables in our analysis in order to facilitate interpretation. For example, desire to practice medicine was initially on a 5-point scale (significantly increased, somewhat increased, no change, somewhat decreased, significantly decreased). This was dichotomized to decreased desire (included both significantly and somewhat decreased) and no change/increased (included all other response options). Univariate logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with concern about caring for patients with COVID-19, satisfaction with ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and change in desire to practice medicine.

Our study indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic had the most unfavorable impact on PGY1s' sense of connection with their medical school community and preparation for intern year, which directly bear on relatedness and competence. It is critical that we better consider how to support connection amongst medical school and residency communities, through both inperson and virtual activities [22] . This is particularly important during this critical transition as many trainees are entering a residency community knowing very few other co-residents, at a time when in-person gatherings during intern orientation are limited. Fortunately, innovations developed by medical schools and residency in the pandemic, was to develop skills and gain experience thereby likely leading to better preparedness [23] . Fortunately, medical schools are innovating rapidly and creatively to meet the needs of their students and better prepare them for their internship, including integrating students back into sub-internships, integrating students into telehealth activities [24] , offering virtual preparatory experiences [25] , and developing virtual objective structured clinical examinations [26] . However, residency programs may also need to provide additional training and support for new residents whose medical school experiences may result in them either being less prepared or perceiving themselves to be less prepared for internship, especially as they enter a residency landscape that is significantly different in the face of the pandemic. In order to ensure the safety of health care professionals and residents during the pandemic, it is critical they are trained and competent in the use of PPE [27] . Our study cohort reported varying levels of perceived competence, even after orientation and after they had started their first rotations. Future studies are needed to understand the objective competence of residentphysicians; however, our study suggests the need to supplement existing training and develop methods for trainees to demonstrate competence prior to interacting with patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19.",

Thus, it is unsurprising that these resident-physician parents have a decreased desire to practice medicine as compared to their peers. As the challenges around parenting during the pandemic continue, medical schools, residency programs and institutions should consider implementing supports for these parents, including but not limited to childcare support.

The advertised topic of the study was schedules, safety, and well-being. Because this secondary topic of COVID-19 medical school experience and transition to residency was not mentioned on the study website, it likely did not attract those with heightened interest in this topic, further mitigating the risk of nonresponse bias. Additionally, for some questions, PGY1s were asked to recall events from several months earlier, potentially resulting in recall bias. However, we attempted to minimize this bias by excluding participants that completed the survey after August 1st. Lastly, the experiences of PGY1s in the United States may be different than the experience of PGY1s in other countries worldwide which may impact generalizability.
