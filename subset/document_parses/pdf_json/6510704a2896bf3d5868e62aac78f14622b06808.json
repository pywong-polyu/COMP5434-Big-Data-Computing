As a new data source for studying collaboration networks, metadata in data repositories compensate for the limitations of publication-based research on collaboration networks. This paper reports the findings from a GenBank metadata analytics project. We used network science methods to uncover the structures and dynamics of GenBank collaboration networks from 1992-2018. The longitudinality and large scale of this data collection allowed us to unravel the evolution history of collaboration networks and identify the trend of flattening network structures over time and optimal assortative mixing range for enhancing collaboration capacity. By incorporating metadata from the data production stage with the publication stage, we uncovered new characteristics of collaboration networks as well as developed new metrics for assessing the effectiveness of enablers of collaboration-scientific and technical human capital, cyberinfrastructure, and science policy.",

Since the 1980s, the U.S. federal government has invested significant resources into building cyberinfrastructure, including data repositories and research data services. In parallel with the advancement of CI and growth of data repositories is a paradigm shift in science from empiricism, theory, and simulation to data (i.e., the fourth paradigm), as envisioned by Jim Gray (Gray, 2007; Gray, Liu et al., 2005) and subsequently articulated by Szalay and Blakeley (2009) .

            "text": "The rapid increase in science data is attributable in no small part to the support provided by CI-enabled tools and services. The large number of tools for using the vast biomedical data available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s website underlines the importance of CI-enabled tools and services in data-driven science. GenBank is one of NCBI's key data repositories and stores \"massive amounts of genetic sequence data generated from evolving high-throughput sequencing technologies,\" serving \"more than 30 terabytes of biomedical data to more than 3.3 million users every day\" (NLM, 2015) . What is unclear in this grand picture of data-driven science is how this changing climate of science research has affected scientific capacity and the aggregation of the knowledge, skills, abilities, and technical facilities of individual scientists (referred to here as Scientific and Technical (S&T) Human Capital), as well as their networks of collaborative relationships (Bozeman, Dietz, & Gaughan, 2001) . More broadly, there is also an unanswered question of how CI-enabled data services have impacted the increment of scientific capacity at individual, project, and institutional levels, and if there is any impact, how much it has affected the extent and rate at which scientists turn data into knowledge. Understanding these questions will require data beyond publication metadata to enable novel insights into the grand picture of data-driven science and CI-enabled research. This paper reports the findings from a longitudinal study that uses the metadata from GenBank (Sayers, Cavanaugh et al., 2019) as the data source. We will first review previous research related to scientific collaboration networks and address the limitations of publication-based data sources in past research. As metadata from a data repository is a novel data source for studying collaboration networks, this paper attempts to provide the background of GenBank and its metadata and articulate on the suitability, feasibility, and possible issues in using this new data source to study data-intensive collaboration networks. Following the methods of data collection and processing, the analyses focus on the network structures and dynamics as well as their implications for the assessment of knowledge production and diffusion.",

            "text": "Collaboration in research is typically measured by coauthorship in publications. Researchers in a collaboration network are called nodes or vertices and the relationships (i.e., coauthorship) between nodes are edges. Collaboration networks with very large numbers of nodes and edges together with variant weights of edges and other factors are highly complex, as nodes have uneven numbers of edges and the edges may vary in length between nodes. Such networks consist of clusters or communities of researchers, which are self-organized, may be interconnected in some ways, and evolve over time. Over the last 50 years, since de Solla Price's work Little Science, Big Science (1963), scientific collaboration networks have been studied extensively from a wide range of disciplines. Newman (2001) collected and analyzed publication author data from MEDLINE, e-Print Archive, and NCSTRL, which represented the biomedical, physics, and computer science fields respectively. He found that these collaboration networks formed small worlds and the randomly selected nodes were typically separated by a short path of intermediate acquaintances. Scientific collaboration networks are essentially a kind of social network in which communities form through tightly knit groups (Girvan & Newman, 2002) . Such a social aspect can be reflected in whom a researcher chooses to collaborate with and how such collaborations may enhance their S&T human capital (Bozeman & Corley, 2004) . Barab\u00e1si, Jeong et al. (2002) give an excellent summary of the research on collaboration networks, which include: Most networks have the \"small world\" property; real networks have an inherent tendency to cluster, more so than comparable random networks; and the distribution of the number of edges for nodes (degree distribution) \"contains important information about the nature of the network, for many large networks following a scale-free power-law distribution\" (p. 591).",

Large data repositories have been built in the last three decades for researchers to submit, manage, share, and reuse data. For many scientific disciplines, submitting to a repository has become part of the regular research process and been made as policy mandates (NIH, 2021; NSF, 2020) . As the science paradigm shifts and data management and sharing policy mandates blurred the boundaries between data professionals and researchers, researchers have been devoting more time to data processing and analyses. The cause of this blurred division of labor stems from the work needed to make raw data clean. That is, data usually cannot be directly fed into algorithms without preprocessing, transformation, and sometimes meshing with other data sources (Kamath, 2009) . The impact of such paradigm shift on collaboration networks is largely unknown and publication coauthorship alone would be insufficient to address. The CI-enabled links between publications and data sets have created a ripe condition for studying complex collaboration networks on a large scale by integrating metadata from data submissions.",

In the discussion of each of these theories and models, Albert and Barab\u00e1si (2002) used the average path length, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution, among others, to explain the statistical mechanics of these theories and models, which are considered as three robust measures of a network's topology. Network theories and models have been applied in studying collaboration networks in biology, ecology, and physics, as mentioned in the previous section. Several properties of scientific collaboration networks have been identified in these studies: Small worlds are common in scientific communities; the networks are highly clustered; and biomedical research appears to have a much lower degree of clustering compared to other disciplines such as physics (Newman, 2001) . The evolution of scientific collaboration networks shows that the degree of distribution follows a power law and key network properties (diameter, clustering coefficient, and average degree of the nodes) are time-dependent; that is, the average separation decreases in time and clustering coefficient decays with time .",

Many of them are often limited in that the data used are filtered by discipline and period from a single database and almost exclusively use publication-based authorship data, as seen in the studies cited above. The limitations of data source and variant timescales make it very difficult, if not impossible, to generate data sets that can be meaningfully reused or integrated with other data sources for understanding the complexity of scientific collaboration networks. Metadata in scientific data repositories offer a new breed of data source for studying research networks. Their large scale and continuous time coverage provide a rich testbed not only for developing models and theories but also for meshing other related data sources to examine and interpret complex collaboration networks from more dimensions.",

The meeting participants agreed on \"the necessity to create a national, computerized database\" (Strasser, 2008, p. 537) . Three years later the Los Alamos Sequence Library became the cutting-edge repository-GenBank -for curating nucleic acid sequence data (Cinkoski, Fickett et al., 1991) . Soon after, the sequence data started to grow exponentially as the computer technology and network availability rapidly advanced in the second half of the 1980s. Meanwhile, nucleotide sequencing methods and technologies have evolved from the first generation represented by \"Sanger sequencing\" to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), which allowed many parallel sequencing reactions at a much lower cost, namely high-throughput sequencing (Heather & Chain, 2016) . During this period, the sequence data processed by GenBank grew from 1.38 million nucleotides in 1984 to 14.1 million in 1990 (Cinkoski et al., 1991) .",

The rapid increase in the volume of nucleotide sequence data soon made it clear that this model could not keep up with the growth of sequence data, as it was labor intensive, and the publishing of these data lagged far behind their generation. In addressing this problem, GenBank worked with journal editors to develop policies to make direct submission of sequence data to GenBank a requirement for publishing a paper. This policy mandate, together with automated data processing, not only reversed the data flow, which was originally from journal articles to GenBank (Cinkoski et al., 1991) , but also pioneered the incentive mechanisms for data sharing. Another significant driving force for GenBank's data growth is the Human Genome Project (HGP, https://www.genome.gov/ human-genome-project), which started in 1990 and was completed in 2003. Six years into the HGP, countries participating in this international effort reached consensus on the timely release of sequence data through the Bermuda Principles, which established policies on sequence data quality standards, sequence submission and annotation, and sequence claims and etiquette to ensure the prepublication sharing and rapid disclosure of sequence data (BERIS, 2019; Cook-Deegan & McGuire, 2017; Maxson Jones, Ankeny, & Cook-Deegan, 2018) . If the development of NGS technology accelerated the increment of the volume and kinds of sequence data and shifted data generation toward more analyses (Alekseyev, Fazeli et al., 2018) , then the journals' requirement for data submission before manuscript submission and the Bermuda Principles cultivated the data sharing culture, an impact that goes far beyond GenBank.",

We used this sample to examine the authors who submitted the sequences to GenBank and how they were related to the principal investigators (PI). The funding data set was extracted from the NIH RePORT database, which contains information on PIs, publications, and affiliations. We mapped the funding records to GenBank records by PubMed article ID (PMID), which allowed us to track submission author's affiliations and roles by triangulating with multiple sources of information, including affiliation and acknowledgment in the article, institutional and personal websites, LinkedIn, and researcher's curriculum vitae/resum\u00e9. The records examined represent only a small fraction of the GenBank records; hence we do not have the generalization power of the whole data collection.

In this context, the first author in data submission and publication was usually the doctoral student or postdoc. When the PIs were not included in the publication or submission, it seemed that they often held a position such as a director of a large laboratory or a government research staff position that did not allow them to engage in the project enough to be given the credit. In some cases, the submission authors were visiting scientists with their own grant and project but needed to use the research facility of a given PI. Although we observed in several acknowledgments that the sequencing was performed outside of the submission authors' labs, this did not change the fact that submission authors were mostly researchers themselves who were also actively engaged in publication activities.",

It is worth pointing out that the time between the date of submission and date of public release provides an important piece of information about the data-to-knowledge production. A GenBank record has two sets of authors: those in publications (references) and those in direct submissions of molecular sequences (i.e., the data authors). An author may or may not appear in both spaces, though it is likely that many authors reside in both the publication and sequence submission metadata. Because the act of data submission represents a stage in a research life cycle earlier than publication, examining the metadata about sequence data submissions and subsequent publications provides an opportunity to uncover how collaboration networks evolved \"in action\" and gain insights into research collaboration that publication authorships alone would have been unable to offer.",

This means that CC measures not only how much S&T human capital a person may accrue but more importantly, how effectively they can utilize the S&T human capital as well as the support provided by cyberinfrastructure and science policy to increase productivity and innovations.

Starting from 2008, the network appeared to be less concentrated on a few dominant hubs. More regional clusters or communities emerged with strong local connections (the red dots on the visualization represent the density of connections). It is notable that some highly connected node clusters emerged from outside the giant component and these clusters of nodes occurred mainly among the data submission nodes (Figure 4) . A possible explanation is that, as the number of edges remained steady, a decrease in the number of nodes means more links between fewer people in the giant component and the nodes that shifted outside of the giant component to form new, more tightly connected local clusters could be the reason for the shrinking giant component.",

As shown in Figure 5 , the clustering coefficient for both publication and data submission networks followed a downward trend, starting around 2007. It may be considered as a sign that GenBank networks were no longer dominated by a small number of highly connected \"hub\" nodes, but rather, the networks tended to be flatter, with more scattered, smaller clusters interconnected through a few bridge nodes. A similar trend is also visible in assortativity for both publication and submission networks, though with more turbulent fluctuations. Assortativity in networks measures the likelihood that nodes with similar properties link to other nodes with those properties. The measure ranges from \u22121 to 1, with 1 = perfect assortative mixing, 0 = nonassortative, and \u22121 = completely disassortative mixing. The fact that the assortativity coefficient for data submission network was near or below zero from 1993-1995, then above, and below zero again from 2016-2018 is an indication that the data submission network went through a structural shift from disassortative to assortative mixing then back to disassortative mixing ( Figure 5 ). In other words, author nodes were more likely to connect with those having similar properties, then dissimilar and then similar again over time. At the same time, the global network was flattening structurally (i.e., there were more locally tightly linked clusters that had connections to \"hub\" nodes through bridging nodes), which we see as more evidence for structural shift.",

The network graphs in Figure 6 show author nodes in both publication and data submission networks (the combined network). Colors indicate the level of assortativity, with red being the highest and blue the lowest in assortativity mixing. The assortativity coefficient peaked in 2002, then dropped steadily afterwards.

The plot shows that high levels of collaboration capacity are located between 0.1-0.6. The fact that the assortativity coefficient values were below 0.1 between 2013 and 2018 for data submission network (Table S3) can be interpreted as a below-optimal state of collaboration capacity, which coincides with the shrinking workforce and stagnant funding for young scientists in biomedical basic research (Levitt & Levitt, 2017; Pickett et al., 2015) . This evidence suggests that networks that are highly assortative or disassortative would not cultivate collaboration capacity as effectively as those with moderate assortative mixing of the nodes. This leads us to speculate that researchers are more likely to attract new collaborators when they also tend to work in a moderately diverse setting. Like-wise, working with new collaborators implies a more dynamic network with stronger S&T human capital (Bozeman et al., 2001) . Thus, the scatterplot in Figure 7 implies that in these networks there is an optimal state of assortative mixing.",

Using the ratio of the number of data submissions vs. the number of publications as a measure of data-intensiveness, the result shows a clear trend: The ratio increased steadily from 1992 through 2003 before leveling off in the next decade, which coincided with the Human Genome Project ending in 2003. Although there was a spike during 2015-16, the sudden drop in the ratio between 2017 and 2018 remains to be explored (Figure 8 ).",

On the one hand, the increase in the submission-publication ratio implies that a publication required more data to support or make conclusive findings over time. This may also reflect that science has been looking at increasingly big, complex problems, hence requiring more team members for data production in support of the publications. On the other hand, the ability of a scientist to secure sufficient and highly skilled S&T human capital will significantly affect their collaboration capacity, which in turn will affect their own productivity and influence in the collaboration network. The interaction of these two factors can be observed in Figure 9 , in which the percentage of authors who participated in data production (grey area) increased but those who only participated in publications decreased. As a percentage, authors who appeared in both data submission and publication networks remained stable after 1996.",

We assume that the greater the S&T human capital a researcher can accumulate or assemble, the more opportunity and resources they can garner to collaborate with other researchers and the more likely the S&T human capital will be used more effectively. In this sense, collaboration capacity is a framework of metrics developed for assessing the effectiveness of collaboration enablers in facilitating successful collaborations, fostering the growth of S&T human capital, and more importantly, accelerating innovations and new discoveries. Collaboration capacity is impacted by three enablers-cyberinfrastructure, S&T human capital, and science policy-and the evaluation of their impacts requires a set of metrics that can operationalize the key aspects that can reflect the impact of enablers.",

The structural shift and patterns of assortative mixing in the GenBank collaboration networks exhibit the evolution history and trends of a large research community. The sharp drop in the total number of authors in the data submissions network from 2016 to 2018 resonates with the steady drop in grant-eligible young principal investigators (PIs) in NIH R01 grant awards, which has been warned to have a negative impact on national competitiveness in biomedical research (Levitt & Levitt, 2017) . To verify whether any impact was generated on the data submissions, we used the data on sequences submitted to GenBank (NCBI, n.d.) to calculate the rate of increase. The results in Table S6 show that the number of sequences in yearly releases started to drop sharply in 2013 and the rate of increase has dropped to a historically low point (1.92, compared to 28.11 in 2005) in 2019. The drop in the number of sequences submitted to GenBank during 2013-2019 seems to correlate with the sharp drop in the data submission authors in our data. Although the COVID-19 pandemic reversed this trend (Table S6 shows that the numbers of sequences released in the first year of the pandemic [i.e., 2020] had skyrocketed by 83% of the previous year's release total and the growth trend continued in 2021), the rise and fall of sequence submissions is nonetheless worthy of further investigation. Nucleotide sequence data as one of the pillars of biomedical research play a critical role in diagnosis, treatment development, and many other theoretical and clinical research areas, and the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines is a great example.",

The significance of big metadata analytics lies in that the data sources cover a much larger part of a research life cycle from data to publications and can even be expanded to patents. These metadata are traces left from different stages of a research life cycle and can be valuable sources for not only enhancing research reproducibility but also uncovering characteristics and patterns of collaboration networks to help us understand better the effectiveness of collaboration capacity enablers and their impact on the transition from data to knowledge. Currently, we have integrated NIH funding data for the same period as well as matched patent metadata from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with those in the GenBank metadata collection to conduct further examination on questions arising from the analysis already conducted. For example, we identified nodes that had consistently high performance, from low to high performance, from high to low performance, and consistently low performance based on the number of publications and data submissions. We observed that an author with performance from low to high involved a transition from a major involvement in data submissions or equal share in data submission and publication to a major involvement in publication and less involvement in data submission. These findings raise more questions for further analysis on questions such the following: \"What are some of the characteristics of these categories of different performance levels?\" and \"How was collaboration capacity and funding associated with the level of performance?.\" The answers to questions of this nature will provide new understandings of the complex collaboration networks in data-intensive science.",
