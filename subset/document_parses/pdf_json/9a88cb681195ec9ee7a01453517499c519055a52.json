It includes those staying in homeless shelters or those who are sleeping on the streets ('rough sleepers'). It also includes staying in temporary accommodation such as bed and breakfasts, hostels, squats, or those 'sofa-surfing' between family and friends' houses. 1 Nearly 0.5% (280 000 people) in England are known to experience homelessness. 2 Additionally, before the COVID- 19 pandemic, approximately 5000 people slept rough in any one night in England. 3 Poverty, substance misuse, severe mental health problems, relationship breakdowns, and childhood trauma have been shown to be both causes and consequences of homelessness. 4 PEH are high users of emergency departments. 5 As demonstrated by previous research, key barriers to the utilisation of primary healthcare services by PEH include: the lack of tailored services to meet their multiple complex needs; services located within buildings and based on appointment systems that are difficult for PEH to navigate; difficulties in registering with a general practice owing to lack of address; and perceived stigma and discrimination towards PEH in primary care. 6 During the past decade, to help increase the accessibility of primary health care to PEH, specialist primary care services for individuals experiencing homelessness have been established across the UK. Such services include specialist health centres, general practices within homeless services, and mobile homeless health teams. 7, 8 Such services can include nurses, GPs, pharmacists, drug and alcohol dependence specialists, opticians, and psychologists. Some are based at fixed locations but others provide mobile clinics offering their services to hostels and day centres, thus making health care even more accessible to these individuals. However, such centres are only located in key urban areas, 7 operate limited hours, and may not able to serve all PEH.",

In addition, the results also suggest a potential lack of utilisation of mainstream GP practices by PEH, thus accentuating their limited access to primary healthcare services. The 43 registrants who identified as PEH within this study accounted for 0.013% of the population within the region; a region that has four times as many statutory PEH compared with the English national average. It is clear that this observed proportion is several folds smaller in comparison with the PEH prevalence of 0.5% in the English general population. 2 The low numbers of PEH identified through the data searches also suggests potential under-coding of homelessness in primary care medical records. When presenting to services, patients may not always declare their homelessness or may use their last permanent residence or temporary residence. The low numbers may also be explained by the itinerant nature of PEH, because patients may not reside for long enough at a fixed address within the mainstream practice's local catchment area, leading to lack of opportunity for practices to fully register patients. As homelessness overlaps with mental ill health, substance misuse, and long-term health conditions, capitalising on windows of opportunity to register patients (for example, when presenting for help for acute conditions) is a starting point for consistent coding in medical records and a subsequent offer of tailored support.",

Previous literature suggests that many PEH prefer to use specialist homeless healthcare services. 8 While commissioning more specialist primary healthcare centres could be one way to improve access of health services to PEH, mainstream services need to be adapted to be inclusive of PEH. Previous studies show that frontline primary healthcare staff are often unaware of patient registration guidelines. 15 There is a need for training and education of such staff to reinforce the registration guidelines allowing patients with no fixed abode to register without any problems. National distribution of 'My right to access healthcare' cards to PEH, as piloted in many geographical areas, 16 should be extended. There is a need for health services to comply with the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 17 to ensure that hospitals refer and provide liaison for the patients to primary care services. In addition, education of healthcare professionals should incorporate the healthcare issues of PEH. Previous studies have also shown that perceived stigma and discrimination in mainstream general practices by healthcare professionals and other patients are key barriers to accessing services. 6 Such factors also act as a barrier to patient transition from specialist homeless healthcare services to mainstream practices when patients find a permanent residence. 8 Anti-stigma intervention for healthcare professionals can be useful. 18 Appropriate coding of homelessness and associated health conditions is imperative to identify those in need of primary health care and to apply prevention measures. Recent studies conducted in primary care practices in Canada have demonstrated that screening patients for poverty, including housing insecurity, is feasible and lends to correct identification of patients facing social disadvantages. [19] [20] [21] As inequalities such as poverty and homelessness are modifiable (similar to drug misuse or smoking), proactive screening of such social circumstances using validated tools, which are acceptable for both patients and healthcare professionals, can identify patients at risk and those already facing adversities, leading to appropriate coding and provision of tailored support. In addition, homelessness also appears as a code in the international classification of disease (ICD-11 -QD71), allowing clinicians to record such status where applicable. 22 There is substantial literature showing the overlap between severe mental ill health, substance misuse, and early mortality. 23 Appropriate coding will prompt signposting and referral to support programmes that are relevant to health conditions that overlap with homelessness, such as mental ill health and substance misuse. This will facilitate appropriate follow-up, screening, timely treatment, and management practices.",

However, they often present late to the service, and their mortality in the emergency department is shown to be 12 times higher than the general population. 24 In addition to strengthening the inclusivity of mainstream practices to PEH, further research is also necessary to develop novel primary care services that can improve PEH access. Outreach-based interventions offered by nonmedical prescribers, including pharmacists and nurses, have been shown to be effective in identifying undiagnosed health conditions and minimising use of emergency departments. 25, 26 Qualitative studies show that PEH value such dedicated services. 27, 28 Establishment of tailored interventions, including outreach-based services, have been advocated in the NHS Long Term Plan. 29 There is also scope to widen the roles of community pharmacies as PEH utilise pharmacies on a regular basis for substance misuse treatment, needle exchange, and prescription collection. [30] [31] [32] [33] Clinical guidelines should be inclusive of social outcomes, such as homelessness, when providing services for substance misuse and severe mental illnesses. 34, 35 As this research only covered general practices within one CCG, a large-scale study capturing wider areas of the UK is needed to improve the generalisability of the findings. Larger national primary care databases, such as Clinical Practice Research Datalink and The Health Improvement Network database, can offer such opportunities. As the data in the present study compared health status of study participants with health status of PEH and general populations as reported in the published literature, future studies should consider a matched cohort design, with comparison of health status of PEH with the general populations within the same general practices.",
