            "text": "Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns over transmission risk from healthcare procedures, especially when operating in the head and neck such as during surgical repair of facial fractures. This study aims to quantify aerosol and droplet generation from mandibular and midface open fixation and measure mitigation of airborne particles by a smoke evacuating electrocautery hand piece. Materials and methods: The soft tissue of the bilateral mandible and midface of two fresh frozen cadaveric specimens was infiltrated using a 0.1% fluorescein solution. Surgical fixation via oral vestibular approach was performed on each of these sites. Droplet splatter on the surgeon's chest, facemask, and up to 198.12 cm (6.5 ft) away from each surgical site was measured against a blue background under ultraviolet-A (UV-A) light. Aerosol generation was measured using an optical particle sizer. Results: No visible droplet contamination was observed for any trials of mandible or midface fixation. Total aerosolized particle counts from 0.300-10.000 \u03bcm were increased compared to baseline following each use of standard electrocautery (n = 4, p < 0.001) but not with use of a suction evacuating electrocautery hand piece (n = 4, p = 0.103). Total particle counts were also increased during use of the powered drill (n = 8, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Risk from visible droplets during mandible and midface fixation is low. However, significant increases in aerosolized particles were measured after electrocautery use and during powered drilling. Aerosol dispersion is significantly decreased with the use of a smoke evacuating electrocautery hand piece.",

Within the medical field, the question of how to provide care safely when it cannot be deferred without detriment to the patient has led to a heterogeneity of policies across institutions and specialties [3, 4] . Topics ranging from the recommended level of personal protective equipment (PPE) to the utility of pre-procedural COVID-19 testing remain unclear, demonstrating a need for standardized recommendations. This is especially true in the care of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma, as operative repair may be time-sensitive to prevent long-term complications [5, 6] , and multiple specialties are typically involved in the care of these individuals whose injuries often require various approaches [7] .",

These droplets can carry viral particles greater than two meters away from an infected individual, contaminating surfaces on which they land [22] . Our experiments demonstrated that mandible (n = 4) and midface (n = 4) fixation performed through the oral vestibular approach generated no visible droplets between 15.24 and 198.12 cm (0.5-6.5 ft) away from the surgical site when measured superior and inferior to the specimen and across from the surgeon. Additionally, no droplets were seen on the surgeon's chest or face shield in any condition tested. Droplets were seen but not quantified on the instruments and specimen after each dissection. This provides evidence that droplet generation from these approaches likely all occurs within 15.25 cm (0.5 ft) from the surgical site. One possible factor is that the oral cavity and lips function as a partial barrier to droplet splatter. As such, mandible and midface fixation through more open approaches may be more droplet generating. This novel finding is an important consideration that should be weighed against the risk of interacting with oral cavity mucosa when performing these procedures on patients who may harbor viral illness.",

Asterisk (*) represents a significant change from baseline (p < 0.001). data demonstrate that for mandible and midface fixation, use of the powered drill for plating also produces a modest increase in particle counts compared to baseline during drilling for total counts (p < 0.001) and in 11 of 16 size distributions measured (p \u2264 0.028) [Fig. 3B ]. However, total particle counts during the 60 s following completion of drilling, and the increase seen during drilling was a fraction of the amplitude compared to electrocautery use [ Fig. 3C ]. This suggests that while drilling does produce aerosols, the number of particles produced is relatively low compared to electrocautery, and the generated particles dissipate quickly. Differences compared to other types of drilling may be due to the smaller caliber of drill bit and short duration of use. In addition, recent literature suggests that using irrigation while drilling as in this study mitigates aerosol generation [29] .",

Aerosol generation resulted largely from the use of electrocautery, with powered drilling producing a statistically significant but relatively small number of particles. Large amounts of particles were produced in the respirable (<5 \u03bcm) [30] and sub-micron range. Production of sub-micron particles is of particular concern as these have been demonstrated to have a greater propensity to penetrate N95 respirators [31] . The authors recommend the use of a smoke evacuating electrocautery hand piece when possible in patients who may harbor SARS-CoV-2, as its use resulted in a significant reduction in particle counts. However, further research is required to accurately quantify the risk of viral transmission posed by these procedures. Until then, the use of enhanced PPE with N95 or powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) and pre-procedural testing is recommended where resources permit.",

In terms of aerosols, the OPS measures particle concentrations only in the 0.300 to 10.000 \u03bcm size range at a single fixed location, which in this study was across from the surgeon. Therefore, our data may only reflect aerosol exposure to the surgeon and surgical technologist. Further studies should measure aerosol levels at the average distance of anesthesia and circulating staff. Moreover, future studies should also investigate aerosol generation with patients in the operating room, as surgery in live patients may be different than cadaver heads due to normal physiologic temperature and blood flow. Finally, we did not study the presence of viral particles or their infectious ability, aerodynamic properties, desiccation, or deposition patterns.",
