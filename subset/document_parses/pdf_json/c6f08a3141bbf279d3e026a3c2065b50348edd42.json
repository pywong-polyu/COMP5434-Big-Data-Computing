            "text": "In 2013, the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health (CIH) published Global Health 2035, a global health investment framework [1] . The CIH showed that with the right investments to scale up existing evidence-based health interventions and new health technologies, a \"grand convergence\" in global health-a universal reduction in deaths from infections and maternal and child health conditions to low levels-was possible by 2035. The CIH also showed the feasibility of sharply reducing the global burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and of reaching universal health coverage (UHC) with a package of \"pro-poor\" interventions. This vision could now be under threat. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to disruption of prevention and treatment services worldwide [2, 3] , such as tuberculosis (TB) and childhood vaccination programs [4] [5] [6] . This article examines the potential impact of such disruptions on progress toward grand convergence and UHC. We begin with a brief summary of Global Health 2035 and of the follow-up report (\"CIH 2.0\"), published 5 years later in 2018, since these 2 reports provide a baseline upon which we can assess the impact of COVID-19. Next, we summarize evidence on how COVID-19 is affecting health services. We then analyze historical trends in maternal, child, HIV, and TB mortality from 2000 to 2019. We use these to explore what would have happened if these trends had continued unchanged (a \"no COVID-19\" scenario) and what might happen under 3 alternative COVID-19 disruption scenarios (minor, moderate, or severe disruption in long-term mortality trends). We examine how the pandemic's impact on the global economy could affect the realization of UHC in low-income countries (LICs) and lower middle-income countries (LMICs). We conclude by exploring what our findings mean for domestic and international health policymaking.",

These countries would need external financing to make up for insufficient resources. Global Health 2035 was published at a time when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was very optimistic about the pace of economic growth in LICs and LMICs.

This modeling should be seen as a \"what-if\" exercise rather than a statement of the most likely future path. The objective of our modeling exercise was to understand, quantitatively, how much the pandemic might throw the world off track for grand convergence and what sort of acceleration in progress would be needed to get back on track. We first projected what would have happened under a \"no COVID\" scenario (i.e., continuation of mortality levels and trends observed over 2010 to 2019) and then under 3 different disruption scenarios (minor, moderate, and severe). We used existing evidence to develop the parameters for these 3 scenarios [21] [22] [23] [24] . All 3 assumed a 5% increase in mortality for TB and HIV, U5MR, and MMR in 2020 and 2021 (we call this the \"affected phase\"). For the post COVID-19 period (from 2022 onward), our minor, moderate, and severe scenarios employ different assumptions regarding the average annual rate of change (AARC) in all-ages mortality rates (Box 1).

Thus, even under the most optimistic scenario (S1), we believe that new technologies and strong political commitment will be needed in order to create an \"enabling environment\" for high-burden countries to achieve more rapid rates of decline in TB mortality to reach convergence. As mentioned, China increased public sector spending on health after the 2003 SARS endemic [26] , which benefited its overall health system, including strengthening its immunization and TB programs. India, one of the high-burden countries for TB, aims to eliminate TB by 2025, which is likely impossible [27] .

Most economies are expected to rebound fairly quickly as long as the pandemic is brought under control in 2021. However, since economies are expected to contract substantially in 2020, maintaining historical rates of growth over 2020 to 2035 would result in lower spending on health by 2035 relative to what could have been achieved had there not been a pandemic. For example, an LIC that has historically achieved 4% GDP growth annually would increase its GDP by 87% in 2035 relative to 2019. If that same country's economy contracted by 5% in 2020 and remained stagnant in 2021, then resumed its 4% annual growth rate, it would only be able to increase its GDP by 65% in 2035 relative to 2019.

Previous modeling studies showed that this level of coverage would be required for these interventions to ensure the grand convergence, and related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets would be achieved [36] . We then projected total domestic resources available for health by triangulating GDP growth projections from the IMF, estimates of the share of GDP devoted to public sector spending on health from WHO, and projection methods and assumptions detailed in previous CIH analyses [37] . Table 1 summarizes the findings of our analysis. By 2035, LICs would only be able to finance about a third of the costs of the package through domestic sources unless they assign substantially higher priority to health than now seems likely. LMICs would only be able to finance a little less than half. With either income group, there would inevitably be some countries with stronger growth that would be able to fully finance the package, whereas the costs would probably be out of reach for other countries.

However, without a balanced approach to UHC that includes building capacity to address NCDs and injuries, countries may find themselves further behind on population health indicators as the residual burden of grand convergence conditions is addressed. Indeed, as shown in Alma-Ata at 40 years, age-specific death rates for NCDs and injuries are increasing, rather than decreasing in some LICs and LMICs (as compared to HICs, where they continue to decrease). These trends suggest that health inequalities across countries could become even more pronounced beyond 2035 if national governments and development partners focus solely on financing and implementing grand convergence-related interventions.",

The Serum Institute of India, one of the largest vaccine manufacturers, produces 70 million doses every month, and it is expected to increase its capacity to produce 100 million doses per month from July 2021 [40] . Manufacturing in the US and other high-income nations is expected to ramp up in 2021 to produce enough doses to cover not just their own nations but to donate doses to COVAX or directly to LICs and LMICs. These countries will require easy to deliver, affordable vaccines in large quantities to cover their populations. The US has recently joined other nations in supporting an intellectual property waiver on COVID-19 vaccines, which could give the green light to LICs and LMICs to start manufacturing their own vaccines (this would also require technology transfer and support for scaling manufacturing facilities and capacity). Distribution challenges in some LICs and LMICs include insufficient health workers, the cold chain requirements, and reaching people in urban slums and hard-to-reach regions [41] . To date, licensed vaccines remain efficacious against all known variants of concern. Nevertheless, there remains the possibility that new variants could evade vaccine-induced immunity.",

If this trend continued beyond 2035, the grand convergence target would not be reached until 2048.Under-5 mortality rate. The picture is less optimistic for the U5MR than it is for HIV:\u2022 S0 scenario: By 2035, the U5MR would fall to 21.8 per 1,000 live births, higher than the grand convergence target of 16 per 1,000 live births. The target would be reached around 2045, 10 years after the deadline. In its Alma-Ata at 40 study, the CIH projected that the target would be reached by 2038, based on the historical AARC from 2010 to 2016; our more pessimistic finding reflects the fact that the historical AARC from 2009 to 2019 is lower than that from 2010 to 2016 (the AARC from 2016 to 2019 was lower than expected).\u2022 S1 scenario: During the acceleration phase (2025 to 2035), the U5MR would fall by 6% annually (the AARC seen at the 90th percentile of LICs and LMICs from 2009 to 2019). At this rate of decline, the U5MR in 2035 would be 19.0 per 1,000 live births, lower than the S0 projection. To reach the grand convergence target by 2035, an AARC of 7% would be needed between 2022 and 2035. Is this feasible? Historically, from 2009 to 2019, the AARC in the U5MR was just over 3% globally and the best-performing LICs or LMICs were Malawi, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, and Rwanda, which achieved an AARC of around 7%[30]. Thus, political commitment, technological breakthroughs, and/or more efficient scale-up of existing tools would be needed to reach convergence by 2035.\u2022 S2 scenario: In this scenario, the U5MR from 2025 to 2035 falls at 3% annually (the historical AARC), and U5MR in 2035 would be 28.5 per 100,000. If this trend continued, the grand convergence target would not be achieved until 2052.\u2022 S3 scenario: Here, the U5MR from 2027 to 2035 falls by 3% (the AARC seen at the 40th percentile of LICs and LMICs from 2009 to 2019), and the U5MR in 2035 would be 31.6 per 1, 000 live births.
