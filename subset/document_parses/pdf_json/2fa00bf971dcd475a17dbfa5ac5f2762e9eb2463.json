Design Rapid scoping review. Literature review with fixed search terms, up to 1 April 2020. Central tendency and variation of the parameter estimates for infectious period in (A) asymptomatic and (B) symptomatic cases from (1) virological studies (repeated testing), (2) tracing studies and (3) modelling studies were gathered. Narrative review of viral dynamics. Information sources Search strategies developed and the following searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Additionally, the Health Information Quality Authority (Ireland) viral load synthesis was used, which screened literature from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, NHS evidence, Cochrane, medRxiv and bioRxiv, and HRB open databases. Results There was substantial variation in the estimates, and how infectious period was inferred. One study provided approximate median infectious period for asymptomatic cases of 6.5-9.5 days. Median presymptomatic infectious period across studies varied over <1-4 days. Estimated mean time from symptom onset to two negative RT-PCR tests was 13.4 days (95% CI 10.9 to 15.8) but was shorter when studies included children or less severe cases. Estimated mean duration from symptom onset to hospital discharge or death (potential maximal infectious period) was 18.1 days (95% CI 15.1 to 21.0); time to discharge was on average 4 days shorter than time to death. Viral dynamic data and model infectious parameters were often shorter than repeated diagnostic data. Conclusions There are limitations of inferring infectiousness from repeated diagnosis, viral loads and viral replication data alone and also potential patient recall bias relevant to estimating exposure and symptom onset times.

The model assumes that the individual study true effects are distributed with a variance \u03c4 2 around an overall true effect, but the model makes no assumptions about the form of the distribution of either the within-study or the between-studies effects. Weightings were derived from the SE (precision) around the estimate. Comparisons were presented as forest plots. Heterogeneity between studies was tested using Cochrane's Q; the magnitude of the heterogeneity was categorised using I 2 as high (>75%), moderate (50%-75%) or low (<50%). 24 Variation in duration across T5 virological studies was compared using a random effects (RE) meta-regression model, using the METAREG command in Stata V.15.1. The hypothesis that heterogeneity may be related to the inclusion of children or depending on symptom severity within the sample was tested in separate univariate models. Severity was dichotomised (0/1) into studies that included patients described as having 'mild' or 'mild-moderate' symptoms versus studies that included patients with 'moderate-severe' or 'severe' symptoms. Similarly, studies were categorised into having some samples from 'children' (as reported in the paper), or wholly adult samples. These variables were then fitted as a dichotomous dummy predictor (independent variable). The parameter estimates from the regression model was solved using restricted maximum likelihood; additionally, p values were estimated using a Monte Carlo model with 1000 permutation test. 25 Raw patient-level data were available from three studies in relation to time from onset to hospital discharge or death (potentially inferring maximal T5 duration). To estimate the predicted mean and 95% CI duration across these studies, data were analysed using a Gaussian RE model (using XTREG command, Stata V.15), with study categories fitted as the RE.

Studies that have investigated blood samples have provided some evidence for an association with severity of infection, 16 60 though it is not clear whether this is a consistent feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 40 It should be noted the lack of data on presymptomatic or asymptomatic cases with regards viral load. An exception was Kam et al, 61 who describe a presymptomatic case in an infant. In another study, Zou et al 53 [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and throat swabs (Ct values: 30-32) testing positive on days 7, 10 and 11 after contact.
