As a result, one of the most challenging aspects of public health is prioritizing the use of limited resources. Building on the foundation of previous researchers, the goal of this exploratory study was to provide current estimates for the actual causes of death, media attention, policy focus, and research funding in the United States. In addition, we sought to calculate and compare media attention, policy attention, and research funding trends to better assess the nation's prioritization of health issues. Using a systematic approach, we and compared how the actual causes of death in the United States align with health-related media attention, policy attention, and federal spending. Overall, our findings suggest that our priorities are not well-aligned with the actual causes of death. Certain actual causes appear to be consistently misaligned across media, legislative, and financial sectors (e.g., tobacco).

Though it was ranked as the second largest actual cause of death in the United States, tobacco consistently ranked lower than many other causes of death in media attention, policy legislation, and allocated research funding. This may be due in part to the longstanding knowledge of tobacco's negative health effects, compared to emerging public health issues, such as illicit drug use (in particular opioid use). The consistently low tobacco ranking may also be a result of the strong political influence of the tobacco industry (40) . Finally, the limited presence of tobacco-related focusing events, drivers of policy change that encourage political focus on a particular issue (41, 42) , may help to explain the relatively limited emphasis in media, policy, and government spending. Examples of tobacco-related focusing events include the Master Settlement Agreement in 1998, which limited tobacco advertising (43) , as well as recent hospitalizations and deaths due to e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury (44, 45) . Without the presence of such events, chronic diseases may be less likely to find \"windows of opportunity\" (42) and, consequently, receive media, policy, or funding attention. Overall, these rankings suggest that the resources for some diseases or conditions may be out of proportion with the overall burden (i.e., morbidity and mortality).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 585, "end": 589, "text": "(40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 736, "end": 740, "text": "(41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 741, "end": 744, "text": "42)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 969, "end": 973, "text": "(43)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1078, "text": "(44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1082, "text": "45)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1195, "text": "(42)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Additionally, the Spearman correlations revealed misalignments between the actual causes of death and media, policy, and federal funding.

However, the correlations between legislation and the actual causes of death are still only small-to-moderate. It is also worth noting that the r-value decreases slightly between proposed legislation and passed legislation.

First, we acknowledge that mortality is not the only outcome that public health interventions seek to impact but rather is one easily accessible in studies like this one. Though this study selected mortality as its outcome of interest, other factors (e.g., morbidity and sociopolitical context) also influence the prioritization of public health resources. Another possible limitation of this study relates to the selected databases. For example, while both Media Cloud and Nexis Uni were chosen to provide an extensive, comprehensive approach to media, these databases do not capture all forms of media attention. As a result, there were likely pertinent data not captured in this analysis, which may have impacted the results. Data identified in this study-in media, policy, and government spending-were analyzed based on quantity, and each occurrence was given an equal weight. Future studies may explore the reach or quality of data from these databases (e.g., placing a relative weight on individual social media shares compared to a national news outlet). It is also important to acknowledge that this paper focused only on the proposal and implementation of federal-level policies. Though state and locallevel policies can significantly impact public health outcomes (46) , we believe that shifting the nation's focus as a whole will need to include a significant focus at the federal level. Future studies may explore and contrast state and local-level policy and media attention in relation to the actual causes of death. In addition, as noted in previous studies (47) , due to the complexity and variation across agencies, as well as difficulty accessing data, we were unable to find public health spending costs for specific causes of death. As a result, we chose to use the TAGGS database as a proxy for national-level public health spending. Additionally, though we suggest multipronged approaches to address the actual causes of death, we recognize that increased media attention, national policies, and government spending are not causally linked with lower levels of actual causes of deaths. However, as we have described, similar approaches have demonstrated promising results, including decreased morbidity and mortality (29) . Lastly, a limitation of this paper was that it did not account for lobbying funds related to specific causes of death. Research has shown that lobbying can impact legislators' voting and, consequently, available funding (46, (48) (49) (50) (51) . However, analyzing lobbying funds was beyond the scope of this project but could be addressed in future work. Despite these limitations, this study adds to the existing policy literature by exploring media coverage, policy attention, and government spending as indicators of public health attention and priorities in the United States. Based on the results of their study, McGinnis and Foege called for a greater investment in prevention, thus shifting away from a disease treatment approach (30) . Likewise, Mokdad et al. described the substantial number of deaths attributable to poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and suggested that a more preventative approach to health may impact mortality (31). In a related study, Vargas and colleagues found that the leading causes of death in the United States are under-represented in the NIH prevention research portfolio (52) . This study revealed similar findings regarding the actual causes of death in the United States. Additionally, it highlighted incongruences between the actual causes of death and media attention, policy attention, and government spending.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1318, "end": 1322, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1617, "end": 1621, "text": "(47)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2283, "end": 2287, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2510, "end": 2514, "text": "(46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2515, "end": 2519, "text": "(48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2520, "end": 2524, "text": "(49)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2525, "end": 2529, "text": "(50)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2530, "end": 2534, "text": "(51)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3029, "end": 3033, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3413, "end": 3417, "text": "(52)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitation"}, {"text": "There are two primary implications that arise from the findings of this study. First, there is a need be sure that actual causes of death are receiving adequate attention. As previous researchers have noted, prioritizing the use of limited resources is imperative for public health impact (53) . Unfortunately, resources in the United States-media, policy, and funding channels-are currently prioritizing different issues, leading to incongruences in the nation's focus on public health. The misalignments across media, policy, and funding sectors may be related to stakeholders' vested interests (e.g., generating interest in news stories vs. satisfying constituents).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 289, "end": 293, "text": "(53)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitation"}, {"text": "When we consider redistributing limited resources, it is important to clarify that we are not simply advocating for the shifting of resources from one preventable cause of death in favor of another. Public health is often a zero-sum game (i.e., the total amount for prevention is relatively fixed over time), and decreasing mortality rates is far more complex than simply redistributing resources. Instead, we are acknowledging that the actual causes of death would be best addressed through prevention (54) , and, unfortunately, resources dedicated to prevention constitute only a small portion of total healthcare spending. In 2017, roughly 95% of healthcare spending was treatment-focused, leaving only 5% for prevention and public health efforts (55) . The U.S. healthcare system is primarily focused on medical treatment; however, a shift toward prevention would result in a more effective and efficient use of resources (47) . This is particularly challenging in public health, due to the reliance on resource-based planning, which often prioritizes immediate health needs (i.e., medical treatment) over long-term challenges (56) . The results of disease prevention efforts may not be immediately apparent, thus diminishing the perceived sense of urgency by stakeholders and the public. Given the limited resources designated for public health efforts, it may be beneficial to maximize the impact of resources to better align with the actual causes of death in the United States.

We recognize that public health and policy researchers are acting within a broader political, social, and economic context, but these action steps may help address the misalignments between media attention, policy attention, government spending, and the leading actual causes of death. Such coordinated and comprehensive efforts on a national scale could be used to improve health and decrease death totals for many-if not all-of the actual causes of death.
