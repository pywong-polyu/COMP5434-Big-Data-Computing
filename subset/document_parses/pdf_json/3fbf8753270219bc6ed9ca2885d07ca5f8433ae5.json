In the present study, we deal with a susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) metapopulation model where the epidemic process in each patch is represented by an SIR model and the mobility of individuals is assumed to be a homogeneous diffusion. We consider two types of patches including high-risk and low-risk ones under the assumption that a local patch is changed from a high-risk one to a low-risk one by an intervention. We theoretically analyze the intervention threshold which indicates the critical fraction of low-risk patches for preventing a global epidemic outbreak. We show that an intervention targeted to high-degree patches is more effective for epidemic control than a random intervention. The theoretical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations for synthetic and realistic scale-free patch networks. The theoretical results also reveal that the intervention threshold depends on the human mobility network and the mobility rate. Our approach is useful for exploring better local interventions aimed at containment of epidemics.",

Countermeasures, such as vaccinations, antiviral medications, and social distancing, have been practiced for controlling past infectious diseases. However, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases pose perpetual challenges for controlling them due to environmental changes and diversification of human behavior [1, 2] . Therefore, it is significant to continuously explore systematic methods for planning effective epidemic control strategies. Mathematical models are powerful tools for understanding epidemic spreading processes which are complex phenomena involved in the type of disease, host immunity, environmental conditions, and human mobility patterns [3] . Mathematical methods have been widely used to estimate epidemic outcomes and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures.",

            "text": "There are a variety of mathematical models for epidemic spreading, from simple to complex ones. Compartment epidemic models assuming homogeneous mixing of individuals are classical and simple [4] . These models have been extended to more complex and realistic ones by incorporating additional factors, such as social structures [5] , spatial structures [6] , seasonal forcing [7] [8] [9] , and human mobility patterns [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Metapopulation epidemic models are a class of models that describe epidemic spreading processes in a group of spatially separated patches connected via migration pathways. This framework has been intensively studied to develop analytical methods for global epidemic thresholds [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] and widely applied to understanding actual epidemic outbreaks [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . In a metapopulation model, infection and recovery events occur in each patch and migration of individuals potentially causes global epidemic spreading. Metapopulation models have often been employed to consider inhomogeneous mixing of individuals. The SIR metapopulation model with fully connected patches was analyzed to examine the properties of the global basic reproduction number (which is differentiated from the local basic reproduction number in an isolated patch) governing the global epidemic threshold [35, 36] . The global reproduction number can be numerically estimated using the next-generation matrix approach, but a theoretical issue is to derive its explicit expression as a function of system parameters, including local epidemiological parameters and human mobility patterns [37] .",

They clarified the effect of heterogeneous network connectivity on the global epidemic threshold. The analysis was conducted under the assumption that the local reproduction number is the same for all the patches. However, the conditions of patches are thought to be heterogeneous in reality. In fact, it was reported that the local reproduction numbers estimated from real data for seasonal influenza are different between local areas [38] . The heterogeneity of local reproduction numbers can be partially attributed to the difference in the immunization coverage rates in local areas. Under the patch heterogeneity, the effectiveness of strategic interventions for epidemic control has been evaluated using a susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) metapopulation model in our previous study [39] . The result shows that targeted interventions for high-degree patches are more effective than random interventions. However, it is still unclear whether this result holds for other types of metapopulation models. For instance, the SIR epidemic process representing an epidemic outbreak as a transient state is qualitatively different from the SIS epidemic process representing an endemic state as a stationary state. In fact, theoretical approaches are completely different between them; the global epidemic threshold of an SIR metapopulation model is analyzed based on a branching process method [18, 19] , while that of an SIS metapopulation model is analyzed based on local stability of the disease-free equilibrium state [39, 40] . Thus, the impact of local intervention in SIR metapopulation models with patch heterogeneity still remains to be studied.",

This model framework is similar to that considered in Ref. [39] , but the epidemic process is qualitatively different. We introduce an intervention rate u representing the fraction of low-risk patches that have received intervention. When u = 0, all the patches are high-risk and a global epidemic outbreak inevitably occurs. In the other extreme case with u = 1, all the patches are low-risk and a global epidemic outbreak is prevented. Therefore, we can expect that there is a certain critical value u = u c \u2208 (0, 1) (called an intervention threshold), separating the outbreak and nonoutbreak regimes. We use this threshold as a measure to compare different intervention strategies. The smaller the intervention threshold is, the more effective the intervention strategy is. The main novelty of this study is to theoretically derive the intervention threshold u c for random and targeted interventions. Furthermore, our theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. The comparison of the intervention thresholds shows that targeted intervention for high-degree patches is more effective than random intervention. Our result indicating the effectiveness of targeted intervention in metapopulations reminds us of the effectiveness of targeted immunization in complex contact networks of individuals [41, 42] . However, these model frameworks are largely different because dynamical processes within network nodes are considered in metapopulation models but not in contact network models.",

The number of patches is denoted by V . The patches are assumed to totally contain a sufficiently large number N of individuals, who are susceptible (S), infected (I), or recovered (R). Epidemic dynamics in each patch follows an SIR process [43] : a susceptible individual changes to an infected one with transmission rate \u03b2 when contacting with an infected individual (S + I \u2192 2I); an infected individual changes to a recovered one with recovery rate \u03bc (I \u2192 R). We assume homogeneous mixing of individuals in each patch where the local reproduction number is given by R 0 = \u03b2/\u03bc. To allow global epidemic spreading, the local reproduction number R 0 needs to be larger than unity. Individuals can migrate from one patch to a neighboring one through the pathway. This is regarded as a diffusion process [40] and the diffusion rate from a patch is denoted by p. Under a homogeneous diffusion process, the diffusion rate from a patch with degree k to one of the neighboring patches (with any degree k ) is given by",

We assume that only a fraction of patches can receive intervention and become low-risk due to budgetary constraints. The local reproduction number in such low-risk patches is denoted by R L 0 and that in the remaining high-risk patches is by R H 0 (>R L 0 ). Let us define D n k,H and D n k,L as the numbers of infected high-risk and low-risk patches with degree k at generation n, respectively. The numbers of individuals who experience the disease during an outbreak in the high-risk and low-risk patches are represented as \u03b1 H N k and \u03b1 L N k , respectively. The numbers of seeds from high-risk and low-risk patches with degree k are denoted by \u03bb H k k and \u03bb L k k , respectively. We define Q(k) as the probability that a randomly chosen patch with degree k is a low-risk one. Considering the transmission of infection from high-risk and low-risk patches separately, the recurrence formulas for D n k,H and D n k,L are written as follows [as in Eq. (4)]:",

The numbers of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals in patch j are denoted by S j , I j , and R j , respectively. A patch whose degree is close to k is chosen to have ten initial infected individuals. The remaining individuals are susceptible. We consider discrete-time dynamical processes and denote the unitary time step by \u03c4 . At each time step, the state of each individual in patch j is probabilistically updated. The update process consists of two stages: epidemic and mobility stages. In the epidemic stage, each susceptible individual turns into an infected one with probability 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2 j \u03c4 /N j ) I j and each infected individual turns into a recovered one with probability \u03bc\u03c4 . After all individuals have been updated in the epidemic stage, the mobility stage starts. In the mobility stage, each individual moves to one of the neighboring patches with probability p\u03c4 .

The global reproduction number R tg c for a scale-free patch network is shown as a function of the intervention rate u and the mobility rate p in Fig. 5 . As in the random intervention case, R tg c increases with decreasing u and increasing p. We can obtain the critical intervention threshold u tg c by numerically solving R tg c = 1 with respect to u. The yellow filled circles represent the values of u tg c which increase with p. By comparing Fig. 5 with Fig. 2 , it can be visually confirmed that the critical intervention threshold for targeted intervention (u tg c ) is much smaller than that for random intervention (u rn c ). The critical intervention threshold u tg c is obtained by solving R c = 1 with respect to u using Eqs. (30) and (40) . The threshold is plotted as a function of the degree exponent \u03b3 and the mobility rate p in Fig. 6 . In contrast to the random intervention case, there is no remarkable change in u c with increasing \u03b3 for a fixed value of p. This result implies that a very small intervention rate with which a few hub patches are changed to low-risk ones is sufficient for preventing global outbreaks.",

Under the assumption that a high-risk patch is changed to a low-risk patch by reducing the local reproduction number by an intervention, we have compared the effectiveness of random and targeted interventions through theoretical and numerical analyses. The theoretical results have shown that the intervention targeted to high-degree patches is more effective than the random intervention. They have been validated by the numerical simulations using the synthetic scale-free networks and the realistic U.S. airport network. Our result indicating the effectiveness of the targeted intervention for SIR metapopulation models is consistent with that for SIS metapopulation models in a similar framework [39] . As the global reproduction number is expressed as a function of the intervention rate and the mobility rate, one can calculate the critical intervention threshold for a given mobility rate and estimate the minimum effort for containment of epidemics. We have found that a higher human mobility rate leads to a larger intervention threshold. This finding suggests that travel restrictions are effective, especially when using targeted intervention. We have also revealed that the intervention threshold is larger for a scale-free patch network with a smaller degree exponent. This result implies that an existence of a very big hub patch increases the difficulty of preventing global outbreaks.",

There are other types of human mobility patterns, such as recurrent (commuting) mobility [20, 21, 27, 28, 53] and adaptive mobility [22, 54] . Moreover, human mobility networks can be better estimated from higher-resolution data such as real-world traffic network data [11, 55] , mobile phone data [14, 53, 56] , and GPS data [57] . It is also intriguing to test other intervention strategies, such as those based on other network centralities, because the important patches are not necessarily high-degree ones. Another strategy is to combine the intervention to local patches and travel restrictions. It would be possible that the optimal intervention strategy is different depending on how to evaluate the epidemic outcome. Therefore, an appropriate assessment of the social impact of global epidemics from microscopic and macroscopic levels is becoming increasingly important [58, 59] .",
