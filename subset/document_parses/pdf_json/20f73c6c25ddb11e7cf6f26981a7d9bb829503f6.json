The effectiveness of vaccination also depends on the induced immune response. Currently there is no method to measure the cellular immune response in blood samples. The functional activity of cells of innate and adaptive immune system is determined by coordinated activity of signaling pathways, especially the JAK-STAT pathways. Using a previously described approach we developed mRNA-based tests to measure activity of these signaling Page2 pathways, and show that they can be used to measure in a quantitative manner the cellular innate and adaptive immune response to a viral infection or vaccine in whole blood, PBMC, and specific immune cell type samples. Pathway activity level and range in healthy individuals was established, enabling interpretation of a pathway activity score on a patient sample without the need for a reference sample. Evidence is presented that the pathway activity analysis may also be useful for in vitro vaccine development and assessment of vaccine immunogenicity. Other envisioned applications lie in development of immunomodulatory drugs and drug response prediction and monitoring. Tests are expected to be of value in the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the described Affymetrix microarray-based pathway tests for measuring host immune response, qPCR-based versions are in development; the latter can in principle be performed within three hours in routine hospital labs.",

            "text": "A good functioning immune system is crucial to protect against diseases, such as viral and bacterial infections and cancer (1). It generates an immune response to non-self antigens, such as a component of a virus, or an abnormal protein produced by a cancer cell. Briefly and highly simplified, an immune response consists of an innate immune response which has an inflammatory component and is responsible for rapid non-specific attack and removal of pathogens and for presentation of pathogen-derived antigens to the cells of the adaptive immune response, which is responsible for generating long term immunity. Both parts of the immune system contain different immune cell types that cooperate to generate an effective immune response. They communicate via a large number of cytokines, such as interleukins and interferons. Cytokines convey messages from one cell to the other by binding to specific cellular receptors to activate cellular signal transduction pathways, especially the JAK-STAT pathways, resulting in production of proteins that adapt the function of the immune cell as response to the cytokine signal. In this highly organized system, dendritic cells are the most important antigen presenting cells bridging the innate and adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune response consists of a humoral response, that is, antibodies specifically generated against the pathogen by B-cells, and a cellular immune response, effectuated by cytotoxic T-cells. For an adequate response to a dominantly intracellular pathogen, such as a virus or in case of cancer cells, the cellular immune response is of prime importance, in addition to the production of neutralizing antibodies. The effectiveness with which the immune system can mount a response Page3 to a pathogen is determined by multiple factors, such as the amount and type of pathogen, genetic variations in relevant immune genes, patient comorbidities, and use of drugs which may have a suppressive, or stimulating, effect on the immune system. Viral infections can create worldwide disasters, as exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (2). A major clinical problem caused by infection with this respiratory virus is rapid deterioration in a subset of patients with pneumonia, requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), frequently with prolonged invasive ventilation and detrimental outcome (3), (4) . Other respiratory viruses, such as other coronaviruses (e.g. SARS and MERS) but also other viruses like the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) can cause similar clinical behavior in a subset of patients. Many other types of viruses, that do or do not specifically target the respiratory system, can also cause epidemics associated with high mortality and serious complications, e.g. influenza, ebola, measles, yellow fever, etc.",

            "text": "The mathematical approach to develop Bayesian network models for the interpretation of the transcription factor target gene mRNA levels has been described previously in detail (6) . A causal computational network model is built, enabling inference of the probability that the pathwayassociated transcription factor is in an active state, binding to and transcribing its target genes ( Figure S1 ). The Bayesian network describes (i) the causal relation that a target gene is up-or downregulated depending on the transcription factor being active or inactive and (ii) the causal relation that an AffymetrixU133Plus2.0 probeset signal is high or low, depending on the target gene being up-or down regulated. Model parameters for (i) have been based on literature evidence, and for (ii) are based on data from calibration samples with known signalling pathway activity, that is, either active or inactive. Target genes for the JAK-STAT1/2 and JAK-STAT3 pathway model were selected using available scientific literature (Supplementary Table S2, and Supplementary methods). Following model calibration and model parameter freeze, mRNA probeset measurements of a new sample can be entered into the model, and Bayesian inference is used to calculate probability P that the transcription factor, and therefore the signalling pathway, is active. Pathway activity score can be presented as log2odds value log2 (P / (1 -P)), which can optionally be normalized on a scale from 0-100 (6),(7), (8) . Quantitative log2odds pathway activity scores are used in the figures and results description. JAK-STAT1/2 and JAK-STAT3 Pathway models were biologically validated on independent public available (14) Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2.0 microarray data of samples with known pathway activity.",

Pathway activity was correctly measured in natural killer (NK) cells stimulated in vitro with IFN\u03b1-2b (IFN type I) ( Figure S2C The JAK-STAT3 pathway can be activated by several cytokines that bind to their respective receptors, resulting in activation of JAK1 and formation of a STAT3 homodimer which transcribes target genes (28) , (29) .

Many factors influence this capability, like genetic variations, age, comorbidities like diabetes, and immune modifying drugs like corticosteroids (48) , (49) , (50) .",

This suggests that activity of this signaling pathway is more associated with activity of the innate immune response, represented by the monocyte fraction in PBMC samples. Indeed, the JAK-STAT3 pathway is also involved in viral disease, and in addition to a role in generating a host immune response, its activity has been associated with severe inflammatory complications caused by a disbalance between adaptive and innate immune response, such as COVID-19 pneumonia (51), (52) , (53) , (54) .",

Yellow Fever (YF) vaccination induced a large increase in JAK-STAT1/2 pathway activity in PBMCs, both in T cells and monocytes, in all vaccinated individuals, within 3 days after vaccination. YF vaccine consists of an attenuated live virus, which infects dendritic cells, resulting in highly effective T cell activation, and excellent immunity (39) . In contrast, after vaccination with a Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV), no such increase in pathway activity was found, while during actual influenza virus infection JAK-STAT1/2 pathway activity did increase. This suggests that the vaccine had not induced adaptive cellular immunity, despite a satisfactory humoral antibody response in 22 out of 28 individuals (40) . In contrast to the live virus YF vaccine, TIV contains inactivated virus. The inactivated virus vaccine may have lost the capability of the wild type virus to induce complete maturation and activation of dendritic cells, necessary to optimally activate T cells. Influenza vaccination not always induces satisfactory immunity and addition of an adjuvant compound to TIV was reported to increase immunogenicity (58) , (59) , (60) . More recently, for this reason adjuvant-containing influenza vaccines have been introduced to increase influenza immunity in the aging population (61) .",

Both maturation and activation of DCs is required to enable processing and presentation of the viral antigen within the HLA complex for efficient T cell activation, requiring activation of the NF\u03baB and JAK-STAT1/2 signal transduction pathways(41),(42). In the here analyzed study, dendritic cells had been infected in vitro with two HIV viral vectors separately or in combination. Only the combined infection with the two vectors was reported to be competent in fully activating the DCs, but neither of them alone. Pathway analysis showed that only in case both virions were present pathway activity scores of NF\u03baB and JAK-JAK-STAT1/2 (A) and NF\u03baB (B) pathway activity analysis of dataset GSE22589 (n=2). Monocytederived dendritic cells (MDDCs) infected with an envelope-defective GFP-encoding VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 vector (HIVGFP(G)) and with VSV-G pseudotyped virus-like particles derived from SIVmac to deliver Vpx (SIVVLP(G)), alone or in combination. Cells were infected with one or combination of the vectors at day 4 of differentiation and were harvested 48 hours later. Pathway activity score on Y-axis in log2odds. cellular host immune response on whole blood samples of patients with a viral infectionIn clinical practice it is expected to be of value to have a rapid and cost-effective test to diagnose a viral infection and measure viral infection-or vaccine-induced host immune response. A whole blood sample is easiest and least expensive to analyze in a routine clinical setting, but contains a mixture of cell types. Analysis of a clinical study in which whole blood samples (collected in PAXgene tubes) were obtained from patients with acute influenza or rotavirus infection showed that the virus-induced increase in JAK-STAT1/2 pathway activity could also be detected in this sample type. Influenza virus infection induced stronger immunity and this was associated with higher JAK-STAT1/2 pathway activity compared to rotavirus-infected patients (",

Two of the here analyzed datasets contained PBMC samples from healthy individuals (GSE34205 and GSE13486). Mean JAK-STAT1/2 pathway activity scores were comparable in the two independent datasets, consisting respectively of male (mean pathway activity score -5.84 log2odds, standard deviation SD 2.74) and female (mean -5.35 log2odds, SD 3.13) children and of adult (mean -6.50 log2odds, SD 2.56) individuals (Supplementary",

To further complete our signal transduction pathway testing platform, we have now developed tests to quantitatively measure functional activity of the JAK-STAT1/2 and JAK-STAT3 signal transduction pathways in different immune cell types, based on the principle of measuring and interpreting target gene mRNA levels of the signaling pathway transcription factor (6),(7),(8). We provide evidence that measurement of activity of the JAK-STAT1/2 signaling pathway in whole blood, PBMCs, or T-cell subsets, from patients with an infectious disease allows distinction between viral and bacterial infection and is informative on the strength of the adaptive cellular immune response against a viral infection. In addition, activity of the JAK-STAT3 pathway may be informative on the inflammatory component of the innate immune response and predictive of a more severe course of a viral infection, for example leading to a cytokine storm syndrome. Additional use of measuring JAK-STAT pathway activity in patient blood samples is expected to lie in prediction of response to specific immunomodulatory treatments, and monitoring effects of such treatments. Simultaneous measurement of activity of other signaling pathways, such as the NF\u03baB, MAPK, PI3K, TGF\u03b2 and Notch pathways is possible on the same sample, and especially when performed on specific immune cell types, may allow more detailed information on the functionality of the immune response (63),(64),(65),(66) (unpublished results, manuscript in preparation). In addition signaling pathway analysis is expected to be useful to quantify immunogenicity and effectiveness of vaccines, especially with respect to the capacity to generate a T cell mediated adaptive immune response.",
