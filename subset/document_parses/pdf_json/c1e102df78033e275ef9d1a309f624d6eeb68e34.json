Recent studies showed that CMR has a broad spectrum of anticancer activities and induces paraptosis in breast cancer and prostate cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of CMR against human non-small cell lung cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. We found that CMR dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human lung cancer H460, A549 and PC-9 cells. Furthermore, exposure to low and median doses of CMR induced paraptosis but not apoptosis, which was presented as the formation of extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation with increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, Bip and Chop, as well as activation of MAPK pathway in the lung cancer cells. Knockdown of Bip with siRNA not only reduced the cell-killing effect of CMR, but also decreased the percentage of cytoplasmic vacuoles in H460 cells. Moreover, CMR also increased the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to radiotherapy through enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress. In lung cancer H460 cell xenograft nude mice, combined treatment of CMR and radiation caused greatly enhanced tumor growth inhibition with upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins and activation of pErk in xenograft tumor tissue. These data demonstrate that the anticancer activity and radiosensitization effect of CMR result from inducing paraptosis, suggesting that CMR could be considered as a potential anticancer agent and radiation sensitizer in the future cancer therapeutics. ;,:",

Apoptosis is induced by surface death receptors, through mitochondrial release of cytochrome c or by cellular stress induced by drug/radiation exposure. The most common signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis include cell death receptor signaling, the caspase signaling cascade and mitochondrial signaling [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . By acting in parallel or sequentially, autophagy can facilitate and cooperate with apoptosis to drive cell death. Blockage of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or knockdown of Beclin1 and Atg7 expression significantly inhibits apoptosis in cells. When a cell is unable to undergo apoptosis, it may undergo necrotic cell death, which does not involve caspase activation [10, 11] .",

The cells were pretreated with 0, 2, 4 or 6 \u03bcM CMR and then irradiated with different doses of IR. We found that pretreatment with CMR enhanced the sensitivity of cells to radiotherapy, and the SER values reached 1.35 for H460 cells and 1.28 for A549 cells at a CMR dose of 6 \u03bcM, 1.14 for H460 cells and 1.19 for A549 cells at a dose of 4 \u03bcM, and 1.12 for H460 cells and 1.10 for A549 cells at a CMR dose of 2 \u03bcM (Fig. 4a) . We also determined the CI for CMR combined with IR in H460 and A549 cells by treating the cells with constant ratios of corresponding LD 50 of CMR and IR. Our results showed that combination treatment with IR and CMR led to an overall CI value of <1.0, indicating a synergistic radiosensitization effect of CMR on H460 cells (Fig. 4b) . Apoptosis analysis further showed that, while the percentage of apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner in cells in response to IR treatment, pretreatment with CMR had no effect on the apoptotic response to IR in H460 or A549 cells (P > 0.05, Fig. 4c ). However, we detected dramatically increased cell populations with vacuole formation in irradiated H460 cells (from 23.5% to 42.2%) and A549 cells (from 18.1% to 33.8%) when cells were pretreated with CMR. Notably, no such change was observed in irradiated control cells that were not cotreated with CMR (Fig. 4d) . Consistent with the above observations, Western blot analysis showed that the expression of Bip and Chop proteins increased only in the cells treated with the combination of CMR and IR. In addition, we also noticed that when cells were pretreated with 6 \u03bcM CMR, the protein levels of IRE1 and ATF6 and the phosphorylation level of PERK (p-PERK) increased in H460 cells in response to IR exposure.

Radiotherapy also contributes to 40% of the curative treatments for cancer patients. For NSCLC patients, concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy is the standard care for local advanced patients; however, the clinical outcomes remain unsatisfactory, with a median progression-free survival of 5-6 months. Recently, a multicenter, open-labeled, randomized phase II trial showed that targeted therapy with an EGFR inhibitor combined with radiation provides a statistically significant PFS improvement (23.4 vs. 9.0 months) compared to that of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in unresectable stage III NSCLC with an activating EGFR mutation, indicating that lung cancer patients with an EGFR mutation can benefit from this new therapeutic strategy [22] , although nearly 60% of NSCLC patients cannot benefit from this treatment because patients have tumors that do not harbor an EGFR mutation. However, the success of the combination of IR with EGFR-targeting chemotherapy suggests the clinical potential of developing a novel radiotherapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients.",

The mechanisms by which the natural components synergize with IR to facilitate cancer cell killing are usually by enhancing apoptosis, affecting the cell cycle, and/or attenuating angiogenesis [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . In this study, we demonstrated that CMR, a type of Diels-Alder adduct from Mulberry leaves, enhances the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells by inducing paraptosis. Previous studies have shown the anticancer activity of CMR in various human cancer cell lines, but little is known about its effects on lung cancer. Our current data showed that CMR significantly induced cell killing. Of interest, we found that CMR treatment induced ER dilation and cytoplasmic vacuolation in NSCLC H460 cells. Immunofluorescence analysis and TEM imaging further showed that in CMR-treated cells, the ER underwent swelling and fusion. In addition, CMR treatment enhanced the expression of ER stress markers, including the transcription factors Bip and Chop. This evidence indicates that CMR kills cancer cells through paraptosis. However, we noticed that CMR treatment did not cause activation of caspase-3 and PARP, which indicates that apoptosis is not a cause of CMRinduced cell death in these cancer cells. In the combination treatment experiment, we also demonstrated that the synergistic effect of CMR on IR-induced cell killing in NSCLC cells involved paraptosis but not apoptosis. Thus, CMR treatment triggers paraptosis in NSCLC cells, which results in significant cancer cell death and a synergistic cell-killing effect of cells in response to IR. Of note, however, we noticed that the expression of all three ER transmembrane sensors, IRE1, PERK and ATF6, was enhanced in CMR-treated H460 cells, while only IRE1 protein expression was increased in A549 cells, indicating the potential of different ER sensors to be induced by ER stress in distinct lung cancer cells [30] .",

Most importantly, we found that paraptosis in CMR-treated cancer cells or in cancer cells treated with the combination of CMR and IR was inhibited when the cells were exposed to the specific phospho-Erk inhibitor U0126, indicating the role of MAPK activation in CMR-induced cell killing and paraptosis in NSCLC cells. 5 MAPK activation mediates CMR-induced paraptosis. a Total cell lysates were collected from H460 cells after the indicated treatments and analyzed for phosphorylation and total Erk, JNK and p38 proteins.
