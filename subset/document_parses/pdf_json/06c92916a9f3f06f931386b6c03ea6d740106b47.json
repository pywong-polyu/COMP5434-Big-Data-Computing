In concert with on-site hospitalists and redeployed physicians, virtual hospitalists aimed to expand capacity while maintaining high-quality care and communication. The program addressed multiple challenges created by our first COVID-19 surge: high patient census and acuity; limitations of and due to personal protective equipment; increased communication needs due to visitor restrictions and the uncertain nature of the novel disease, and limitations to in-person work for some physicians. The program created a mechanism to train and support new hospitalists and provide and expand palliative care services. We describe how our virtual hospitalist program operated during our COVID-19 surge in April and May 2020 and reflect on potential roles of virtual hospitalists after the COVID-19 crisis passes.",

This unprecedented escalation in demand for high-acuity clinical care was complicated by patient isolation, fear of contagion, scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the rapidity and unpredictability of patient deterioration. Several hospitalists were eager to help with patient care but limited by personal health status including pregnancy, comorbidities, quarantine due to COVID exposure, or recovery from illness.",

In one, remote clinicians replace in-person clinicians to care for inpatients at underresourced Critical Access Hospitals. 2 While efficient in use of personnel where local resources are scarce, this model raises concerns about a perceived compromise in the quality of care. A second model of collaborative care has precedent in the ICU setting (\"tele-ICU\"), where virtual intensivists work together with in-person non-intensivist providers. This has been shown to improve ICU mortality and reduce length of stay. 3 However, given the need for more providers, this model comes at a financial cost, unless it allows for the care of significantly more patients. As our COVID numbers increased and telemedicine was increasingly utilized for outpatients, 4 we queried whether hospitalists working virtually could help address the challenges we faced.",

All were experienced hospitalists with at least two years as attendings, but all hospitalists and our section were new to telemedicine.

The virtual and on-site hospitalist schedules were created in parallel to maximize efficiency.

First, when paired with redeployed physicians temporarily working in hospital medicine, virtual hospitalists provided clinical expertise in general medicine including diagnostic reasoning, treatment planning, advice around escalation of care, and assistance with discharge planning. Second, virtual hospitalists working with on-site experienced hospitalists shared or divided tasks such as writing notes, submitting bills, communicating with families and consultants, reviewing the literature, and monitoring patients' clinical course. This allowed on-site hospitalists to manage larger numbers of high-acuity patients, focus their attention on patient assessment and clinical reasoning, and spend less time on documentation. The virtual hospitalists were responsible for staying up-to-date with rapidly changing hospital protocols and national guidelines for care of patients with COVID-19 and could reference the most updated guidelines in real-time as their colleagues were at the bedside rounding. Many admitted patients improved and were discharged home. Because of uncertainty about the clinical course of COVID-19, virtual hospitalists assumed responsibility for post-discharge follow-up. In a newly created program, a team of nurses and APPs called patients by phone at several intervals after discharge and escalated concerns to virtual hospitalists. The hospitalists assessed the patients remotely and addressed needs, such as sending new prescriptions or referring back to the emergency department.",

Our expert palliative care teams were met with enormous demand for their services, especially in the ICUs. With needs exceeding available specialists, hospitalists needed to provide primary palliative care. Virtual hospitalists developed and taught COVIDTalk, an advanced communication skills training program adapted from VitalTalk, a national organization that trains clinicians in skills to facilitate goal-concordant end-of-life care. 7 Virtual hospitalists were among over 100 providers trained in COVIDTalk during the surge. While an on-site hospitalist examined a newly admitted patient lacking the capacity to determine code status, their virtual counterpart used skills from COVIDTalk to simultaneously discuss goals of care with family members by phone. As clinical acuity escalated, virtual hospitalists could build on the relationship established with the patients' family on admission to make additional decisions together.",

Virtual hospitalists addressed these deficits in human contact with phone and video visits with patients without the hindrance of PPE, fear of contagion, or need for haste. Our hospitalists found that patients' families, unable to visit their loved ones in the hospital, craved more communication with our teams than before the pandemic. They had many questions about our rapidly evolving understanding of prognosis, clinical trajectory, treatment options, and needs for quarantine and contact tracing. Virtual hospitalists dedicated a significant amount of time ensuring thorough communication with families, logging a daily median of 105 minutes on the phone with families, with some days up to 540 minutes. On-site hospitalists were stretched thin while caring for critically ill patients on medical floors; virtual hospitalists had more time to spend on the phone with families and could provide synchronized updates while on-site hospitalists performed bedside assessments. On-site hospitalists reported that working with virtual hospitalists allowed them to perform critical care without sacrificing communication and felt that their patients and families received more attention and support than what they could have provided alone.

Therefore, it is difficult to quantify the financial costs of this program. Future research is needed to measure whether quality of care, patient experience, or clinical outcomes would have been different without the virtual hospitalists' support.",

We are in the process of launching an interinstitutional network to ensure that access to resources, including guides for innovative care models to manage similar crises, is readily accessible to hospitals and frontline providers worldwide. With more time for advance planning and study design, we plan to assess future iterations of virtual hospitalist programs with a rigorous analysis of costs and measurement of outcomes to assess value to the system.",
