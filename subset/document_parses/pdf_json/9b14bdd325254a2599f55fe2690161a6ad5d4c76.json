Recent evidence has shown that the control of multiple immune functions, including chronic inflammation, pathogen responses, lymphocyte activation, and regulatory signaling, is altered by K63 ubiquitination. In this review, we detail the novel cellular sensors that are dependent on K63 ubiquitination for their function in the immune signaling network. Many pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can target K63 ubiquitination to inhibit pathogen immune responses; we describe novel details of the pathways involved and summarize recent clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2-specific responses. We also discuss recent evidence that regulatory T cell (Treg) versus T helper (T H ) 1 and T H 17 cell subset regulation might involve K63 ubiquitination. Knowledge gaps that merit future investigation and clinically relevant pathways are also addressed.",

In this review, we focus on the emerging understanding of the role of K63-linked ubiquitination in an array of immune response mechanisms. We also highlight the important regulatory role of K63 ubiquitination in striking a balance between immune activating versus immune tolerance mechanisms. We review prominent examples of key signaling adaptors, including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs), TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), NLRs, RLRs, and stimulator of interferon genes [STING, also referred to as Mediator of IRF-3 activation (MITA) or endoplasmic reticulum IFN stimulator (ERIS)], that serve as docking platforms for K63-linked ubiquitin chain assembly during immune cell activation and tolerance mechanisms (Figure 1, Key figure) . The complementary role of deubiquitinating enzymes is also briefly mentioned, as well as the emerging putative role of K63-linked ubiquitination in SARS-CoV-2 immune dysregulation. In addition, we summarize emerging breakthrough discoveries on SARS-CoV-2-induced specific immune responses that might be associated with K63 ubiquitination. Highlights K63 ubiquitination can drive NF-\u03baBand MAPK-mediated immune cell activation in a cIAP1/2-and TRAF2/3/6dependent manner.",

            "text": "Ubiquitination involves covalent binding of ubiquitin to target substrate proteins in an ATPdependent manner, a mechanism that involves isopeptide linkage between the C terminus of ubiquitin and the epsilon amino group of an internal lysine residue of the target substrate [3, 4] . Ubiquitin chain formation can involve any of the possible seven lysine (LYS, K) residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) or the N-terminal methionine (Met1) on ubiquitin, depending on various factors, including the type of E2, E3 ligases, and the target substrates, which ultimately dictate the functional specificity of any particular ubiquitination event [5] (Boxes 1-3). The K48-mediated ubiquitin linkages target proteins for proteasomal degradation and are typically referred to as canonical. The K63-linked ubiquitin chains do not target to the proteasome, but instead have important roles in eukaryotes, including DNA damage repair, cell signaling, and autophagy [1, [5] [6] [7] . Ubc13 is an unusual E2 that, in complex with its non-enzymatic cofactors (either Mms2 or Uev1a), catalyzes K63-specific linkages [8, 9] . Ubc13-Mms2 is essential for cellular mechanisms involving DNA damage repair, whereas the Ubc13-Uev1a complex regulates cell signaling pathways that drive immune, inflammatory, and cell proliferation/survival responses [8, 9, 10, 11] . K63-linked ubiquitin chains can be formed anchored to the target protein or can exist as free or unanchored chains and serve as docking sites for signaling molecules that drive immune pathways, such as TLRs, IL1R, and RLRs [12] [13] [14] [15] . Heterogeneous K63 ubiquitin chains or K48/ K63 branched ubiquitin chains can preferentially target the substrates for proteasome degradation [16] . K63 ubiquitin-conjugated E3 ligases and their target substrates undergo deubiquitination in the presence of deubiquitinases (DUBs) and have an important role in modulating K63dependent cell signaling [17, 18] (Box 4). Research on Ubc13-catalyzed K63 ubiquitination has rapidly advanced over the years and the functional implications of this non-proteolytic posttranslational mechanism that are of relevance to innate and adaptive immunity are summarized herein. While the focus is largely on K63-linked ubiquitination and the role of Ubc13 in immune cell signaling, it is noteworthy that other important modulators of immune responses, including other unusual E2s, UbcH5, UbcH7, other E3 ligases, and LUBAC, are not addressed and are detailed elsewhere [2, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

In culture, splenocytes of Ubc13 +/mice, upon stimulation with LPS, exhibited reduced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 MAPK expression, which were associated with diminished TRAF6 polyubiquitination relative to WT controls [24] . In addition, Ubc13 +/mice exhibited reduced Ubc13 protein in most tissues, along with significantly impaired inflammatory signaling in response to TNF and LPS stimulation in vivo [24] . This decreased signaling was associated with reduced in vivo TRAF6 ubiquitination and reduced in vivo activation of NF-\u03baB and stress kinases (p38 MAPK and JNK), demonstrating a key role for Ubc13 in inflammatory responses [24] . However, in other independent studies, tissue-specific gene-knockout studies reported in B cells, T cells, and macrophages derived from Ubc13-deficient mice (Lck_Cre Ube2n fl/fl mice generated on a mixed C57BL/6 and 129P2/OlaHsd background) showed different results [25, 26] . While homozygous Ubc13 -/-B cells and macrophages demonstrated essential roles for Ubc13 in BCR-, TLR/IL-1R-, or CD40-mediated activation of MAPKs, Ubc13 had a minor role in BCR-, TLR-, IL-1R-, or CD40-mediated NF-\u03baB activation and IL-1\u03b2-mediated TAK1 phosphorylation in these same cells [25] . Nevertheless, conditional deletion of Ubc13 in T cells (Lck_Cre Ube2n fl/fl thymocytes) showed reduced NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO, also known as IKK-\u03b3) ubiquitination, I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation/phosphorylation, and NF-\u03baB activation upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/Ionophore and anti-CD3/CD28 antibody stimulation relative to WT [26] . The authors attributed this discrepancy to Ubc13 deletion efficiency in each conditional model and/or to a cell type-specific role of Ubc13 in the activation of NF-\u03baB [26] .

Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs): include aged, dead, and damaged self-structures released from host cells in response to necrosis or apoptosis and are endogenous alarmins that trigger an immune response. Inflammasome: multiprotein oligomeric complex assembled by some NLRs upon sensing intracellular PAMPs/ DAMPs; serves as a signaling platform for the recruitment of caspase-1, which activates IL-1\u03b2 from its precursor form (pro-IL-1\u03b2) to induce innate immunity. Linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC): comprises the catalytically active HOIP and accessory proteins HOIP-L and SHANKassociated RH domain interacting protein SHARPIN; functions as an E3 ligase that forms linear ubiquitin chains from Met1 of ubiquitin. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs): present on the host cell surface, in the endosome, or in the cytoplasm; recognize a variety of conserved structural motifs present on PAMPs and DAMPs, activating immune signaling pathways that target pathogens/alarmins for their eventual clearance by the host immune system. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): conserved molecular structures present on microbes or pathogens; specific to the pathogen of interest, are carbohydrates, lipoproteins, or nucleic acids (bacterial or viral DNA and RNA) sensed by host cells to trigger an immune response. NLRP3: also known as cryopyrin; a cytosolic PRR that forms the inflammasome upon sensing PAMPs/ DAMPs to trigger an induced innate immune response. Nod-like receptors (NLRs): a family of cytoplasmic PRR sensors that detect cytosolic PAMPs or DAMPs via LRR domains and assemble to form inflammasomes, which trigger innate immunity in response to infection or endogenous alarmin signals. Regulatory T cell (Treg): subpopulation of CD4 + helper T cells suggested gene dose-dependency effects and a cell type-specific role for Ubc13 [24] [25] [26] .

Some cIAPs are implicated in the suppression of apoptosis by virtue of their ability to bind active caspase-family proteases [28, 29] . The IAP family of proteins, including cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, have E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity [30] [31] [32] . TRAF2 and TRAF6 form a complex with cIAP1/2 to conjugate K63-linked ubiquitin chains catalyzed by Ubc13, followed by NF-\u03baB or MAPK activation in human immune cell activation via antigen and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [33, 34] (Figure 2 , Box 2). While IAPs activate the classical NF-\u03baB pathway, relying on K63 ubiquitination, these E3 ligases repress the non-canonical NF-\u03baB cascade by promoting K48mediated degradation of NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK); both pathways proceed in a TRAFdependent manner. The immunomodulatory role of TRAFs is reviewed elsewhere [35] (Figure 2 ).",

MALT1 K63 ubiquitination, in response to PMA/Ionomycin-and/or anti-CD3/CD28 antibodyinduced human Jurkat and murine CD4 + T cell activation, was associated with I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB activation compared with uninduced cells [41] . TRAF2-binding (WT) cIAP2/MALT1 versus TRAF2-nonbinding (mutant) cIAP2/MALT1 in Jurkat T cells showed elevated NF-\u03baB induction for WT, but not mutant complexes [32] . Ubc13-Uev1a-(and UbcH5c-)catalyzed TRAF6-mediated K63 ubiquitination of MALT1 was confirmed using a cell-free system [41, 42] . MALT1-deficient T cells isolated from Malt1 -/mice showed impaired I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB activation upon PMA/Ionomycin stimulation compared with WT controls [41] . These observations implied that ubiquitinated MALT1 of the CBM complex could serve as a docking platform for subsequent ubiquitination, followed by activation of the IKK complex of the classical NF-\u03baB cascade upon PKC-theta-dependent TCR engagement ( Figure 2 ).",

Traf6 fl/fl Foxp3Cre + mice with FOXP3 + Treg-restricted deletion of TRAF6 (Traf6 -/-) either failed to support the growth of implanted B16 melanoma cells or delayed the implantation of MC38 colon cancer cells compared with WT mice [46] .

            "text": "There are several other modulators of K63 ubiquitination ( Figure 3 ). For instance, SHARPINdeficient Cpdm -/mice show a significant reduction in the generation of Tregs, as evidenced by the inefficient induction of Foxp3 in Cpdm -/-CD4 + T cells upon anti-CD3 antibody stimulation, compared with Cpdm +/mice [48] . The autoimmune and inflammatory phenotype of Cpdm -/mice was overcome by replenishing Cpdm -/neonatal mice with SHARPIN-sufficient Tregs from Foxp3 YFPCre Cpdm +/+ via adoptive transfer. This was shown by a reduction in the lung inflammatory effector T cell subsets (T H 2 and T H 17-like) and their cytokines (including IL-3, IL-5, and IL-17), compared with Cpdm -/mice that received no Treg cells [48] . Human Jurkat T cells that stably expressed SHARPIN and endogenous SHARPIN in mouse WT CD4 + T cells assembled K63-ubiquitin chains, attenuated TCR signaling, and showed an increase in FOXP3 expression relative to controls [48] . However, CD4 + T cells from Cpdm -/mice that lacked K63ubiquitinated SHARPIN showed greater association of TCR\u03b6 with the signaling kinase Zap70 Box 4. Deubiquitinases that reverse K63-linked ubiquitination K63 ubiquitin-conjugated E3 ligases and their target substrates are also subjected to deubiquitination in the presence of DUBs [17, 18] . The zinc-finger (ZnF) protein A20 and cylindramotosis (CYLD) protein are DUBs that catalyze the hydrolysis of K63-linked ubiquitin chains conjugated to target E3 ligases or substrates [115] . CYLD -/-T cells are hypersensitive to TCR/CD3 and TCR/CD28 activation of T cells. A20 negatively regulates NF-\u03baB signaling by inhibiting E3 ligase or substrate activity (TRAF2, TRAF6, cIAP1, RIPK1, and MALT1) [116, 117] (see Figure 2 in the main text). A20 inhibits the interaction between E2s Ubc13 or UbH5c and, by doing so, A20 along with Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) targets Ubc13 or UbcH5 for K48-ubiquitin chain-conjugated proteasomal degradation [118] . A20 functions to deubiquitinate K63-ubiquitin linkages conjugated to MALT1 of CBM-Ubc13-TRAF6 complex and impairs TCR-induced NF-\u03baB signaling; A20 also undergoes proteasomal degradation to restore TCR/CD28-induced IKK activation [119] . OTUD7B is a DUB that deubiquitinates K63assembled ubiquitin chains from G\u03b2L, a substrate for TRAF2 E3 ligase [120] . Ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (USP5) specifically targets the free C-terminal diglycine motif of the unanchored polyubiquitin chain and deubiquitinates ubiquitin monomers from its proximal end [121] . It would be interesting to investigate whether USP5 targets the unanchored K63-linked ubiquitin chains catalyzed by Ubc13, for example in the context of RLR signaling and antiviral immunity [12] [13] [14] [15] 121] .",

            "text": "Given the importance of K63-linked ubiquitination in mediating several innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways, it is not surprising that pathogens have evolved mechanisms to counteract this post-translational modification. For example, some bacterial virulence factors have DUB-like activity, such as SseL (from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium), YopJ (from Yersinia pestis), and ChlaDUB1 (from Chlamydia trachomatis). These bacterial proteins modulate host immune responses [122] [123] [124] . Macrophages infected with SseL-deficient Salmonella show increases in I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and ubiquitination followed by transcriptional activation of NF-\u03baB-dependent gene expression [122] . Although not a member of the DUB family of cysteine proteases, SARS-CoV-1 encodes a Papain-like protease protein (PLpro; derived from the larger nsp3) that inhibits STING by deubiquitination of K63 linkages [81] . USP49, a ubiquitin-specific protease, interacts with and deubiquitinates STING after HSV-1 infection. USP49 decreases antiviral responses, and knockdown or knockouts of USP49 potentiate not only HSV-1, but also cytoplasmic DNA and cGAMP-induced Type 1 IFN production [125] . The SARS-CoV-2 PLPro protein inhibits TLR-7 signaling by deubiquitinating K63 linkages from TRAF3 and TRAF6 in human promonocyte cells that were stably transfected [126] . These findings further demonstrate that K63 ubiquitination is important for Type 1 IFN production and antiviral responses due to both STING and cGAMP, helping to explain why pathogens may target STING for deubiquitination. In summary, DUBs function as a counter-regulatory mechanism to either shut down or promote signaling.",

NLRX1 also binds to mitochondrial adaptor MAVS and prevents its interaction with RIG-I, thus inhibiting not only NF-\u03baB, but also IRF3 pathway-induced antiviral immune responses [112] . NLRP12 abrogates K63 ubiquitination of RIG-I, prevents RIG-I from activating MAVS, and inhibits RIG-I-induced antiviral immune responses [113, 114] . NLRP12 reduces K63 ubiquitination of RIG-I, while enhancing K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, as demonstrated both in an overexpressing system using HEK293 cells and endogenously in dendritic cells (derived from WT and Nlrp12 -/mice).",

NLRP12 can also suppress inflammation [70] . For example, Nod-like receptor card domain 3 (NLRC3) blocks both STING activation and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) activation. NLRC5 and NLRX1 inhibit IKK activation, enhancement of nuclear factor KappaB (NF-\u03baB) and inflammation signaling by TLRs. NLRP12 negatively regulates noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway. NLRC5, NLRX1, and NLRP12 negatively regulate RIG-induced antiviral immune responses. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB, RIG-I, and MDA-5 signaling (by ssRNA) is blocked when NLRC5 is K63-ubiquitinated.",

STING has a central role in stimulating innate immunity, Type 1 and 3 IFN production, and also inflammation via nuclear factor KappaB (NF-\u03baB). IFN production by STING is dependent on K63 ubiquitination (red ovals). STING acts as a linker for activation of downstream IFN activating genes (IFN regulatory factor 3; IRF3,) by retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-I), mitochondrial antiviralsignaling protein (MAVS), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) through TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which senses RNA viruses. Additionally, TLR7/8 and TLR3 signal IFN production by single-strand (ss)RNA and double-strand (ds)RNA and these signal through K63-ubiquitinated TNF receptor-associated factor 3/6 (TRAF3/6; not shown here).

Decreased Type 1 IFN (specifically low IFN-\u03b1 and no IFN-\u03b2) has been strongly associated with more serious coronavirus 2019 (COVID- 19) symptoms and death, while the amount of NF-\u03baB-associated cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6) are elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 [91] . In human lung epithelial cells and in an animal model of COVID (K18-ACE2-transgenic mice), a STING agonist (diABZI-4) strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication for both the alpha and delta variants (B.1.135.1) [92] . The Trends in Immunology study also showed that SARS-CoV-2 could induce a delayed immune response that could be overcome with exogenous IFN administration [92] . Two other research groups also reported that this same STING agonist (diABZI-4) can significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung epithelial cells [93, 94] .",

            "text": "Since K63 ubiquitination is pivotal in STING signaling (as described in the preceding text), several studies have examined the potential inhibitory role of SARS-CoV-2 open-reading frame proteins in K63 ubiquitination and in diminishing Type 1 IFN secretion. There are four SARS-CoV-2 proteins that have been shown to alter K63 ubiquitination, affect IFN signaling and may lead to decreased Type 1 and 3 interferon secretion ( Figure 4) : 3CL, ORF9b, NSP8 , PLpro. 3CL is an important protease in SARS-CoV-2, which directly inhibits STING K63 ubiquitination and causes a decrease in downstream signaling in human, mouse, and chicken lung epithelial cells [95] . The ORF9b SARS-CoV-2 protein antagonizes Type 1 IFN production after activation of RIG-I-MAVS by blocking K63 ubiquitination of NEMO in human primary epithelial cells [96] . The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein also inhibits Type 1 IFN secretion by inhibition of RIG-I, probably due to inhibition of RIG-I K63 ubiquitination by TRIM25 E3 ligase [as has been shown for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)] in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) [97, 98] . NSP8 from SARS-CoV-2 suppresses MDA-5-stimulated IFN signaling by binding to MDA-5 CARD and blocking K63-linked ubiquitination in human embryonic kidney cells [99] . In summary, SARS-CoV-2 inhibition of Type 1 and 3 IFNs appears to be important for evading the innate immune response. Multiple mechanisms of inhibition of interferon signaling by SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been elucidated and alterations in K63 ubiquitination are prominent in this evasion of the host response ( Figure 4 ).",

Ubc13-catalyzed K63 ubiquitination has a key role in striking a balance between immune cell activation and immune tolerance mechanisms, as evidenced from murine studies. Recent findings demonstrated that the control of multiple immune functions, such as chronic inflammation, pathogen responses, lymphocyte activation, regulatory signaling pathways, and lymphocyte subset development, can be altered by K63 ubiquitination. While we have discussed some details of K63 ubiquitination-dependent regulation of immune signaling and described some of the novel cellular sensors that are dependent on K63 ubiquitination during immune signaling, numerous questions remain (see Outstanding questions). For instance, mechanistic details of SARS-CoV-2 infection and K63 ubiquitination in immune responses remain far from being understood and require robust experimentation. Therefore, although advances have been made regarding K63 ubiquitination in the immune system, the field eagerly awaits much-needed further research in this important area, particularly when considering the relevance to coronavirus infections, such as from SARS-CoV-2.",

FOXP3-dependent K63 ubiquitination of target substrates regulates immune tolerance mechanisms that counteract the inflammatory phenotype (right). While some NLRs negatively regulate K63-linked ubiquitination to blunt inflammatory responses, the role of NLRs in regulatory T cell (Treg)-versus T H 1/T H 17-induced T cell responses is unknown. The mechanistic role of Ubc13 on the modulators of K63 ubiquitination [including SHARPIN or Casitas B lineage lymphoma b (CBL-B)], deficiency of which blunts immune tolerance mechanisms and causes a shift from Treg-induced immunosuppression to T H 1/T H 17-induced immune activation, needs further investigation.

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (red ovals) and linear polyubiquitin chains (green ovals) catalyzed by Ubc13-Uev1a and UbcH5/linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) are necessary for efficient activation of immune and antiviral cell signaling pathways. (1) The tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-induced non-canonical mechanism involves K48-ubiquitin chain-mediated degradation of TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) by cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1/2 (cIAP1/2), release of TRAF2/TRAF6 for K63 ubiquitination, and activation of non-canonical nuclear factor KappaB (NF-\u03baB)/ MAPK. (2,3) TNFR1-induced K63-ubiquitination of RIPK1 drives two opposing TNFR1 canonical signaling pathways: canonical NF-\u03baB activation modulated by TRAF2-cIAP1-UbcH5-LUBAC-Ubc13-RIPK1 (shown as Complex-I) and classical apoptosis mediated by RIPK1, Caspase-8 and FADD (shown as Complex-II), which is regulated by RIPK1 kinase activity or necroptosis mediated by RIPK1-RIPK3 activity. (4) Stimulation of Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR4) triggers MyD88-dependent TRAF6-cIAP1/2-Ubc13-catalyzed K63 ubiquitination of downstream substrates followed by NF-\u03baB/MAPK activation. (5) T/B cell receptor (TCR/BCR) activation recruits the caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein1-B cell lymphoma 10-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein 1 (paracaspase) [CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM)] complex and activates E2-E3 ligase-mediated K63 ubiquitination-dependent downstream pathways. (6) Stimulation of Nod-like receptors (NLRs) recruits the adaptor proteins to trigger K63 ubiquitination of E3 ligases and their target substrates (including RIPK2) for activation of downstream pathways. The deubiquitinase A20 and some NLR family proteins [e.g., Nod-like receptor Card domain 3 (NLRC3) and NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 12 (NLRP12)] negatively regulate K63 ubiquitination-mediated immune cell activation.",

The black arrows indicate stimulation of a pathway and the red arrows denote either inhibition or functional implications due to inhibition. The small red ovals attached to proteins are K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Membrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytokine receptors [including canonical tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors] activate ubiquitinated TNF receptor-associated factor 2/6 (TRAF2/6) pathways to stimulate cytokine and interferon (IFN) production. Single-strand (ss)RNA, double-strand (ds)RNA and mitochondrial (mt)DNA activate cytosolic receptors that are also controlled by ubiquitination. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an intermediate for activation of downstream IFN-activating genes, IFN regulatory factor 3/7 (IRF3/ 7) by retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) through TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1), cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) sensing dsRNA. K63 ubiquitination of SHANK-associated RH domain interacting protein in postsynaptic density (SHARPIN) and Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma-b (CBL-B) promotes regulatory T cell (Treg) lineage commitment and deficiency in K63-ubiquitinated SHARPIN or CBL-B stimulates helper T cell (T H ) 1 and T H 17 inflammatory responses.
