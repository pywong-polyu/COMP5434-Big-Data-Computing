The main goals and organizational principles of the ACS model were initially outlined in the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Ad Hoc Committee letter in 2005, which advocated for the creation of a new specialty that would provide comprehensive care to acutely ill surgical and trauma patients. 1 Trauma and EGS patients treated at specialized trauma and newly established ACS centers have achieved superior clinical outcomes compared to patients treated in nonspecialized centers. [2] [3] [4] [5] The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health care systems and hospitals with an increased demand for both human and material resources and has presented a unique opportunity to test the performance of the ACS model during this nonsurgical catastrophic event. 6 During the COVID-19 surge in Boston from March to May 2020, the ACS service at an urban, tertiary, level I academic trauma center was assigned to continue coverage of all trauma, EGS, and SCC patients, with the added responsibility of taking care of critically ill nonsurgical patients including COVID-19 positive patients.",

The anesthesiology attending who was a part of the regular SICU coverage in the pre-COVID period was reassigned to a newly organized COVID ICU. A chief surgical resident who had completed fellowship in and was board-eligible in critical care medicine was added to the team. This chief resident was always on call with 1 of the senior acute care surgeons, who was covering the ACS/non-COVID ICU and acted as a supervisor. Given the increasing number of critically ill COVID-19 patients with high acuity and clinical demands, the SICU attending coverage was changed from partial in-house presence to 24/7 in-house coverage for the COVID-19 SICU. The trauma surgeon assigned to the ACS service provided coverage of trauma and EGS cases, as well as the newly formed \"clean\" ACS/non-COVID ICU. The call schedule was then modified so that both teams, the COVID-19 SICU and the ACS /non-COVID ICU team, stayed inhouse and worked in 12-hour shifts.",

Although the volume of EGS and trauma patients decreased during the COVID-19 surge, the ACS providers successfully adapted to managing the influx of critically ill nonsurgical COVID-19 patients while still maintaining the surgical productivity of the ACS service. Clinical outcomes of the critically ill patients treated by ACS service during COVID-19 surge did not significantly differ from other nonsurgeon-managed ICUs at our institution.",

            "text": "The ACS model was initially introduced to address a nationwide shortage in the coverage of acutely ill surgical patients. The main goal of this model was to provide improved continuity of care to trauma, EGS, and critically ill surgical patients. Acute care surgeons are required to have a wide spectrum of clinical skills, allowing them to provide a high quality of both surgical and intensive medicine care to a diverse population of patients. 1 By its nature, the ACS model is predominantly designed to be utilized in emergent surgical settings that carry a great deal of clinical unpredictability and complexity. It is also designed to be performed as a shift-type work schedule that requires high-quality handoff between providers and an ability to adjust to a fast-changing clinical situation. 2 During the COVID-19 surge, which occurred at our institution from April to May 2020, we saw a significant increase in the number of critically ill nonsurgical patients admitted. A shortage of nonsurgical ICU beds and medical intensive care staff led to the utilization of the surgical ICU in the management of critically ill nonsurgical patients. With some adjustments in the ACS call schedule, we managed to accommodate the influx of critically ill nonsurgical patients while maintaining surgical coverage for trauma and EGS patients. As opposed to many other centers, our 4 trauma surgeons remained dedicated to all 3 tenants of ACS: EGS, trauma surgery, and critical care rather than being allocated to only caring for 1 of those clinical areas. 2 In addition, given the overwhelmingly higher number of COVID-19 patients and a need to relocate both human and material resources, we temporarily changed trauma activations criteria allowing ED physicians to have a greater role managing lower acuity trauma cases without routine trauma team activation.",

            "text": "During the COVID-19 surge, we observed the previously described phenomenon where a decrease in surgical volume is compensated by an increase in the number of ICU patients. 6, 8 Uniquely approaching the recent COVID-19 surge as a nonsurgical \"mass casualty event\" helped us to reallocate resources to clinical \"hot spots\" while continuing to provide adequate coverage across all patient populations managed by the ACS service. The surge period was characterized by a higher overall proportion of critically ill patients admitted to our institution. The majority of patients admitted to the surgical ICU during the surge were not surgical patients. The admission of nonsurgical critically ill patients to ICU units was dictated solely by bed availability and not by particular ICU specialty, with the exception that all critically ill surgical patients were exclusively admitted to the SICU and managed by the ACS service. The increased number of the critically ill patients during the COVID-19 surge led to the higher acuity of critically ill patients admitted to the ACS service during that period in comparison to the pre-COVID time. Ultimately, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality among critically ill ACS patients before and during the COVID-19 surge (13.6% vs. 9.4%, P > .05). When comparing patients treated in ACS-and non-ACS-managed ICUs during the surge period, there were no significant differences noted in the distribution of patients in terms of critical illness indicators or overall mortality. However, among critically ill COVID-19 positive patients treated by the ACS service, there was a nonsignificant trend toward lower mortality (13.9 vs. 27.4%, P = .12). The outcomes of this specific group of patients were in line with previously reported outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients from other institutions. [9] [10] [11] At our institution, no elective surgeries were allowed during the COVID surge, except for those patients in whom a surgery delay would lead to a permanent health damage. 12 As a result, we noted that more than 50% of all surgical cases in the Department of Surgery during the COVID surge were performed by the ACS service. The urgent and emergent nature of surgical cases typically performed by the ACS service resulted in a disproportionately high surgical contribution of the ACS service during the COVID-19 surge. The frequency of different types of surgical cases performed also shifted during this period. The increase in the number of patients on prolong mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 surge led to a raising need for tracheostomies and PEG tubes in those patients. This resulted in these 2 procedures being the most common surgery performed during the COVID-19 surge, as opposed to exploratory laparotomy in the pre-COVID period. The ACS service was the leading provider of tracheostomy and PEG tube placement at our institution.",
