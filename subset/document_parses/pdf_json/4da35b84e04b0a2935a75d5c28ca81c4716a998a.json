            "text": "In exceptional circumstances such as health pandemics, it is to be expected that policy actions are supported by a balanced use of scientific information to support decision-making that impacts the lives of citizens. However, situations in which no scientific consensus has been reached due to either insufficient, inconclusive or contradicting findings place strain on governments and public organizations which are forced to take action under circumstances of uncertainty. In this chapter, we focus on the case of COVID-19, its effects on children and the public debate around the reopening of schools. The aim is to better understand the relationship between policy interventions in the face of an uncertain and rapidly changing knowledge landscape and the subsequent use of scientific information in public debates related to the policy interventions. Our approach is to combine scientific information from journal articles and preprints with their appearance in the popular media, including social media. First, we provide a picture of the different scientific areas and approaches, by which the effects of COVID-19 on children are being studied (e.g., transmission, infection, severity, etc.). This provides a snapshot of the scientific focus and priorities in relation to COVID-19 and children. Second, we identify news media and social media attention around the COVID-19 scientific output related to children and schools. We focus on policies and media responses in three countries: Spain, South Africa and the Netherlands. These countries have followed very different policy actions with regard to the reopening of schools and represent very different policy approaches to the same problem. We analyse the activity in (social) media around the debate between COVID-19, children and school closures by focusing on the use of references to scientific information in the debate. Finally, we analyse the dominant topics that emerge in the news outlets and the online debates. We draw attention to illustrative cases of miscommunication related to scientific output and conclude the chapter by discussing how information from scientific publication, the media and policy actions shape the public discussion in the context of a global health pandemic.",

While it rapidly became clear that certain population groups are more at risk, with the elderly and adults who have underlying health conditions being at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19, much uncertainty remained surrounding children (Rajmil, 2020) . The uncertainty characterized both the infection rates among children as well as their range of symptoms. As empirical evidence accumulated at tremendous pace, fewer infection rates have consistently been reported in children compared with adults, as have the milder symptoms (Cruz and Zeichner 2020 , G\u00f6tzinger et al. 2020 , Goldstein et al. 2020 ). Very few cases in children have been linked to severe symptoms, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome and Kawasaki-like disease Whittaker 2020, Webb et al. 2020) .",

Adults and children older than 13 years of age could still be tested if they presented cold-like symptoms. The special testing rules stipulated being really sick or being in contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19.

The enclosed and crowded environment, prone to poor ventilation and where children and educators spend 6 to 8 hours daily, creates the conditions for a high-risk environment. Hence, strict measures have been necessary in the face of scientific uncertainty and closing schools was among the first measures taken worldwide to reduce the spread of the virus. China and Mongolia were the first countries to close schools in the middle of February 2020, followed by some schools in Italy and San Marino at the end of February 2020. By March 31st, schools in 193 countries were closed due to COVID-19.",

Whereas 43 countries reopened schools partially and other 40 countries fully reopened schools by June 15th, many other countries in the northern hemisphere postponed the reopening of schools until after the summer holidays. In a considerable number of countries, school reopening has been perceived as being safe, given the low levels of community spreading. Nonetheless, when community spread levels were not low, hot spots of infections were reported at a school and at a school camp (Stein-Zamir et al., 2020; Torres et al., 2020; Szablewski et al., 2020 ). An ECDC report on COVID-19 in children and the role of school settings in COVID-19 transmission concludes that \"there is limited evidence that schools are driving transmission of COVID-19 within the community, however there are indications that community transmission is imported into or reflected in the school setting\". Macartney (2020) has reported low transmission rates in the New South Wales educational system during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though most schools remained open in Australia during the first wave, class sizes were reduced during the peak. For some parts of the country (e.g. Melbourne) with high community viral spreading, schools did close.",

These two databases are of special interest due to the combination of sources they include, containing not only studies published in scientific journals but also preprints from the main global repositories (e.g., BioRxiv, MedRxiv, SSRN, etc.).",

This is our final set of scientific publications from which we trace their (social) media reception. The two databases (WHO and CORD-19) do not represent distinctive sets of publications, having quite substantial overlap. In order to avoid duplicates, the two databases were merged and cleaned. For a reliable merging of the two databases, as well as for the further tracing of the (social) media reception of the publications, it was necessary to count with unique document identifiers (e.g., PubMed Identifiers, Digital Object Identifiers, etc.). Particularly Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) are commonly assigned to scientific publications to univocally identify scientific documents across databases and the web-at-large. The main inconvenience of using DOIs is that we can only identify and combine publication data for half of the papers included in the CORD-19 database and a third of those included in the WHO database ( Figure 1 ).",

This network provided a baseline to visually inspect the whole body of literature related with COVID-19 and children. Moreover, it also offered a baseline on which to overlay Twitter and news media activity. This was done by coloring the nodes of the network (noun phrases) based on the number of mentions received by the papers containing such terms. Thus, terms with a higher intensity in the color grading belong to papers that are highly tweeted by users of a given country. Figure 2 provides a visual aid to help the reader better understand and interpret the contents of such maps. The data collected on news outlets and tweets were used to investigate the activity and topics covered in the (social) media when reporting scientific outputs, for each country. Overlay maps were used to show those topics. We include overlay maps for tweets in this chapter. We mention that single noun phrases \"covid\" and \"children\" were removed from the maps since they are redundant for our analysis. The overlay maps for news outlets are uploaded on figshare. For illustrative purposes, we selected examples to study differences in the reporting of scientific literature in the news media, by individually reading and analyzing the contents of selected scientific and news articles, and the tweets text.

The highest number of tweets in early July is the result of mentions received by a nationwide, population-based seroepidemiological study (Poll\u00e1n et al., 2020) on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain (ENE-COVID). A total of 1,906 tweets followed soon after the article was published in the Lancet, at the beginning of July. The second-highest tweeted article (739 tweets) reports on paediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome (Yonker et al., 2020) and received distinct attention before the school reopening, as well as in September. Similarly, attention was paid before the school reopening to the safety of reopening (primary) schools during pandemic (Levinson, et al., 2020; Mallapaty, 2020) .",

The nodes in the map present the co-occurrence of the most relevant keywords identified from the titles of the 5,713 articles in our dataset. The color coding of the map reflects the prevalence of mentions of those articles in tweets from Spain relative to the worldwide collected tweets: The darker the color, the more focus on the keywords relative to the worldwide tweets on the topic. The map in Figure 4 depicts more focus than is the case worldwide on topics such as school and education, but also on adolescence, experience and impact, which suggests a focus on the social implications related to school closure. Furthermore, an enhanced focus on infection and risk factors, diagnosis and treatment is visible on the right-hand side of the overlay map. The severity of symptoms, i.e., multisystem inflammatory syndrome appears to be at the same level as for the rest of the world, but at higher levels than for the other two countries. The news overlay map (not shown but uploaded on Figshare) shows less activity around the severity of symptoms and infection, but similar activities for transmission and school, school closure and impact. Figure 5 provides the timeline for the school closure and (partial) reopenings in South Africa. We note the differentiation between the reopening of secondary (high) schools and primary schools in July and August. Primary schools reopened later than secondary schools. A total of 74 news articles and 992 tweets were identified. Of the 74 news articles, 33 news articles were identified during the first school closure and only 18 in September. The most mentioned studies in the news are those by Yonker et al. (2020) and Hsiang et al. (2020) , on large-scale anti-contagion policies, each with 3 mentions. Despite the comparatively low number of identified tweets, we observe Twitter activity around the announcement of school closure in March, and immediately after the first confirmed death, which registers the highest Twitter activity. The highest number of tweets (92 tweets) was in fact in relation to a study on SARS transmission, risk factors and prevention in Hong Kong (Lau et al., 2020) , and concerned the wearing of face masks. This illustrates a textbook example on how correlation between two apparent events does not imply causation.",

This finding introduces an interesting observation of the discussion around the face masks in the Netherlands, where face masks only became mandatory in December 2020. In Spain and South Africa, where mask wearing was made mandatory earlier on in the pandemic, we do not observe a reaction to this publication, with only one news mention in both Spain and South Africa. A report on coronavirus disease in children from the United States published by the CDC COVID-19 Response Team (Covid CDC et al., 2020) also received 13 mentions in the Dutch news media.

The first sustained discussion on Twitter was stirred up by the announcement on March 12th that schools will remain open. The tweets debated the government decision and the message transmitted by RIVM that children are less susceptible to become infected. The highest tweet activity was generated by the study by Lau et al. (2020) in early April, with 96 tweets. In the middle of May, a systematic review (Lecrerc et al., 2020) on the available literature on examples of SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to indoor activities, caught the attention of tweeters in the Netherlands. The majority of 70 tweets focused on the need of outdoor sports (for children), as supported by the lack of empirical evidence for outdoor settings. Finally, the second-most tweeted (79 tweets) article mentioned paediatric SARS-CoV-2 (Yonker et al., 2020) and third-most tweeted output (with 71 tweets) provides scientific support for the wearing of face masks (Peeples, 2020) . Even though face masks are not the topic of our study in this chapter, it is interesting to note again that in the Netherlands, face masks were not mandatory at the time of the Twitter discussion. Figure 8 illustrates the topics covered by tweets in the Netherlands relative to the overall tweets on the topic. Unlike in Spain and South Africa, there is little focus on the social topics, which may reflect the early school reopenings in the Netherlands. Most tweets focus on infection and transmission, which are expected topics when schools are open. The news overlay map reflects less activity related to infection and slightly less to severe symptoms, but more to transmission and to school closure than the Twitter overlay map.

After finding that regardless of the viral load most children are either asymptomatic or have milder disease, they warn \"that it would be ineffective to rely on symptoms or temperature monitoring to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection\" (p. 51). While the paper clearly emphasizes the potential risk of children spreading the disease, it does not present evidence of higher transmission rates from children. However, a news item from the Netherlands mentioning the article is entitled \"Children with mild symptoms from coronavirus appear to be very infectious\". Four other Dutch news items report the findings of the study, which are not in line with the guidelines from the National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) that children play a modest role in the transmission of the coronavirus. Spanish media presented a very different perspective on the paper's findings, warning in their news articles titles that asymptomatic children are spreaders of the disease.",

The study points out that community transmission is replicated in a school setting and hence the risk of school reopenings while community spread is high. This suggests that despite the strict measures on school reopenings in Spain, the public debate accounted for the risks of less strict measures. The severity of COVID-19 symptoms in children was captured by 550 tweet mentions of Kawasaki and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Spain, 47 in the Netherlands and 31 in South Africa.

Despite the broad scientific coverage of the topic, both in the news and social media, we observed locally-driven communication in the context of a global pandemic. Our illustrative exploration also identified a disconnect between the policy (political) timeline and the resultant communication in the social media, suggesting that the (social) media reaction to policy moments is not supported by frequent referencing to scientific output on the topic of children and school closure during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

It is conceivable that social media is mirroring science given the number of health, research and other professionals in our sample.

In our study, we found no evidence during the pandemic of a pro-or anti-schooling movement on Twitter. This claim is based on the lack of a universal or popular hashtag related to the topic and which would point to a specific community of attention on Twitter. Further support is provided by the fact that there are no highly active or dominant Twitter accounts to be found in the data. One would expect to find highly active Twitter users in cases where the platform is used to amplify messaging. In the data, only two accounts (both from Spain) were found to have tweeted more than 100 times during the eight-month period. One of the accounts belongs to a paediatrician while the other to the Spanish Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases. In the absence of an ideologically-motivated group, movement or collective, and some evidence that scientific rather than political activity is the driver of social media activity, Twitter is not in this case being used as a communication platform to amplify messaging about the risks or benefits of children attending school during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
