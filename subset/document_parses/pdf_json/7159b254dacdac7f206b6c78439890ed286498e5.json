This pandemic portrays a spectrum of clinical complications, primarily affecting the respiratory system reported to be caused by a pathogen SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the family of beta coronavirus. Currently, the main objective of the government authorities of all affected countries and research organizations is to find a potential solution in the form of a pharmacological intervention or a vaccination to eradicate the disease and to have a long-term solution to deal with the pandemic. A multitude of anti-viral regimens is proposed based on the repurposing of currently available drugs for other issues or the compassionate use of drugs to immediately control and optimize the healthcare facilities. Meanwhile, a number of agencies are proposing new drug candidates to recreate the possibility of treating the disease. Similarly, a lot of research work is going on worldwide for the development of vaccination. Currently, a good number of candidates has finally reached the borders of Clinical Trials and are expected to be launched as soon as possible. However, the regulatory framework and authorization of these candidates is the most significant aspect of the whole scenario, which needs a specific set of time for validation purposes. The present work is widely focused on the general aspects of COVID-19 and the regulatory landscape for the emergency authorization of repurposed drug candidates, compassionate use of drugs, investigational entities, and vaccine development worldwide.",

All the currently used therapies are focused on the clear complications produced by COVID-19 and deliver symptomatic relief to the patient from the previous knowledge of similar complications produced by any other disorder. Currently used treatment is based on the repurposing of drugs of various classes such as anti-viral drugs, anti-parasitic drugs, antibiotics such as remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirin, ivermectin, inhibitors of various cytokines [4] . All scientific organizations and government bodies shifted their focus towards the testing and development of therapeutics relevant to deal with the pandemic on an emergency basis. Even the diagnostic kits are developed to increase the monitoring and tracking of the spread of the disease. However, legal regulations and emergency approvals of these therapeutics to deal with such urgent situation require a whole different regulatory framework in order to pace up the development protocols [5] . This review primarily focuses on the scenario of the emergency approvals of the drugs and protocols followed in issuing Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the repurposed drug candidates, development of the vaccination and various developers attempting to launch desired vaccine candidates worldwide.",

This disease triggers the respiratory system, and various published reports suggest the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 differ according to the severity. The incubation period of the virus ranges between 0d and 24d [6] . The widely occurring symptoms include fever, dyspnoea, fatigue, myalgia. However, 40% of people also show certain kind of gastrointestinal symptoms as well, and interestingly 10% of these are not accompanied by respiratory symptoms [7] . These include vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea and anorexia. Headaches, dizziness and altered levels of consciousness have also been reported in many cases [8] . Various reports also address the severity levels and are higher in older aged people or patients with some underlying disorders. Furthermore, raised levels of certain enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferases and increased CD3 and CD4 T cell counts are also associated with the worsening of the condition. When it comes to co-infections, almost 8000 samples tested for COVID-19 in China documented 5.8% chances of co-infections such as seasonal flu, rhinoviruses and influenza virus in the positive individuals [9] .",

These viral particles are enveloped that possesses a spike-like protein and recognize the human receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme II) for its entry [10] . They are single-stranded positive huge RNA, mostly round with a diameter ranging 120-160 nm having a tendency to infect humans as well as animals. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 reveals remarkable identity with SARS-CoV and RaTG12, and this suggests a possible origination of the virus from the bat species. After binding to the receptor, the host protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the protein, and fusion peptides fuse the viral membrane. The expression of ACE2 in various tissues is responsible for the appearance of less common extra-pulmonary symptoms. After integration, the virus releases its RNA into the cytoplasm of host cells, and by the process of translation and replication, new virion particles are produced, which after exocytosis, infects the neighbouring cells. In immune response to this, cytokine storm elevates the factors such as Interferon c, Interleukin 6, Tumour necrosis factor a, IL-8, MCP-1, IL-1b, IP-10, IL-10 [11, 12] , and this can be fatal too.

Most of these drug candidates are focused on delivering symptomatic relief. All scientific associations are working diligently to develop the required therapeutics that can treat or help in preventing the infection. But to conduct such activities, necessary legal regulations are required to meet the proper quality standards, timely developments and implementation of proper manufacturing protocols. Drugs that require significant development in treating a certain emergency situation are usually granted a Priority Review Designation which anticipates shortening the 10 months review time to nearly 6 months which is followed by an Accelerated Development Designation that shortens the study duration by relying on surrogate laboratory markers instead of clinical endpoints [14] . The Fast Track Designation deals with a wide range of disorders with unmet medical needs [15] . Then the Breakthrough Therapy Designation happens to make improvements and significant developments in the products over the available therapies [16] . Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a provision which is sanctioned to determine the considerable potential of an emergency and if any effective treatment is believed to be reasonable where the benefits outweigh the potential risks and where there is no sufficient approved alternative, then under such circumstances, a drug candidate might be authorized by EUA [5] . Emergency use authorization (EUA) provides protection against threats related to CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) emergencies during health disasters. Since the beginning of this ongoing emergency of COVID-19, which has the potential to challenge the health and security of the people, various EUA's have been issued for medical devices, therapeutics, In-Vitro kits. EUA supposedly grants the non-approved medical products in order to diagnose, prevent or treat the issues for which no sufficient approved alternatives are available. Figure 2a shows an Algorithm demonstrating the issuance of EUA in public health emergencies. Under Sect. 564 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, FDA commissioner determines the certain steps in order to issue an EUA [79] .",

Remdesivir is a prodrug and an analogue of ATP which competes with ATP and acts on RNA dependent RNA polymerase to integrate into viral RNA leading to termination of RNA synthesis. In the primary human airway, epithelial cells also remdesivir successfully exhibits antiviral activity against the pathogen of COVID-19 [19] . Even from the case studies of phase III clinical trials, it was documented that patients receiving remdesivir along with the standard of care have shown better improvement rather than the patients not receiving the drug [17] . The compassionate use of remdesivir has also led to improvements in COVID-19 patients.",

Well-versed consent of the patient is one of the prime requirements to initiate the compassionate use of drugs. These are used only if the potential advantages outweigh the risks of the drug. A major issue with the use of the compassionate drug is that the patient becomes reluctant to perform in clinical trials due to the possibility of participation in control groups where they don't receive the investigational drug candidate [42] . This is why there are certain regulations that consider patients for compassionate use of drugs who fail to get enrolled for clinical trials since clinical trials are more important to develop generalized information regarding the investigational drug candidate [43] . Another major drawback is that there are no primary documents on the bioethics committee that reviews the compassionate use requests because so far, the committee is involved with clinical research and due to ethical issues concerning these requests [44] .

It basically uses the less virulent or killed strains of the pathogen to induce antibody production accompanied by the risk of reverting back to the wild-type strains. However, for longer lasting effect, booster doses may be required [55] . Dynavax Technologies, in collaboration with Sonovac Biotech, has revealed some preliminary data reporting Phase I and Phase II studies from an inactivated vaccine candidate [55] . For the successfull development of a vaccine, it is important to identify the whole genomic map of the virus on which researchers are working for a long time and made quiet, brilliant attempts. The interaction of S-protein present on the virus with the host ACE2 receptor was explored to be used as a target for the design of the vaccine [67] . The issues to be considered while developing the vaccine includes induction of optimal antibody response since there are always chances of re-infection or relapse, especially in the patients with mild or no symptoms in the long term [68] . The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is expected to reduce these issues and have an improved antibody titer so that individuals do not have chances to get re-infected within years. A recent report suggests that vaccine candidates having binding capacities against SARS-CoV-1 may have crossreactivity against Receptor Binding Domains of SARS-CoV-2 [69] . Another major concern for a current design for the vaccine is its potential against mutations and high levels of glycosylation in the target S-protein of the pathogen and the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement [70] . Once the suitable candidate is generated, the up-streaming according to the demand of the population in compliance with the good manufacturing practices is the next challenge. (Tables 1, 2 ) depicts the various vaccine candidates under pre-clinical and clinical trials, respectively, information adapted from D.G. Bruno et al.",

            "text": "Handling the evolving COVID-19 pandemic requires multidimensional approaches. However, precautionary measures and resources have been put forward by various countries against COVID-19 to prevent transmission and reduce fatality rates. Most strategies include self-isolation or quarantine, the promotion of public health measures including washing of hands, respiratory etiquette. Symptomatic relief from some previously used antiviral drugs awaiting further clinical trials. The sudden and unpredictable emergence of COVID-19 and its potential to cause a threat to global health allows the need for close collaborations among a wide variety of organizations in both researchers as well as manufacturer sectors. Thus, the laboratory surveillance network can generate valuable data with key variables of interest for characterizing the ongoing pandemic. Such an analysis may be useful to inform the future course of action. Therefore, analysis of these surveillance data can be obtained from the diagnostic kits. The testing performance could give descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 cases by various points. The major key preventive strategies to reduce the pandemic COVID-19 will be by the implementation of a mass vaccination program if developed quickly. However, the widespread use of currently licensed antiviral agents would show to present a reasonable strategy. Significant efforts are underway to improve access to items essential for the COVID-19 emergency response. This review describes the impact of pandemic COVID-19, current strategies to combat viruses, including antiviral drugs, etc. and various management initiatives implemented to mitigate its effects and the intervention of global researchers and different agencies to reduce or eliminate the viral infection. It also highlights some of the vaccines which are approved for clinical trials and other drugs that are under study. The article additionally offers the outbreak of viruses in distinctive nations and the medication and diagnostic package produced through exceptional international locations for the cure and detection of the virus.",
