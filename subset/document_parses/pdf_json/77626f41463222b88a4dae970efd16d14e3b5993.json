These observations are in agreement with epidemiological pattern of 2003 Coronavirus SARS-CoV outbreak when 8,098 cases of SARS were diagnosed worldwide and only <5% of all cases were diagnosed in patients <18 years of age [1] . 2012 MERS-Coronavirus outbreak reported few cases of MERS-CoV in children and it remained mainly a disease of adults [2] .",

The H of measles virus plays a crucial role in success of measles vaccine and the S protein of coronavirus is the most promising and studied candidate antigen for SARS-CoV vaccine development. It is the major target for neutralizing antibodies in human patients and in animal models. These similarities in structural construct may play a role in eliciting immune response against coronavirus in a child previously immunized against measles.",

Measles vaccination carries a number of advantages: highly efficient, safe, easily manufactured at large scale, vaccine strains are genetically stable, measles does not recombine or integrate genetic material, vaccine does not persist or diffuse, mass booster doses can be given to both pediatric and adult population, and it presents an economical option that can be evaluated swiftly in times of crisis.
