            "text": "In the past 50 years, the world has seen a dramatic shift in the causes of death and disabilities from infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) led by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (1) , which causes an estimated 17.9 million deaths every year (2) . As a result, the urgent need for policy measures to protect cardiovascular health is more apparent than ever and presents a historic imperative to prioritize and invest in public health by adopting health-promoting policy measures, including industrially produced trans fatty acids (IP-TFAs) elimination. Intake of IP-TFAs is associated with an increased risk of heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease (CHD) (3) . A 2% absolute increase in energy intake (EI) from trans-fat has been associated with a 23% increase in cardiovascular risk (4) . Although limited data are available on IP-TFAs intake globally, a recent report estimated that the 2017 global market volume of partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), the main source of IP-TFAs in food, was \u223c13.6 million tones (5) . PHOs constitute 25-45% of total fat (6) . The most common non-conjugated IP-TFAs in the daily diet of humans are 18-carbon fatty acids with one double bond in the 9-carbon transposition or two double bonds in the 9 and 12 carbon, called elaidic acid (EA; 9t18:1) and linolelaidic acid (LEA; 9t12t18:2), respectively (7) . EA, which is the trans form of oleic acid (OA, C18:1 cis), is the principal TFA found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and margarine. Following ingestion, EA is typically integrated into the plasma membrane of cells. EA has also been shown to induce oxidative stress; for example, an EA-rich diet caused oxidative stress in mice due to EA-induced reduction in plasma vitamin E levels (7) . EA intake resulted in significant hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and fatty liver alterations (8) .",

            "text": "In addition, a recent study by Buyun Liu et al. found that plasma EA concentration is associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms (9) . Another study demonstrated that EA could change physiochemical surface properties of lactobacilli, an antimicrobial, cholesterol-lowering, immunoregulatory, and gut-beneficial bacteria (10) . LEA is an omega-6 TFA (9E,12E-9t12t18:2), principally discovered in foods with fried or highheat cooking or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (11) . It was suspected to enhance the adipogenic differentiation favoring obesity (11) . Moreover, it was shown that LEA appeared to be potentially more detrimental than EA and that LEA contributed to higher risks of sudden cardiac death compared to other isomers (12) . Furthermore, in a survey conducted by Qiu Bin et al., it is discovered that EA and LEA triggered endothelial cell apoptosis via the caspase pathway and the mitochondria pathway and that LEA induced higher human umbilical vein smooth muscle cell proliferation than EA (13) . Around 58 countries have introduced laws to date that will protect more than 3 billion people from TFAs by the end of 2021 (14) . However, more than 100 countries have yet to act to eliminate TFAs from their national food supply and make the world TFAs free by 2023 (14) . The food industry is also becoming more receptive to replacing IP-TFAs in their products with healthier oils and fats. In 2018, TFAs elimination was identified as one of the priority targets in the WHO 13th General Programme of Work, which guides the 5-year work of WHO in 2019-2023 (14) . Also in 2018, the REPLACE action package was launched to help countries in removing IP-TFAs from their food supplies (15) . In addition, WHO released additional resources in 2019 to support country actions, including six implementation modules and a live policy tracking map, the TFAs Country Score Card 1, to monitor global progress toward the 2023 target (14) . In 2020, WHO established a TFA indicator that records whether countries have adopted WHO best-practice policies for eliminating IP-TFAs (16) . Their removal from the global food supply could prevent up to 17 million deaths by 2040 and would be the first time an NCD risk factor has been eliminated (17) . The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has witnessed rapid modernization in the past 30 years that has led to a dramatic transformation affecting people's lifestyles and diet. The average intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and TFAs in EMR exceeded the WHO upper limits and was estimated to be 10.3 percent and 1.9 percent of total EI, respectively (18) . The highest SFAs intake was reported in Djibouti, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Yemen, while the highest intake of TFAs was reported in Egypt and Pakistan. The main sources of TFAs in the region are margarine, biscuits, French fries, cereal-based foods, fast food, snacks, milk, bakery products, pie, and cake. Lower TFA content was reported in traditional foods (18) . With a population estimate of around 6,803,105 million and a severe decline of the gross domestic product from the US $7,661 per capita in 2019 to the US $2,744 in 2020 (19), Lebanon is characterized by a high urbanization rate (88%) (20) coupled with westernization and modernization in diet and lifestyle and higher uptake of NCD risk factors. Similar to the region, the Lebanese population suffers from a high burden of NCDs, accounting for 91% of total annual deaths with CVDs responsible for 47% of total deaths (21) . Because IP-TFAs increase the risk for heart disease and are estimated to cause more than 500,000 deaths per year (14) and based on the WHO recommendation that TFAs intake should not exceed 1% of total daily EI (equivalent to <2.2 g/day in a 2,000-calorie diet), providing baseline information on dietary sources of IP-TFAs in Lebanon is a crucial stepstone to reduce the risk of death and hospitalization by CVDs and is one of the strategic interventions under the area of prevention and reduction of risk factors in the Regional Framework for Action on NCDs (22) .

The 2019 survey was not centrally coordinated but instead pooled data from five separate sources having the broadest geographical coverage in terms of location and had relatively a sample size of 30 types of traditional dishes. The samples were identified according to their frequency of consumption (23, 24) and selected for TFA analysis along with two non-conjugated fatty acids (EA and LEA) (25) . In contrast, the subsequent surveys 2020 were centrally coordinated having the broadest coverage in terms of products selected and had a sample of 35 types of Arabic sweets and 46 types of market food products. The full methodology of food list identifications and food sampling is described elsewhere (25) (26) (27) . On the other hand, the 2021 survey was nationally coordinated, with a coverage of 34 types of butter, ghee, and margarine purchased from the Lebanese markets. Lot numbers were checked to ensure that each unit belonged to a different lot. The samples were stored, labeled, and analyzed before expiry dates. Samples were selected to include all types of butter, ghee, and margarine in Lebanon. The analyses were carried out in duplicate for each sample. To further interpret current levels of TFAs and partially hydrogenated fatty acids in Lebanese foods, product categories were compared to similar products found in other countries.",

About 93% of the products tested in Lebanon, between 2019 and 2021, met the WHO recommendations (less than 2% of trans fatty acid in total fat), while about 7% exceeded the limit. As per Tables 1-3 , all in all, EA was dominant in almost all the analyzed samples, and its higher amount indicates that hydrogenated oils were a major contributor in the processing of food products or baking and cooking meals. In comparison with other countries all over the globe, a broad range of EA was observed in many food products ( Table 4) . For instance, the mean level of EA in Baklava (0.2%) was relatively low in our study in comparison with the content of EA in Iran (2.5%) (31) . Furthermore, our findings showed that the mean levels of EA in cakes (2.6%) were much lower than the content of EA found in cakes in France (18.5-25.6%) (32), Iran (6.95-18%) (31-33), Poland (7.95%) (34), India (1.92-3.93%) (35) , and higher than EA cake content tested in Lebanon in 2015 (1.7%) (36), Korea (1.36%) (37), Turkey (0.37%\u22121.43%) (38) , New Zealand (0.9%) (39) , and Malaysia (<0.001%) (40) ( Table 4 ). In addition, the mean levels of EA in biscuits in Iran (9-12.86%) (33), Lebanon 2015 (3.7%) (36), Poland (2.81%) (34), Korea (2.4%) (37), New Zealand (0.9%) (39) , and Germany (0.18%) (41) were higher than our results (0.1%), except for Malaysia (<0.001%) (40) and India (0.01%) (35) ( Table 4) . As for the breakfast cereals, the mean level of EA in our study (0.1%) was much lower than in France (28.9-32.4%) (32) and Korea (0.5-6.75%) (37) , and higher than in the UK (0.03%) (42) and Malaysia (<0.001%) (40) ( Table 4) . Moreover, our finding showed that the mean level of EA in chocolate wafers was 6 times more than EA content in chocolate wafers in Malaysia (40) . As for the butter, the New Zealand (39) and Costa Rican butter (43) contained five times more EA, and the Pakistani butter (44) contained three more times EA, compared with our results (Table 4) . However, the butter in UK, Germany, and Iran contained 0.22% (42), 0.23% (41) , and 0.3% (33) EA, respectively; this is lower than the content of EA tested in our study (0.6%) ( Table 4) . Also, Table 4 shows that the margarine in Slovenia contained the highest content of EA (34.63%) (45) compared to our findings (2.2%) and other countries. As for the EA content in chips, Iranian chips showed the highest level of EA (10%) compared to our results (0.1-0.3%) and other countries (33) ( Table 5) .

            "text": "According to many studies, there was an impact of TFAs and PHFAs labeling on reducing the burden of CVDs due to IP-TFAs (66) . According to an unpublished study conducted by our team, 32% only of the products available in the Lebanese markets reported IP-TFAs on their labels (data not shown). Our finding came to hand in hand with Kamel et al. (67) , in which 181 food products were sampled from local supermarkets in Saudi Arabia and showed that one-third of the products mentioned IP-TFAs on the nutrition label. Moreover, while the majority of the investigated samples in our project had low levels of IP-TFAs, up to 14 g of TFAs per 100 g of food was observed in certain oils and fats sold at the Lebanese markets. Our findings, concerning the range of IP-TFAs in market products, were relatively low compared to the market investigations published in Stender et al. (68, 69) . (20) . According to the nutrition labels of tested butter and margarine, the countries of origin from which all the butter and margarine were imported to Lebanon were Turkey (n = 5), Egypt (n = 4), Malaysia (n = 3), Saudi Arabia (n = 1), Sri Lanka (n = 3), UAE (n = 1), Netherland (n = 2), Belgium (n = 3), France (n = 4), Italy (n = 1), Ukraine (n = 1), Germany (n = 2), and Denmark (n = 2) (data not shown). Among all these countries, 33 percent (5 countries over 15) are implementing mandatory national limits and adopting monitoring mechanisms for mandatory of IP-TFAs limits. On the other hand, in the remaining countries, the best-practice TFAs policy passed but was not yet in effect (16) . Lebanon, long considered a middle-income country, is rapidly sinking into poverty as it faces a triple shock from the unprecedented economic crisis, the impact of COVID-19 on employment and public health, and the consequences of the Beirut port explosion. Despite that, the actual relative impact of IP-TFAs exposure on heart disease mortality in Lebanon is limited but unambiguously still considerable. The findings in our report highlight the importance of controlling the importation of food products from countries controlling IP-TFA levels in food to avoid sinking Lebanese markets with IP-TFA-rich food products (20) , both of which are often ultra-processed, unhealthy, and rich in IP-TFAs. Therefore, this population group is at higher risk of TFA-attributable CVDs. This study presents some limitations. First, there are many challenges facing the laboratories in Lebanon concerning the testing of IP-TFA, and the lack of standards limits testing other forms of isomers. Second, the food products compared between regions were compared in terms of food groups and not in terms of brands. Moreover, the comparison between traditional dishes or Arabic sweets omits the cooking preparations and ingredients. Third, in the current study, the WHO technique was followed to test the IP-TFA levels in foods tested; however, this was not always reported in many other countries.",

There is more than enough convincing evidence that a high IP-TFAs intake is detrimental to cardiovascular health. Fortunately, this problem in Lebanon is fairly easy to solve via proper legislation. However, the persistence of food products with high IP-TFA levels in Lebanon means that subgroups of the Lebanese population, mainly vulnerable and food-insecure people, are threatened by high levels of TFAs due to frequent consumption of risky products. The inauguration and implementation of policies to curtail IP-TFAs in Lebanon may therefore be legitimized, and such efforts should underline added fats and packaged foods due to the economic crises in which people opt to select cheap oils, including butter, ghee, and margarine instead of vegetable oils. We all deal with the clinical consequences of IP-TFA consumption, and we should all be engaged in putting an end to this threat. Although trans fatty acids have a small impact on heart disease mortality in Lebanon, they are unquestionably significant. The persistence of food products with high quantities of trans fatty acids poses a health risk to Lebanese citizens. Fortunately, proper laws in Lebanon can easily remedy this situation.",
