            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus is a highly contagious disease occurring in respiratory, urogenital, and reproductive tissues of chicken causing considerable losses due to death, egg drop, and reduced production. is preliminary study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and to assess the potential risk factors in chickens of northwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2020 to June 2021. A total of 768 serum samples from three zones were collected. To investigate the presence of antibodies against IBV, the indirect ELISA serological test was applied. Positivity for anti-IBV antibodies was observed in 23.96% (95% CI: 20.98-27.14) of the samples. e mixed-effect logistic regression analysis of potential risk factors showed that IBV prevalence was significantly higher in young chickens than adults (p < 0.001) and higher in intensive farm type than in extensive type (p < 0.001). Based on the production purposes of the chickens, the odds of seropositivity for IB was significantly higher in layers than in broilers (p < 0.001) and dual purposes (p < 0.001). is study revealed higher seroprevalence in farms which had the \"all-in-all-out\" rearing method than in farms with different batches in one house with a significant difference (p < 0.001), higher seroprevalence in the poor ventilated type than in good ones (p < 0.001), and higher seroprevalence in the houses that did not remove used litter at all than houses of completely disposed and partially disposed litter (p \ufffd 0.002). Moreover, disinfection of houses had significant effect on the occurrence of IB. Having personal protective equipment was significantly affecting the occurrence of IB, being higher in the farms that have no wearing clothes and shoe than in those having wearing clothes and shoe (p \ufffd 0.002). In conclusion, the seroprevalence finding in the present study indicated that the organism is circulating among the population of chickens and high enough to cause significant economic losses erefore, poultry houses should be cleaned, disinfected, and well ventilated and farm attendants should have separate farm shoe and clothes. Further studies on the virus isolation and molecular characterization of the target gene are needed in the study area.",

However, mortality may increase up to 50% with some strains that cause nephritis or when opportunistic pathogens such as Escherichia coli complicate the disease [17] . Obviously, losses from production inefficiencies are more than mortality. In broilers, infectious bronchitis leads to poor weight gain and loss of profit at slaughter. In layers, it causes loss of egg qualities and egg production may drop down to 10-50% [18] .

In layer chicks, excretion of NT methylhistidine derived from degradation of myofibrillar proteins is higher than in broiler chickens in relation to body weight and muscling. Unlike layer chickens, broiler chickens show low m-calpain activity and high calpastatin (calpain 4 e Scientific World Journal inhibitor) activity, which suggests that m-calpain and calpastatin activities in skeletal muscles differ between chicken types which have different rates of muscle growth. ese results may suggest that leg muscles of layer hens compared to meat-type chickens are more susceptible to oxidative stress [34] . However, there was no significant relationship between sex and breed in relation to the occurrence of IB. is study was also aimed at making a comprehensive study on the detection of antibody against IBV in chicken by considering environmental factor analysis namely, farm type, feeding status, rearing method, ventilation, house sanitation, litter management, disinfection of houses, carcass management, and farm shoe and clothing (Table 3) . Accordingly, there is a significant relationship between farm type and seroprevalence of IB. Higher seroprevalence was found in intensive farm type as compared to the extensive type (AOR: 0.14: 95% CI: 0.06-0.34) with a significant difference of p < 0.001.

            "text": "is work aimed to make a comprehensive study on the detection of antibodies against IBV in chicken by considering multifactor analysis. Consequently, a total of 768 samples were collected and tested for IBV by the indirect ELISA test, and an overall seroprevalence of IB was found to be 23.96% (95% CI: 20.98-27.14). IBV vaccine is not used in this study area; therefore, this is presumed to be a field infection. Even if apparent difference was noted, the present finding agrees with the report of Ramos et al. [37, 38] that demonstrated overall seroprevalence of IBV (25.53%) in industry-associated flocks of chickens inside Atlantic Biome forest, Northwestern S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. e results are also supported by the findings of Shettima et al. [39] , who reported an overall prevalence of 26.6% from Nigeria. Moreover, this study finding was consistent with the finding of Bhuiyan et al. [40] , who reported a prevalence of 23.82% in broilers, from Bangladesh, and Ayim-Akonor et al. [15] , who revealed a prevalence of 21.2% in local chickens from Ghana. However, this study finding was quite lower than the results of previous surveys in chicken, such as, studies by Hutton et al. [20] , who reported a prevalence of 94.5% from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR), located in Bishoftu, and Tesfaye et al. [21] , who demonstrated four serotypes of infectious bronchitis virus with the prevalence of 70.60% from unvaccinated backyard and commercial farms in Ethiopia. is difference may attribute to the relatively high risk for chickens to get infection in and around Bishoftu, as described by Bekele et al. [41] that the disease has been speculated to be introduced concurrently with an increased number of commercial state and private poultry farms flourishing in the country especially in and around urban areas. Hence, Bishoftu and its surroundings represent the major and the principal site where a number of commercial farms are present and thus, chickens brought to this area will have higher risk of getting an infection from varied sources [32] .",

[53] who revealed that the seroprevalence of IB increased when the chickens spend more time in the farm, because of the long period of exposure to the virus. Even if its difference was not significant, this study also revealed higher seroprevalence of IB in females (24.23%) than in males (23.29%). is result agrees with the report of Mungadi et al. [48] who revealed a higher prevalence in females than in males without significant differences in the study of local chickens in live bird markets in Sokoto State, Nigeria. is could be due to the fact that more females (549) were sampled than the males (219). is could be also associated with the presence of less-efficient immune response in males than in females due to the differences in the activity of humoral-and cell-mediated immune responses between the sexes [48] . ere was a significant difference in the prevalence among chickens of different ages (p < 0.05). e higher prevalence was found in young chickens (32.12%) than in adults (21.22%).",
