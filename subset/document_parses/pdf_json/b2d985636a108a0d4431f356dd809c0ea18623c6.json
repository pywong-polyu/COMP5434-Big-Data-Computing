The hallmark of CSS is an unchecked feedforward activation and amplification of host immune, causing the massive release of a wide range of cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-c, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-18, which contributes to the formation of a cytokine storm [3, [6] [7] [8] .

The triggers leading to CSS are heterogeneous and derive from infection [10, 11] , malignant tumour [12] , rheumatic disease [13, 14] , iatrogenic injury [15] and the application of immunotherapeutic drugs [7, 16, 17] , amongst which infection is the most common cause [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 441, "end": 444, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 445, "end": 448, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 449, "end": 452, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 453, "end": 456, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 457, "end": 460, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 461, "end": 464, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 767, "end": 770, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 771, "end": 774, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 775, "end": 778, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 779, "end": 782, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 980, "end": 983, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1062, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1066, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1090, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1115, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1119, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1144, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1195, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1199, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1203, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1258, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses infecting multiple host species, including humans and several other vertebrates, which may cause cross-species transmission [18] .

Low pathogenic CoVs infect upper airway and cause seasonal respiratory illness, whilst highly pathogenic CoVs, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), infect the lower respiratory tract and may lead to acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death [19, 20] . Since December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) had rapidly spread from Wuhan of China to over 200 countries and regions in the world, caused global pandemic as claimed by WHO [21] [22] [23] .

Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) belongs to the spectrum of sHLH and complicates several rheumatic diseases, especially systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) [29] [30] [31] . The most progress in the understanding of the mechanism of CSS has been made in pHLH, which is a result of mutations in genes involved in the perforin-mediated pathway of cytolysis shared by natural killer cells (NK cells) and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells [32] . Normally, perforin in NK cells and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells can be packaged into cytolytic granules and then released into the immunologic synapse to form a pore between the lytic cell and the target cell (infected or tumour cells), allowing granzyme B, co-packaged with perforin, to induce the apoptotic cell death of the target cell [8] . Therefore, mutations in perforin coding gene or genes essential for perforin transport will cause a failure of normal cytolytic function and inability to clear the antigenic stimulus, leading to the hyperactivation of macrophages and T helper 1 (Th1) cells accompanied by excessive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, causing a self-amplifying hyperinflammatory state known as the cytokine storm [30, 33] . In addition, some work also suggested that more than 40% of sHLH patients had heterozygous mutations in the fHLH-associated genes [34] .

As we know, activated macrophages can produce a variety of cytokines, especially TNFa and a variety of interleukins (ILs, e.g. IL-6, IL-1 band IL-18), which may trigger the cascade reaction of inflammatory factors, and finally form a cytokine storm [8] . Macrophages also play a crucial role in the CSS induced by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which has demonstrated remarkable success in the treatment of CD19-positive B-cell malignant tumours. Van der Stegen and his colleagues showed that both toxicity and IL-6 release could be ameliorated by prior macrophage depletion in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)/beige mouse model of CSS induced by ErbB-specific CAR T-cell therapy [36] . Subsequently, Singh and his colleagues demonstrated that monocyte-derived cells were responsible for IL-6 secretion in response to CAR T-cell activation and IL-6 blockade did not affect the therapeutic effect of CAR T cell [37] . Similarly, using a murine model of CSS that developed within 2-3 days of CAR T-cell infusion, Giavridis and his colleagues showed that the severity of CSS was not mediated by CAR T cell-derived cytokines but by IL-6, IL-1 produced by recipient macrophages [38] . Further, Norelli et al found that human monocytes were the major source of IL-1 and IL-6 during CSS in the humanized mice with high leukaemia burden. Accordingly, they found that both monocyte depletion and blocking IL-6 or IL-1 receptor could avoid the occurrence of CSS [39] . All of these findings suggest that monocytes/macrophages play a crucial role in the development of CSS after CAR T-cell therapy and enable new therapeutic interventions in this filed.

The increase of IL-18 level is also related to the susceptibility of MAS in sJIA, but the specific mechanism is still unclear [48] . In the context of CAR T-cell therapy, CSS is induced by the excessive release of IFN-c by activated T cells or tumour cells. IFN-c can then facilitate the activation of other immune cells, especially macrophages. The activated macrophages produce excessive amounts of additional cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-a, IL-8 and IL-10, which leads to other corresponding clinical manifestations [16, 49] . In the setting of influenza virus-related CSS, Farrar and his colleagues found that patients infected with H5N1 had higher levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), monokine induced by IFN-gamma (MIG), interferon-gammainduced protein-10 (IP-10) and IL-8 than patients infected with seasonal H1N1 common influenza [11] .

Remarkably, the autopsy findings revealed that the lymphoid tissues and organs had been destroyed in COVID-19 patients [54, 55] , which is very unusual from CSS in sepsis and CAR T-cell therapy. Spleen atrophy and lymph node atrophy are observed in patients with COVID-19 [54, 55] , whilst in other CSS-related diseases, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are more common [4] . However, the specific mechanisms for these differences remain unclear and need to be further clarified. Here, we summarize the evidence of CSS in COVID-19 and the possible pathogenesis of cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2. The direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positivesense, single-stranded RNA viruses, which have caused two large-scale pandemics in the last two decades, SARS and MERS [10] . Spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV, facilitate viral entry into their target cells via the interaction with functional cellular receptor identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [56] . Generally, ACE2 was highly expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes and renal proximal tubular cells [57] . Functionally, ACE2, belonging to the ACE family, inactivates angiotensin \u2161(Ang\u2161) and generates angiotensin 1-7, a biologically active heptapeptide characterized by a potent vasodilator function [58] . It has been demonstrated that the binding of the coronavirus spike protein to ACE2 leads to the down-regulation of ACE2, which in turn results in excessive production of vasoconstrictor Ang\u2161 and reduced production of vasodilator angiotensin 1-7. Ang\u2161 also plays the role as a proinflammatory cytokine via angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R). The Ang\u2161-AT1R axis further activates NF-jB and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), which stimulates the production of the mature form of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and TNF-a [59] . Additionally, the induction of ADAM17 also processes the membrane form of IL-6Ra to the soluble form (sIL-6Ra), followed by the gp130-mediated activation of STAT3 via the sIL-6Ra-IL-6 complex. The activation of both NF-jB and STAT3, which in turn activate the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp), a mechanism for the hyperactivation of NF-jB by STAT3, will lead to a hyperinflammatory state, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular permeability [60] . Apart from ACE2, the entry of CoVs also requires S protein priming by cellular proteases, and SARS-CoV employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming [61] . Recent studies also indicated that ACE2 was a functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 [62, 63] . Additionally, Wrapp and his colleagues found that the receptor-binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 was 10-20 times stronger than that of SARS-CoV [64] . Moreover, Hoffmann and his colleagues found that SARS-CoV-2 also used the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming [65] . Based on the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a similar mechanism of hyperinflammatory state can be expected for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, using the (AT1R) blockers and TMPRSS2 inhibitors may be a promising treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 229, "end": 233, "text": "[54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 234, "end": 237, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 382, "end": 386, "text": "[54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 387, "end": 390, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 480, "end": 483, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 907, "end": 911, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1133, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1312, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1513, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2040, "end": 2044, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2484, "end": 2488, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2661, "end": 2665, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2748, "end": 2752, "text": "[62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2753, "end": 2756, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2899, "end": 2903, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 3026, "end": 3030, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Possible mechanisms of CSS in COVID-19"}, {"text": "A postmortem study in patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that the pathological features of COVID-19 greatly resembled those seen in SARS and MERS, with a histological examination showing a bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates [66, 67] .

Additionally, there was an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory Th17 cells [66] .

On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 reaches the lungs again through blood circulation and interacts with ACE2 receptors on the surface of alveolar capillary endothelial cells, making the alveolar capillary endothelium the target of attack by the immune system, thus inducing a series of immune responses and aggravating lung injury. The imbalance of lymphocyte subsets characterized by the decrease of CD4 + , CD8 + T cells, the increase of the number of proinflammatory Th17 cells and the increase of CD8 + cytotoxic particles, aggravated the disorder of host immune system.
