Global estimates of seasonal influenza-associated mortality range from 300,000 to 650,000 deaths per year, with the highest at-risk group consisting of individuals over age 75 (4) . In the United States, influenza-associated morbidity and mortality have steadily increased, an observation linked to an expansion of the aging population. Pneumonia related to severe influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection results in an initial acute exudative phase characterized by release of proinflammatory mediators that damage the alveolar epithelial and capillary barrier to cause refractory hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (5) . If a patient survives this first stage, activation of resolution and repair programs during the ensuing recovery phase is crucial for restoration of lung architecture and function, which promotes liberation from mechanical ventilation, decreases intensive care unit length of stay, and extends survival.",

Aside from being one of the best predictive biomarkers of chronological aging and age-related disease onset, DNA methylation regulates Treg cell identity through tight epigenetic control of Foxp3 and Foxp3-dependent programs (15) . Biological aging is associated with a progressive loss of molecular and cellular homeostatic Regulatory T (Treg) cells orchestrate resolution and repair of acute lung inflammation and injury after viral pneumonia. Compared with younger patients, older individuals experience impaired recovery and worse clinical outcomes after severe viral infections, including influenza and SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Whether age is a key determinant of Treg cell prorepair function after lung injury remains unknown. Here, we showed that aging results in a cell-autonomous impairment of reparative Treg cell function after experimental influenza pneumonia. Transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling of sorted Treg cells provided insight into the mechanisms underlying their age-related dysfunction, with Treg cells from aged mice demonstrating both loss of reparative programs and gain of maladaptive programs. Strategies to restore youthful Treg cell functional programs could be leveraged as therapies to improve outcomes among older individuals with severe viral pneumonia.",

Because of their tissue-reparative functions, Treg cells are important modulators of the immune response that promotes tissue regeneration after injury (18) . Whether age plays a key role in determining the prorepair function of Treg cells in the injured lung during recovery from viral pneumonia remains unknown. If aging indeed affects Treg cell-mediated recovery, is it a Treg cell-autonomous phenomenon or is it because the aging lung microenvironment is resistant to Treg cell-mediated repair? Using heterochronic (age-mismatched) adoptive Treg cell transfer experiments and molecular profiling in mice, we sought to determine whether the age-related impairment in repair after influenza-induced lung injury is intrinsic to Treg cells. Our data support a paradigm in which aged Treg cells activate maladaptive responses, fail to upregulate youthful reparative programs, and consequently exhibit a cell-autonomous impairment in prorecovery function, which delays resolution from virus-induced lung injury among aged hosts.",

To evaluate the age-related susceptibility to influenza-induced lung injury, we administered influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus via the intratracheal route to young (2-4 months) and aged (18-22 months) WT mice. Aged mice exhibited greater than 50% mortality when compared with young animals ( Figure 1A ), impaired recovery of total body weight following a similar nadir ( Figure 1B) , and more severe lung injury by histopathology at a late recovery time point, day 60 after infection ( Figure 1C ). At this same time point, aged mice also displayed an increase in the total number of cells per lung ( Figure 1D ), which were mainly composed of immune cells identified by the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 ( Figure 1E ), suggesting nonresolving tissue inflammation during recovery in older mice. Similar to prior reports (19, 20) , we confirmed that the increased susceptibility to influenza-induced lung injury in aged mice was observed despite having cleared the virus on day 14 after infection, the time of the greatest degree of weight loss among both groups ( Figure 1F ).",

Aged mice demonstrated increased mortality when compared with young animals at this time point (Supplemental Figure 1A ; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.141690DS1), but other markers of acute inflammation, including weight loss (Supplemental Figure 1B) , total lung cells (Supplemental Figure 1C ), and total lung CD45 + cells in surviving animals were not significantly different between groups (Supplemental Figure 1D ).

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the pairwise comparison between young and aged Treg cells during the recovery phase after influenza infection revealed that aged Treg cells downregulated repair-associated processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, myogenesis, and angiogenesis compared with young hosts (Figure 6, A and B) . This pairwise comparison demonstrated that although young Treg cells exhibited significantly increased expression of genes associated with naive (resting) state and lymphoid tissue markers akin to central Treg (cTreg) cell phenotype (Lef1, Sell, Satb1, Bcl2, S1pr1, Gpr83, and Igfbp4), aged Treg cells upregulated genes implicated in effector Th1, Th17, and T follicular regulatory differentiation (Tbx21/Cxcr3, Hif-1a, and Sostdc1, respectively); cell cycle (Ccna2, Mmc3 and Msi2); T cell anergy (Rnf128); and DNA damage response (Xrcc5 and Rm1) ( Figure 6A ).

The remaining 1,336 uniquely upregulated genes in young Treg cells were linked to reparative processes, in contrast with the 103 uniquely upregulated genes in aged Treg cells.

We measured the protein expression of these molecules by flow cytometry and found similar expression between young and aged Treg cells 60 days after influenza infection (Supplemental Figure 4A ). We reasoned that measurement of only 3 markers linked to repair incompletely characterizes the complexity of the Treg reparative landscape during influenza-induced lung injury and recovery. Accordingly, we compared our young and aged Treg cell RNA-Seq dataset with previously published datasets describing reparative IL-10 + and IL-18R\u03b1 + Treg cells (13) . We found that reparative IL-10 + and IL-18R\u03b1 + Treg cells were most similar to young Treg cells from our data set when compared with aged Treg cells (Supplemental Figure 4B) . Indeed, the number of genes within the unique intersections of young and IL-10 + and IL-18R\u03b1 + Treg cells was significantly higher than the number of genes within the unique intersections of aged and IL-10 + and IL-18R\u03b1 + Treg cells. Genes within the unique intersections of young and IL-10 + and IL-18R\u03b1 + Treg cells were enriched for gene ontology processes linked to reparative processes, including extracellular matrix remodeling, vascular remodeling, and tube morphogenesis (Supplemental Figure 4B ). These results underscore our finding that the youthful Treg cell response during recovery from influenza pneumonia was defined by a more robust reparative phenotype compared with aged hosts.",

The resulting eTreg cells with Th-like phenotypes migrate to inflammatory nonlymphoid tissues and acquire transcriptional and functional programs that copy the T effector responses they intend to suppress (27, 28) . Having observed transcriptional upregulation of effector-associated factors in the aged Treg cell response during recovery from influenza infection, we next performed flow cytometry analysis to measure canonical effector-associated transcription factors and cytokines at the protein level. During the recovery phase after influenza infection, aged mice exhibited a higher percentage of eTreg cells in their lungs compared with young hosts ( Figure 9A ). In the lung, compared with young CD4 + Foxp3 + cells, aged cells exhibited significantly higher expression of the transcription factors Tbet and Ror-\u03b3t, canonical master regulators of Th1 and Th17 responses, respectively ( Figure 9B) . Surprisingly, intracellular cytokine profiling of these cells also demonstrated a significant increase in the percentage of Ifn-\u03b3-and IL-17-producing CD4 + Foxp3 + cells in the lungs of aged mice compared with young mice ( Figure 9C) .",

These data suggest that Treg cells in the lungs of aged animals upregulate inflammatory effector programs during recovery from influenza.

In addition to representing one of the hallmarks of aging, epigenetic phenomena such as DNA methylation regulate the development, differentiation, and functional specialization of T cell lineages, including Treg cells (14) (15) (16) 30) . Therefore, we reasoned that age-related changes to the Treg cell DNA methylome could inform the divergent prorepair transcriptional response observed between young and aged Treg cells after influenza infection. We performed genome-wide 5\u2032-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3\u2032 (CpG) methylation profiling with modified reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of sorted lung Treg cells during the naive state or recovery phase after influenza infection (day 60, Figure 10A ). PCA of approximately 70,000 differentially methylated cytosines (FDR q value < 0.05) revealed tight clustering according to group assignment; the main variance across the data set (PC1) reflected methylation changes due to age ( Figure 10B) , consistent with prior studies (17, 31) . We next identified genes that were both differentially expressed and contained differentially methylated cytosines within their gene promoters (ANOVA, FDR q value < 0.05), finding 1,319 genes meeting this strict parameter threshold ( Figure 10C ). K-means clustering of these genes' expression levels revealed similarity to the overall heatmap of differentially expressed genes in Figure 4C , suggesting a strong correlation between differential DNA methylation and transcription. GSEA of these genes demonstrated that this methylation-regulated gene expression program was associated with prorecovery processes and was significantly skewed toward young Treg cells ( Figure 10C) . Combined, these results support the notion that age-related DNA methylation regulates the reparative transcriptional regulatory network during recovery from influenza-induced lung injury.",

Most studies have addressed the early mechanistic events leading to viral pneumonia-induced lung injury, yet failed to develop efficacious therapies to improve outcomes among patients with viral ARDS. Thus, we focused our experimental design on the late stages of recovery from influenza infection with the goal of investigating potentially novel reparative pathways that could be leveraged to enhance lung resilience to viral pneumonia in older hosts. Both influenza A virus-and SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury disproportionately affect the elderly, who comprise the greatest proportion of infection-related deaths (1, 3, 32, 33) . Here, we found that similar to human epidemiological data and previous preclinical murine studies, aged mice exhibited increased susceptibility and impaired recovery after influenza infection (4, 19) . Injury to alveolar epithelial type 1 and 2 and endothelial cells disrupts the tight gas-exchange barrier, causing accumulation of fluid and proinflammatory mediators in the alveolar space, a hallmark of ARDS pathophysiology (5) . Notably, we found that during late recovery from influenza infection, aged hosts demonstrated a decreased number of AT2 cells and endothelial cells compared with young animals, suggesting that failure to repopulate the alveolar lining contributes to the observed age-related impairment in recovery. Severe influenza infection leads to a robust expansion of Krt5 + cells, which migrate distally to form cyst-like structures or pods intended to cover the damaged alveolar wall (22) . These pods persist long after the initial infection, lack the capacity to generate a functional alveolar epithelium, and therefore constitute an insufficient reparative response to injury (22) . Here, we found that aged animals displayed an increased percentage of Krt5 + cells during the recovery phase of influenza-induced lung injury, which reflects the dysregulated repair response among aged hosts.",

Investigators have demonstrated that aging can negatively affect the composition and function of the Treg cell pool throughout the lifespan, rendering them inefficient as mediators of tissue repair (36) . This decline might occur through cell-autonomous mechanisms that result in altered trafficking to the lung and T cell maladaptive responses that lead to increased susceptibility to disease. For instance, loss of stemness accompanied by differentiation into proinflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotypes, activation of DNA damage responses, and the senescence secretome are among some of the T cell maladaptations that result from the mounting challenges to JCI Insight 2021;6(6):e141690 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.141690 which the T cell repertoire is exposed over a lifetime (24) . These T cell maladaptive changes could also result from an age-related decline in stromal signals and circulating factors from the tissue microenvironment that either affect T cell function directly or render the microenvironment resistant to T cell responses. Our heterochronic adoptive Treg cell transfer experiments definitively address this paradigm, ascertaining that the observed age-related Treg cell dysfunction is due to cell-autonomous mechanisms and dominant over the aged pulmonary microenvironment. Our data demonstrated that aging not only imparted a loss of prorecovery Treg cell function, but also a gain of some of these maladaptive features compared with young hosts. Future studies should aim to address the respective contribution of loss of reparative function or gain of maladaptive function to the overall phenotype and function of aged Treg cells during virus-induced lung injury and recovery.",

Gene expression profiling of lung Treg cells during the recovery phase of influenza infection revealed that young Treg cells significantly upregulated genes (compared with aged Treg cells) linked to biological processes associated with a robust prorepair signature, including extracellular matrix organization, alveologenesis, and vasculogenesis. Here, we demonstrated that the young Treg cell prorepair program was dominated by Areg expression and other genes related to the above-mentioned reparative processes. Interestingly, we found no difference when comparing the suppressive phenotype and function of young versus aged Treg cells after influenza infection and during steady state. These results suggest that the reparative program of Treg cells is separable and distinct from their suppressive program, an important observation that informs the development of Treg cell-based immunotherapies to target molecular pathways regulating their reparative function. In regard to aged Treg cells, we found that although capable of upregulating a prorepair program after influenza infection, the response was far less robust than the youthful reparative response. Moreover, aged Treg cells displayed increased expression of genes associated with an effector phenotype with increased expression of canonical Th1 and Th17 lineage markers (Tbet/IFN-\u03b3 and Ror-\u03b3t/IL-17, respectively). Whether this finding represents an age-related functional adaptability of Treg cells after influenza infection or it is the result of Treg cell lineage instability leading to effector differentiation remains unknown.",

Nevertheless, bulk RNA-Seq analysis averages gene expression profiles across a heterotypic Treg cell pool and presents them as a monotypic population, constituting a limitation to our data interpretation.

Whether epigenetic phenomena have a similar regulatory role in modulating the Treg cell reparative gene expression program remains unknown. Here, we used an unsupervised bioinformatics analysis to uncover a Treg cell-specific methylation-regulated transcriptional program enriched for reparative processes during recovery from influenza infection. Our computational integrative approach provides inferential evidence that age-related DNA methylation can modify the expression of genes linked to prorepair processes in Treg cells but does not prove causality and therefore represents a limitation of our study.
