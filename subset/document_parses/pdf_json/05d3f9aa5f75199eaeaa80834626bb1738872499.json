In the first section describing the infrastructure and expertise, there are six points. A BSL-2 level laboratory facility should be available, which should include a molecular biology setup for virological diagnosis and functioning and calibrated Biosafety cabinet type 2A/2B. A cold centrifuge/microfuge to extract RNA should also be available. A functioning and calibrated real-time PCR machine should be at the facility's disposal. With respect to the manpower requirement, one or more medical microbiologists with experience in molecular virology, along with four to six technicians with experience in molecular virology who can work in two to three divided shifts and one or more multitasking staff to take care of washing/cleaning work. The medical microbiologist(s) and technicians should have a good understanding of laboratory biosafety and biosecurity. They must have been trained for handling respiratory samples for viral diagnosis, RNA extraction, and real-time PCR with an experience of work in virology and handling clinical specimens, especially respiratory samples. The institute must have its own time tested and a strong policy on biomedical waste management of human origin. At last, but not the least, there should be a well-defined arrangement for segregating and discarding biomedical waste. Private medical colleges should submit a National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accreditation certificate and scope of accreditation for real-time PCR for RNA viruses.",

In the early half of March 2020, nationwide, there were only 52 laboratories authorized to carry out COVID-19 tests, now the number has grown up to over 25 times, with 1321 fully functioning laboratories out of which 907 are governmentowned. Back in 2009, when the H1N1 swine flu pandemic spread across the world, India had only two viral research diagnostic laboratories capable of carrying out molecular virology tests. This gap in infrastructure prompted the Government of India in its collaborative efforts to set up newly designated laboratories. We conclude from the current scenario and our experience that we should be prepared beforehand to tackle another such unfortunate situation in the future by setting up new laboratories as per the population needs and to upgrade the present laboratories with state-of-the-art diagnostic modalities. The government should also plan to develop indigenous equipment to make India self-dependent and to decrease the economic burden on our healthcare system. Healthcare workers should be trained in the techniques by including it as a part of their curricula and conducting various workshops and continuing medical education (CME) programs at regular intervals to update their knowledge.",
