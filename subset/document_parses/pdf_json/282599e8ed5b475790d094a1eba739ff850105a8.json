Overall, the US CDC N1 RT-dPCR and RT-qPCR assays had the lowest ALODs (< 10 GC/reaction) and PLODs (<3,954 GC/50 mL; 95% probability of detection) regardless of the seeding level and model used. Nevertheless, consistent amplification and detection rates decreased when seeding levels were < 2.32 \u00d7 10 3 GC/50 mL even for these assays. Consequently, when SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations are expected to be low, it may be necessary to improve the positive detection rates of wastewater surveillance by analyzing additional field and RT-PCR replicates.

The authors recommended the CCDC N assay for its high sensitivity and reproducibility when analysing plasmid control material, plasmid-seeded wastewater, and real wastewater samples.

Gamma radiation was administered with a 50 kilogray or 5 Mrad dose using an MDS Nordion Irradiator.

            "text": "Wastewater surveillance is being utilized in many countries to monitor coronavirus disease 2019 via severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA presence and levels in community wastewater. Prior to surveillance sampling, SARS-CoV-2 RNA excreted by infected individuals is diluted by many orders of magnitude in wastewater. Therefore, to achieve trace detection and quantification of RNA, the wastewater samples require the application of optimized concentration methods (with varying primary and/or secondary concentration steps) before extraction of the RNA fragments and, finally, highly-sensitive molecular assays using reverse transcription PCR positive stool sample. Serially-diluted RNA sub-samples were shared with participating laboratories to determine sensitivity. Most RT-qPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 examined in their study successfully detected ~5 GC/reaction, reflecting a high sensitivity. A reduced sensitivity was noted for the original RdRp assay from Charit\u00e9 Institute of Virology (Charit\u00e9), which may have impacted the confirmation of some COVID-19 cases in the early weeks of the pandemic. A study by Vogels et al. (2020) compared the performance of nine primer-probe combinations targeting several genes (i.e., E, N, ORF1, RdRp) recommended by the World Health Organization (e.g., those developed by the China CDC, US CDC, Charit\u00e9 (Corman et al., 2020) , and Hong Kong University). This comparison was performed with standard reference materials and clinical samples (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva, urine, and rectal swabs) seeded with the reference material. The authors demonstrated that at low viral concentrations (1 to 10 GC/\u00b5L), not all assays yielded positive results; thus, suggesting that some assays may be more prone to false-negative errors than others (Vogels et al., 2020) . Most notably, the RdRp reverse primer had mismatches with the reference material that were attributed to evolution of the virus, causing low analytical sensitivity.",

For wastewater surveillance, the analytical sensitivity of methods must also account for the efficiency of the various processing steps, including primary concentration, loss through nucleic acid extraction, and inhibition of reverse transcription or PCR amplification. Together the RT-qPCR/dPCR ALOD and the process recovery efficiency (loss of target through all sample processing steps) against their plasmid-seeded samples (Zhang et al., 2022) . However, the generalizability of such findings is constrained by several limitations. The RT-qPCR cycling parameters were the same for all assays and deviations from the optimized assay-specific cycling parameters may have affected the sensitivity of one assay compared to another. Furthermore, plasmid control materials, rather than SARS-CoV-2 virions, were seeded by Zhang et al. (2022) into RNA extracted from wastewater to determine the spiked mocks limit of detection using seeded wastewater. The use of plasmid control materials (which are double-stranded DNA) for SARS-CoV-2 (single-stranded RNA virus) has well documented limitations, including heterogeneity in PCR efficiencies and non-linearity for RT-qPCR experiments (Bivins et al., 2021a) .",

Given the complexities of such workflows, there are many factors that may contribute to false negative and erroneous results (wastewater negative despite the presence of COVID-19 in the relevant population), which are thoroughly discussed in several review articles (Ahmed et al., 2020b; Medema et al., 2020b; Michael-Kordatou et al., 2020; Ahmed et al., 2021a; Bivins et al., 2021a). Interpreting discordant results is further complicated by the many RT-PCR assays in use. Multiple assays have been developed targeting various nucleic acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 specific to the nucleocapsid (N), envelope protein (E), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), open reading frame one (ORF1), membrane protein (M), and surface protein (S) genes (Li et al., 2020). While these assays were developed for clinical testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples, they are also being used for wastewater surveillance (Bertrand et al., 2021; Bivins et al., 20201; Gibas et al., 2021; Navarro et al., 2021; Westhaus et al., 2021). Several studies have examined the analytical sensitivity, as measured by the assay limit of detection (ALOD), of various RT-qPCR assays primarily for clinical testing. For example, Igl\u00f3i et al. (2020) compared 13 commercially-available real-time RT-PCR assays using SARS-CoV-2 cellcultured virus stock. Analytical sensitivity of assays in the different kits varied between 3.3 to 330 RNA gene copies (GC)/reaction. Muenchhof et al.

Assuming a Poisson model for the distribution of target GC into PCR reactions, the theoretical 95% probability of detection used to determine ALODs and their estimated values vary widely between studies, even among wastewater surveillance studies for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Bivins et al., 2021a). For example, during wastewater surveillance in Virginia using droplet dPCR (ddPCR), Gonzalez et al. (2020) determined ALODs using 60% probability of detection (N1 = 14.6 GC/reaction). While, in northern Indiana, Bivins et al. (2021b), using the same ddPCR platform, estimated the ALOD using 95% probability of detection (N1 = 3.3 GC/reaction). ALODs reported in the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance literature have ranged from 1 GC/reaction (Gerrity et al. 2021), to 50 GC/reaction (Randazzo et al. 2021), up to as high as 100 GC/reaction (Chavarria-Mir\u00f3 et al. 2021). However, it should be noted that the control materials and statistical methods used to estimate the ALODs are not consistent from one study to another.In the current study, we have determined the ALOD for each RT-qPCR/dPCR assay using an exponential survival model(Verbyla et al. 2016). The exponential survival model deviates from the Poisson by incorporating a probability, r, that when the target is present describes the probability of \"survival\" of the target throughout the entire analytical workflow (Poisson assumes r = 1.0) to be successfully detected, so the estimated ALOD increases above the Poisson by the inverse of r ([-ln1-0.95]/r). The observed ALODs of the RT-qPCR assays suggest that the \"survival\" probabilities deviate from 1 with the CDC N1 assay demonstrating the highest survival probability (3/9.5 = 0.32) andE_Sarbeco demonstrating the lowest (3/48.1 = 0.06). Conversely, the RT-dPCR US CDC N1 assay probability of survival of 0.91 (3/3.3) was the closest to 1. These results suggest that for the RT-qPCR assays there are sources of error that reduce the detection probability even when a copy of the target has a high probability of having been added to the reaction well (according to the Poisson distribution). The sources of error could include inhibition associated with the matrix or inefficiency of the PCR reaction in amplifying the control material. In the current study, RNA extracted from gammairradiated SARS-CoV-2 was used as the control material, so inhibition is expected to be minimal.",

For clinical samples, the results of pure reverse-transcribed RNA transcript standards and seeded samples were different for CCDC-N and CCDC-ORF1ab(Vogels et al., 2020). This indicates that the comparison of RT-qPCR assays should be performed for relevant matrices, such as clinical and wastewater samples. The PLOD is the matrix-relevant limit of detection incorporating the inefficiencies of the entire workflow. Determination of PLOD is not common practice in research literature, especially for wastewater samples, but has been conducted for microbial source tracking marker genes, pathogens, and indicator viruses in surface and drinking water samples(Stokdyk et al., 2016; Symonds et al., 2016; Staley et al., 2012; Verbyla et al., 2016; Ahmed et al., 2018). In this study, we determined PLOD values of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by seeding known concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples using five different RT-qPCR and one RT-dPCR assays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the SARS-CoV-2 PLOD for wastewater and provides insights on the analytical limitations for trace detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. For PLOD determination, we used 36 different wastewater samples collected from 36 WWTPs representing varying wastewater characteristics. For seeding values >2.32 \u00d7 10 4 GC/50 mL, all 18 wastewater samples and PCR replicates were positive by each assay RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR assays suggesting at these seeding levels, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater may be quite straightforward using the combination of adsorption extraction and the Power Water RNeasy Kit. However, with seeding values <2.32 \u00d7 10 3 GC/50 mL, detection rates decreased with the lowest detection rates observed at the seeding level of 2.32 \u00d7 10 3 GC. At these two seeding levels, consistent amplification was not observed by all RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR assays. Interestingly, the CDC N1 assay outperformed other assays regarding detection sensitivity. The superior performance of CDC N1 assays compared to other assays has been reported in research literature (Ahmed et al., 2021c; Chavarria-Mir\u00f3 et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2021; Pecson et al., 2021; P\u00e9rez-Catalu\u00f1a et al., 2021). Our findings also corroborate with a recent study that suggested US CDC N1 is suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater with low COVID-19 prevalence (Zhang et al., 2022). The performance of US CDC N1 RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR were similar, however, RT-dPCR yielded more positive replicates than RT-qPCR. The increased sensitivity of RT-dPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater compared to RT-qPCR has also been reported (Ahmed et al., 2021c; Ciesielski et al., 2021; Graham et al. 2020). These findings clearly suggest that sub-sampling error is ., 2021b), which could introduce false negative errors in RNA detection (Taylor et al., 2019).Furthermore, factors such as stochastic amplification, measurement uncertainty, variability in virus concentration and RNA extraction methods, inefficient RT-qPCR, and stochastic levels of inhibitors could affect the PLOD and the reproducibility of results.If the objective of the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance is early detection of COVID-19 cases in a community, then the factors mentioned above, and associated variabilities should be carefully considered by analytical laboratories and public health units. Every amplification, whether it is reproducible between replicates or not, or even with a Cq value >40 should be considered as potential positive (given appropriate negative results in all negative controls) and reported to the relevant agencies. For a virus such as SARS-CoV-2, which is highly contagious, it may be better to be overly cautious to effectively manage outbreaks. The results of this study also highlight the importance of modelling detection limits in PCR-based methods as probabilities rather than fixed limits. This approach has been described previously to determine the ALOD (Verbyla et al., 2016; Forootan et al., 2017), but we have now applied it to determine the PLOD. Considering the loss of SARS-CoV-2 RNA throughout the sample concentration and analysis process and the observation that the survival of the target during the PCR process is frequently less than 100%, using a modelling approach can help determine a laboratory's probability of detecting the target when the concentrations are very low.

The acceptable variation in PCR-based quantification systems has been formalized as the limit of quantification (ALOQ); however, allowable variation is debated with proposed CV threshold values from 25% to 35% (Klymus et al., 2019; Kralik and Ricchi, 2017; Forootan et al., 2017). For wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA the intrinsic and workflow-derived variability remains largely uncharacterized due to limited method replication and the relationship between an ALOQ derived via control materials and idealized matrices and actual wastewater samples remains uncertain (McClary-Gutierrez et al., 2021a; Medema et al., 2020).",
