This is due to the fact that it particularly relevant here to highlight all the hidden features and not just the more significant ones as in classical scenarios, where most features are shared and than can be considered as noise.

The topic is to recognize which pathology is likely to be involved in analyzing patient session output. The idea is to compare typed words with those that the model of a certain pathology produces, in order to evaluate the likelihood that the patient is affected by that pathology. Preliminary experiments show that the approach is promising.",
