Neutralizing antibodies constitute a highly promising approach for treating and preventing infection by this novel pathogen. In the present study, we characterize and further evaluate the recently identified human monoclonal MD65 antibody for its ability to provide protection against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Eighty percent of the untreated mice succumbed 6-9 days post-infection, while administration of the MD65 antibody as late as 3 days after exposure rescued all infected animals. In addition, the efficiency of the treatment is supported by prevention of morbidity and ablation of the load of infective virions in the lungs of treated animals. The data demonstrate the therapeutic value of human monoclonal antibodies as a life-saving treatment for severe COVID-19 infection.",

Neutralizing Abs constitute a highly promising approach for treating and preventing infection by the novel SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 6 ). The viral surface spike glycoprotein is essential for viral attachment, fusion, and entry into human cells, and thus considered as the major target for therapeutic neutralizing Abs [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Specifically, highly potent neutralizing Abs target and block the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) located in the S1 subunit of the spike to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) 7, 10, 14 .",

The initial binding and neutralization characterization of MD65 Ab were conducted following the expression of this Ab as a single-chain human-Fc recombinant form (scFv-Fc) 11 . Here, towards implementation of this Ab as a bona fide therapeutic product appropriate for human use, it was re-cloned and produced as a full recombinant IgG molecule of the IgG1/k isotype which includes the triple mutation M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) in the Fc region. These modifications increase the Ab affinity towards the human FcRn 33 at acidic pH and thereby prolong its serum half-life, a parameter that is essential for a high therapeutic value [34] [35] [36] . Characterization of three versions of the MD65 Ab: scFv-Fc, IgG, and IgG-YTE, established that overall they are comparable with regard to their antigen-binding performance (Fig. 1a) and that the IgG versions exhibit slightly favorable affinity when compared to the scFv-Fc one (apparent K D of 0.7 versus 1.0 nM, respectively). Similarly, the two MD65 IgG formats possess equivalent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization potency in vitro (NT 50 of 40 ng/ml), which is slightly better than that of the scFv-Fc Ab (NT 50 of 67 ng/ml; Fig. 1b ). In addition, all three Ab versions were shown to effectively prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD to the hACE2, again with favorable kinetics for the IgG formats (Fig. 1c) . These slight differences may indicate that there is a correlation between Ab affinity and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. This aspect will be further clarified in future studies.",

Accordingly, the interactions of MD65 IgG and IgG-YTE with human FcRn, at pH 6.0, were assessed by biolayer interferometry (BLI). As expected, the modified Ab demonstrated a marked increase in affinity compared to the non-modified version, manifested by a threefold improved on-rate and significant lower off-rate of binding (Fig. 2a, b) . Steady-state analysis of these interactions revealed that the overall affinity of the IgG-YTE version toward human FcRn at low pH is 10-fold higher than the IgG version (Fig. 2c) .",

SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 mice is manifested by a progressive and widespread viral pneumonia with perivascular and pan-alveolar inflammation, immune cell infiltration, edema, lung consolidation, and distinctive vascular system injury that were apparent even 3 weeks after infection (in surviving animals) 26, 29, 40 . Here, the observation that post-exposure Abbased treatment of infected mice resulted in complete protection with no apparent signs of disease has prompted characterization of the pathological status of their lungs. To this end, mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2, treated with MD65 2 days later, and necropsy was performed at day 21. Overall, no major pathological changes or signs of inflammation were found in the lungs of the Ab-treated mice (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). The only indication of previous viral infection is the presence of scarce lymphoid aggregates that are well contained (Fig. 4d) . It was previously reported that in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 model, B cells infiltrated into the lungs, accumulated, and formed aggregates 29 . It is therefore conceivable to assume that the lymphoid aggregates observed here contain B cells that were recruited during the initial accumulation of the virus in the lungs, within the first days after infection. Thus, the effective Ab treatment that inhibited the virus ability to propagate have also prevented the progression of the inflammatory process, as strongly suggested by the infrequent occurrence of pathological changes in the lung and the alveolar tissue. These results substantiate the notion that post-exposure Ab treatment of lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly effective, rapidly neutralizes the virus propagation, and limits the inflammatory and the pathological progression.",

Interestingly, the prophylactic administration of the MD65 Ab prevented the mounting of the humoral response, suggesting that effective neutralization of the virus occurred immediately upon infection (Fig. 5a) . In contrast, animals treated either 1 or 2 days post-infection developed a marked Ab response that is in good correlation with the time of treatment. As several studies have shown that most SARS-CoV-2neutralizing Abs target the S1 subunit and even more specifically the RBD, the humoral responses of the Ab-treated mice toward these two antigens was further evaluated. Indeed, a similar pattern was observed for these two antigens as for the spike (Fig. 5b, c) , suggesting that the endogenous Ab response may contain SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing Abs that will confer partial or full protection against re-infection. Determination of the neutralization titer of these samples could provide further support for this concept, yet such an experiment is complicated by the masking effect of residual MD65 Ab.",
