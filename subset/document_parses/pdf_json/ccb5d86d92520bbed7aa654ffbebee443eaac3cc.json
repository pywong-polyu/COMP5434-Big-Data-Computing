Different chaperones possess distinct modes of substrate recognition that determine their substrate range and specificity [6]. Among them the ubiquitous 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family of chaperones is shown to be associated with plethora of misfolded and aggregated substrates, possibly selecting their targets for proteasomal or autophagy degradation. The Hsp70's activity, in turn, is regulated by a number of cofactors and cochaperones, together functioning as a 'machine' [7] . For instance, J-proteins prime the Hsp70's folding property by selecting and supplying the substrate to Hsp70 and also stimulate the Hsp70's ATPase activity, whereas nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) promote the exchange of ADP with ATP, to accelerate the cyclic reaction [8] .

Among them the mostly widely understood are the model substrates processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. The cellular organelle ER is the most crowed environment in the cell performing diverse cellular roles. Any dysfunction in the ER activity leads to accumulation of misfolded and/or unfolded proteins. Cells maintain ER proteostasis by deploying diverse array of ER-resident chaperones and enzymes, which process their client by correcting or priming them to degradative pathways. For example, in the case of misfolded secretory protein carboxypeptidase mutant CPY* and nonglycosylated pro-a-factor, the ER lumen Hsp70 called binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and its associated cochaperones efficiently process the misfolded proteins for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (Fig. 1, Step 3 & 4) [9].

Cells counteract these aggregates by sequestering them in special cytoplasmic quality control compartment (Fig. 1, Step 6) for refolding or autophagic degradation (Fig. 1, Step 7) [12]. Partitioning of misfolded proteins into compartments is an organized process that appears to be conserved from yeast to mammalian cells.

Unsurprisingly, due to its complex organization, error in membrane protein synthesis, assembly, and delivery is associated with several diseases such as cystic fibrosis, retinitis pigmentosa, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, Another key question is how the protein quality control deals with the aggregated membrane proteins. Similar to soluble PQC compartments, increasing evidence indicates the existence of quality control structures for membrane proteins [24], but the formation and composition of these structures are poorly characterized. Recent studies have implicated requirement of certain PQC factors for the formation of these structures, including chaperones (Hsp70, DnaJB, Bag3), molecular motors, microtubules, and microtubule-associated factors (histone deacetylase; HDAC6) [25, 26] . However, the basic formation mechanism of these structures is vague. Moreover, the manners in which substrates are recognized and targeted to aggresomes leading to autophagy are not known. Recent studies have supported the notion of ER membrane chaperones playing pivotal role in recognition and fate of aberrant clients. For instance, membrane-localized J-protein B12 along with cytosolic Hsp70 is reported as a potential factor for membrane client recognition [27, 28] .

Polyomavirus family is the most studied nonenveloped virus whose host entry is well understood. During entry, the virus reaches the ER from the cell surface and co-opts ERAD factors to reach cytosol. Specifically, the PDI family of enzymes reduces and isomerizes the viral disulfide bonds that often expose hydrophobic epitopes [32, 33] . These changes partially disassemble the virus and the particle now mimics a giant misfolded protein aggregate, which now recruits Hsp70 homolog BiP and its luminal cochaperones [34, 35] . The restructured, hydrophobic virus is primed for membrane penetration, by exploiting molecular motor kinesin-1 to drive the reorganization of ER membrane chaperone B14 to form the virus membrane penetration site, called 'focus' [36] . The focus-localized virus is then extracted from the membrane by a B14-tethered cytosolic disaggregation machinery (B14, Hsc70, and Hsp110), consequently reaching the cytosol [37] . In summary, studies on polyomavirus have unraveled the interplay of host PQC components in the ER lumen, ER membrane, and the cytosol. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the entry and disassembly of human papillomavirus (HPV). For instance, several studies have proposed HPV reaching ER during host entry and utilizing ERresident PDI family proteins [38] .

For instance, during Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, virus induces ER membrane rearrangement to form a viral replication factory. Although, several chaperones (Hsp70, Hsp90, and calnexin) are implicated to play a role in virus replication, the exact composition and mechanism of replication factory formation is poorly defined and proposed to be closely related to PQC [42] .

More importantly, the role of Hsp70 at each step is specified by nine distinct DNAJ cofactors [43] .
