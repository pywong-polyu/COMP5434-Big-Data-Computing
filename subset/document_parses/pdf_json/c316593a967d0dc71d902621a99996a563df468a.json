Physical education teachers assist students in remaining mentally fit, raising the bar for making healthy choices in life, and developing character from childhood to adulthood. These educators provide opportunities for children, adolescents, and young adults to develop skills, build confidence, and understand the value of mental and physical health. In a report based on a Twitter survey of teachers and senior managers, Speck (2020) asserted. 49% of respondents indicated that they were stressed and anxious about the possibility of contracting coronavirus. Additionally, the report compares a study in which 35% of teachers reported increased stress and anxiety as a result of their preparedness for homework.",

The automated classroom has been the critical choice for institutional partners in responding to the crisis, ensuring that students' lessons begin. Since foreign organizations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) accepted national institutions such as the Human Resource Development (HRD), millions of schools and universities have moved their physical classrooms online to ensure that students' \"learning is never interrupted\" during the isolation condition (Sokolovskaya, 2020) .

Physical education instructors instructing practical lessons via computer screen made no sense and lacked credibility in terms of implication and comprehension by the students (Mijaica, 2017) . While teachers were willing to conduct daily online lessons, they expressed concern and emphasized that most students come from disadvantaged communities and vulnerable groups that lack internet access (Stephen Christena, 2020) .

Distance learning's ongoing Pandemic increases stress in physical education, which is typically based on practical and skill-based understanding; teachers worldwide struggle to cope with new problems while exhausted and drained (Varea and Gonz alez-Calvo, 2020) . Teachers' fatigue is a result of dynamic uncertainty. Teachers work to equip themselves and incorporate new technology into their classrooms. They revise or redesign lessons and experiment with new ways of doing things, such as assigning homework, responding to emails, texts, and phone calls from administrators, parents, and students (Collie and Martin, 2016) . They serve as a resource and connection for ongoing learning. Numerous teachers struggle to balance their family obligations and teaching responsibilities in the face of growing coronavirus fears. Stress and anxiety together can alter the brain in ways that make the already stressful teaching job even more tolerable (Oducado et al., 2021) . The abrupt transition to new home teaching requirements, compounded by coronavirus fears, creates trauma that can shift the brain from higher-order thinking to survival mode (The COVID-19 Pandemic, 2021). Ironically, physical education teachers are being pushed to convert their classes to the virtual model to maintain social distancing.",

However, psychologists have suggested that a more apt term might be 'physical distance' (\"Let's Aim for Physical,\" 2021). This physical separation from others was a requirement that needed to be met, but not social space. Social support for everyone's well-being is critical now, as it has always been (Waldinger, 2021) . It has been observed that teachers who have positive relationships with their students and colleagues report higher job satisfaction and public life satisfaction (Rebecca Collie, 2021) .

Nonetheless, the degree to which individuals can adapt to changes in stress, anxiety, social support, and sexual satisfaction is contingent on their adaptability, thoughts, behaviours, and emotions to deal with rapidly changing or unpredictable situations (Prasanna et al., 2020) . Typically, a teaching career entails various events and activities classified as a novel, changeable, or uncertain. To name a few: teachers must adapt to students' changing needs during a lesson, adjust to unexpected student behavioural situations, and alter their teaching plans in response to schedule changes (Teaching Through a Pandemic, 2021). Not only have teachers' responses to students' situations changed, but the Pandemic has also harmed teachers' normal sexual relationships with their partners.",

Regardless, these actions were critical in limiting COVID-19 spread, as the disease is spread through close contact. To minimize the reach of this infectious virus, everyone can limit their contact 'bubble. ' Regardless, people rely on social interaction with their immediate family, acquaintances, employers, and neighbours, as well as individuals they meet through various interests and recreational activities.

Social contact and support have been shown to help reduce stress, depression, anxiety, and isolation and boost self-esteem, normalcy, wellbeing, and overall quality of life (Agbaria and Mokh, 2021) . In comparison, a deficiency of social support has the inverse effect (Baqutayan, 2011) .

Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised the public to stay at home and avoid as much social and physical contact as possible in order to prevent the disease from spreading (\"Advice COVID-19 -World Health Organization\", 2021). This implies that the majority of people were restricted in various ways, that borders were closed, that freedom of travel was limited, and that more people were quarantined or isolated. Due to the Pandemic's unprecedented nature and future uncertainties, movement is restricted and is considered a long-term state of affairs (Rita Amelinda, 2020).

It is made up of an archipelago of over 332 islands, 110 of which are permanently inhabited. Fiji is roughly halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, and its immediate neighbours include Vanuatu, Tonga, and Samoa. Fiji is a multiracial country with a population of just over 800,000. Fiji has 172 secondary schools and 700 primary schools with a combined total of approximately 13000 teachers (MEHA, 2021). The present study considered the aforementioned number of teachers. The sample for the study was generated using the Krejcie and Morgan Table (Morgan, 1970) , which was developed by the National Education Association's research division. The formula was followed by a table that the researchers used (Moc ana\u0219u, 2020). Thus, the study sampled 375 Physical Education and sports teachers. Random cluster sampling was used to select participants for the study because it is one of the sampling methods used to represent the population in light of the Fiji Islands' geographical location (Etikan, 2017) . Fiji is divided into four divisions that serve as clusters for sample collection. Each cluster has an average of 94 instructors selected at random for the study. The researcher focused exclusively on physical education and sports teachers because that is the researcher's area of interest, and little research has been conducted on the impact of COVID-19 on various factors affecting Fiji's physical education and sports teachers.",

            "text": "The difference in age results for physical education and sports teachers in secondary schools reveals no statistically significant difference in age when Coronavirus Anxiety (CA), Stress with COVID-19 (SC), Social Supports (SSS), and Sex Satisfaction are considered (SS). However, when young teachers were compared to other groups, they reported lower levels of social support satisfaction. Nonetheless, they experienced more sexual pleasure than young adults; young adults, on average, experienced more sexual pleasure, significant anxiety, and stress (Melin M.F. Ali et al. Heliyon 7 (2021 ) e07860 et al. 2003 ). Males and females had similar standards, but males had higher means for social satisfaction. COVID-19 affected all teachers, regardless of their age or gender. Additionally, the COVID-19 Pandemic has had a profound impact on the lives of everyone. Numerous people are confronted with difficulties that are stressful, overwhelming, and elicit strong emotions in both adults and children. While public health measures such as social distancing are necessary to halt the spread of COVID-19, they have the potential to make us feel isolated and lonely and to exacerbate stress and anxiety (\"COVID-19 and Your Health\", 2021). By contrast, sexual pleasure is a significant factor in individual and group differences, possibly contributing to a higher level of fulfilment for people in relationships (Lehmann et al., 2015) . There is a dearth of information regarding sexual satisfaction, including how individuals' sexual satisfaction is aggregated and whether satisfaction varies by age difference (Flynn et al., 2016) . Sexual content was found to be more prevalent in young adults and the elderly. This conclusion is consistent with prior research indicating a lower level of sexual satisfaction among partners (Baumeister et al., 2001) . While there were differences between young teachers and adults observed in conjunction with the finding, which was confirmed by previous research, another study suggested the opposite (Lee, 2020) . Although there are no comparative studies of these variables across cultures, the results indicate that social and cultural factors have a positive effect (Wadley, 2020) . Additionally, there were significant differences in stress, anxiety, social support, and sexual satisfaction during the COVID-19 lockdown for SCS, and SS (F \u00bc 6.740, 12.070, 32.656. Sig. \u00bc .010, 001, and.000) for single and married participants, respectively. The mean scores for psychological parameters such as CAS appear to be nearly identical; however, while married couples scored higher on SCS, SSS, and social support, single teachers scored high. The marital physical education teachers were under a lot of stress, as they have a greater responsibility to the family and are responsible for children (Litzinger and Gordon, 2005 ). They had a high level of sex satisfaction because they spent more time with their family while on lockdown, as opposed to a single man who would naturally do so (Karata\u015f et al., 2021) . Sexual and marital satisfaction is the primary factor that influences stress and anxiety. It establishes the norms for interpersonal relationships between individuals and married couples (Bodenmann et al., 2006) . There is marital joy, which increases marital satisfaction and safeguards the family through social interactions with family and extended group members (Bradbury and Karney, 2004) . In a study conducted in Turkey on the effects of the global COVID-19 Pandemic on couples' sexual lives, researchers observed an increase in the severity of anxiety, depression, and stress perception, as well as an increase in sexual dysfunctions in male and female volunteers (Karag\u20ac oz et al., 2020) . These findings corroborated those from China regarding the decline in sexual functions and psychological disorders (Lu et al., 2020) .",

There were no significant differences in sexual satisfaction, social support anxiety, or mental health between genders in this study. This, however, contradicts the finding that male and female physical education and sports teachers in Fiji had a relationship with their stress levels. Female educators faced greater pressure than male educators (Prasanna et al., 2020) . Additionally, the results corroborate findings from pacific studies, which indicate that there is no correlation between males and females in western Fiji when it comes to stress. According to the survey, all teachers have encountered varying degrees of stress at some point in their careers, whether moderate, mild, or severe (Ahsan 2006) . The COVID-19 outbreak instils fear in the populace, particularly in affected countries, and the media play a significant role in escalating mental distress (Dachen 2017) . For instance, since the disease's spread, some organizations have used the phrase \"end of the world,\" causing increased concern (Koh, 2020) . Although the government identified a small number of cases of border transmission in Fiji, it still instilled fear in many. When a patient's voice is heard, people's anxiety level increases. The anxiety manifested itself in a variety of ways, for example, through panic buying, which resulted in a bizarre shopping spree of hoarding toilet paper (Kundra, 2020) . This was observed in community transmission cases that emerged in 2021, resulting in additional lockdowns and panic. The persistence of the increase in cases and its effect on the factors analyzed can be investigated further.",

Living in a stressful situation, such as financial insecurity, family disruption, trauma, or loss, or, of course, the current COVID-19 Pandemic, can undoubtedly trigger the worsening of depression and anxiety symptoms. Self-care is frequently difficult to maintain during times of crisis. Because many of us are preoccupied with containing the fires in our lives, we are frequently too exhausted to engage in mindful eating, exercise, or other refuelling activities (\"Policy Recommendations During the COVID-19 Pandemic Internet Society\", 2021). During this Pandemic, it is suggested delegating chores to others, limiting oneself to one self-soothing activity per day, such as taking a bath, drinking a cup of tea, napping, or practising 5 min of deep breathing. While many people will be unable to resume their prepandemic exercise routines, some form of physical activity at home is necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Regular exercise can still be beneficial for your mental health, even if it is as simple as taking a daily walk or spending five minutes stretching or performing yoga poses. Hobbies such as gardening can also be considered exercise. On the other hand, school leaders can foster a collegial, supportive climate within their schools, thereby increasing teacher engagement and effectiveness. Schools require policies that either support or obstruct the development of a healthy school environment and effective teacher performance. The education department shall provide teachers with opportunities for professional development in order to enhance their own social and emotional competence. Teachers will benefit from stress management programs that help them develop coping and awareness skills, as well as reduce anxiety and depression and improve their health. Schools can implement workplace wellness programs to reduce health risks, health care costs, and teacher absenteeism.",

During the epidemic, more support from spouses and mutual understanding would reduce sex satisfaction. The other means that by using social media and encouraging one another during the lockdown and social distance, teachers' stress will be reduced. Physical education and sports teachers would benefit from a lower teacher-tostudent ratio. It will alleviate stress and anxiety by allowing for adequate social distance during the practical class. According to the findings, the assistance of stakeholders is required to reduce the effects of anxiety and stress on people who follow the recommendations. The current study has a number of limitations, including a small sample size and parameters that could be investigated and researched further.",
