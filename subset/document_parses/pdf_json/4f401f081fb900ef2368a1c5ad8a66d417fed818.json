            "text": "Purpose Cancer caregiving is shown to be a burdensome experience in typical times. The purpose of this study was to describe cancer caregivers' emotional, physical, and financial strain during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared to preCOVID-19, and explore racial and ethnic variations in caregiver strain. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional online survey using Lucid, LLC, incorporating quotas for race, ethnicity, gender and age. Caregivers had to be adults living in the USA and currently providing unpaid care to an adult cancer patient (i.e., during COVID-19) and prior to the pandemic. We assessed the caregivers' emotional, physical, and financial strain and asked them to compare to preCOVID-19 caregiving. Analyses included descriptive and linear regression adjusting for sociodemographic and caregiving-related variables. Results A total of 285 caregivers met eligibility, and most were nonHispanic white (72.3%) and female (59.6%). Based on a scale of \"1: Much lower\" to \"5: Much higher\", the financial, physical and emotional strain/stress experienced by caregivers compared to preCOVID-19 was, on average, 3.52 (SD: 0.82; range: 1-5) for financial strain, 3.61 (SD: 0.86; range: 1-5) for physical strain, and 3.88 (SD: 0.89; range: 1-5) for emotional stress. NonHispanic black caregivers were significantly more likely than nonHispanic white caregivers to indicate that caregiving-related financial strain was higher than preCOVID-19. Moreover, Hispanic caregivers compared to nonHispanic white caregivers reported caregiving-related emotional stress was higher than preCOVID-19. Conclusion These findings suggest a need to be attentive to racial and ethnic variations in emotional and financial strain and provide targeted support in clinical care and via public policy during a public health crisis.",

In addition to formal health professionals, relatives, or friends of cancer patients are essential in patient care as they provide many and varied tasks [2] . This cancer caregiving experience is well-known to be demanding, and, as such, most caregivers experience physical and psychosocial health deficits [2] [3] [4] . Compared to noncaregivers, caregivers in general are shown to experience poorer physical health [5, 6] and psychosocial outcomes, including sleep disruption and heightened emotional stress [2, 5, [7] [8] [9] . Caregivers also report using more emergency health services than noncaregivers and engage in poorer health behaviors (e.g., smoking) [7] . Furthermore, as caregivers provide support to a patient or care recipient, their well-being can have reciprocal implications on the care recipient [10, 11] .",

Thus, it is important to assess caregiver well-being during crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, to provide immediate assistance. It is also plausible that caregivers who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups might be more vulnerable to strain given the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on US racial and ethnic minorities [12, 13] . More specifically, the adverse burden of COVID-19 is especially evident among black and Hispanic individuals [12, 13] . Such disparities are due in large part to pervasive structural inequalities, including limited access to preventive services and less opportunity and lower ease in complying with physical distancing recommendations because of factors such as higher community density or employment necessity and conditions [13, 14] . Thus, similar to the trends with COVID-19 in society, it is possible that cancer caregivers' burden during COVID-19 will also vary by race and ethnicity.",

The caregivers' physical, emotional and financial strain/ stress was assessed using the National Alliance for Caregiving and the AARP questions included in their Caregiving in the U.S. national surveys and reports [22, 23] . Participants responded to three questions about financial, physical and emotional stress/strain (\"How emotionally/physically/financially straining or stressful is caregiving for you?; Likert response of 1: not at all-5: very much). We also asked caregivers how their current emotional, physical, and financial stress/strain levels compared to preCOVID-19 caregiving. They were asked three separate questions for physical/financial/ emotional strain: \"Compared to providing care prior to COVID-19, my [emotional stress/physical strain/financial strain] level now is: 1: much lower; 2: somewhat lower; 3: the same; 4: somewhat higher; or 5: much higher. These questions were developed to mirror the NAC/AARP questions about physical, financial, and emotional stress/strain. A higher rating indicates a greater impact of COVID-19 on caregiving strain/stress.",

Of these caregivers expressing scores of 6 or above, 42.6% were in the range of severe distress (8 or above). Caregiving burden was also elevated, as the ZBI-12 mean score in the current sample was higher than that reported for a sample of cancer caregivers providing care for patients with advanced disease [16] . Scoring for quality of life (CQOL) mirrored other findings in terms of suggesting adverse impact of cancer caregiving during COVID-19. The overall CQOL mean was low but slightly higher (better) (62.85) than reported previously among a small sample of cancer caregivers of patients receiving hospice care (61.5) [21] . Furthermore, the CQOL domains for our sample of caregivers ranged from 60.5 to 65.3, with each being slightly higher (better) than that reported in the literature with exception of the social QOL domain [21] . This finding is particularly relevant given the likelihood of social distancing due to COVID-19, and suggests a need to focus on ways to improve social interactions for caregivers. This might include virtual support groups or encouraging caregivers to connect with others in ways that does not require face-to-face interaction. Though limited, some evidence suggests that online support groups can benefit caregivers in varying contexts (e.g., dementia and oncology) [24, 25] . Finally, the ZBI-12 mean score was higher than that reported for a sample of cancer caregivers providing care for patients with advanced disease [16] . Of even greater concern are our findings that racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately experiencing heightened financial strain (nonHispanic black caregivers) and emotional stress (Hispanic caregivers) as cancer caregivers during COVID-19. These findings reflect the broader disparity of COVID-19 within society in that nonHispanic black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to express being adversely impacted [12, 13] .",

With respect to emotional stress of caregivers, at least one previous report notes that cancer caregivers and noncancer caregivers are rarely asked about their own needs. Specifically, according to findings of a report by the NAC, slightly over half (54%) of cancer caregivers had been asked by clinicians whether they needed information to care for the patient, and even fewer (29%) reported being asked if they needed information to care for themselves [2] . Given reduced social interactions due to COVID-19, the clinical context, including virtual, is likely a critical contact point for cancer caregivers to connect with others and receive support. Thus, during this crisis, it seems especially important that the patient's care team consider the well-being of the caregivers by involving the caregiver and assessing his/her needs not only in patient-care but also in selfcare.",

            "text": "Strategies to identify caregivers allow caregivers to convey their needs, and receive support are driven largely by clinical recommendations and state policy. For example, in 2001, the Institutes of Medicine recognized caregivers as an essential part of an older adult's care team [26, 27] , and, recently, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) highlighted a need for person-and family-centered care [28] . These recommendations align with state-level statutes designed to identify and train caregivers at hospital discharge (i.e., the Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable-C.A.R.E-Act) [29] . Furthermore, implementing routine assessment of survivors' needs and caregivers' needs is named as a priority area by Alfano and colleagues [30] in their article on equitably improving outcomes for cancer survivors and supporting caregivers. Though mostly exploratory in terms of acceptability and feasibly assessments, there are increasing examples of clinicbased efforts to assess distress among caregivers in the adult and pediatric oncology contexts [31] [32] [33] . Essential to meeting caregiver needs in clinic-based settings is an organizational shift toward patient and family-centered care [34, 35] and ongoing assessment of caregiver outcomes. Furthermore, as demonstrated by our findings, engaging caregivers in clinical care might be particularly vital for Hispanic caregivers given their relatively higher levels of emotional stress associated with caregiving during COVID-19 than prior. Factors contributing to this finding should be fully explored going forward. For example, in May, 2020, the NAC and AARP provided a snapshot of Hispanic caregivers based on their national data and report on caregivers in the US 2020 Report [22] . This report [36] noted that Hispanic caregivers, compared to nonHispanic whites, tended to be younger and were more often in high intensity care situations. Thus, incorporating communication about caregiving strains and needs within patient clinical interactions might be immediately beneficial for caregivers as a way to uncover factors contributing to elevated stress. Furthermore, this engagement and subsequent response must consider caregivers' cultural beliefs and values. In a recent editorial, Hooper and colleagues [37] noted the importance of recognizing community characteristics and providing culturally adapted services. This is an area of ongoing need and response in the clinical and caregiving fields. Furthermore, we also identified that the financial strain of caregiving during COVID-19 was high for approximately 3 in 10 of these caregivers, and this percentage was higher than previous reports of cancer caregivers and noncancer caregivers [2] . Again, we saw differences by race/ethnicity in that nonHispanic black cancer caregivers were significantly more likely than nonHispanic white caregivers to express that cancer caregiving-related financial strain during COVID-19 (the time of the survey) was perceived to be higher than preCOVID-19. Additional analyses are needed to understand the cause of this financial strain, such as employment strain, lack or loss of health insurance, health care cost even with insurance, or rent or mortgage-related strains. However, given the immediate crisis of COVID-19 and debate on financial support, these findings suggest that certain groups, including caregiving-related groups, might benefit from targeted financial assistance during COVID-19 through public policy efforts.",

            "text": "There are several limitations of this study. First, though online surveying is increasingly being conducted and a recognized strategy to identify nationwide samples quickly and at lower cost, online sampling still presents concerns. One concern with online surveying is an inability to confirm that an individual is indeed a caregiver as indicated. However, we employed several strategies to safeguard against this concern, including, as described in the methods, utilizing several eligibility screening questions that involved several response options as opposed to simply yes or no response with respect to caregiving and study eligibility. We included several eligibility requirements for the study rather than just indicating one was a cancer caregiver. We also assessed duration of time completing the survey and determined that none of the caregivers moved through the survey at what would be considered \"speeding,\" which is measured as completing the survey in a timeframe that is 1/3 of the median time for the sample. The cross-sectional nature of the data is less preferred than a longitudinal design, particularly with respect to comparing their current levels of caregiving-related physical, financial, and emotional stress/strain to preCOVID-19 caregiving. However, as COVID-19 is a crisis event and not something that could have been planned for in terms of study design, such analyses (longitudinal) are not feasible unless a study was already ongoing. Given the ongoing threat of COVID-19, it is suggested that those with access to caregiving data prior to COVID-19 consider conducting follow-up analyses to consider differences, including trend analyses. We also acknowledge that knowing if a patient or caregiver was COVID-19 positive would have provided further context of distress for this analysis. We also acknowledge the relatively small sample size of nonHispanic black and Hispanic respondents. However, these groups represent a good proportion of the sample overall (9.5% and 13.7%, respectively), and quota sampling was based on national findings of cancer caregivers from a nationally representative sample of caregivers [2] .",

Furthermore, this strain/stress is especially evident among non-Hispanic black caregivers (financial strain) and Hispanic caregivers (emotional stress). These findings mirror evidence in society in which racial and ethnic minority groups, particularly black and Hispanic individuals, are more likely to experience adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Given the crisis of this event and lack of time to study longterm, these findings (with aforementioned limitations) should be considered in terms of financial-related public policy to support caregivers as well as organizational (e.g., cancer center) policies to support and further engage caregivers to assess their needs and respond. Our ongoing research will continue to explore how changes in the situation of the caregiver (e.g., loss of employment, difficulties in accessing care) contribute to caregiver outcomes during times of a public health crisis.",
