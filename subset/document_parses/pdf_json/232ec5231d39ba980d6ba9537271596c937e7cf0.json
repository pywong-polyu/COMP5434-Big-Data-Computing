This risk is increased for patients in long term care facilities (LTCF), especially as they transition back and forth to emergency departments (ED).

Both LTCF and ED staff recognized that nurse communication has a critical role in both diagnosis and antibiotic utilization. Though providers have the final responsibility for diagnosis and prescribing decisions, providers often rely on the information collected (e.g. history and urine testing), interpreted, and delivered by the nurses to make those decisions. This is especially true in situations where the providers have not seen the patient, or have limited time for interaction.(Q2, Q3) The ED nurses also have a frontline role specifically in identifying UTI infections.(Q4) Communication Dynamics within Healthcare Settings", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "4 as well as a major contributor to inappropriate antibiotic use. 3 Increased prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, medical comorbidities, and cognitive impairments in the geriatric patient population are barriers to appropriate diagnosis and treatment of UTIs. 4, 5 While many antibiotics for UTIs are given to patients with symptoms, a significant number of antibiotics for UTIs are given for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nursing homes. 6 Asymptomatic bacteriuria has a point prevalence range between 20-50% in LTCFs. 7 Altered mental status, malaise, and lethargy do not increase the probability of infection in older adults in the ED. 8 Despite long-established understanding of the lack of association between these statuses and infection in older adults, 9 a culture of interpreting any change of condition in older adults as an underlying infection still persists in the current generation of providers and caregivers. 10 In fact, urinalyses (UAs) are not just ineffective for this populationthey contribute to antibiotic overprescribing. 11 The number of LTCF residents with complex health care issues is rising, 12 and LTCF residents with suspected infections often are referred to the ED. 13 The effects of misdiagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic use can extend beyond a single organization, affecting the risk of bacterial resistance in facilities and individuals throughout both the healthcare system and the local community. 14 Time pressures, incomplete information, poor knowledge of constantly updating diagnostic and treatment guidelines, facility-level policies, and federal guidelines all have an influence antibiotic prescribing decisions in the ED. 15 Additionally, interconnected psychological and behavioral factors drive UTI misdiagnosis in the ED. 15, 16 In LTCFs, antibiotic prescribing is influenced by many social and contextual factors, including nursing pressure, nursing gatekeeping, and family satisfaction. 17 Similarly, the CDC's Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship for Nursing Homes calls for leadership, accountability, and regular interpersonal feedback in addition to changes in diagnostic techniques and prescribing policies. 18 Building rapport and personal relationships over time to gain the trust of the local clinicians has been recognized as an important component of 5 successful antibiotic stewardship programs, 19 and local organizational culture is an important informer of prescriptions in LTCFs. 20 In addition to localized effects, LTCF residents who are treated in the ED are likely subject to combinatorial effects resulting from the interactions between the two organizations, but these effects that have not been well documented.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 66, "end": 67, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 264, "end": 266, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 267, "end": 268, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 440, "end": 441, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 521, "end": 522, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 640, "end": 641, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 762, "end": 763, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 927, "end": 929, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1049, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1124, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1202, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1443, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1673, "end": 1675, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1779, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1782, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1943, "end": 1945, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2172, "end": 2174, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2320, "end": 2321, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2366, "end": 2368, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2454, "end": 2456, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Nurses in particular have been identified as critical stewards of antibiotics due to the personal interactions they have with patients, families, physicians, and other nurses.

Potential LTCF participants were selected through purposeful criterion sampling. While we did not have a pre-specified number of participants needed per category, we specifically invited interested individuals to participate based on region in Wisconsin, setting (metro vs. non-metro), years of experience, and size of facility. In this way, we attempted to interview participants representing a range of demographic and setting characteristics. To recruit participants from EDs, the principal investigator sent email invites to groups of emergency physicians and nurses. The sample of ED participants was a convenience sample; however, we did include participants from different types of EDs (e.g. academic versus community, high versus low volume) with varying levels of clinical experience. We proceeded with sampling, data collection and preliminary data analysis concurrently and stopped data collection once participant responses became redundant, attempts to uncover new themes failed to reveal novel data and the study team deemed data saturation had been reached. 30 All participants received between $50-100 in appreciation of their time commensurate with their role and estimated hourly wage.

this is an overt area of focus in many facilities. Facilities have developed scripts to help nurses discuss patient assessments, diagnostic criteria and antibiotic prescribing decisions, including feedback on appropriateness, with physicians in real-time as opposed to a report card from the medical director once a year.(Q21) The scripts and tools used in these facilities have specifically helped nurses communicate effectively about ordering UAs and concerns regarding antibiotic prescriptions that are inconsistent with facility practice guidelines.(Q22, Q23) The informal, on-site education between health care professionals can be powerful tools in improving interpersonal communication, especially for those encountering and challenging power dynamics. LTCF nurses described the positive impact of nurse-to-nurse education on how to confidently speak to physicians regarding antibiotic deescalation and the decision to send a patient for an ED evaluation.(Q24, Q25, Q26) Developing trust within and across healthcare teams through a pattern of regular communication and longitudinal relationships can help improve coordination and standardization of care. LTCF nurses and medical directors described how their relationships with each other can improve antibiotic stewardship and ED utilization patterns.(Q27, Q28)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Characteristics of Participants and Participants' Practice SettingsWithin the ED, nurses routinely communicate with physicians before sending a UA, but sometimes UAs, and other tests or procedures, are sent without prior nurse-physician communication. Emergency physicians described trust in the ED nurses' decisions and approval over current ED nurse autonomy.(Q5, Q6, Q7)In contrast, LTCF nurses are required to report changes of conditions to primary care physicians (PCP) within pre-specified time frames. LTFC nurses described balancing the need to report changes in condition while also ensuring UAs were ordered appropriately by requiring nursesto contact the physician or confirm with their manager prior to ordering a UA.(Q8, Q9) Communication Dynamics across Healthcare Settings Both LTCF and ED nurses were often frustrated with the process of trying to communicate across settings. The communication across healthcare teams occurs primarily through phone communications if at happens at all. The LTCF staff described infrequently receiving a call from the ED staff about returning patients.(Q10)The ED nurses were similarly frustrated with the communication process because sometimes when they tried to call report it was difficult to identify and/or reach the nurse who was going to be receiving the patient upon transfer back to the LTCF.(Q11) While many LTCF and ED nurses expressed frustrations with communication, LTCF nurses who worked in non-metro areas had fewer communication issues due to increased familiarity with the providers. They described how because they worked in a small setting everyone routinely worked with each other, which promoted increased trust and willingness to listen to each other.(Q12) Emergency physicians described how LTCF nurses had a tendency to be deferential or nervous when talking to them, and suggested that14 it might be because of the power dynamic between the positions.(Q13) LTCF Directors of Nursing also acknowledge this power dynamic and said it did not just apply to emergency physicians but all physicians with whom the nurses interacted, and it was more common in less experienced nurses.(Q14)Communication Challenges in the Context of UTI Diagnosis and TreatmentIn this patient population, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, causing UTI prevalence to appear higher if diagnosis relies solely on UA results. LTCF staff described questioning the frequency and accuracy of UTI diagnosis and antibiotic utilization for residents treated in the ED.When LTCF nurses and infection preventionists encounter ED-prescribed antibiotics that they believe are inappropriate, they have to communicate with the resident's PCP to request deescalation. LTCF staff described encountering significant relationship barriers when communicating with physicians about deescalating an antibiotic that was prescribed by a different provider. LTCF staff described that despite their best efforts to educate providers, they often faced barriers to achieving appropriate deescalation.(Q17, Q18)Likewise, there were situations where physicians seemed to need confirmation from nurses in order to accept nurses' suggestions for best practice. LTCF staff described how word choice and communication style when providing feedback to PCPs had an effect on physician's decisions, including decisions to send a resident to the ED or to agree to deescalate antibiotics.(Q19, Q20)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Themes and exemplar quotes of importance of communication, roles, within and across teams and challenges specific to UTI diagnosis and treatment Q2.

I've talked across the state about this topic mostly to long-term care nurse audiences. Every place I talk, they ask this question.
