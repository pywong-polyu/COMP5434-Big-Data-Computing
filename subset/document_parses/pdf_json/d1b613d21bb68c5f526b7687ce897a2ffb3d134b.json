People suffer and die, the environment is polluted, and the threat of the nuclear demon is once again on the loose. And what can the attackers expect in return? Possibly a slight change in world order, and surely a generous bounty for the military industrial complex. Dear attackers, the only people that will profit from this war are already rich beyond comprehension. You are hurting yourselves, you are hurting others, and you are playing dice with the future of human race. Get to grips with reality! Stop the war! Less than a week since the beginning of war, the free world has united in various anti-war measures (BBC 2022). Unfortunately, the journal cannot join these immediate efforts due to the very nature of academic publishing. But I deeply believe that, when the guns beat, the muses must not remain silent. We need to understand our reality in order to change it for the better; this is why we urgently need to develop new postdigital approaches to the theory and practice of warfare.",

Casus belli, it seems, were Ukrainian attacks in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Lugansk (Council on Foreign Relations 2022). This is not the time or place to develop theories of what exactly triggered the war in Ukraine; this task needs to be left to future historians. Yet a postdigital approach, which is 'both a rupture in our existing theories and their continuation' (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018: 895) , requires us to expand traditional analyses towards new aspects of our reality. In the next few paragraphs, I will outline some ideas and directions in which postdigital thought may contribute to traditional theories of warfare and vice versa.",

Yet it is fair to say that quite a few armed conflicts, some of which can be classified as wars, take place as I write these words. For some reason, the war in Ukraine has overshadowed all recent wars in a blink of an eye. For instance, Switzerland's decision to impose sanctions against Russia has brought the country closest to violating its military neutrality since 1815! (He 2022) .",

The continuation part has been going on steadily since the beginning of recorded history, so we can reasonably speculate about close relationships between war and human nature. The rupture part is more complex. Is the war in Ukraine deemed so much more important than other wars because of its location in Europe? Because of the Russian threat to use nuclear weapons? Or because it is seen as a landmark event signalling changes in balance between global superpowers? Leaving these questions to the judgement of history, and without any downplaying of Ukraine's importance in global affairs, I cannot help but notice that the drums of war took less than a week to spread to the whole world. People are now talking about a clash of superpowers (Gordon 2022) and civilisations (Douthat 2022) , about a Third World War (Rubin 2022) , about a New World Order (Harris 2022) , and other grand schemes and concepts. The history books always identify the localized conflict as the spark for the later war. Now, there is almost a rush to be the one that identifies that spark.",

Can we use the concept of viral modernity to understand the spread of war drums beyond Ukraine and/or develop a suitable course of action against horrible predictions of global chaos and destruction?

In various forms from jamming pipelines to interference with elections, cyberwarfare has always been around (see Morrison 2022) . In our postdigital age, however, increasing interdependence between human beings and technologies makes cyberwarfare more dangerous than ever. Indirect forms of cyberwarfare, such as Russia's interference with Brexit (Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament 2020), are very different from direct forms of cyberwarfare such as jamming country's communications or interfering nuclear power plants (Findlay 2019) . In the long run, however, political decisions can have more serious consequences than explosions, and postdigital studies need to take all these forms of cyberwarfare seriously.",

Yet in our time of post-truth and fake news, impacts of misinformation are stronger and further reaching than ever (MacKenzie et al. 2021). As we recently say in the Covid-19 pandemic, a post-truth mediascape can divide people's attitudes even towards evidence-supported scientific truths such as the benefits of vaccination. Truths about the war, such as who started first and who killed whom, are irreducible to scientific experimentation and therefore even easier to manipulate. While the education community is predominantly focused on developing long-term solutions such as (post)-digital literacy, times of need desperately call for more immediate measures. Studies of post-truth and fake news are now more important than ever; to make themselves useful, they need to step down from the ivory tower and situate themselves as Freirean (1972) critical praxis.",
