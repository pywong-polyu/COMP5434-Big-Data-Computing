Using easy-to-apply questionnaires and scales (often by telephone interviewing), several studies evaluated samples of COVID-19 inpatients from 4 weeks to several months after discharge. However, studies conducting systematic multidisciplinary assessments of PASC manifestations are scarce, with thorough in-person objective evaluations restricted to modestly sized subsamples presenting greatest disease severity. Methods and analyses We will conduct a prospective observational study of surviving individuals (above 18 years of age) from a cohort of over 3000 subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were treated as inpatients at the largest academic health centre in Sao Paulo, Brazil (Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo). All eligible subjects will be consecutively invited to undergo a 1-2day series of multidisciplinary assessments at 2 timepoints, respectively, at 6-9 months and 12-15 months after discharge. Assessment schedules will include detailed multidomain questionnaires applied by medical research staff, self-report scales, objective evaluations of cardiopulmonary functioning, physical functionality and olfactory status, standardised neurological, psychiatric and cognitive examinations, as well as diagnostic laboratory, muscle ultrasound and chest imaging exams. Remaining material from blood tests will be incorporated by a local biobank for use in future investigations on inflammatory markers, genomics, transcriptomics, peptidomics and metabolomics.",

            "text": "COVID-19, caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious disease with potentially severe and incapacitating manifestations. COVID-19 currently challenges scientific communities worldwide to rapidly produce findings to inform treatment and rehabilitation strategies for both its acute symptoms and possible long-term consequences, with an unprecedented need for multidisciplinary collaboration. Since the SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via the ACE 2 receptor expressed in several tissues, complications of COVID-19 involving multiple organs are expected. There is emerging evidence that these symptoms may be persistent, characterising what is now being called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). A few reports have suggested that many patients display subacute, multiorgan symptoms 1 month to approximately 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, 1-9 when replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 can no longer be isolated. 1 There is also a need for systematic studies to increase knowledge about longer-term PASC (or 'long COVID-19') manifestations, when abnormalities persist beyond 12 weeks of the onset of acute COVID-19 and cannot be explained by other diagnoses. 1 10 In a study that reassessed 1733 patients with COVID-19 after 6 months of in-hospital discharge (in China), 76% of patients reported at least 1 symptom. 11 Findings of multiple organ manifestations were detected, including pulmonary dysfunction, muscle weakness, kidney dysfunction, newly onset diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. In another investigation of COVID-19 inpatients (n=478) conducted in France, persistent manifestations (including dyspnoea, fatigue and cognitive deficits) were also found frequently (in 51% of subjects) 4 months after discharge. 12 Sao Paulo, Brazil, is one of the most densely populated and urbanised cities from low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). During the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, our largest public-funded academic health centre (Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo; HCFMUSP) undertook an operation that turned its main hospital into a fully dedicated inpatient facility for individuals presenting moderate to severe COVID-19. 13 A total of 900 beds were made available at this site, more than 300 of which in intensive care units (ICUs). Over 3500 inpatient admissions due to suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection took place from 30 th March through August 2020.",

Investigations of sequelae after recovery from acute COVID-19 in LMIC settings are relevant to confirm and extend findings of studies conducted elsewhere, and to assist in the planning of local rehabilitation programmes. Our main objectives are to describe the frequency and severity of multidomain symptoms and indices of disability using comprehensive assessment schedules; to investigate significant associations between persistent COVID-19 manifestations and variables related to the acute disease severity, lifestyle habits, COVID-related psychosocial stressors, sociodemographic status and urbanisation-related environmental risk factors; and to assess the potential for reversibility of PASC. Additionally, this multidisciplinary programme will create a data repository to allow further investigations on how different PASC subsyndromes may relate to each other, and future pathophysiological studies relating distinct clinical features of PASC to biomarker data extracted from blood samples obtained from the same subjects.",

            "text": "There is a pressing need for observational studies documenting the presence of persistent symptoms and sequelae of COVID-19 after hospitalisation. However, thorough multidisciplinary investigations of large patient samples are still scarce. In a study of PASC that reassessed 1733 patients after 6 months of in-hospital discharge, assessments of multiorgan manifestations were restricted to a 12-item medical questionnaire, physical examination, a cerebrovascular/cardiovascular registration form, scales addressing QOL and dyspnoea, laboratory tests and a 6-minute walking test. 11 Objective assessments (including pulmonary function tests, ultrasonography of lower limb veins and abdomen, and CT of the chest) were conducted in a subsample of 390 patients, including only 76 ICU subjects. 11 In another study of 476 COVID-19 patients investigated 4 months after in-hospital discharge, symptom screening was undertaken by telephone; detailed in-person assessments were restricted to approximately one-third of the sample (those reporting relevant symptoms during the telephone interview and all ICU subjects), including laboratory tests, CT of the chest, cardiopulmonary tests, a 6-minute walking test, and cognitive and psychiatric assessments. 12 In addition to the large size of our expected sample, one advantage of the study proposed herein is that we will conduct comprehensive symptom surveys and objective assessments of PASC manifestations in all individuals that agree to participate (rather than restricting more detailed schedules to a subsample with greater disease severity). 12 One other potential strength is that we will have access to baseline hospital data that were recorded prospectively. Moreover, rather than advertising the follow-up study Open access to potentially interested subjects, we will systematically search for individuals fulfilling inclusion criteria for the study. Conversely, one relevant limitation that should be acknowledged is the fact that we will rule out the presence of current re-infection only by the absence of clinical signs and symptoms, rather than by a negative RT-PCR test. Additionally, the fact that the study subjects will be all from one single hospital site might be taken as a further limitation. However, we should consider that HCFMUSP temporarily undertook a substantial multiplication of its capacity to treat cases of respiratory distress in 2020, thus allowing several hundreds of COVID-19 subjects from different city districts to be admitted to our hospital simultaneously. Over approximately 5 months, this setup led to numbers of treated COVID-19 cases comparable to the samples combining several medium-sized or largesized hospitals included in studies conducted elsewhere. Moreover, our access to one large-sized, single-site sample implies that homogeneous in-stay protocols were used, thus potentially reducing inter-individual differences in outcome due to variations across hospitals regarding administrative, diagnostic and treatment routines.",

It has been demonstrated that individual-level and neighborhood-level variables provide complementary information about the contribution of socioeconomic conditions to health outcomes, 65 and both will be available to be tested as potentially significant factors associated with COVID-19 outcomes in our sample. The use of such variables should allow us to investigate the extent to which the vulnerability to more severe COVID-19 might be predicted not only by age, ethnicity and medical factors (eg, number of comorbidities) 71 but also socially determined factors such as poor housing conditions, unstable income and delayed access to health services. 72 Once our analyses will be carried out in a large urban LMIC setting, unique information may be gathered regarding the influence of disadvantaged socioeconomic status on specific long-term COVID-19 manifestations. 73 As in other parts of the world, there is currently in Sao Paulo a commendable pressure from funding agencies, other research sponsors and public universities to ensure that scientific investigations will deliver, as much as possible, evidence-based data to inform real-time solutions to problems related to long-term consequences of COVID-19. Since the observational assessments will be carried out over several months, interim analyses of results may encourage our specialised research teams to plan for nested clinical trials testing the efficacy of shortterm interventions targeting specific long-term COVID-19 manifestations. Additionally, we expect that the delivery of general care to the overall cohort will be facilitated by the procedure of summarisation of clinical information and follow-up contacts with participants and their care providers.
