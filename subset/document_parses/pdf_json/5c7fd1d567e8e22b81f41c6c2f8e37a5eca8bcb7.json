Recently, others have also reported lower severity of RSV coinfections specifically [30] and viral coinfections overall [31] . Because detection of viral RNA/DNA may sometimes represent carryover from a previous RTI, the apparent protective effect of coinfection could be related to antiviral immune responses (eg, interferon induction) to recent infection. Interestingly, the most frequent RSV coinfecting agent in our cohort was adenovirus, a virus prone to prolonged low-level shedding [31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 127, "end": 131, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 315, "end": 319, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 650, "end": 654, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 686, "end": 690, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1059, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Finally, RSV infections themselves may be more aggressive than infections with other viruses. Garcia et al recently demonstrated that RSV bronchiolitis was independently associated with severe outcomes, compared with non-RSV bronchiolitis [25] . Similarly, we found that children hospitalized for RSV RTI were 4 times as likely to have a severity score of \u22652, compared with children hospitalized for hMPV RTI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 239, "end": 243, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "There are several potential limitations to our study. First, we identified hospitalized cases on the basis of collection of NPAs for clinical diagnostic purposes. For that reason, we were not able to identify RTI unrecognized by treating physicians because of atypical manifestations. Specifically, influenza may present in young children with systemic symptoms and few or no respiratory findings; therefore, we may have underestimated its frequency. Also, we did not systematically assess the potential influence of bacterial copathogens on disease severity. Experimental animal data suggest that prior infection with hMPV predisposes to severe pneumococcal pneumonia [32] . We did not test for bacteria in our participants' nasopharyngeal secretions (indicating colonization or possible infection), and it would not have been ethical to obtain lower respiratory tract specimens from young children solely for the purpose of our study. Furthermore, although we evaluated >1000 children with RTI, our ability to assess risk factors for hMPV disease severity was limited by the incidence of hMPV-associated hospitalization (69 cases). Consequently, we were unable to assess in multivariable models the effect of specific high-risk comorbidities associated with severity in univariate analyses, such as cardiac disease or different degrees of prematurity. In addition, as discussed, a potential selection bias toward at-risk patients may have been present among pediatric clinic patients. The last 2 limitations should bias toward the null; yet, our results show significant associations between hypothesized risk factors and hMPV disease severity. Similarly to earlier evaluations of RSV [9, 28] , multicenter studies will be necessary to characterize the role of specific comorbidities in hMPV illness, especially among premature infants. Finally, because very few (ie, 3) hMPV patients had a severity score of \u22652, we dichotomized our index as 0 and \u22651 to assess hMPV disease severity. This may not have allowed us to capture the risk factors associated with the most severe outcomes of hMPV RTI, such as PICU admission or death.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 669, "end": 673, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1690, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1694, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, we present prospective data proposing host, environmental, and viral determinants of hMPV disease severity.
