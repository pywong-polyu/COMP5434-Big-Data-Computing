Addiction consultation services (ACS) increasingly provide OUD treatment to hospitalized patients, but barriers to initiating and continuing medications for OUD remain. We examined facilitators and barriers to hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation from the perspective of patients and healthcare workers in the context of an ACS. METHODS: In this qualitative study, we sought input using key informant interviews and focus groups from patients who received care from an ACS during their hospitalization and from hospitalists, pharmacists, social workers, and nurses who work in the hospital setting. A multidisciplinary team coded and analyzed transcripts using a directed content analysis. FINDINGS: We conducted 20 key informant interviews with patients, nine of whom were interviewed following hospital discharge and 12 of whom were interviewed during a rehospitalization. We completed six focus groups and eight key informant interviews with hospitalists and hospital-based medical staff (n = 62). Emergent themes related to hospital-based OUD treatment included the following: the benefit of an ACS to facilitate OUD treatment engagement; expanded use of methadone or buprenorphine to treat opioid withdrawal; the triad of hospitalization, self-efficacy, and easily accessible, patientcentered treatment motivates change in opioid use; adequate pain control and stabilization of mental health conditions among patients with OUD contributed to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) continuation; and stable housing and social support are prerequisites for OAT uptake and continuation. CONCLUSION: Modifiable factors which facilitate hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation include availability of in-hospital addiction expertise to offer easily accessible, patient-centered treatment and the use of methadone or buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal. Further research and public policy efforts are urgently needed to address reported barriers to hospitalbased OUD treatment initiation and continuation which include unstable housing, poorly controlled chronic medical and mental illness, and lack of social support.",

            "text": "Hospitalizations related to opioid use and opioid overdose quadrupled in the past three decades. 1 Medical complications of injection drug use, including solid organ infections, may require weeks of intravenous antibiotics to ensure bacterial clearance. 2 People who inject drugs often remain hospitalized to complete antibiotic treatment which may be challenging for those who lack social support or coping skills. 3, 4 Consequently, patients with substance use disorders and healthcare providers report difficult interactions related to in-hospital substance use, poorly controlled withdrawal, patients leaving prior to treatment completion, and in-hospital overdose deaths. [5] [6] [7] [8] To address increasing opioid-related hospitalizations, some hospitals have implemented addiction consultation services (ACS). 9 ACS meet with hospitalized patients to discuss their substance use, offer treatment, and link patients to post-discharge addiction treatment. [10] [11] [12] [13] Provision of hospitalbased addiction treatment is associated with reduced rehospitalization and increased post-discharge treatment engagement. 14, 15 Population-level data has demonstrated that receipt of opioid agonist therapy (OAT), including buprenorphine or methadone, following an overdose event was associated with a 50% mortality reduction over 12 months compared to no treatment receipt. 16 In the outpatient setting, patient-reported barriers to OAT initiation and continuation include negative perceptions of treatment by family, friends, or healthcare providers, difficulty accessing treatment, and lack of motivation to remain in treatment. 17 The ACS is a novel intervention that is becoming increasingly implemented in hospitals in North America. 9, 10, 18, 19 As hospitals expand access to ACS, we identified facilitators and barriers to hospital-based opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment initiation and continuation. We included the perspective of patients who received care from an ACS during hospitalization and from hospitalists and hospital-based nurses, social workers, and pharmacists who cared for hospitalized patients with OUD. This study was conducted to inform efforts to expand patientcentered, hospital-based OUD treatment, with a focus on treatment uptake and retention.",

Focus group participants were segmented into practice type: hospitalists, pharmacists, and nurses with social workers because we anticipated that homogenous groups would allow for more free-flowing conversations. 25 One-hour focus group sessions were held in a hospital conference room at noontime with lunch provided as compensation for participation. Due to low focus-group participation by nurses based on COVID-19-related scheduling conflicts, we also conducted one-on-one key-informant interviews with nurses over the telephone at their convenience. These interviews lasted approximately 45 min, and gift cards were provided for compensation. Recruitment for both groups continued until it appeared that data saturation was reached. 26 Study participants were informed that interviews were confidential and provided verbal consent prior to data collection.",

All patients reported opioid use, 11 (55%) reported opioid and methamphetamine use, and two (10%) reported opioid and alcohol use (Table 1) . Between November 2019 and February 2020, we recruited and conducted six in-person focus groups with hospitalbased providers for an average of nine participants per group. Hospitalists (n = 19, 31%), pharmacists (n = 18, 30%), nurses (n = 13, 21%), and social workers (n = 11, 18%) were represented. We conducted telephone interviews with nurses at both hospitals (n = 8). The majority of participants were women (n = 46, 75%) ( Table 1) . From this broad range of perspectives, we identified five emergent themes as they pertained to hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation including: (1) the role of an ACS to address OUD and facilitate treatment engagement; (2) expanded use of OAT to treat opioid withdrawal and to improve patient-provider interactions; (3) the triad of hospitalization, self-efficacy, and patient-centered treatment (defined as low-threshold treatment) motivated opioid use behavior change 35 ; (4) the necessity of pain control and mental health stability for OAT continuation; and (5) the significance of stable housing and social support for OAT initiation and continuation. Themes 1, 2, and 5 included perspectives from patients and hospital-based providers. Themes 3 and 4 were limited to patient perspectives (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "Patients with substance use disorders report experiencing stigma in the healthcare system, which is a barrier to OUD treatment uptake. 17, 36 In our study, several patients described respectful and informative interactions with the ACS. For some patients, discussing treatment options with the ACS reduced their own personal stigma with OAT. Hospitalbased providers appreciated having the ACS available to discuss treatment options for their patients and to facilitate addiction treatment linkage following discharge. With the presence of an ACS, non-addiction providers are exposed to effective medications and behavioral interventions for OUD, thus normalizing OUD and the medications used to manage it. Previous work demonstrated that \"treatment works\" messaging may mitigate addiction-related stigma. 37, 38 As more hospitals implement ACS to provide evidenced-based treatment, the stigma experienced by hospitalized patients with OUD may diminish. In the meantime, hospitals should support training and education of hospital-based providers to extend their knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy to best care for hospitalized patients with OUD. 39 Patients and hospital-based providers identified uncontrolled pain, active mental illness, and a lack of housing and social support as barriers to OUD treatment continuation following hospital discharge. Chronic pain management in the setting of OUD is complicated by opioid-induced hyperalgesia, high rates of co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and increased risk of relapse compared to patients with OUD alone. [40] [41] [42] Chronic mental illness is challenging to manage when people are actively using substances, when they lack stable housing, and when they are unable to access routine mental health care. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Hospitals are increasingly partnering with community organizations to provide housing to people with severe, chronic health problems. 49 Additionally, many hospitals provide medical respite to people experiencing homelessness who are too ill to recover on the streets, but are not ill enough to remain in the hospital. 50 Hospitalized patients with severe OUD often experience many of these barriers, leading to frequent re-hospitalizations and increased mortality. 51, 52 For people experiencing severe mental illness, an assertive community treatment model, which offers around-the-clock, customized, community-based services to people in their homes, has been associated with a reduction in homelessness 53 and in substance use compared to standard case management. 54, 55 A combination of assertive community treatment, low-threshold OAT, and stable housing may improve utilization of healthcare services and mortality among this vulnerable group of people. 16, 53, 56 The use of OAT to manage opioid withdrawal combined with readily accessible OUD treatment, provision of patientcentered care, and care linkage were identified as facilitators of OUD treatment uptake. The presence of an ACS facilitates education and awareness of these evidence-based practices for OUD treatment; however, an ACS is not absolutely necessary for clinical practice uptake, implementation, and dissemination. In hospitals where ACS implementation may not be feasible or necessary, successful models targeted at OUD treatment exist. Key aspects of these programs include a project champion to advocate for hospitalized patients by correctly diagnosing OUD, in-hospital buprenorphine initiation with continuation at discharge, co-prescribing of naloxone for overdose reversal, and linkage to addiction treatment upon discharge. [57] [58] [59] [60] Hospital-based clinicians and academic societies advocate for their colleagues to incorporate OUD treatment into their daily practice to \"drive societal change by removing barriers for patients and mitigating the stigma against being an X-waivered clinician.\" 60, 61 Calls to remove restrictions on buprenorphine prescribing led to an exemption from the X-wavier training requirements and certification to psychosocial services for clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine to 30 or less patients at any given time. [62] [63] [64] [65] Hospitals should support their staff to develop innovative education and training strategies to expand hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and care linkage. Insurers should provide higher reimbursement for provision of OUD services to incentive providers to incorporate this work into their clinical practice. Future work should evaluate if such programs reduce growing costs associated with opioid-related hospitalizations and help patients achieve their personal goals related to opioid use, including incorporating harm reduction strategies into their opioid use, initiating OAT when indicated, and/ or engaging patients in behavioral health treatment. 66 ",
