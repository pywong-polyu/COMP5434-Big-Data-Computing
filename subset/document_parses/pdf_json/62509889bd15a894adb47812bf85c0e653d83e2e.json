Due to the contagious nature of the disease, monitoring and controlling how people come in contact with each other has shown to be key in containing the disease . Therefore, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have taken various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (e.g., lockdowns, social distancing, testing and tracing) (Flaxman et al., 2020) , while facing the conundrum of balancing the trade-off between benefits on public health and depletion of economic performance (Ukkusuri, Yabe, & Seetharam, 2020) . In order to monitor and evaluate the impacts of such interventions, large scale mobile phone data has been utilized as an effective data source (Fan & Stewart, 2021; Oliver et al., 2020) . Studies on human mobility analysis have used such data to model disease dynamics (Bengtsson et al., 2015; Dodge et al., 2021; Finger et al., 2016; Tizzoni et al., 2014; Wesolowski et al., 2012) . During the COVID-19 crisis, various stakeholders have utilized large-scale mobility datasets to evaluate the effects of NPIs in various regions (Bonato et al., 2020; Cintia et al., 2020; Dahlberg et al., 2020; Gao, Rao, Kang, Liang, & Kruse, 2020; Klein et al., 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Long & Reuschke, 2021; Pepe et al., 2020; Santana et al., 2020; Schlosser, Maier, Hinrichs, Zachariae, & Brockmann, 2020; Wellenius et al., 2020; Yabe et al., 2020) .",

More specifically, metrics such as \"social contact index (SCI)\" have been proposed, and their strong relationships with the estimated transmissibility of COVID-19 (i.e. effective reproduction number R t ) has been shown . However, such metrics are incapable of predicting outbreaks beforehand, since such analysis can only be conducted in a retrospective manner. This is a critical drawback since countries are already facing second and third waves of COVID-19 (as of October 2020), and countries are in need of effective early warning systems that can predict when and where the next outbreaks would occur beforehand.",

We hypothesize that users who search COVID-19 symptom related queries more frequently and intensely have a higher risk of having contracted the virus. By integrating the mobility analysis and web search analysis, we propose the \"high-risk social contact index (HR-SCI)\" metric, which takes into consideration both the density of population and risk of COVID-19 ( Fig. 1) , in contrast to previous metrics that only rely on either mobility data or web search data alone. The methods are tested using data of >450,000 users in Tokyo, who were observed across a 7month period (February 1, 2020 to September 10, 2020). Experiments show that the HR-SCI is capable of predicting COVID-19 outbreak hotspots 1-2 weeks before the official observations of the outbreak. The HR-SCI metric can be used to develop early warning systems for COVID-19 hotspots that inform government agencies the locations of potential outbreaks, allowing them to plan effective prevention and preparation strategies.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have utilized web search query data to understand information seeking behavior and the occurrence of infodemics (Bento et al., 2020; Mavragani, 2020; Rovetta & Bhagavathula, 2020) . Others have used such data to detect the increase in COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. loss of smell) (Rajan et al., 2020; Walker, Hopkins, & Surda, 2020) , and also for predicting outbreaks (Hisada et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . With the availability of open datasets (Xu et al., 2020) , there is great potential in further using web search query data for pandemic response and prevention. Despite the vast array of studies, none have attempted to integrate web search data with mobility data to predict COVID-19 outbreaks.",

Non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented by the Japanese government include a non-mandatory closure and remote-working of non-essential business employees (February 26th), closures of public elementary, junior high and high schools (March 2nd), and inbound entry restrictions, starting with Hubei Province, China (February 3rd), until restricting inbound visitors from 73 countries (April 3rd). No mandatory lockdowns were enforced in Japan. The State of Emergency (SoE) was declared on April 7th, and was lifted on May 25th, after observing a significant decrease in cases (see Fig. 2 , gray bars). Although Japan was able to contain the disease, many cities started to see an increase of cases in early July, and experienced the second wave in July to September (see Fig. 2 , gray bars). Tokyo, which has the largest number of COVID-19 cases among prefectures in Japan, had around 400 new daily cases at its peak.

In addition to the above consent, YJ asked for additional consent from the users in this study because the analysis related to COVID-19 and personal health are much more sensitive.

The data acquisition frequency of GPS locations varies according to the movement speed of the user to minimize the burden on the user's smartphone battery. If it is determined that the user is staying in a certain place for a long time, data is acquired at a relatively low frequency, and if it is determined that the user is moving, the data is acquired more frequently. We overcome this varying data acquisition frequency by spatially and temporally interpolating the location data, as explained in Section 5.3. A panel of users who were active each day in Tokyo metropolitan area before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic were selected from the pool of users that have agreed to the aforementioned consents.

Queries submitted by users were treated as \"Covid-19 queries\" if they match against pre-defined query patterns. The query patterns consist of 3 types of query phrases: 1) COVID-19 symptom related queries, 2) names of medical institutions related to COVID-19 care, and 3) names of locations, as shown in Table 1 . For the first group of queries, 186 COVID-19 symptom related queries were determined, such as 'coronavirus high fever' or 'may have coronavirus', including various slang words (e.g., 'corona' instead of 'coronavirus', which is typically used by Japanesespeaking users). For the second group of queries, 5 queries that represent medical institutions concerned with COVID-19 were determined. These include facilities such as hospitals designated by the local health authorities to be specialized for the treatment of COVID-19 infected patients. The third group of queries include 2168 queries representing names of locations (e.g., Shibuya). The latter two groups of queries only were scored as \"COVID-19 related\" only when they were searched together (e.g., \"Central hospital Shibuya\"). To ensure the fairness of future analyses and to avoid users from making these searches even when they do not have COVID-19 symptoms, we do not disclose the details of the query list. When a user has at least one COVID-19 related search query within a session, we determine that web search session as a COVID-19 related web search session. Given a pre-defined threshold k, a user is identified as a high risk user is he/she had more than k COVID-19 related web search sessions. Fig. 2A shows the hourly number of high ",

To overcome data sparsity caused by battery saving functions of the app (explained in Section 4.2), we perform spatio-temporal interpolation of the GPS location observations. Because the GPS data are collected less frequently when movement is detected, we assume that the individual users are static while there are no observations. In the final interpolated dataset, each individual's locations are recorded every 30 min. Using the interpolated individual trajectory data produced from mobile phone location data, the social contact indexes were computed. The social contact indexes shown in Fig. 2B were computed for 30 min intervals. First, for each time interval [t, t + dt), where dt = 30 minutes, users who were not within 125 m from their estimated home locations (via meanshift clustering of nighttime staypoints) were detected as \"staying out\". We denote this set of individual users as N t out . For user i staying out (i \u2208 N t out ), we compute the number of other users \"staying out\" who are within 125 m from user i, and use that count c i, t as a proxy for social contacts. The social contact index is calculated as the total social contacts for all users staying out, divided by the total number of users including those staying at their homes. Thus, mean social contact value is computed as C t = \u2211 i\u2208Nt outc i, t /N, where N is the total number of users observed on that day. The social contact index is the relative value of mean social contacts with respect to typical mobility patterns, observed before the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the social contact index (SCI) of 1 corresponds to the same amount of social contacts as the daily peak times on weekdays before the COVID-19 pandemic. A previous study has shown that the spatial threshold does not significantly affect the estimation results in the urban scale , however, to show this we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the temporal and spatial threshold parameters in Section 6.3. Fig. 2B shows the SCI between February 1st and September 5th in metropolitan Tokyo. We observe a gradual decrease starting from April, low SCI during May and June, and a rise in SCI in July and August. By comparing with the new daily cases (gray bars), SCI reduces significantly after the first wave but the decrease is more subtle after the second wave. Fig. 2C shows the high risk SCI (HR-SCI). We observe that similar to the number of high risk users ( Fig. 2A) , the number of high risk users increase slightly before both the first and second waves, however, the increase is smaller during the second wave. In the following sections, we investigate the effectiveness of these three metrics in predicting COVID-19 outbreaks in different geographical scales (macroscopic and microscopic).",

To quantify the predictability of daily cases trend, we computed the time lagged cross correlation between the metric time series data and the daily cases trend (\"Both waves\"). A positive lag would indicate that the metric precedes the daily number of cases, while a negative lag would indicate the opposite. Also, since we observe different patterns during the first and second waves, we divide the daily cases trend into the first wave (February 1st ~ May 31st) and the second wave (June 1st ~ September 5th), and compute the lag for each of the periods. Fig. 3A -C shows the estimation results of the temporal lag for the three metrics: high risk users (HRU), social contact index (SCI), and high risk social contact index (High Risk SCI). We used the daily values of each metric to compute the cross-correlations with the number of daily cases. The results indicate that the two metricshigh risk users and high risk social contact indexhave similar high predictability of the daily number of cases when inspecting the two waves separately, however, the High Risk SCI outperforms the HRU index when we perform lagged correlation analysis on both waves. The time lagged time series data are visualized in Fig. 3D -F, where the dotted black line shows the original observation, solid black line shows the lagged waves in aggregate (\"both waves\"), and colored dashed and solid lines show the time lagged first wave and second wave predictions, respectively. The peak cross correlation are shown in Table 2 , and indicates that while HRU and HR-SCI metric perform better, SCI itself is not able to capture the trends of the number of new cases. Although the HRU metric performed the best during the first wave with R = 0.894 and lag of 8 days, the HR-SCI performed the best during the second wave with R = 0.756 and for the two waves combined with R = 0.641. From these results, we conclude that the HR-SCI metric perform well to predict the temporal trends of new daily COVID-19 cases across multiple waves.",

Note that since the original data contained the location information of each individual every 30 min, the minimum temporal threshold was 30 min. The overall patterns computed using all spatial and temporal threshold parameters present similar trends, where we see two significant peaks; 2020 April just before the first wave, and 2020 July, just before the second wave. Changing the temporal threshold between 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min changes the granularity of the estimations, where we see a more smoothed out time series data when social contacts are computed in 120 min thresholds, which is intuitive. When changing the spatial threshold parameter, we observe interesting patterns especially in the first wave. The high risk SCI is more sensitive to the spatial threshold parameter during the first wave, where reducing the contact threshold from 1 km to 125 m reduces the HR social contact index by around 70%. However, the second wave is significantly less affected by the change in the spatial threshold parameter. This indicates that during the first wave, high risk individuals had higher spatial proximity with eachother, Fig. 4 .

The time lag for the 1st wave, 2nd wave, and both waves between the high risk social contact index and the number of cases are shown. We observe that the correlation is higher when we compute the index using more spatially granular information. Interestingly, the right plot on the top row shows that for both waves, the temporal threshold of 60 min performs best (also for the second wave). The time lags under different parameters are mostly stable for each wave. ",

In particular, cross correlation analysis showed that the fluctuations in the high risk user count preceded the cases count by 1-2 weeks, which can be useful in predicting the outbreaks in the macroscopic scale. However, the HRU index was not effective in predicting outbreak locations in the microscopic scale, as shown in Section 6.2. This is because on the microscopic scale (125 m grid cells), the decrease in the average number of users observed in each cell increases the noise in the data.

However, as shown in the analysis in Section 6.2, SCI has two major drawbacks in predicting hotspots. First, the SCI is relatively static over time, staying consistently large in locations that are more congested, including central business districts and hub stations (e.g., Tokyo, Shibuya, Shinjuku), and consistently low in more rural areas. Although it is true that COVID-19 has a higher probability of spreading in high-density areas, because of this static nature of the SCI metric, it is difficult to predict the timings of such outbreaks. In the case of Shinagawa (one of the busiest central business districts in Tokyo), outbreaks could not be detected using SCI because the area was always congested throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Mizonokuchi (an town in the outskirts of Tokyo) which had an outbreak also could not be detected using SCI because of the consistently low SCI.",

First, we found that although the HRU and HR-SCI metrics had high predictability of COVID-19 cases in Fig. 3 , the optimal time lags in the two waves varied (first wave: 9-16 days, second wave: 16-23 days). Many reasons could be causing this difference, however, this suggests a change in the the web search behavior of the users between the two waves. As the virus spreads and more information becomes available due to the increase of cases, the type of symptoms that users search in relation to COVID-19 could increase (e.g., it was unknown that loss of smell was related to COVID-19 in the first weeks of the outbreak). Moreover, the difference in the absolute amount of high risk users between the two waves show that awareness levels of COVID-19 had also changed, and that as people become more used to the Fig. 8 .

Despite these issues, the finding that we can predict the outbreak around 1-2 weeks beforehand is valuable and has various potential applications as discussed later. Future research could focus more on the modeling of the web search behavior to improve the accuracy of the outbreaks.",
