However, because the number of currencies has been rapidly growing and investors face different investment opportunities, its dominance is disputable. This paper aims to analyse the links between leading cryptocurrencies. These links are measured by the amount of information shared and transmitted before and during the pandemic. We also verify possible lead-lag relationships within the sample. We study seven cryptocurrencies of the highest market capitalization and a relatively long history of market quotations. The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting unprecedented crisis has affected the entire investment community, and many assets and commodities significantly dropped in value. We focus on cryptocurrencies that-on the contrary-experienced an increase in their value (at the beginning of 2020, Bitcoin price oscillated around 7200 USD). Already in April 2021, it exceeded 61,500 USD (according to coinmarketcap.com, accessed: 21 October 2021). We observe a similar enormous growth in the prices of other cryptocurrencies too. Although the prices had fallen at the end of Spring 2021, at the moment of writing this article, they still surpassed the beginning of the 2020 level).",

The former is no less important from the investors' perspective during the portfolio selection process. Secondly, we find that the amount of mutual information included in returns and volatility is much higher than the one in liquidity. The latter seems to affect the lead-lag relationships-they are indistinguishable in daily returns and volatility but relatively clear in liquidity. The amount of mutual information contained in liquidity has increased beginning from the pandemic. Moreover, there is no definite leader among cryptocurrencies when it comes to information transfer. We observe the growing role of Ripple in this process, and we link it to the fast transaction processing algorithm of this coin. According to the DTW results, Bitcoin leads all cryptocurrencies in terms of liquidity, but we observe that Monero is its close follower (probably due to the growing interest in more privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies).",

With respect to cryptocurrencies, Yi et al. (2018) [1] analysed whether Bitcoin was a dominant cryptocurrency over the period December 2016-April 2018. They found that cryptocurrencies with high market capitalization (namely Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin) propagate large volatility shocks, while small-cap cryptocurrencies are more likely to receive volatility shocks from others. Although Bitcoin plays an important role and generates strong volatility shocks to other cryptocurrencies, it does not play a role of the 'clear' leader on the market in terms of volatility connectedness.",

XRM and Ether mostly reacted to negative shocks, while Dash and Ether were weakly reacting to positive returns. In terms of volatility spillovers, Bitcoin was the most powerful and was followed by Litecoin. Ciaian et al. [6] reinforced the conclusion of the lack of the dominant position of Bitcoin. They show that the changes of prices of alternative coins (so-called altcoins) are driven by the development of Bitcoin in the short-run (for 15 out of 16 examined altcoins) but not in the longer term (for only four altcoins).",

In most cases over the period 2015-2020, shocks were transmitted to the other cryptocurrencies and had a short-term effect on the returns. The scholars also found evidence that the volatility transmission in the high-frequency domain becomes more important than in the low-frequency one. By analysing samples year by year, they found that the variance explained by the first principal component increased over the period both for returns and for volatility. Although over the year ending in August 2016, the percentage of variance explained by the first PC amounted 76% for Bitcoin (the values for Litecoin and Ether were 68% and 7%, respectively); in the year ending in July 2020, the first PC represented 86% of the Bitcoin variance, and the latter was exceeded by Litecoin (91%) and Ethereum (93%).

The goal of the algorithm is to find an optimal alignment between two time series.

The global cost is the summation of the cost between each pair of points in the alignment. The algorithm was first used in speech recognition, where the same signals may differ in speed. It allows for a non-linear mapping of one signal to another by minimizing the distance between the two. The algorithm, unlike econometric methods, does not assume a single delay in the entire period; time series may have different delays at different times. It tries to find the smallest distance among different lags.",

The absolute value of these differences is not high, but we can observe that from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2021 the value rose to 0.19.

Instead, we can comment on the magnitude of the numbers. All the numbers in the tables are multiplied by 100. The differences between returns and volatilities are very small.

We found that cryptocurrencies share a relatively high amount of mutual information (especially in returns and volatility), while information transfer between them is limited. Moreover, we observed that mutual information shared in liquidity has increased since the beginning of the pandemic. The lead-lag relationships between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in terms of returns and volatility are almost indistinguishable in daily data, which is probably related to the high amount of mutual information shared by these measures. Additionally, using dynamic time warping, we have found that changes in the liquidity of Monero (XMR) started to precede the changes in liquidity of all other cryptocurrencies, apart from Bitcoin.",

We confirm that high-capitalization cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin) share a large amount of mutual information with others. However, over time, the relationships become weaker.
