Here, we performed an analysis of the cellular immune status, cell ratios, and monocyte populations of patients with COVID-19 treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) (cohort 1, N = 23) and normal care unit (NCU) (cohort 2, n = 10) compared with control groups: patients treated in ICU for noninfectious reasons (cohort 3, n = 30) and patients treated in NCU for infections other than COVID-19 (cohort 4, n = 21). Patients in cohort 1 presented significant differences in comparison with the other cohorts, including reduced frequencies of lymphocytes, reduced CD8+T-cell count, reduced percentage of activated and intermediate monocytes and an increased B/T8 cell ratio. Over time, patients in cohort 1 who died presented with lower counts of B, T, CD4 + T, CD8 + T-lymphocytes, NK cells, and activated monocytes. The B/T8 ratio was significantly lower in the group of survivors. In cohort 1, significantly higher levels of IgG1 and IgG3 were found, whereas cohort 3 presented higher levels of IgG3 compared to controls. Among many immune changes, an elevated B/T8-cell ratio and a reduced rate of activated monocytes were mainly observed in patients with severe COVID-19. Both parameters were associated with death in cohort 1.",

Even though the virus directly targets the respiratory tract, the immune response triggered by the infection, also called the host response, can provide further explanation for the development of severe disease with multiple complications such as thromboembolic events, liver failure, and autoimmune manifestations [1, 2] . Viral replication in infected cells causes cell death, leading to activation of alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, resulting in a local inflammatory response. The release of proinflammatory cytokines from these cells, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), and Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) [3, 4] , further stimulates a type 1 helper T cell (T h 1) response, with migration of T lymphocytes and monocytes to the site of infection. Whereas this immune reaction is responsible for viral clearance in the majority of individuals, many patients with severe disease present an abnormal immune cell activation with overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines leading to the so called cytokine release syndrome [1, [3] [4] [5] . This overshooting inflammation, similar to septic disease, can lead to organ damage and death.",

Of note, T cells appear to be particularly reduced in patients with severe disease [5] . CD8 + and CD4 + T cells are markedly reduced in patients with a complicated course and are also being identified as independent risk factors for poor prognosis [5, [11] [12] [13] . Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to induce a differentiation of CD4 + T lymphocytes into pathogenic T h 1 cells with high expression of GM-CSF and IFN\u03b3. This cytokine milieu, is also involved in the differentiation of intermediate monocytes (CD14+, CD16+), whose presence could accelerate tissue damage [14, 15] .

However, viral pathways and host response triggered by SARS-CoV2 seem to induce a more specific and complex pattern of changes, which is supported by our data. The mechanisms involving immune dysfunction, especially of T lymphocytes, seem to be multifactorial and associated with a complex context of overstimulation, excessive migration, cell exhaustion, and simultaneous inhibition [4, 9, 14, [21] [22] [23] .

Similar findings have been reported by others, also demonstrating higher frequencies of B cells in patients with severe disease as compared to patients with milder disease [10] . Since in cohort 1, the CD8 + T lymphocytes were reduced to a greater extent compared with other cell populations, we performed an explorative analysis of the B/T8 ratio, which showed differences between the ICU COVID+ (cohort 1) and ICU COVID-(cohort 3) groups as well as between the groups ICU COVID+ (cohort 1) and NCU COVID+ (cohort 2), suggesting that higher ratios could not only predict a more severe course of disease, but also illustrate more precisely the immune changes caused by SARS-CoV2. Interestingly, the pooled analysis of all measures over time in ICU COVID+ subgroups also showed a higher B/T8 ratio in the group with dismal outcome, which could help to understand the involvement of B cells in severe COVID-19. Even though neutralizing antibodies play an important role in viral clearance and immunity, the overstimulation of B cells and the production of non-neutralizing antibodies may lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) worsening the infection [27, 28] . Moreover, non-neutralizing antibodies can lead to formation of immune complexes, favoring complement activation and tissue damage [28] . Recent reports of patients undergoing B-cell depleting therapies provide interesting insights into the roles of B cells in the disease. Even though a pro-longed course has been reported, many patients developed only mild disease, despite their underlying hematological diseases [23, 29] . All our patients presented an inversion of the ratio (from >1 to <1) over time with a trend toward immune reconstitution, suggesting that immune dysfunction is more pronounced at early stages. In addition, the immunoglobulin profile in COVID patients could also be linked to overshooting immune response. In our study, we found statistically significant higher levels of IgG3 and IgG1 in patients with COVID compared to controls. Both IgG subclasses are known to be linked with intensification of inflammation with enhanced complement activation [26] . Even though we could not find differences between both COVID+ cohorts, these findings support the development of an intrinsic proinflammatory, complement-activating immunoglobulin milieu and agree with recent published data [26] . Even though almost all patients in the ICU COVID+ cohort received immunomodulatory agents, mainly hydroxychloroquine, our results agree with most of the literature published, thus far, following the In the group with positive outcome, two patients were lost to follow-up after hospital discharge with only two measures at the point of censoring.

In contrast, intermediate monocytes and activated monocytes (HLA-DR+/CD14+) were reduced in the ICU COVID+ cohort in comparison to the other groups when measured at baseline. Since many patients were referred to our hospital in an already critically-ill condition, monocyte measurements were probably performed at a time point during the disease course when tissue damage was already established through migrated monocytes. Interestingly, activated monocytes increased significantly over time, which may favor the notion of \"consumption\" of these cells in the earlier stages of disease, which is in line with other recent published data [31] . In contrast to this, nonclassical monocytes (CD14-, CD16+) were increased in the ICU COVID+ cohort with decreasing trend over time. Notably, the subgroup of ICU COVID+ patients with negative outcome had lower counts of monocytes at baseline compared to survivors, which might indicate tissue migration.

The T-cell compartment is particularly affected and dramatic changes in CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes might play a prognostic role. Moreover, monocytic subsets and the dynamics of these cells appear to correlate with outcome. Additionally, we present the B/T8 ratio as novel marker of immune changes in severe COVID-19 and report a complement-activating immunoglobulin profile in COVID patients. Considering this immune profile of COVID-19, we suggest that monitoring the immune changes in T-cell compartments, monocytes, the B/T8 ratio, as well as immunoglobulin subclasses could be a useful tool in monitoring the disease course. Our findings might potentially be helpful in the future decision-making process of immune modulatory therapies, based on the specific level of immune dysfunction.",
