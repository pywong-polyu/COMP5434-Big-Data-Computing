In the 1980s and 90 s, the U.S. response to crack cocaine was driven by media depictions of an urban, public health crisis primarily affecting black communities in American cities. This media depiction drove U.S. drug policy and shaped both political debate and public attitude towards crack cocaine [1, 2] . The subsequent influx of drug education messages, public service announcements, and curriculums that were created in response to crack cocaine were pervaded by the public and political fear that crack cocaine was destroying a generation of young Americans [3] . The U.S. government response at this time focused on managing the perceived crack cocaine epidemic by criminalizing rather than providing treatment facilities or healthcare services for people who use crack cocaine. In fact, the 1988 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that the sharpest rise in cocaine and crack cocaine use since the inception of the survey in the early 1970s, rapidly outpaced the availability of treatment programs and efforts to expand treatment facilities in metropolitan areas such as New York City [4] .",

French political and media attention towards crack cocaine has also recently increased due to the presence of visible, open drug use in Paris framing the topic as a public order, health, and social problem. This attention stems from crack cocaine in France having increasing associations with socially and economically vulnerable populations when compared to powder cocaine use patterns [6] . Unlike the U.S., the aggregation of racial data is prohibited in France. And as a result, the French understanding of the current rise in crack cocaine use does not clearly analyze the issue along racial lines but rather considers low socioeconomic populations to be drivers of the recent increase in crack cocaine use [5] . Since the late 1970s, in addition to a repressive drug policy approach, France has implemented a strong, publicly funded drug treatment system with harm reduction services to better Open Access \u2020 Andrew Goulian and Marie Jauffret-Roustide have contributed equally *Correspondence: ajg2253@columbia.edu address the health needs of people who use drugs [7] .

In the 1980s, the intersection of people who use crack cocaine and the HIV/AIDS epidemic propelled in the American psyche the idea that people who use crack cocaine in the U.S. is primarily associated with black communities in major metropolitan areas. During that time, as the prevalence of HIV was increasing in American cities, positive correlations were found between sexual risk-taking behaviors and crack cocaine use in black adolescent populations [9] . Other reports demonstrated how the popularity of crack cocaine significantly increased urban crime rates and boosted inner-city decay in major metropolitan areas of the U.S. in the late 1980s and early 1990s [10] . Meanwhile, mass media pedaled to the American public a fearmongering, racist narrative of predominantly black \"crack baby mothers\" who risked burdening the U.S. healthcare system with an epidemic of \"crack babies\" [11] .",

Bias's death and surrounding media coverage were used as catalysts for significant drug policy changes, including the enactment of the U.S. Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which established minimum sentencing for possession of crack cocaine [12, 13] . And the resulting 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses was enforced despite the scientific community demonstrating that both powder and crack forms of cocaine produce identical and predictable physiological effects, negating any need for a difference in minimum sentencing [14] .",

The minor differences in preparing and labeling terminology of different subtypes of crack cocaine are considered to be social distinguishers [19] .",

The general framing of crack cocaine in France is characterized by both an intersection of open drug use in public spaces with crack cocaine's associations with low socioeconomic communities. In France, illicit drug use was criminalized by the Law of December 31st, 1970, which is also included in the Public Health Law Code [7] . France can be considered a paradox because the country has a repressive approach to drug policy, quite like the U.S., but at the same time has implemented a strong, publicly funded drug treatment system in the 1970-1980s followed by harm reduction services to better address the health needs of people who use drugs since the 1990s [7] .",

            "text": "Notably, in France, crack cocaine has not been framed as a public health epidemic, even with the trend of crack cocaine use and the rise of open drug scenes in Paris and its suburbs [6] . The origins of the French response to people who use crack cocaine can be traced to a spike of increased crack cocaine use in France in the early the 2000s with data showing foci in Paris, North-East suburbs, and overseas territories including French Guiana and R\u00e9union [5] . More recent French public health surveys demonstrate crack cocaine is one of the most commonly used illicit substance, after cannabis, by people who engage with harm reduction services and drug treatment centers [23] . This substantial increase in the number of people who use crack cocaine led to the creation of harm reduction tools such as the dissemination of clean crack pipes. In 2019, in response to the increased visibility of open drug use in Paris and its suburbs in public spaces, the city of Paris, regional health agency, and Ile de France Prefecture implemented a \"Crack Plan\" to improve access to harm reduction services and social housing for people who use crack cocaine openly in Paris. The \"Crack Plan\" also proposed to strengthen the harm reduction services for people who use crack cocaine by increasing a public-funded healthcare model that is embedded in the French model of welfare state that strives to protect the most vulnerable populations [24] . Indeed, since 2020, access to housing for people who use crack cocaine living in precarious conditions has increased in Paris, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic that paradoxically helped the harm reduction providers to transform this topic into a priority [25] . At the same time, a repressive policy towards crack cocaine open scenes and users who lived in these deprived areas is still present in France, especially in Paris and its suburbs where open drug scenes are visible. In September 2021, this repressive policy was symbolized by a wall that has been built to avoid people who use crack cocaine to move again to a residential area in the North-East of Paris [26] .",

To add, the racial crossroad is further reflected with the terminology of Parisian crack cocaine dealers referring to themselves as modous a word that stems from the Mouridi community from Senegal, as a product of past French colonization in West Africa [5] . Further qualitative ethnographic data demonstrates an intersection between people who use crack cocaine and migrants-another term that elicits proxy terminology and highlights racial and ethnic inequalities from postcolonial France [6, 27] . The French media depiction of crack cocaine often supposes a relationship between people who use crack cocaine and migrants, but it is interesting to note that migrants are often presented in media as victims of malevolent drug dealers [27, 28] .",

Additionally, ethnographic studies have described an overrepresentation of people of color in French prisons coupled with a threefold increase in court appearances and higher arrest rates for foreign-born French nationals [30, 31] . The difficulties for highlighting explicitly racial inequities can be partially explained by the \" French Republic Universalism\" prism that claims that all French people who belong to the same nation need to be considered as \"equal citizens\" with the \"same rights\" regardless of their origins. This framing brings about a color-blind political discourse that is unable to publicly recognize that discrimination against people of color according to the French colonialist ideology [32] .",
