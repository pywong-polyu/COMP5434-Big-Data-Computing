This methodology proposes the implementation of lean management in its broadest sense: adopting both lean principles and some of its practical tools or practices in order to achieve competitive advantage. The complete service value chain was considered when introducing changes through lean management implementation. This implementation involved training and involving staff in the project (personnel pillar), detecting and analysing \"waste\" in value chain processes (processes pillar) and establishing control and measurement mechanisms in line with objectives (key performance indicators pillar) and putting in place improvement actions to achieve these objectives. The application of this methodology brought about an improvement in the management of patient flow in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and quality but also an internal transformation towards lean culture.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Over the past few years in the healthcare sector, changes have occurred that have had a considerable impact on society.

This VSM allowed the teams to discuss the current state of the system, the project itself and the viability of carrying out certain actions to improve its management. Thus, team members were able to identify different activities that did not add value for the patient or which caused rework for themselves, long waits, unnecessary movements, or repeated errors. The waste detected can be classified into two categories: that with a direct impact on the patient (waste which affects the patient directly and conditions his/her satisfaction with the service provided; see Table 1 ), and that with an indirect impact on the patient (waste that is not felt directly by the patient but impacts negatively on generating added value, and on the effective and efficient management in the Unit; see Table 2 ).

In this regard, the categorisation and prioritisation of patients from the first consultation to the beginning of treatment led to a reduction in waiting time for urgent patients (quality improvement). Waiting time from the first consultation to the diagnostic test showed a reduction of 71.6% with respect to the initial measured values; from the diagnostic test to the start of treatment, the reduction was of 81.6% (see Table 4 ). Developing the computer application to manage waiting lists systemised the ordering of each different list according to the assigned timeframe for seeing each patient. The creation of technical instructions, procedures, and protocols allowed process standardisation. This reduced the possibility of human error, made processes more predictable, and therefore easier to manage. The standardisation of processes helped to manage their complexity, allowed the acquisition of new skills, and fostered an understanding of the interrelationship between the different processes that constitute patient flow [76] .

Standardisation is key when objectively laying the foundations for capacities, productivities and terms, setting targets and identifying deviations. Process observation and documentation were proven effective, because they can serve as a real eye-opener for staff members who have never before examined their own processes in this way.

The good results obtained in these initial experiences are an excellent calling card and incentive to other areas, departments or centres (in the consolidation-extension stage) when launching new improvement teams in more complex settings that require more sophisticated lean tools or practices. The value of these experiences as promotors of transformation or change can be summed up in the common saying: \"actions speak louder than words\".

In other cases, for application, the diversity and complexity of these tools and indicators would be greater, which would lead to some variety in the effort required in the methodology when it comes to providing the necessary training and resources.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "Finally, the ultimate objective of lean management and the proposed methodology is to eliminate waste in the various processes used in health sector organisations; however, some of the improvements (albeit on a small scale) could enter into conflict with the basis for medical or healthcare treatment, the good use of available technologies or even the regulations in force. Logically, in such situations, common sense would have to prevail over any potential for improvement.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "Internal management of healthcare is incredibly complex and a vast quantity of data are collected. In general, it is still not possible to easily identify how a hospital is performing in terms of quality, cost and delivery of services, because a great deal of the information gathered is not linked to measure the efficiency of processes. Thus, it is important to identify what adds value for the patient and what information and activities are necessary in order to provide added value in the best possible way in line with lean principles. The participative methodology offers guidelines to achieve this by focusing on the generation of added value for the patient and eliminating waste in service provision. The proposed methodology could be adapted and adopted by any hospital department, in any other hospital, or in other health services, in other countries. Lean management's successful implementation would rely on a suitable choice of change agent who can foster change, on good management and coordination of actions related to the three pillars of processes, personnel and KPIS, and on the existence of a true leader in the organisation who would be responsible for the whole process of change.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The advantages of our participative methodology go beyond the important improvement in the hospital unit operations, because people's commitment and involvement make it possible to bring the organisation into line with lean principles. Likewise, the methodology is participative and proposes support through teams that include people from different functions and hierarchical levels. This across-the-board structure is very important because it allows cohesion, deletes barriers and generates a culture of teamwork and learning. On the basis of what was developed in this paper, it can be said that the main research question was answered affirmatively. That is, it is possible to define and implement a participative methodology that systematically seeks to redesign processes in health services, by applying the scientific action research approach and under a lean management perspective.

Before beginning home treatment with the CPAP, the patient is fitted with the most\nsuitable type of mask. However, the patient usually experiences discomfort with the mask after\ncontinuous use of the CPAP.

Waste with indirect impact on the patient.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Type of Waste </td><td>Comments\n</td></tr><tr><td>Delays in drafting\ndiagnostic reports\n</td><td>Before a patient can begin treatment, sleep unit doctors must firstly draft a report on the results of\nthe diagnostic test. In the Unit there were files full of diagnostic test results waiting to be drafted in\nreports. Managers were unable to estimate how many reports were pending, but the files contained\ndiagnostic test results that were more than one year old. The sleep unit doctors drafted reports\nwhenever they managed to have some free time.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Patients who do not\nfollow the treatment\n</td><td>Unit managers were aware that some patients who had started home treatment were not using the\nCPAP for the time required for an effective treatment. However, they were unable to estimate how\nmany patients underused the CPAP or the number of patients receiving treatment.\nThe economic cost of each CPAP amounts to \u20ac1.35 per day and 15 patients were identified as not\n</td></tr><tr><td>having used the machine for more than 10 years. Halfway through the project, 4137 patients in\nhome treatment had been recorded, 15.52% of those used the CPAP for less time than was required\nfor an effective treatment.\nSleep unit patients achieve added value through the effective treatment of SAHS. Apart from\nspending time on activities that add value for patients, doctors and nurses from the sleep unit carry\nout other activities within the pneumology department such as visiting admitted patients, receiving\nvisits from supervisors, and helping with other activities outside the unit.\nThese activities do not form part of their schedule, and when they arise, doctors and nurses must\nimprovise in order to maintain a minimum service in the sleep unit.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Sleep unit\nspecialists\ndedicating time to\nactivities outside\nthe unit\n</td></tr><tr><td>Paper support\ninformation system\n</td><td>Initially, all information handled within the unit was on paper, such as the appointments diary,\nreports on test results, and forms to be filled out by both doctor and patient during the consultation.\nA large amount of paper-based information was collected from different points along the patient\nflow which led to the duplication of some data. This complicated data analysis and patient\ntraceability for the unit management.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Difference in criteria\nfor diagnosis and\ndischarge of\npatients\n</td></tr><tr><td>Impossible to\nquickly and easily\nunderstand\ndifferent aspects of\nunit management\n</td><td>After pooling the criteria for patient referral to the unit and the criteria followed by unit doctors for\npatient discharge, there appears to be no uniformity of criteria for decision making.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Essential aspects of unit management such as knowing the current workload, the traceability of each\npatient, or the productivity of the unit, were difficult if not impossible for the unit specialists to\nunderstand. This was due to a lack of defined indicators and a lack of information to create them.\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "Table 3 ).\nTable 3.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Type of Improvement </td><td>Proposed improvement actions.\nComments\nThree different patient categories were defined depending on the seriousness of the illness, the risk\nof accident due to the symptoms of the illness and the patient's profession (the risk of accident is\nhigher if a professional driver suffers from drowsiness, rather than an administrator).\nThe categories of urgent, preferential and normal were established. The appropriate category is\nassigned to the patient by sleep unit professionals in the first consultation. Any patient diagnosed as\nurgent is always given priority in the flow. This action is similar to the triage method used in\nemergency departments.\nThis method efficiently rations patient treatment when there are insufficient resources for all to be\ntreated immediately. The sleep unit has a large number of patients on waiting lists. Since it is not\npossible to attend to all patients at once, priorities were established for administering medical care.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Categorisation and\nprioritisation of patients\naccording to\nseriousness\n</td></tr><tr><td>Drafting technical\ninstructions\n</td><td>Technical instructions were drawn up for all activities where the probability of human error\noccurring was greater. The instructions explained the optimal way to carry out these activities.\nIn the case of the diagnostic test apparatus, step-by-step instructions were drawn up for the\npositioning of each part of apparatus. Each step contained a small photo with an explanatory text.\nThese technical instructions were posted on the wall in the sleep unit and placed in the bags that\ncontained the diagnostic test apparatus.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Action procedure for\npatients who do not\nadhere to treatment\n</td><td>An action procedure was drawn up in conjunction with the external care provider company to\nidentify patients that voluntarily underused the CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure). Under\nthis procedure, the external care provider company would report a monthly list of non-adherent\npatients (including their reasons for not using the CPAP) and the sleep unit would evaluate each\nparticular case. By way of example, for a patient who used the CPAP, but not sufficiently, efforts\nwould be made to re-educate the patient in its use. In the case of a patient who did not use the CPAP\nat all or refused to use it despite having been re-educated in its use, sleep unit doctors would have\nthe necessary authority to recall the CPAP.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Categorisation and\nprioritisation of doctors'\nactivities\n</td><td>The daily activities carried out by unit doctors were recorded over a three-week period. These\nactivities were classified into three categories: key activities that impact patients directly, such as\nconsultations; general activities that impact patients indirectly, such as training sessions for unit\n</td></tr><tr><td>staff; and other activities that do not add value for the patient, such as meeting unit visitors. Target\npercentages for the time dedicated daily to each type of activity were established: 70% for key\nactivities, 20% for general activities, and 10% for the rest. In addition, a proposed weekly schedule\nfor doctors' activities was drawn up.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Computerisation of\ndata capture, storage\nand analysis\n</td><td>During the case study, an \"Access\" computer application was developed to capture, store and\nanalyse all data handled within the sleep unit. This includes doctor and patient forms, medical\nreports, test results and so on. Data capture, analysis, treatment, and storage would be centralised in\na single application and database. The patient appointment process was also systemised. Each\npatient was automatically allocated the maximum admissible time within which he/she should be\nseen (by appointment), in line with the patient's previously assigned category of urgent, preferential\nor normal. The patients on the waiting list were arranged from most to least urgent according to this\nmaximum admissible time for receiving an appointment. Furthermore, if the patient is not seen\nwithin this maximum admissible time, a notice is sent to the person in charge of managing the\nappointment process.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Development of\ninternal procedures and\nprotocols\n</td><td>Internal procedures and protocols were drafted in order to standardise processes that were carried\nout by different doctors. This sought to homogenise diagnosis and treatment criteria for patients,\nreduce the probability of producing human error, and facilitate the task of estimating productivity,\nquality and efficiency indices.\nIndicators were defined for the appropriate management of each value adding activity. These\nindicators were established to measure the following: unit productivity, such as the number of\nconsultations per week and number of reports drafted per week; quality, in terms of waiting time to\naccess the system, waiting time between processes, total accrued patient waiting time, rate of test\nrepetition and number of patients not adhering to treatment; system load, as in the number of\npatients in the system, number under treatment compared to the number of diagnostic tests and\nnumber of patients suffering from or with symptoms of the illness. Depending on the situation,\neither a target value or an admissible value was established for each indicator.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Defining indicators that\nare linked to objectives\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Funding: This research received no external funding.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "acknowledgement"}, {"text": "The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflicts of Interest:"}]}
