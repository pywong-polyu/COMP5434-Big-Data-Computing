This may be due to the epitope rP1-513 having greater combination ability than rP1-534, and the proteins just simply mixed with the antigen but did not bind covalently. In summary, the results of our study demonstrated that two epitopes of the C-terminal of P1 adhesin could be used for the serodiagnosis of M. pneumoniae-infected patients, although rP1-513 had a better sensitivity and specificity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 75, "end": 97, "text": "Chaudhry et al.
