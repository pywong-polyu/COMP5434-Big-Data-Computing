It is important to establish a new home routine. Ensure that the wake and sleep time is consistent. Schedule specific times for schoolwork, meals, play time, and exercise. Keeping a consistent schedule, albeit new and different will become the norm, alleviate anxiety, and help with the adjustment period. Visual daily calendars can be helpful to delineate passing of time, and to aid the child in anticipating the next agenda for the day.",

For example, a child with autism is more likely to understand \"I am sick\" rather than \"I am under the weather\" or \"I caught the virus\". Visual cues can be used to teach certain behaviors such as handwashing. Story boards that describe situations or an encounter in a precise and sequential way using simple and literal language can also be used to facilitate communication.",

Even with clinic cancelations and absence of routine visits, it is crucial that we remain connected to them, and for them to know that they are supported. We need to innovate and utilize telemedicine to meet as much of their needs as we can. For parents, they need to know that they are not alone in this fight. The human spirit is resilient, and if we are ready to forgive ourselves for imperfect days, and soldier on, we will arrive at the end whole.",
