We aimed to investigate the serial mediation effect of insomnia and exhaustion in the relationship between secondary traumatic stress (STS) and mental health complaints among the frontline healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, 126 frontline healthcare workers from Romania completed validated surveys between March and April 2020. PROCESS macros were used to test the proposed hypotheses of the three-path mediation model. We computed the models for insomnia as the first mediator (M1) and exhaustion (M2) as our second mediator. STS was significantly related to insomnia. Insomnia was significantly related to exhaustion, and STS was positively related to exhaustion. In the third model, exhaustion was strongly and positively related to mental health complaints. The total indirect effect was positive, and the sequential indirect impact of STS on mental health complaints via both mediators in series (insomnia and exhaustion) was significant. Secondary traumatic stress had a positive direct effect on mental health complaints. In our limited sample, the results show that frontline medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak have high STS, which are related to mental health complaints through insomnia and exhaustion.",

Thus, exposure to suffering is the first pathway to STS [17] . When negative energy accumulates without counteraction by some positive mechanisms, this residual energy wreaks within the affected person [18] . Numerous studies showed that psychological trauma has strong associations with poor mental health [19] . Moreover, traumatic stress exposure is linked to increased risks and severe acute and chronic illnesses [20] . As one study demonstrated, some of those symptoms involve insomnia and sleep disturbances [21] . This is consistent with other studies that cited that those symptoms led to dissatisfaction at work, lowered organizational commitment, and exhaustion in addition to high levels of absenteeism [22, 23] . Considering those described above, we can argue that exposure to trauma, which leads to STS, creates a pathway to other symptoms, such as insomnia, feelings of detachment, exhaustion, with all of those having a severe impact on healthcare employee mental health.",

It is felt as if the background is an individual circumstance [25] . Therefore, since those are symptoms similar to the primary trauma [26] , it increases the risk of several psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, depression, fatigue, and exhaustion [25, 27] . Moreover, as previous studies showed, STS was included in a salient job demand model [28, 29] . Following a well-researched Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R), two critical forces affect burnout: Job demands and job resources. Many studies already showed a close relationship between STS and burnout [30, 31] . Being understood as job demand, STS was related more closely with exhaustion and depersonalization, two of the sub-constructs of burnout [19] . One study showed that the participants try to cope with high levels of STS by emotionally detaching themselves from the exhaustion, which follows the symptoms of STS [25] .",

Therefore, in our opinion, research must focus not just on the psychological outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also on the mediators of the relationship between work-related stress symptoms and other outcomes, such as STS and mental health complaints among frontline healthcare workers. One possible mediator is insomnia, a short-term or long-term disorder, with trouble falling and/or staying asleep. Several studies conducted from January until March 2020 have reported that doctors and nurses working on the frontline experienced anxiety, depression, and sleep problems [32] . Another possible mediator is exhaustion, as a part of burnout, which refers to feelings of depletion and feeling down, resulting from overtaxing work [33] . It is experienced by a wide range of employees, including healthcare workers [34] . Furthermore, the effects of exhaustion have an impact on frontline medical workers by experiencing mental health complaints.",

Next, we computed the analyses for exhaustion (M2) as our second mediator. Insomnia was significantly related to exhaustion (b = 0.25, p < 0.01) supporting Hypothesis 2. In this second model, also STS was positively related to exhaustion (b = 0.28, p < 0.001). In line with Hypothesis 3, in the third model, exhaustion was strongly and positively related to mental health complaints (b = 0.31, p < 0.001).

Based on these results, we can conclude that sequential mediation is statistically significant. STS had a positive direct effect on mental health complaints (b = 0.15, 95% CI [0.076, 0.230].

Still, as one systematic review showed, results are not consistent and offer little support to those variables [43] . On the other hand, due to a multivariate analysis among ICU healthcare workers, considering different variables, only gender was identified as a risk factor [15] . Working hours per week, several night shifts per month, lack of compensation, and other professional factors were not correlated to burnout among intensivists before the COVID-19 outbreak. However, future investigation of those factors may clarify the impact of possible confounds on healthcare staff mental health. Longitudinal studies could further strengthen our conclusions and evidence of the nature of the relationships between STS and mental health complaints. Future research should also test other mediators in relation to mental health complaints to provide a broader image of the psychological implications in treating patients on the frontline during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Our findings can be used to formulate psychological interventions focused not just on the psychological outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also on the mediators of the relationship between work-related stress symptoms and mental health outcomes, such as insomnia and exhaustion. Current and future studies among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 medical crisis may provide valuable information for additional training and organizational support to improve frontline healthcare workers' mental health and psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic.
