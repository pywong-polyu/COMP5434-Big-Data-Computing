Partnership support may encourage ART adherence, reducing viral load and the risk of HIV transmission. This study aims to determine whether HIV viral suppression is associated with partnership status and partnership support among 201 HIV positive (HIV+ individuals in serodiscordant partnerships and 100 HIV+ unpartnered individuals receiving care at Hospital Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o in Porto Alegre, Brazil between 2014 and 2016. Clinical data and patient-reported questionnaire data were assessed, and propensity scores were used to control for confounding variables in adjusted logistic regression models. Viral suppression did not significantly differ between HIV+ partnered (78.5% virally suppressed) and unpartnered (76.0% virally suppressed) individuals. Among individuals in partnerships, viral suppression was significantly associated with having a partner who attended monthly clinic visits (AOR 2.99; 95% CI 1.00-8.93). Instrumental social support-attending monthly visits-may improve the odds of viral suppression among HIV+ individuals in serodiscordant relationships.",

The risk of HIV acquisition among HIV\u2212 individuals in serodiscordant partnerships is not uniform, however, and may be dependent on the presence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), condom use, sexual behaviors, and male circumcision, in addition to the HIV+ partner's antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, viral load, and disease stage [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . ART adherence is considered one of the most important factors in reducing the risk of seroconversion for HIV\u2212 individuals in serodiscordant partnerships [1, [7] [8] [9] [10] . Consistent ART use is linked to viral load suppression, decreased genital secretion of HIV, and significantly lower risk of HIV transmission during sex [1, [7] [8] [9] [10] . Despite its vast benefits, adherence to ART, as with medication adherence for other chronic conditions, remains a challenge [11] .",

Results from HPTN-052 indicated that ART treatment of the HIV+ partner could decrease seroconversion risk by 96% [7, 12] . Several prior studies have indicated that a large proportion of partners in HIV serodiscordant partnerships report engaging in unprotected sex, underscoring the importance of sufficient ART adherence in this population [13] [14] [15] . In instances in which pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is not typically offered to HIV\u2212 individuals in serodiscordant partnerships, ART adherence is particularly crucial. At the time the current study took place, PrEP was not publicly available in Brazil, and became freely available in the country in May 2017 [16] .",

Of all HIV+ individuals in Brazil, it is estimated that approximately 69% receive ART and 65% become virally suppressed [17] . Although women in Brazil are typically tested for HIV during pregnancy, missed opportunities to identify and treat HIV+ pregnant women have been identified in up to one third of cases [18] . Additionally, partner testing is not typically offered, allowing serodiscordant partnerships to remain unidentified and potentially leading to new cases of HIV infection [19] . Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state, and its largest and capital city, Porto Alegre, are important areas for HIV prevention efforts in Brazil. In previous years, Rio Grande do Sul and Porto Alegre have faced consistently higher HIV incidence rates and mortality rates from AIDS than the national average [17, 20] . HIV prevention efforts, particularly among serodiscordant partners, are crucial to reducing the high burden of HIV in Porto Alegre.

Facets of social support include emotional support-the provision of care, empathy, love, and trust-, instrumental supportthe provision of goods and services-, and informational support-the provision of information during times of stress [23] . Social support has been found to be positively associated with medication adherence among individuals suffering from a variety of chronic conditions, including HIV/ AIDS [24] [25] [26] [27] . For those suffering with long-term illnesses, romantic partners may be the main source of social support [28] . HIV+ individuals with HIV-partners may also be increasingly likely to adhere to ART in order to prevent HIV transmission to their partner. Such \"altruistic adherence\" has been documented among serodiscordant partners in HPTN-052 [29] . The effects of partnership on ART adherence, however, remains ambiguous [30, 31] .",

Participants in TRIPAI may be more likely to be virally suppressed than other HIV+ individuals in Brazil because TRIPAI participant have thus far been retained in HIV/AIDS care at Hospital Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, and may have access to increased resources to improve adherence due to their involvement in the study. Research among HIV+ individuals, including in Brazil, has indicated that retention in care is associated with improved ART adherence, viral suppression, and decreased risk of mortality [37] . Overall, partnership status was not associated with viral suppression. It appears that there may be barriers to viral suppression among some individuals that affect both partnered and unpartnered individuals, and that partnership presence alone may not be enough to overcome other barriers to sustaining care. Individuals who are unpartnered may compensate for their lack of a partner by securing support that may encourage ART adherence from other members of their social network, including family and friends. Previous research among HIV+ individuals has found that the number of close friends and family members is significantly associated with greater perceived social support, which may encourage medication adherence [38, 39] . Additionally, partnership presence does not guarantee strong social support that improves ART-taking; partnerships in distress and/or partners with their own health issues may not provide support. Even when an individual has strong social support, other factors, such as physical and mental health issues, competing priorities, personal beliefs, risk behaviors, and limited access to health services may prevent an individual from adhering to ART and achieving viral suppression [38] .",

This is consistent with prior research, which has indicated that practical support, such as accompanying a partner to the clinic, has a greater impact on medication adherence than emotional support [40, 41] . Attending an HIV+ partner's clinic visits has also been associated with other positive health outcomes; a study among HIV+ pregnant women in Kenya found that the risk of vertical transmission was significantly lower among women whose partners attended clinic visits [41] . Partner attendance in prenatal care visits is also associated with a higher level of satisfaction with partner by pregnant women and a higher rate of acceptance of HIV testing by men in Porto Alegre [42] . Greater involvement of partners in HIV care may ultimately lead to viral suppression; research among HIV-serodiscordant partners in New York found that partner-focused interventions aiming to identify barriers to ART adherence and optimize partner communication resulted in significantly improved ART adherence and reduced viral load [27] .",

Ensuring that individuals living with HIV in Brazil can continue to receive adequate care for HIV in the years ahead is critical. There are concerns that health resources for people living with HIV in Brazil be drastically reduced in the coming years, as President Jair Bolsonaro's administration supports downsizing the Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade (SUS), the country's public health system [44] . The administration's ineffective response to the COVID-19 pandemic underscores concerns that national health crises, including HIV/AIDS, may be inadequately managed into the future [45] .",

Additionally, TRIPAI may be vulnerable to biases associated with observational data, such as selection bias due to subject self-selection. HIV-partners who enrolled in TRIPAI were required to attend a clinic visit and complete a questionnaire asking about the support they provided to their partner; individuals who agreed to participate in TRIPAI may be more supportive partners than HIV-individuals in serodiscordant partnerships who declined to participate. Additionally, since inclusion criteria included partner disclosure of HIV status, individuals who felt they could not disclose their HIV status to their partners were excluded. Prior research has indicated that among HIV-serodiscordant partners, HIV status disclosure was significantly associated with ART adherence [40] . It is thus possible that the participants enrolled in TRIPAI are not representative of all HIV-serodiscordant partners in Brazil, and that individuals who feel unable to disclose their HIV status to their partners may face reduced rates of ART adherence and viral suppression.",

HIV viral suppression may be influenced by treatment regimen, baseline viral load and CD4 count, and any previous ART use and/or ART ressistance [43] . These factors were not controlled for in this analysis, and could confound the results of the study. Additionally, factors such as depression and stress likely influence level of partner support, ART adherence, and viral suppression, but were not measured in this study. In previous studies among serodiscordant partners, mental health, and specifically depression, was associated with ART non-adherence [29] . Additionally, some of the data collected in TRIPAI may be considered sensitive, and may thus be prone to misclassification. While sensitive information collected via ACASI tends to produce less social desirability bias than face-to-face interviews, it is possible that individuals still underreport socially undesirable behaviors (e.g. substance use) and overreport socially desirable behaviors (e.g. condom use) in ACASI.",
