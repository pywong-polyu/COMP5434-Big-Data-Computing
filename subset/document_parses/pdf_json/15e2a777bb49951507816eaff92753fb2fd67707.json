            "text": "Hawkes processes are a form of self-exciting process that has been used in numerous applications, including neuroscience, seismology, and terrorism. While these self-exciting processes have a simple formulation, they can model incredibly complex phenomena. Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by modelling daily mortality counts as distinct phases in the COVID-19 outbreak. We first consider the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We then explore subsequent phases with more recent data. Various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic are considered, namely, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony.",

It has since spread rapidly with over 116 million confirmed cases and more than 2.5 million deaths as of 7th March 2021 [1] . Since the first reported case in December 2019, countries around the world have fought to contain the virus. In the absence of a vaccine, countries implemented a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions and strategies to reduce the spread of the virus, from measures such as social distancing, mask-wearing and contact tracing, to complete city lockdowns and stay at home orders. These recommendations are guided by mathematical and statistical modelling to quantify the efficacy of these measures [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

There is also a wealth of knowledge around prevention strategies to control the outbreak. In all of these, statistical and mathematical models are an essential aspect to gaining meaningful insights into how the virus spreads and quantifying its various impacts. A popular choice is compartmental models, with some considering the standard SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model [10] [11] [12] , and further extensions in which additional states are introduced [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . As an alternative to compartmental models, others have used methods such as branching processes to capture the spread of the virus through individual networks [2, 3, 5] , log-linear Poisson autoregressive models [19] , and other probabilistic models of the infection cycle of the virus [20] . Various models based on growth curves have also been proposed, for example [21] [22] [23] , who use logistic, exponential and Richards growth curves respectively. More detailed approaches such as agent-based modelling have also been considered by numerous authors [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

In its original form, the Hawkes process is a continuous-time point process; however, the DTHP observes the occurrence of events at a discrete time resolution. Due to this construction, the DTHP can directly model the available data (i.e. daily counts), without artificially imputing the data onto a continuous timeline, as is generally done in studies using continuous-time Hawkes processes. We also introduce deterministic change points in this study, since the dynamics of the spread vary abruptly as the pandemic progresses and preventative interventions are introduced.",

These authors employ a continuous-time Hawkes model with a nonparametric estimate of the reproduction number, R(t), the average number of secondary cases produced by a single case of the virus. Both death counts and the number of confirmed cases in the early stage of the epidemic, before April 1st, are modelled in three states of the U.S., several European countries and China. Compared to SIR and SEIR models with a fixed reproduction number, their Hawkes model with a dynamic parameter leads to lower estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . In the same line of work [45] , consider several datasets for the state of Indiana in the early stage of the epidemic. They also compare a nonparametric estimate of the reproduction number, R(t), with an exponentially decreasing function and a step-function, and find that the estimation of R is very sensitive to the type of input data (i.e. deaths or cases), the data source, and the model choice. Similarly [46] , adopt a continuoustime Hawkes model with spatial covariates to model both the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths, for the U.S. at the county level. This study also considers a time-varying reproduction number. Finally [47] , also use the continuous-time Hawkes process to illustrate the severity of the virus in France if no preventative action were to be taken.",

We make no such assumption, and believe considering external excitation throughout the entire course of the pandemic is a valuable consideration. There are still travellers arriving from abroad, and thus exogenous activity is still occurring in later phases at a lower rate. This is particularly relevant as many countries have relatively relaxed quarantine requirements, which means that travellers from abroad are still capable of spreading the virus. Although we study mortality data in this analysis, we are able to make a connection between mortalities and infections. In particular, we show in S1 Appendix that the rate of external events in our model can roughly be interpreted as external infections, times the probability of death given infection.

For example, as medical professionals become more familiar with the virus and treatments are improved, medical facilities are better equipped to deal with COVID-19 patients in critical condition requiring ICU [57, 58] . However, this can be offset by increased demand for hospital beds, resulting in medical facilities becoming overwhelmed and unable to care for all patients that require hospital treatment.

This is due to data issues that can arise when considering the number of confirmed cases, such as lack of testing or differing testing rates between countries, differences in definitions and differences in the timing for reporting of cases. Additionally, to mitigate the effect of systematic influences in reporting, such as lower reporting on weekends [50] , the data is smoothed over a rolling window of seven days. The start of the observation window, t 1 , for each country is defined as the time the number of deaths exceeds ten. For the initial stage of this analysis, we consider data up to 25th July 2020. We define a single change point, T 1 , as the time where the maximum number of deaths occurs, for the countries with sufficient data in the downward phase of the epidemic by the end of the initial study period. Where there is insufficient evidence for the downward trend, for example, in India and Brazil, no change point was introduced, and only a single phase was modelled. Moreover, the trend for Brazil showed evidence of the curve flattening; however, there was insufficient data for this second phase. Thus the end of the observation window for Brazil is fixed on 1st June 2020. Additionally, as China, India, Spain and the United States experienced large deviations from the current trend towards the end of the observed data, earlier endpoints of 13th April 2020, 12th June 2020, 15th June 2020 and 21st June 2020 were imposed respectively. This avoids the anomalous spikes at the end of these series, since it was not clear whether these aberrations were real or due to reporting definitions or other errors. The endpoint for the remaining countries was set as 25th July 2020. We later extend our analysis to include more recent data, to demonstrate the utility of our model in later phases of the pandemic.

In particular, a random selection of posterior samples is taken, and the entire time series is simulated from these draws. The posterior predictive intervals from these simulations compared to the observed data are given in Fig 3. In general, the intervals for these simulations encapsulate or are very close to the observed data, however, they can be extremely wide and often underestimate the volume of events in the initial phase of the outbreak. This is likely due to variation in the assumed Poisson data generating distribution, and relatively wide priors on the baseline parameters for the first phase, resulting in a wide range of possible sample paths. Additionally, these sample paths did not adequately capture the observed trend in the U.S. However, we find that including the data from the first phase in the model and predicting the second phase results in improved accuracy of the posterior predictive intervals for all countries. These results are presented in Fig 4. Out-of-sample (O.O.S.) validation is also performed for each country as a measure of model fit. First, we consider the initial phase of the epidemic before the change point. The model is trained on data from the first 15 days of the sample, followed by a 5-day O.O.S. prediction. We then repeat this process, increasing the length of the training period by 5 days until the change point. As shown in Fig 5, these predictions are reliable only in the short term, and become more unreliable as the end of the first phase approaches. The first phase predictions grow exponentially and quickly surpass the actual growth of the process, as the observed curve flattens due to the effects of preventative measures that have been implemented.",

The posterior predictive intervals are generally very accurate for all countries, as seen in Fig 5. Compared to the O.O.S. validation performed for the first phase, the improvements in accuracy observed in the second phase are likely due to the stationarity of the process in the second phase, resulting in more predictable trends.

In the initial analysis, \u03b2 is generally close to 1 in the first phase and reduces in subsequent phases.

Another factor could be increased levels of community transmission, affecting the self-exciting component of the intensity function, and thus placing less emphasis on the baseline component. In subsequent phases, \u03bc begins to increase again, which suggests an increase in movement between countries. The exception to this is the U.S., for the reasons stated in previous sections.

As the epidemic is still ongoing, new data is becoming available each day, and the model must be re-fit and tuned each time the data is updated. While we somewhat manually select change points in this analysis, an algorithm suitable to this model with automatic selection of the number of change points and their respective locations could also be considered. Additional change points need to be determined carefully as there must be sufficient information in each time series to inform parameter estimation. Another consideration is flexible Bayesian nonparametric splines [66] or other methods to provide time-varying parameters. However, the identifiability and existence of this model would need to be established. One could also consider different triggering kernels, including nonparametric kernels in order to improve the flexibility of the model. Another possible extension is considering covariates related to COVID-19 deaths, such as the number of people travelling and number of hospitals per capita.",

Compartmental models such as the SIR family of models are among the most popular methods for epidemic modelling. They are more detailed and consider the mechanics of the infection cycle, separating the population into categories such as susceptible, infected and recovered or deceased. Our DTHP model is simplified in the sense that we consider only death events. We chose to model deaths instead of infection numbers as the latter data was very unreliable in the beginning due to lack of testing and different testing policies across countries. However, as we show in S1 Appendix, as a first-order approximation, the death dynamics are helpful to understand the infection dynamics. This approximation is convenient when the infection data are unreliable, as occurred in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the presence of data uncertainty such as this, the SIR model requires additional terms to account for this measurement error.",

This differs from the SIR model, which naturally considers a finite population whereby the infection dies out once herd immunity is achieved. The impact of this difference is negligible in our modelling because we predominantly model the pandemic's initial phases, where not enough of the population has been infected or vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. This may not be the case for more prevalent diseases such as the flu, however both models are reasonable.

The various interventions that take place simultaneously result in complex interactions that complicate the dynamics of the process. Our focus is on the early stages of the epidemic where there is a great deal of uncertainty and volatility. The SIR model family is useful for phenomena where the mechanics are well known. However, complicated variants of these models are required to capture the complexity of this pandemic. Our simple model is useful in describing this early stage in the pandemic when there are still many unknowns.

Instead, the fall is driven by external factors such as social distancing measures, temperature, and improvement in treatments, to name a few. SIR family models have also incorporated change points or time-varying parameters to account for these alternative drivers [51, 52] . Given our analysis's retrospective nature, the change points were quite obvious, and we did not estimate them. However, our Hawkes model can be easily augmented to induce this shape naturally.

The exponential model also becomes less appropriate as the pandemic progresses. In later phases, there are complex interactions that result in trajectories that are inherently not exponential. These are uncertain times, and our model strikes a balance between modelling the dynamics of the whole infection cycle and fitting a generic exponential model.

Similarly, the magnitude parameters in our model, given by \u03b1, also represent the expected number of secondary cases caused by a single parent event. While their respective interpretations are similar at a superficial level, \u03b1 is not directly comparable to reproduction numbers in epidemiological models. This is due to differences in model assumptions and the underlying mathematical frameworks, as our model's magnitude parameters do not provide the same information as the effective reproduction number. The effective reproduction number informs the level of herd immunity that will bring the virus under control, and the proportion of new infections that must be prevented to change the trend of events from increasing to decreasing [67] , whereas our model parameters do not. However, we note that, similarly to reproduction numbers, if \u03b1 > 1 in our model there is exponential growth in the number of events and \u03b1 < 1 leads to a stationary model, which translates into a decrease in the number of deaths if the phase begins at a time with a high event intensity. We also consider a static variable that fundamentally averages over the whole period, rather than varying through time as the effective reproduction number would. We do this as reasonable change points were fairly obvious in the dataset used for this analysis. However, for more complex trajectories, other authors [44, 45] consider a Hawkes model with a time-varying magnitude parameter, which they refer to as a dimensionless reproduction number. This approach could inform the change point's location by observing when the magnitude parameter goes below 1. The change points could also be estimated, for example using the method suggested in [68] .",
