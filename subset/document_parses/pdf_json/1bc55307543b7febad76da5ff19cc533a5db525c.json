Design: A qualitative study involving five focus groups. Setting: Birmingham and Leicester, England, United Kingdom. Participants: Forty-seven Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 sufferers. Results: Shifts in taste and odour were very common with disgusting or unpleasant notes being perceived in many foods, including animal products rich in protein. Food consumption patterns varied affecting nutrition status, individuals weight, types of foods consumed, cooking habits, coping mechanisms, anxieties, family and social interactions. Individuals expressed the need to taste something or experience normal tastes and flavour. Low pH foods, highly processed foods which may contain large amounts of refined sugars as well as cold processed food were the preferred items for consumption. Conclusion: Olfactory dysfunction was related to the consumption of nutrients that require moderation and to the quality of life. Intervention at an early stage is necessary in order to help avoid such complications and thus, this work informs medical practitioners and health workers of the variety of food choices that are more acceptable for people suffering from altered tastes and odour perception.",

            "text": "Flavour is a complex multisystem percept experienced as a result of the combination of taste and odour (5) . Thus, flavour loss has a tremendous impact on eating quality of foods. Smell and taste dysfunction have been implicated in loss of appetite, unintended weight loss, malnutrition and reduced quality of life (6) . Alterations in taste and smell fall into two classes: loss of sensory acuity and distortions of taste and smell function. Dysfunction may be quantitative (hyposmia/anosmia) or qualitative (parosmia/phantosmia) (7) . Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may exhibit to varying degrees as hyposmia (partial loss of smell), anosmia (total loss of smell), hypogeusia (decrease in taste sensitivity), ageusia (total loss of taste), hyposmia (decrease in sensitivity of odour), parosmia (altered sense of smell), phantosmia also termed olfactory hallucinations (smelling odours that are not there), (8) phantogeusia also known as gustatory hallucinations (taste perceived in the oral cavity independent of any external stimuli) (9) and chemesthesis (evoking sensations like burning, cooling and tingling). Anosmia and dysgeusia are often comorbid in COVID-19 patients (10) with a significant association being displayed between both disorders (11) . Olfactory and gustatory disorders due to respiratory viral infections are not unknown (12) . Olfactory dysfunction as a sign of early infection indicating SARS-CoV-2 was promulgated in recent research (11) with 77 % (95 % CI 61\u22c54, 89\u22c52 %) of patients identified having such impairment using objective methods in a meta-analysis (13) . Similarly, olfactory impairment is a highly reliable symptom and early sign (14) in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (15, 16) involving pathologic processes affecting the olfactory system prior to the onset of typical clinical manifestations. Hyposmia may be an early known pre-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease. Evidence mounted rapidly by scientists (17, 18) to include anosmia, hyposmia, dysgeusia and more recently phantogeusia (19) as a novel finding in assessing patients with COVID-19. It was on 18 May 2020, when the British government announced through the press that the loss of taste and smell were officially added to the symptoms of COVID-19 (20) , following recognition as crucial symptoms by the WHO.",

            "text": "The National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE) (21) reports that recovery time is different for everyone but for many, symptoms are resolved within 12 weeks. For those experiencing extended symptoms, NICE (21) defined long COVID, recently termed post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), as 'signs and symptoms that develop during or following an infection consistent with COVID-19, which continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis'. A French study (22) reported 24 % of patients had persistent taste and smell disorders 7 months after the onset of symptoms, while the National Institute for Health Research (23) estimated approximately 10 % experience symptoms and impaired quality of life beyond 12 weeks. These figures show the gravity of the problem, with millions of people affected for extended periods of time, worldwide, and at the time of conducting this research, no recourse through clinical avenues. Fortunately, some countries such as the USA (24) in 40 states, Canada (25) and England (26) have set up a number of clinics to help deal with problems associated with PASC. Owing to severe symptoms requiring urgent attention, priority is given to those with heart and respiratory problems, thrombo-embolic complications, cognitive blunting, fatigue, etc. (27) with gustatory and olfactory dysfunction falling into a lower tier and only a few clinics attending to such dysfunction.",

The quality of life studies concentrating on smell loss as well as working on both taste and odour loss (28) from 9000 user-generated texts on the AbScent COVID-19 Smell and Taste Loss moderated Facebook support group have been conducted recently. Their findings revealed a number of altered eating-related aspects including the failure to consume food, loss of desire to eat food and engage socially, modification of body weight and altered relationship to self and others. Although results from this research concur with the aforementioned findings, greater detail is provided herein using focus groups of sufferers from PASC showing new evidence of different foods eliciting various odour and taste responses, the suitability of different foods, specific nutritional concerns, individuals' ability (or inability) to cope with gustatory and olfactory changes as well as anxieties related to mental and emotional well-being.",

Qualitative approaches are widely used to examine experience-centred designs (29, 30) with focus groups being emphasised as a preferred method (31) . This exploratory research was carried out between November 2020 and February 2021. Five focus groups were conducted: three in Birmingham and two in Leicester, England. A convenience sample method was adopted to recruit participants. Invitations to attend were sent, one per month for a period of 4 months, via the Health and Life Sciences website as well as circulating flyers with referrals being made from employees/students to individuals willing to participate in the present study. Eligibility criteria to participate included: (a) a minimum of 18 years of age, (b) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 3 months prior to this survey, (c) currently experienced alterations in taste and smell (d) willingness to participate within a week of registration. Excluded were those that reported any previous pre-existing olfactory/gustatory dysfunction (patients were asked: 'Did you have an impairment in your sense of smell or taste prior to COVID-19 diagnosis?'). All individuals that met these specific criteria were included in the present study. Recruitment ended when an in-depth understanding of the alterations in taste and smell of food as well as subsequent behavioural changes were achieved. Furthermore, when results between groups showed no dis-similarity, saturation was reached and did not warrant additional sessions.",

Each focus group discussion was recorded and transcribed, notes were taken on key issues arising from the discussion. Thematic analysis was conducted from the accumulated data and used to develop a common coding framework across the group discussions. Five themes were identified: occurrence and duration, foods implicated and flavour intensity, nutrient intake, coping and anxieties.

Geographical studies (32, 33) reported 43\u22c51 and 49 % BAME classification in the cities of Birmingham and Leicester, respectively. This sample study reflects the participation and interest of the BAME community as individuals are at a higher risk of developing severe COVID and are four times more likely to die from the disease (34) (35) (36) . These communities are also frequently at higher risk for metabolic disorders including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and type 2 diabetes (37) .",

Previous studies have also shown patients with parosmia reporting foul odours (16, 19, 41) .

Fruits such as berries and stone fruits were the least pungent and had a mild metallic taste (six individuals). Highly acidic food items (low pH) (44) were more acceptable to the palate of thirty-seven participants. Various lactic acid bacteria are used in pickles and cheese to produce lactic and acetic acid and are claimed to be probiotics (45) . The BAME community is known to consume lots of spiced foods (46) but the results show that they (seven in the cohort) experienced difficulty in perceiving the various flavours. Furthermore, preferences for the consumption of fermented milk and vegetables (pickles, kimchi, etc.) are high (46, 47) , providing distinct sharp flavours enhancing gustatory experience. However, this again was reported as diminished perception by the same seven individuals. Fermented meat products also contain lactic acid-producing bacteria that reduce the pH down to 5\u22c53 or less. Commercial products contain sodium nitrite as a preservative and after drying may have a fat content between 40 and 50 % (48) . Coffee was perceived to have an odour of burnt tyres by 6\u22c54 % of individuals but the flavour may be compounded by the bitter taste of water. Impaired chemesthesis (43) was also evident as heat sensations from chillies were not noticeable by two individuals. The consumption of processed meats such as salami and pepperoni contain nitrites which are known to be carcinogenic (49) . It is worth stating here that the NHS (50) published information as part of symptom management including food items for those experiencing taste and flavour disorders suggesting the use of herbs and spices, opting for strong sharp foods as well as cold foods.",
