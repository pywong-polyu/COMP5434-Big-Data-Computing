Their construction is random as compared to deterministic fractals such as the Mandelbrot set (which is formed through repeated iterations of a simple mathematical equation). The irregularities and variations in coastlines have defied attempts of characterization using methods which are based on Euclidean geometry. Measuring the length of smooth curves is a simple process of successive approximations by line segments. For more accurate measurements, smaller segments can be used. As the segment size approaches zero, the sum of the lengths of the segments will approach the length of the curve. However, this naive application of Euclidean geometry to natural curves fails because the limit may not exist. There are several possibilities for this failure such as sloppy length measurements, use of different data sets by different researchers (some of which may be erroneous), and use of different measurement methods, leading to differences in measured lengths etc.",

For some objects, an explicit formula for N(\u01eb) can be found and in that case D b is computed by taking a limit of the appropriate expression (see Theorem 3 below).

The length of the coastline is calculated to see if it lies within the scaling region for reliable length. This makes the study important and useful because it allows to reveal the fractal characteristics of the coastline and also helps to verify the actual length estimates of the coastline. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The algorithm starts with obtaining the high resolution spacial coastline map of Australia (see Fig. 2d ) from GADM. We then remove small islands and coastline of Tasmania using a 'R' program and cover the coastline with gridlayer using vector research tools in QGIS. The algorithm counts the number of boxes (N) for a specified grid size (r) and finally store the output data for calculations. We have used total 17 grid sizes using the measurement scales: 1000, 800, 750, 600, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 100, 75, 50, 25, 10, 5, 1, and 0.5 km. Figure 5 depicts plots of the data inside the scaling regions. In Fig. 5a , box size (r) is potted against number of boxes (N) (on log scale). It is evident from the plot that the number of boxes increases rapidly as the size of the measuring scale decreases below 1. This confirms the inverse power law relation between number of boxes and the measurement scale. The log N \u2212 log r curve is plotted in Fig. 5b , which allow us to determine the fractal dimension by measuring the slope of the best fit line to the computed data log(N) = \u22121.143 log(r) + 4.59 (obtained using the method of least-squares). From this, we get the box-counting dimension of the coastline 28 having an absolute error of 0.013 and a relative error of just 1.15%. Now using the box-size (r), and the equation L(r) = k \u00d7 r 1\u2212D with log(k) given as the intercept of log N \u2212 log r , we recover the power law (by fitting the power regression curve) for the coastline length of Australia as:",

Note that the length of the coastline increases rapidly as the measurement scale decreases within the scaling regions. In practice, the smallest possible measurement scale within the scaling regions should be selected to calculate the length of the coastline after the scaling regions and fractal dimensions are determined since the length of the coastline increases rapidly with decrease in the measurement scale within the scaling region (see Fig. 6 ). Therefore, the lower limit of the scaling region is a natural choice for calculating the coastline length. In Fig. 6b , a zoom on the scaling region is shown. From this, we found that the lower limit of scaling region for the coastline of Australia is (nearly) 1 km. Thus, the length of the mainland coastline is approximately 38910 km which is in close agreement with the actual length of 35821 km reported at the beginning of this Section.",

At very small grid sizes, the parallelization is still very challenging and yet to be achieved specially when the coastline (e.g. Australia, Russia, Canada etc.) or the Euclidean object under consideration are very large in size. In all such instances, a truly parallel distributed memory algorithm (via use of MPI, Open MP for inter processor communication) seems to be the only option that can speed up the computations very fast. Another possibility to accelerate calculations is to exploit the massively parallel processing power of the GPUs (graphics processing units) together with CUDA or OpenCL parallel computing platforms.",

We remark that the development of CPU, GPU based parallel algorithms in fractal geometry is still in nascent stages and the multiprocessing algorithm presented in this article in a small step in this direction.

Mandelbrot quoted in his famous book The Fractal Geometry of Nature (1982), \"Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line\". Mandelbrot discovered and plotted one of the most interesting and popular fractal known as the Mandelbrot set (see Fig. 1) at IBM on March 1, 1980. Shishikura 36 proved the intriguing conjecture by Mandelbrot 32 which states that the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is 2. Shishikura's proof was based on the concept of bifurcation of parabolic periodic points. Let us begin by introducing the formal definition of fractal dimension. Definition 1 Let (X, d) be a metric space and A be a compact subset of X. Let \u01eb > 0 (a small number) be given and define i.e. A \u2282 n i=1 B \u01eb (x i ) , where B \u01eb (x i ) is a ball of radius \u01eb centered at x i . We say that A has fractal dimension D if where C > 0 is a constant. N \u01eb (A) = minimum number of closed balls which covers A (1) N \u01eb (A) \u2248 C\u01eb \u2212D The limit exists. We recall two important results from Barnsley 1 . The first result gives existence of fractal dimension and the second result replaces the continuous variable \u01eb in Eq. (2) by a discrete variable to simplify the process of computations. Theorem 1 (Theorem 2.1, Chapter 4) Let m be a positive integer. Consider the space (R m , Euclidean). Then D(A) exists for all A \u2208 H(R m ). Here, H(R m ) is the set of all non-empty compact subsets of R m .",
