In recent studies, potent antiviral receptor binding domain specific antibodies were found in all COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors despite low titers of neutralizing antibodies [17] . While the overall antibody titer is most likely an important factor in determining the viral neutralization potential of a given convalescent plasma donor, multiple other factors likely play a role. These include antibody binding avidity, diversity of response, and amounts of differing antibody classes. While antibody avidity, combined strength of the antibody-antigen complex, can have substantial impact on the humoral immune response, there are limited data on temporal dynamics and correlates of SARS-CoV-2 antibody avidity responses, and whether a stronger avidity response is associated with higher neutralizing titers. An association between antibody avidity and neutralizing antibody titer may also help to identify optimal convalescent plasma donors.",
