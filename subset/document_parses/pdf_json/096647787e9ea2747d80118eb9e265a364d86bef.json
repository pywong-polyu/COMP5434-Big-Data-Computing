An example of nonprobability sampling is convenience sampling, where patients are selected only based on accessibility and availability. e selection process for convenience sampling can lead to over-or underrepresentation of certain population attributes and therefore decreases the generalizability of the study results (sampling bias). A special form of convenience sampling, commonly used in clinical research, is consecutive sampling. In this sampling method, for a specified period of time, every subject who meets the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria is recruited for the study. is sampling method prevents the researchers from \"picking and choosing\" subjects [15] . Analysis of 31 published meta-analyses showed that nonconsecutive sampling tended to overestimate the diagnostic accuracy of the test by 50% compared to consecutive sampling in diagnostic accuracy studies [16] . e effect of consecutive over nonconsecutive sampling can be seen in a study evaluating deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities. Kline et al. recruited subjects using a consecutive method to compare the diagnostic accuracy of emergency clinician-performed compression ultrasonography for DVT of the lower extremities against whole-leg venous ultrasonography and reported a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 89% [17] . By contrast, other studies on the same topic reported almost perfect diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity: 100% and specificity: 91.8-100%) using a nonconsecutive sample. ese higher accuracy measures could be due to excluding complex cases, excluding patients who may be difficult to perform ultrasound, or excluding ambiguous results [18, 19] .",

An example of this bias in the radiology literature can be found in a study by Mater et al. which evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of shunt series radiographs and CT to assess for cerebrospinal fluid shunt malfunction. e clinical decision to proceed to shunt revision, which was used as the reference standard, was made by the neurosurgeons after reviewing the radiograph and CT imaging.

Of the 589 patients included, the reference standards, which were pathology reports, surgical diagnosis, or clinical decision for medical treatment for appendicitis, were not available for 63 patients (10.7%) due to loss to follow-up. e authors acknowledged this limitation and analyzed the effect on diagnostic accuracy.
