The pandemic has been a tough test for all European national health systems and their capability to provide an adequate reaction. Methods: The present work aims to reveal correlations between parameters such as COVID-19 incidence, ICU bed occupancy, ICU excess area, and mortality in Italian regions. Public data for the period of March 1 to July 16, 2020, were analyzed using several mathematical and statistical methods. Results: The analysis defined two separate groups of Italian regions. The examined variables considered within these groups were interlinked and dependent on each other. The regions of the two groups shared the same kind of fitted model (linear) explaining mortality as a function of cumulative incidence, but with higher value of the constant in one group, so characterized by a high intrinsic \"strength\" of the pandemic, certainly playing a major role in the generation of a large number of severe and life-threatening cases. These results are confirmed at European level. Other factors may condition mortality and be linked to incidence, such as ICU saturation and excess. Conclusions: These quantitative results could be a very helpful tool to set up preventive measures and optimize biomedical interventions before the pandemic, in its recurrent waves, could overcome the reaction capacity of any public health system.",

            "text": "Since its onset, COVID-19 has been characterized by high contagiousness (Zhu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020) and different syndromic appearance, from an asymptomatic state or mild signs of discomfort (the majority of cases) to severe manifestation of acute respiratory distress, necessitating intensive care (IC) treatment. Different virus containment measures have been adopted throughout the world. Response to the threat includes individual and collective mobility limitations, physical distancing, quarantine of red zones, in-house confinement, provision of personal protective equipment, identification of infectious cases, and contact tracing via an enhanced effort of direct diagnosis. Rapidly expanding from China, COVID-19 soon became a fierce challenge for all of Europe. It was, in fact, immediately clear that capability of individual European national and regional health systems to sustain the threat mainly relied upon strength of the epidemic (i.e. cumulative number of cases) and was primarily linked to the availability of IC treatment required by the most severely affected patients. Mortality-wise, the pandemic exhibited a great variability in the EU, European Economic Area, and UK countries that share similar welfareshaped health systems. Different mortality values were also seen in Italian regions, especially in the northern part of Italy, where the pandemic originally struck and was more intense (i.e. Lombardy and Veneto), with the first documented cases on February 21, 2020. Since then, the pandemic has spread over the whole country. When the first outbreaks developed, Italy had a total of 5000 ICU beds. Owing to the spatial and latitudinal heterogeneity, size, and asynchronous insurgence of the outbreaks, local hospitals and ICUs were rapidly saturated in Lombardy. Lockdown measures, implemented at country level on March 12, 2020, and possibly other factors, allowed control of the diffusion of the epidemic. Following the end of March, the COVID-19 incidence started to decrease and at the end of April the pandemic had released its grip on ICUs. Most patients with early symptoms are now treated at home or in COVID-19 specialized wards and hospitals.",

After an RMSE comparison, the best type of model was applied to the IC sequence of each region. Whenever an IC fitted curve exceeded the maximum IC capability level, we numerically approximated the area of the geometric region under the curve and above the level. The IC capability at the beginning of the pandemic was taken from (Anon, b).

Apart from a numerical constant, this is the within variance of the cluster. The associated clusters with their elements are obtained by suitably cutting the dendrogram with a horizontal line. Given an arbitrary number of clusters between 1 and n \u00c0 1 (n is the sample size), the corresponding number appearing on the vertical axis, divided by the square root of 2, gives the square root of the difference between the summation over the k clusters of the within-cluster sum of squares and the same quantity for k + 1 clusters. To select the optimal number of clusters we use these heights. Specifically, we follow the elbow criterion slightly modified: we select the number k such that if we decrease it by one, we have a high loss, but if we increase it by one, we have a low gain. More precisely, we maximize the ratio loss/gain, which indeed corresponds to the ratio between the heights relative to k \u00c0 1 and k clusters, respectively.",

A simple linear model with one parameter was used. This is a crude approximation as the mortality sequence can be obtained mathematically from the incidence one by convolving it with a suitable kernel. Nevertheless, we take into account the temporal delay by comparing the cumulative incidence to the mortality sequence after shifting the latter along time. An optimal value of the shift was found by minimizing the variance unexplained by the model. In Figure 3 , we present the result of the best linear fit for Lombardy. The results of the fits for the regions of the first and the second groups' G HC are included in the same figure. The slopes of the best linear model for the regions of the first-group G HC are significantly higher than those of the second group (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank test, p < 0.003). We repeated the analysis for the relation between cumulative incidence and cumulative daily ICU occupancy. In this case, there is no significant difference between the mean values of the slopes of the regions in the two groups (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank test, p = 0.1). The results are similar for Spain, United Kingdom, Romania and Germany (Figure 4) . The slopes of the lines for Germany and Romania are smaller than for Spain and the UK and comparable to those of the second-group G HC ; whereas, the slopes for Spain and the UK are comparable to those of the first-group G HC . The number of critical care beds for Spain, UK, Romania, and Germany are 9.7, 6.6, 21.3, and 29.3 for 100,000 inhabitants, respectively (Anon, c).",

This is done by a fitting a linear model between ICU excess area and COVID-19 mortality for the regions of the first group of G IC (Figure 5b ). Mortality in this case is evaluated at the end of the excess period for all regions, i.e., April 20. The outlier Lombardy, where the Italian epidemic started and reached the highest mortality, is excluded from the analysis that gives a determination coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.85. A similar result is obtained when the area is replaced by the maximum of daily ICU occupancy. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that the mortality mean value in the regions of the first group of G IC is higher than those in the remaining regions of the first group of G HC with no ICU excess area, i.e. Liguria and Emilia Romagna. However, the difference is not significant (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank test, p = 0.6). This could be tested by performing the analysis at provincial level but, unfortunately, ICU occupancy data are not publicly available at provincial level. Finally, the partition of the Italian regions into the two groups G HC is almost identical to that obtained by hierarchical clustering from cumulative incidence at the day when the lockdown started at national level in Italy, i.e., March 12, 2020 ( Figure 6 ). Among the regions of group 1 (the one with high cumulative intensity), only Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia are not in group 1 G HC (Figure 2 ). This result is important because the pattern at March 12 helps to predict the one at July 16.",

Two groups of regions can be identified in Italy, with mean values related to each of these three parameters that significantly differ between the two groups. These two groups, moreover, can be well separated using specific statistical tools, i.e., hierarchical clustering (G HC ). The resulting dendrogram clearly shows the presence of two clusters with higher (G HC1 ) or lower variable values (G HC2 ). Lombardy, where the pandemic started and where it has been more intense, is the prototype of the G HC1 cluster. Thus, results show that the viral pandemic affected Italian regions with a dual modality according to the pandemic \"strength\" and that cumulative incidence of cases, maximum daily ICU occupancy, as well as mortality are somehow interlinked. The spatial proximity to Lombardy of other G HC1 regions along with high mobility of people from Lombardy to non-neighboring regions can explain such a group clustering. The exception to this rule is apparent in the Veneto region, a condition that can derive from a number of public health measures that were adopted by the regional prevention and epidemiology departments: (i) immediate lockdown of the first outbreak centers, (ii) prompt set up of COVID-19 dedicated facilities like first aid, wards, and hospitals together with an increased number of beds in ICUs, (iii) a consolidated capillary territorial distribution of hygiene and preventive services, and (iv) wide adoption of diagnostic tests for symptomatic and at risk populations.",

Cumulative incidence is also linearly related to cumulative daily ICU occupancy but this latter variable varies in the same manner in the two regional clusters, indicating that higher virus circulation has induced the same need for more available IC beds in both groups of regions, without distinction for disease severity.",

Among G HC1 regions only Liguria and Emilia Romagna do not belong to G IC1 but nearly have IC excess area, a result that indicates that this parameter is also related to the pandemic strength. It is notable in this regard that the IC occupancy in Liguria exceeds 95% of the available units. This suggests that the trend for Liguria should be more similar to the regions of the G IC1 than the G IC2 group. A different situation accounts for Emilia Romagna where the IC occupancy is about 80% of the available ICU beds but COVID-19 incidence is extremely heterogeneous for the different provinces; Piacenza being an example of a highly affected district with respect to others. Data relating ICU excess area to mortality indicate a direct correlation in G IC1 regions (Bolzano, Trento, Piedmont, Marche, and Aosta Valley) with the exception of Lombardy, the worst hit region. This paradox may be because Lombardy had the more intense virus circulation among the general population in Italy; this caused a rapid saturation of hospitals and ICUs that, in turn, became the source of a rapid transmission of contagion from cases with high viral load, a condition that resulted in a serious number of victims (Fagiuoli et al., 2020) . The observed pattern is not specific for Italy. In fact, Spain and the UK, which have low ICU capacity, show the same trend as Lombardy and the other regions of the first-group G HC , whereas in Germany and Romania, with high ICU capacity, the situation is similar to the regions of the second-group G HC .",

The region with highest value of cumulative incidence (i.e. Lombardy) forming a single region group is plotted in black. Aosta Valley, and Emilia Romagna). The fact that both Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia had a relatively low mortality and daily ICU occupancy (did not fall within G HC1 group) means that the early public health preventive measures adopted by these regions may have successively affected pandemic spread. Obviously, other virus and host-related factors could influence mortality (e.g., virulence, age, and comorbidities) and could explain some of the discrepant estimates described. Moreover, a high mortality among IC-treated patients cannot be solely related to COVID-19 but to different social, epidemiological, and environmental factors such as the number of days of admission to ICU and the acquisition of multidrug resistant bacterial infections (Rossolini et al., 2014) . Our data clearly indicate that IC, albeit life-saving for the most severe COVID-19 complications, should be deferred as much as possible. A substantially reduced IC saturation would mean a better overall survival with new effective treatments being adopted in the community and with a diminished occurrence of nosocomial virus spreading (de Wit et al., 2016) . In fact, at the end of the lockdown, with the drop in new SARS-COV-2 positive cases and the reduced admission to ICUs, mortality values steadily decreased (Onder et al., 2020) .
