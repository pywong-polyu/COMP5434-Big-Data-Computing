This cross-sectional study sought to measure the point prevalence levels of depression in university students (ages 19-25 years) from Maharashtra, India, during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic and lockdown, through an online opt-in survey. The BDI-II was self-administered by 783 respondents (males = 243; females = 540). Results indicated overall mild levels of depression (mean BDI = 16.48) and high point prevalence, with 51.8% (n = 406) of the population being symptomatic, of which 16.3% had severe, 17.9% had moderate, and 17.8% had mild levels of depression. No association was found with age, gender, educational level of participants, period of hostel stay, education, and occupational level of parents. Overall percentages of symptomatic women were higher, suggesting the gendered effects of the pandemic. This study explored the symptomatology of depression wherein \"sadness,\" \"changes in sleep patterns,\" and \"concentration difficulties\" emerged as the most commonly experienced symptoms. Symptom expression was found to vary with intensity and gender. Symptomatic men experienced significantly more cognitive symptoms like self-criticalness, punishment feelings, thoughts about past failures, and changes in sleep patterns, while symptomatic women felt significantly high \"loss of energy.\" No significant gender differences were seen in the experience of cognitive-affective symptoms. Possible reasons are discussed. Further exploration of the experiences of youth is essential to understand the full gamut of the pandemic's impact on them.",

Instead, it may be more useful and precise to gather areaspecific data to arrive at prevalence rates for a particular socio-demographic, geographical context.

The experience of these symptoms and their management are mediated by various factors like age, geography, social, and cultural contexts. The nature of symptoms experienced by young people has predictive value in the early diagnosis of clinical depression and requires deeper exploration (Dardas et al., 2016) . Very few studies have reported the symptom profile of depression among Indian youth, and most of the data is based on clinical samples and collected retrospectively. Due to this, we know very little about symptom expression of depression in non-clinical university students. Since data for this study was collected during the lockdown period, when educational institutions and offices were functioning through online modes, the nature of symptoms that youth were experiencing at this time and significant patterns that emerge will offer greater insight into their experience of depression during this period. Evidencebased data emerging from such studies can help policymakers, mental health professionals, educators, and parents develop plans, programs, and strategies to mitigate the burden of depression among youth.",

The BDI-II (Beck et al., 1996) is a revised version of the original tool and consists of 21 questions assessing cognitive, affective, and somatic symptoms of depression as experienced in the last 2 weeks. On a non-clinical population, a single administration of the BDI-II in the absence of other diagnostic assessments may not indicate clinically diagnosable disorders, but scores may still be used to screen for probable cases of depressive symptoms as operationalized in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV (Wang & Gorenstein, 2013) . The scale is easy to administer and has high content and construct validity and shows concurrent validity with other measures like the MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. It has been used in several Indian studies to measure the levels of depression in Indian adolescents (Win et al., 2019) , thereby demonstrating its cross-cultural compatibility with the target population. The scale has an internal consistency of 0.9 and high test-retest reliability. Although some studies indicate different scores for symptom categories depending on whether the sample is drawn from a clinical or non-clinical population, the current study used the recommended cut-off scores of the original scale to classify participants into minimal (0-13), mild (14-19), moderate (20-28), and severe (29-63) intensities of depression (Beck et al., 1988) . Existing factor models and item content of the BDI-II draw a distinction between cognitive-affective symptoms of depression (items 1-14: sadness, pessimism, past failure, loss of pleasure, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal ideation, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, worthlessness) and somatic symptoms (items 15-21: loss of energy, sleep problems, irritability, appetite problems, concentration, fatigue, loss of interest in sex).

The top five most commonly experienced somatic symptoms across mild, moderate, and severe categories were changes in sleep patterns, difficulties in concentration, loss of energy, changes in appetite, and tiredness, while the most commonly experienced cognitive-affective symptoms were sadness, loss of interest, feelings of guilt, loss of pleasure, and irritability. However, when taking only the moderate and severe categories into consideration, the experience of somatic symptoms like changes in sleep patterns, concentration difficulties, loss of energy, and fatigue surpassed the experience of other cognitive-affective symptoms (Table 5 ). Across symptom categories and across gender, sadness, changes in sleep patterns, and concentration difficulties remained the most commonly reported symptoms and with high intensity. It was seen that 49% of the symptomatic population experienced suicidal thoughts or wishes. Symptom expression was found to vary with gender (Table 6 ). Females experienced significantly more somatic symptoms (loss of energy, sleep problems, irritability, appetite problems, concentration, fatigue, loss of interest in sex) than males (p = 0.048), though there was no significant difference between genders in the experience of cognitive-affective symptoms.",

            "text": "In the present study, depressive symptoms were found in 51.8% (n = 406) of the population, the mean BDI score was 16.48 and the median BDI score was 14, which are both in the mild category. This is in line with pre-COVID studies of adolescent depression from rural Pune (in Maharashtra), where the prevalence rate was found to be 54% but is much higher than a study from rural Maharashtra, where the prevalence rate among students of ages 12-18 years was found to be 6.66% (Shaikh et al., 2018; Shelke et al., 2015) . Studies of depression from other parts of India have reported wide variations in prevalence rates, ranging from 14.5 to 60%. Hence, although the prevalence is on the higher side, the finding of this study agrees with much of the existing trends from across the country. The mild intensity of depression (mean BDI = 16.48; Median = 14) found in this study which took place in the middle of the pandemic, is slightly lesser than the moderate level reported by Rehman et al. (2021) in their study of depression in Indian students during the pandemic. Although the complete sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic may become apparent only after several years, the current study supports existing findings of low to moderate levels of COVID-related distress in adolescents (Magson et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020) . Fluctuations in perception of the pandemic over time as being less dangerous (data collection took place in November when the first wave was coming to an end) may contribute to lower emotional impact (Terry et al., 2020) . Several external and intrinsic factors moderate COVID-related depression in young people and a clearer understanding of the experience of depression during the pandemic requires an inquiry into these factors (Porter et al., 2021; Rehman et al., 2021; Sundarasen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . While some existing community-based studies have found that adolescent depression is largely of mild (Grover et al., 2019; Lodha et al., 2016) or moderate severity (Kumar et al., 2019; Malik et al., 2015) , this study found that the symptomatic percentages of mild (= 18%), moderate (= 17.5%), and severe (= 16.3%) categories were almost comparable. The increased intensity of depression may be explained by the fact that this study was conducted almost 8 months into the lockdown, during which time youth had been in a state of prolonged social disconnect. Biological disasters like COVID-19 give rise to acute (within 2-6 months of the outbreak) and long-term (after 6 months of the outbreak) mental health issues. Although they were young and not considered to be a high-risk group during the first wave of the pandemic, college-going youth experienced sudden and dramatic changes in their daily lives during the lockdown. With their regular schedules disrupted, increasing challenges of online education, demands of household responsibilities, rising uncertainty about examinations and career options, and the compulsion to live with restrictions, youth are at higher risk of developing increased distress during the lockdown (Jacob et al., 2020; Magson et al., 2021) . Students in higher education experienced ambiguity with regard to immediate and long-term career prospects. Uncertainty about the future has been directly linked to high levels of depression and anxiety (Beck & Haigh, 2014; Dar et al., 2017; Sundarasen et al., 2020) .",

Depression studies based on rating scales have generally reported point prevalence greater than 40% when compared to studies based on structured instruments, which report a point prevalence rate of 2-25%. The findings of this study add weight to existing findings that using a rating scale for a single-stage screening of participants yields higher estimates. A careful assessment of apparent variations in data among states in India needs to be made to get a better understanding of the prevalence of depression among youth in India and results must be interpreted with care (Grover et al., 2019) . Standardization of measurement tools, study design, and sample population are imperative for developing nationwide data of mental health indicators before policy decisions are made. The paucity of comparable pre-pandemic data on depression in this population makes it more difficult to delineate the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown accurately. Assessing for possible risk factors associated with depression, the current study did not find any significant linkages between levels of depression and socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, relationship status of participants, birth position, hostel stay, educational status of self and parents, and occupation levels of parents. These findings are inconsistent with the existing association of depression with residency in hostels, belonging to nuclear or joint family systems (Shelke et al., 2015) , mothers' education level, and mother's nature of occupation (Lodha et al., 2016) . Existing literature has found evidence of the association between female gender and depression before and during the pandemic (Magson et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2018; Terry et al., 2020; Urmila et al., 2017) . Some studies have pointed out possible measurement bias of the BDI to explain females getting higher scores than males, though findings have not been conclusive (de S\u00e1 Junior et al., 2019) . Contrary to such findings, this study found no significant gender effects, though overall percentages of symptomatic women were slightly more than that of men across mild (M = 17%, F = 18%), moderate (M = 16%, F = 18%), and severe (M = 16%, F = 17%) categories. In their study comparing depression among the youth of Peru, Ethiopia, Vietnam, and India during the pandemic, Porter et al. (2021) found similar results in Indian youth. One reason for variations observed in studies conducted during the pandemic could be the stress-inducing conditions imposed by the pandemic regardless of gender. Alternatively, this finding could support existing evidence that gender effects are more prominent in clinical populations rather than community samples (Compas et al., 1999) .",

Across genders, somatic symptoms were significantly more than cognitive-affective symptoms in symptomatic individuals, indicating the important role played by somatic symptoms in the early detection of depression. Somatization is the main reason why patients with depression end up seeking primary care, but it is also the primary cause of undetected depression as it diverts medical attention to other discrete medical conditions (Katon et al., 2004) . Hence, there is an urgent need for primary care physicians to assess somatic symptoms with concomitant cognitive-affective symptoms for the early detection of depression in youth. There is growing acceptance of culture as a fundamental factor in the presentation of psychological distress and it has been noted that people in collectivistic cultures have a tendency to somatize distress. People in such cultures commonly present with tiredness, sleep problems, and concentration difficulties when undergoing depression (Ryder et al., 2008) . Assessing for depression using the classical Western symptom collection dominated by mood and cognitions may have limited use in such cultural contexts.",

            "text": "In its wide use with various populations, the BDI-II has thrown up gender differences in symptom presentation, but findings have been inconsistent. The current study adds to this inconsistency. \"Changes in sleep patterns\" and \"sadness\" emerged as the most commonly experienced symptoms, although the former has been associated more with women and the latter has been associated more with men (Khesht-Masjedi et al., 2017) . Although the means of scores for \"difficulty in concentration\" and \"crying\" were higher for females, there were no significant differences across gender, which is in contrast to some studies that have found female gender associated with \"difficulties in concentration,\" \"crying,\" and rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987; Sund et al., 2001) . The mean scores for \"guilty feelings\" were higher in men than women, which contradicts the finding that women with depression experience more guilt (Silverstein, 2002) . Self-criticalness, punishment feelings, and feelings of being a failure were significantly more prominent in symptomatic men than women, lending credence to existing evidence that depression may be \"masked\" in men due to gender stereotypes and that masculinity in itself may impact how different men experience symptoms of depression. While some studies have found that women score higher than men on both somatic and cognitive-affective scales, others report that such differences may be sensitive to factors like age and the presence of psychological and physiological symptoms (Delisle et al., 2012; Dessotte et al., 2015; Romans et al., 2007; Silverstein, 2002) . The current study found that women experienced significantly more somatic symptoms when compared to men, although there was no significant difference in cognitive-affective symptoms. Such disparity has been attributed to biological factors and social aspects like cultural expectations and division of household work. The period of the lockdown has impacted both genders but when compared to men, women and girls face greater social, economic, and health risks. The increased burden of domestic duties and familial expectations like care for family members generally fall on women in collectivistic societies where gender roles are shaped by entrenched patriarchal norms (Davis & Williamson, 2019; Rivera et al., 2020) . Unequal distribution of roles and responsibilities, heightened monitoring and restrictions by family members, reduced personal freedom, increased risks of gender violence, and the perceived inability to challenge gender social norms and disparate power equations could contribute to significant somatic distress in women leading to symptoms like crying, loss of energy, fatigue, and inability to concentrate. Being socially isolated and cut off from supportive social networks and safe spaces due to university closure could add to the vulnerability of women in these cultural contexts, exacerbating somatic symptoms. The interplay of somatic and psychological symptoms has important implications for the personal and professional domains of women's lives. On the one hand, somatic symptoms lead to diagnoses unrelated to depression, while health conditions, related and unrelated to depression, augment depression scores.",

Participants of this study were actively engaged in academic and career-related activities and the lockdown may in part account for their keen awareness of difficulties in concentration, sadness, fatigue, disrupted sleep patterns, and self-criticalness triggered by environmental factors like fear about health, excessive media exposure to information about the pandemic, an excessive amount of time spent online, increased workload, and difficulties associated with non-optimal learning experiences during the pandemic including decreased sleep quality due to increased screen time (Salfi et al., 2021 ).",

Several socio-cultural factors impact the experience and expression of depression and the differential distribution of these factors across the country may account for such variations. This study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was a major stressor for the concerned population. The time period of the study, as well as the nature of tools used, could also lead to variations between studies conducted in India. Regardless, these wide variations demonstrate the need for studies to be conducted according to geographic and demographic factors. The generalizability of such findings to the rest of the nation may be somewhat limited given the wide variations that exist between sections of the population. Future studies in this area must be careful to connect findings to the context and methodological factors, even as they try to collate nationwide data.",

Depression in this critical stage of life can have several long-term consequences for the individual, families, and the community as a whole. In the wake of the uncertainties and stress posed by the ongoing pandemic, it is also important to assess the sources of stress for this age group and devise interventions at the individual and systemic levels, including the family, college and university, potential workplaces, and neighborhoods. As the pandemic rages on and with possibilities of such events in the future, data emerging from such studies could identify protective and mitigating factors while offering keys to ensuring mental health and resilience in youth.",
