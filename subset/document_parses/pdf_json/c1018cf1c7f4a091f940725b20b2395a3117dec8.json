The replicons are subgenomic constructs that can replicate autonomously and express viral nonstructural proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. They contain the exact sequence of HCV 5 -and 3 -UTRs [11] . There is a neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) just downstream of the IRES of the virus to ensure cell resistance to neomycin and its analogs such as Geneticin (G-418). The encephalomyocarditis virus IRES is also recruited downstream of the neo gene and just upstream of the viral nonstructural genes to ensure the translation of several subunits of the HCV replicase complex ( Figure 1B) . Our hypothesis was that the binding of mPUM to HCV IRES is able to repress neomycin phosphotransferase gene translation and this will increase cell cytotoxicity in the presence of G-418. As demonstrated in Figure 1C , our results showed that the cell viability of clone 5 cells decreased to 28.41% (p: 0.0036) at 72 h after transfection.",

Although the precise mechanism of the mPUM protein involvement in the reduction of HCV replication needs further investigation, it is most likely that this reduction is due to the binding to HCV IRES stem-loop IIIb. As a part of IRES structure, stem-loop IIIb plays a critical role in translation of the viral polyprotein through interaction with eIF-3 and 40S ribosomal subunit [9] . Any obstacle to such an interaction can decrease viral polyprotein translation. This is in agreement with our previous results of a luciferase reporter assay that showed more than 30% decrease in IRES-dependent translation of Firefly luciferase in the presence of mPUM protein targeted for stem-loop IIIb [8] . This was also in line with the results of our viability assay in Huh7.5 clone 5 cells, where the expression of mPUM protein in clone 5 cells in a medium supplemented with G-418 resulted in more than 70% reduction in cell viability. Although further studies are required, the potential binding of mPUM protein to HCV IRES in the replicon RNA may suppress IRES-dependent translation of neomycin phosphotransferase gene and induce cell cytotoxicity in the presence of G-418. In JFH-1-infected cells, moreover, the attachment of mPUM to the IRES may also lead to the reduction in viral polyprotein translation and subsequent decrease in the production of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Since nonstructural proteins comprise the main components of HCV replicase complex, their decline can lead to the reduction of HCV RNA replication [12] [13] [14] . Stem-loop III involves in the HCV replication not only by affecting HCV translation but also by enhancing RNA replication efficiency [6, 15, 16] . Addition of stem-loop III to stem-loops I and II, which are sufficient for HCV replication, augmented RNA replication to about 100-fold. Therefore, the binding of mPUM protein to stem-loop IIIb may also affect HCV replication through reduction of the efficiency of RNA replication.",

For example, siRNAs, DNAzymes and ribozymes have been designed to bind to 5 -UTR in order to trigger the cleavage of HCV IRES and subsequently to repress viral replication in cell culture. In agreement with our data, Korf et al. [22] demonstrated approximately 60% reduction in HCV replication, using siRNAs directed against stem-loops II and III. Moreover, Roy et al. [23] designed several DNAzymes targeting stem-loop IIIc with an inhibitory activity of approximately 70% reduction in replicon RNA synthesis. In another study, Chevalier et al. [24] showed a greater than 96% reduction in focus-forming units/ml infectious titer, using a siRNA targeting both 3 end of domain III and 5 end of domain IV involved in a pseudoknot-located upstream from the initiator codon. In our study, transfection of mPUM 48 h before infection with JFH-1 strain induced a greater than 98% reduction in viral RNA copy numbers/ml in the supernatant of Huh-7.5 cells, 9 days after infection.",

The cells were transfected by a plasmid-expressing Firefly luciferase under the control of HCV IRES (psiCHECK2-IRES) as control. Moreover, the cells were cotransfected with psiCHECK2-IRES and either a plasmid-expressing wtPUM or mPUM protein. Firefly luciferase expression level was evaluated 72 h after cotransfection. (B) Schematic organization of HCV genome (top) and a subgenomic replicon (bottom). While the translation of the genome to the viral polyprotein is HCV IRES-dependent in the bicistronic replicon system, translation of nonstructural proteins is EMCV IRES-dependent and translation of neo gene is HCV IRES-dependent. (C) Cell viability assay in Huh7.5 clone 5 cells. The effect of mPUM expression on the viability of cells expressing neo-resistant gene under the control of HCV IRES was evaluated at 72 h post-transfection in the presence of G-418 antibiotic selection pressure. (D) Western blot analysis for viral NS3 as well as wtPUM and mPUM expression. Cell lysates of naive nontransfected, wtPUM-and mPUM-transfected Huh7.5 clone 5 cells were analyzed.

Huh7.5 cells were transfected with pcDNA-mPUM or pcDNA-wtPUM, and then infected 48 h later with the JFH-1 virus. The JFH-1 GND strain infection and naive Huh7.5 cells were used as controls. Quantitative RT-PCR assay was performed on days 3, 6 and 9 after the infection. All data were normalized by naive Huh7.5 rates and one-way ANOVA test was used to determine statistical significance. The results are expressed as absolute numbers of genome copies per ml (mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 2). (B) Impact of mPUM protein expression on JFH1-induced cytopathic effects in Huh7.5 cells. Cytotoxicity assay was performed on mPUM-and wtPUM-expressing JFH1-infected Huh7.5 cells as well as JFH1-infected cells on days 3, 6 and 9 postinfection. The JFH-1 GND strain infection and naive Huh7.5 cells were used as controls. One-way ANOVA test was used to compare the results, which are expressed as mean percentage of cytotoxicity (mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 2). p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. The asterisk symbol (*) above each bar is in comparison with naive Huh7.5 cells. ANOVA: Analysis of variance; HCV: Hepatitis C virus; RT-PCR: Real-time PCR; SEM: Standard error of the mean.",
