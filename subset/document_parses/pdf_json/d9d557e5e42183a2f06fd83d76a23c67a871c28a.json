The context of significant restructuring of health organizations and regions in Ontario challenged the province's capacity to respond to COVID-19. A complex leadership structure, led by political leaders, with limited healthcare supply chain expertise at decision-making tables and a prioritization of \"hospitals first\" early in the first wave were described as challenges Ontario faced in managing the pandemic. A lack of supply chain digital infrastructure-and consequently, lack of available data-meant informed decision-making regarding supply utilization and demand forecasting was not possible. The Ontario case presents key lessons learned regarding the unintended consequences of lack of supply chain coordination across organizations, and the prioritization of hospitals and allocation strategies on Canada's most vulnerable population segments.",

In order for health services and public health to meet the unprecedented demands of the current and future pandemics, supply chain and logistics infrastructure must have the capacity to respond to disruptions to ensure that health teams, essential workers, and citizens have the products and equipment needed to contain spread, and for health services to achieve optimal outcomes for those who become infected. Supply chain in health systems source and distribute products to ensure health system teams have timely access to the essential products and equipment needed for care delivery in a timely, safe, and secure manner. Health services supply chain teams source and distribute everything from beds to ventilators, intravenous (IV) pumps and IV tubing, medications and vaccines, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and endotracheal tubes. Hospitals generally have well established supply chain processes and infrastructure, whereas, community agencies (e.g., long-term care, home care, and primary care) have little, if any supply chain infrastructure or expertise.",

A flood in 2012 at Sanofi Pasteur, the supplier of a bladder cancer drug, ImmuCyst, resulted in significant delays in cancer treatments for patients. 1 Pharmaceutical manufacturers were not able to increase production to meet demand due to the time it takes to source the ingredients and manufacture this drug. When Hurricane Maria knocked out the electrical grid in Puerto Rico in 2017, Baxter, one of the only manufacturers of IV bags in the United States, experienced severe stock shortage. 2 Canadian and U.S. hospitals were left without the needed supply of IV bags, limiting their ability to deliver intravenous medications for a number of weeks. The demand for IV bags globally skyrocketed, resulting in a 600% cost increase for hospitals that were all competing for a limited international supply. 2 Supply chain interruptions during public health crises are also well documented. A key lesson learned from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Ontario was the importance of the supply of protective equipment for health workers. Three of the 44 Canadians who died of SARS were healthcare workers as transmission of the virus was poorly understood. 3 In total, 400 persons became ill with SARS and 25,000 people were in quarantine. 4 Although public health practices and infection control procedures improved following the SARS epidemic, supply chain practices did not change and health supply chain research and evidence remain profoundly underdeveloped. A key finding of the Justice Campbell report foreshadows the context of the COVID-19 strategy in Ontario:",

Supply chain processes in Canadian health systems are highly varied in structure (e.g., centralized in some provinces and decentralized in others), with little coordination across jurisdictions, 5 and operate with little or no transparency, 6 resulting in leadership decisions described by one physician leader as \"flying blind\" while managing the COVID-19 pandemic. 7 This pandemic has laid bare the critical need for capacity to acquire and move products, equipment, and supplies to enable health teams to deliver essential care services. Health systems must strengthen supply chain processes, informed by empirical evidence of best practices and supply chain resilience. 8 This paper reports on case study research of the province of Ontario, revealing empirical evidence of supply chain processes and infrastructure within and across Ontario's provincial health system, during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. This evidence is analyzed relative to leadership strategies and policy to inform effective, agile, and responsive pandemic management for Canadian health systems. This case study is one of seven conducted to examine health supply chain capacity and infrastructure across Canada, the first national study of health supply chain, funded by CIHR (Ref. # VR5 172 669).",

Primary care, home care, and long-term care in Ontario function more autonomously, with little direct management by regional or provincial leaders and a mixed model of both privatized service organizations (e.g., residential care, laboratory, and pharmacy) and publicly funded care delivery. The public health system in Ontario is described as \"a collaborative effort between a variety of organizations, including the Ministry of Health, Public Health Ontario (PHO), 35 local Public Health Units (PHU), and other collaborative government partnerships.\" 11 Healthcare supply chain in Ontario is similarly decentralized, whereby healthcare organizations across Ontario manage supply chain processes autonomously, deciding on how best to manage supplies and products to meet the supply needs of their own organization. 12 The majority of Ontario hospitals participate in SSOs as well as GPOs to achieve savings through \"bulk purchasing\" of products and supplies. The SSOs and GPOs tend to work independently of each other with limited coordination across organizations. Purchasing decisions are based on the local budgets of single healthcare providers, focused primarily on achieving lowest cost. There is limited engagement of clinicians in procurement processes and the limited human resources to undertake supply chain management practices. 12 Following the outbreak of SARS in 2003 and H1N1 in 2009, there were many recommendations 13 to strengthen supply chain capacity in Ontario; however, few of these recommendations were implemented. When the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in Ontario, there was no centralized supply chain infrastructure and limited pandemic stockpile resources, which resulted in organizations having to source critical products, in competition with every other global jurisdiction.",

On March 2, 2020, a number of weeks following the first case of COVID-19 in Ontario, the Ministry of Health established a \"Health Command Table, \" initially with 21 members and then expanded to more than 500 participants. 17 Decisions were led primarily by government officials with daily press conferences announcing pandemic measures by the Premier of Ontario, and on occasion the Minister of Health. The size and complexity of the Command Table was viewed as slow to react to the dynamic changes in the pandemic's key events. Despite the significant number of stakeholders at the Command Table, organizations and stakeholder groups across the province functioned autonomously, which was consistent with the decentralized leadership structure across the province, resulting in a highly varied array of strategies and approaches to managing the pandemic.

Critical product inventories were dramatically reduced once regions in China were under quarantine and manufacturing capacity came to a halt. Allocation frameworks were a decisionmaking tool to guide decisions regarding the distribution of PPE products from provincial stockpiles to those organizations in greatest need. The goal of the allocation strategy was to conserve inventories of critical products until such time as PPE products could be sourced and procured, in order to reduce the risk of running out of critical products. A key informant describes: \"For our contract demand, they continued to provide some product within the context of the contract, but because of the sheer volumes of requests that they were getting, everybody went on allocation. You only got a certain percentage of what you were going to get, and the percentage was not going to keep up with our utilization.

The province's capacity to respond was further challenged by a large and complex leadership structure that had no clear line of accountability to organizations across the province, resulting in inconsistencies in efforts to manage the pandemic in each geographic region. There was no digital infrastructure to make visible the supply challenges, critical product inventories, or accuracy in rates of product demand utilization, which precluded data-driven decisions to optimize supply chain capacity to distribute critical products across the province. Limited representation of key areas of expertise, such as health supply chain and clinician leadership at decisionmaking tables, and lack of data and digital infrastructure to inform decisions or to accurately forecast utilization contributed to the many challenges evident in the Ontario case. The intense competition for critical products globally, and lack of supply chain management expertise further contributed to significant challenges for health organizations across the province, particularly organizations providing care to vulnerable populations, most notably Ontario seniors.",

Despite engaging more than 500 members in the Command Table, the ability to foster development of others, ensure clarity and consistency of communication, build a team able to work meaningfully together was not evident in this Ontario case.

Clarity of the direction and strategy for the pandemic response was very limited, and taking action at the provincial level was limited to a \"power and control\" strategy to impose public health restrictions, which were implemented with a high degree of variability across the province. Integration of organizational strategy to advance provincial-level responses was not possible due to the highly decentralized structure of health organizations across the province.

The province of Ontario was very early in a system transformation process, having dismantled the leadership teams and boards for each of the 14 local health integration networks across the province, leaving a significant gap in leadership infrastructure at the time the pandemic unfolded. Systems thinking, implementing effective processes across stakeholder groups, particularly across the many supply chain stakeholders, was not evident in the early phases of the pandemic. The processes implemented were widely viewed as slow to respond with lengthy implementation, resulting in \"building the bridge while driving over it.\" The virtual supply chain strategy relied on manual counts of critical products, which was then uploaded into a database to inform decisions. Distribution of critical products in short supply were allocated only after outbreaks were established, rather than being proactive in preventing outbreaks for high-risk populations such as seniors living in congregate settings. The crisis that emerged in long-term care was a clear indication of the limited capacity of the province of Ontario to adequately respond to the pandemic, hampered by a very decentralized leadership model, a transition toward health system restructuring, a lack of data and digital infrastructure to inform decisions, and a lack of supply chain infrastructure and capacity to coordinate efforts to source and procure the critical products needed to ensure safe work environments for the health workforce, and to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in high-risk communities and work environments.",

Effective leadership requires a results-oriented strategy that meaningfully engages others, clearly establishes direction, values the use of evidence, and is supported by data-driven decision-making. Achieving results necessarily requires accurate and accessible data to inform decisions, and evaluate effectiveness and outcomes of decisions, particularly supply chain capacity and outcomes, during events such as pandemics. Leaders must accurately measure the effectiveness and capacity of health systems to respond to such events in a manner that is equitable, and validated by data and evidence. c. System transformation is critical to any provincial health system response to crisis events such as a pandemic. Although Ontario was compromised in its response to this pandemic due to system restructuring, critical lessons learned must be carefully considered at the system level to inform and encourage system innovation to prepare Ontario for such events in future. Digital infrastructure that creates transparency of health system capacity to respond to surge in demand will be critical to Ontario's future capacity to respond to pandemic events. Data that is open, transparent, and accessible to all stakeholders is a strategic asset, particularly supply chain data, and enables collaboration and coordination across organizations to support effective and high performing coalitions of stakeholders to mobilize and advance emergency responses to events in future. Digitally-enabled health systems and supply chain infrastructure in particular, will be strategic assets able to sustain health system capacity to effectively and proactively manage pandemic events well into Ontario's future.",
