It would therefore be sensible for further guidance on when such strict measures should apply. Our study confirms the success of risk-stratifying patients in accordance with the Covid-19 ENT UK guidelines, such that low-risk patients do not require immediate FNE. We also recommend the use of low-dose CT neck over lateral soft tissue neck X-ray, as the latter provides little clinical use. However, if sufficient PPE is available, FNE remains a supportive adjunct to investigation of these patients.",

However, we would advise that this only be the case when there is strict evidence to support the diagnosis; for example, in cases of repeat and moderate-or high-risk presentations.",
