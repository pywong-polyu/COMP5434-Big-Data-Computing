These lesions might have dusky ecchymotic centers yet without blistering or necrosis. Conjunctivae and mucosal membranes are not involved. Typically, hands and feet are swollen due to angioedema. Dermatographism is a common finding. Affected children otherwise appear healthy and nontoxic. A short-duration fever and mild respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were observed. Diagnosis was made on a clinical basis, and skin biopsy was not required. This condition is typically selflimited, resolving over a one-week period. Antihistamines use may be of benefit. Due to its morphology, urticaria multiforme might be misdiagnosed as erythema multiforme or serum sickness-like reactions. Despite distinct clinical features, urticaria multiforme seems to be underrecognized. Urticaria multiforme is believed to be triggered by antecedent infections. In one case series, most of the patients had upper respiratory tract infections or otitis media. 8 Thorough evaluation for infectious etiology is typically unsuccessful. In the aforementioned paper, associated pathogens were identified in three patients (adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes). 8 Children with urticaria multiforme may have a recent history of medication use, mainly antibiotics. Antimicrobials associated with acute annular urticaria predominantly include amoxicillin, cephalosporines and macrolides.",
