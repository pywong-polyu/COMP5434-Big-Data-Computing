This novel coronavirus is the cause of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has resulted in millions of confirmed cases and thousands of deaths. The control of an unprecedented outbreak demands a plethora of comprehensive measures to be adopted, such as thermal scanning, tracking applications, and devices. However, the consequences of the usage of these solutions cannot be predictable a priori, especially their impact on civil rights and liberties.",

Relevant restrictions are exceptionally considered legitimate, when it is necessary for reasons of public interest, such as the advocacy of public health. It is hence vital that the personal health data, extremely sensitive information of every data subject, are processed exclusively for the COVID-19 outbreak, according with the proportionality, necessity, and the other fundamental principles of the processing of personal data. 4 Malpractice could provoke, inter alia, phenomena of stigmatization and discrimination against infected individuals.",
