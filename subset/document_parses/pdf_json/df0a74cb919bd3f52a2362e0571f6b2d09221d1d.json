Methods: We retrospectively compared the rates of positive screening tests for postpartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of 9 or more or self-injury factors) and liaison/psychiatric intervention rates between pre-pandemic and pandemic groups of postpartum women who delivered a live birth at our tertiary perinatal center in Yokohama, Japan between January 2019 and May 2020. Those whose postpartum health screening was performed in 2019 (March-June 2019) were considered the pre-pandemic group, and those whose screening was performed between March and June 2020 were considered the pandemic group. Adjustments were made for maternal background, pregnancy, and delivery outcomes, including a history of psychiatric disorders, complications, preterm delivery, NICU admission, and maternal postpartum complications, and the data were analyzed using a logistic regression analysis. Results: Postpartum health screenings were performed on 339 women before the pandemic and 279 women during the pandemic. Positive screening rates for postpartum depression did not change before and during the pandemic (adjusted odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 0.885-2.46). Conclusions: There was no apparent increase in maternal psychological stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Yokohama, Japan. Postpartum women responded differently in settings with varied levels of disease severity and social restrictions.",

Zanardo et al. 7 compared the EPDS scores of puerperal women in Northeast Italy during the period of government restrictions on movement and the same period in the previous year and reported a significantly higher total score of 2.16 points. Research from China 6 regarding mental health during pregnancy and a comparison of thoughts of self-harm from before and after the report of COVID-19 human-to-human transmission showed a 2.85-fold increase in the risk of self-harm. In contrast to such reports, our results indicated that the median EPDS score was unchanged from pre-pandemic to pandemic, the rate of high EPDS score and the self-injury factor were also unchanged. The most likely reason for the difference in maternal psychological stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic between Japan and other countries is that the number of COVID-19 patients in Japan and the extent of their illness was less than that of other countries. 15 In addition, there were no administrative lockdowns and only a few restrictions in Japan. In previous reports from China and Italy, 6, 7 moving between cities and going out were severely restricted. In contrast, in Japan, people could go out freely and without penalty. For preventative measures against infection at our hospital, we did not allow partners to attend deliveries, restricted visits to women by family members and friends during hospitalization, and placed restrictions on accompanying family members or friends for prenatal checkups. However, these factors did not appear to have affected the EPDS score. There was also no increase in women requiring liaison psychiatric intervention during the pandemic in univariate analysis. The EPDS is only a screening tool and cannot be used for diagnosis. In Japan, an EPDS score of nine or more points is considered positive with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 93%. 12 The high false-positive rate may be the reason why no difference was observed. However, there was no difference in liaison psychiatric intervention rates in univariate analysis, which may indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic did not worsen psychological stress significantly enough to require intervention.",

This means that it is difficult to confirm that it represents the impact on pregnant and puerperal women in different parts of Japan. Second, we administered the EPDS in the postpartum period and were neither able to consider all possible stressors experienced during pregnancy nor assess pregnant women who required intervention during pregnancy. Moreover, because of the small number of interventions, it was not possible to perform the multivariate analysis of the rate of liaison psychiatric interventions. Finally, when the infection persists or additional administrative measures are taken, the psychological stress of these factors is expected to be worsened as compared to the results of this study. In other words, there may still be room for prevention in Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve mental healthcare measures under the current situation where the pandemic is still widespread.",
