Rapid reconfiguration was required to introduce new assays at high capacity for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, while maintaining existing services. Aim The aim of this national survey was to capture Laboratory Medicine's response across the Republic of Ireland during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An electronic survey developed using Microsoft Forms\u00ae was emailed on 5 October 2020 to 53 local representatives of the PeriAnalytic and Laboratory Medicine Society (PALMSoc), reaching 38 separate pathology departments in the country. Results A total of 45 responses from 38 laboratories were received (72% response rate) representing a range of departments and disciplines. Most laboratories (63%) introduced new tests, and in a time frame of less than 6 weeks (80%). Point-of-care testing (POCT) played a significant role in the response to COVID-19, with almost half of respondents (47%) reporting that additional equipment was introduced. Maintenance of the Quality Management System (QMS) proved challenging, with 60% of respondents indicating that not all aspects were sustained. When asked about changes to staff rostering, 98% of respondents reported that changes were made. All adjustments were made despite staffing challenges; only 18% of respondents described the staffing levels in their department as 100% prior to the onset of the first wave. Conclusions This study confirms an agile and resilient response to the COVID-19 pandemic from Ireland's Laboratory Medicine services despite many economic and staffing challenges.",

Twenty-nine percent of these reported a reduction of 0-25%, 36% reported a reduction of 25-50% and 29% reported a reduction of 50-75% of expected workload. Respondents also made valuable use of any available time with 63% introducing new tests in response to the pandemic, the majority of which were in Microbiology departments (Fig. 1d ). The introduction of new tests was determined by requests from clinical users (70%) and/or for patient management reasons (60%), with literature review and research potential being a lesser driver of change. The majority of these tests (80%) were introduced in a time frame of less than 6 weeks. Despite this, standard protocols were maintained and 100% of respondents enrolled new tests in External Quality Assessment (EQA) schemes. Twenty-one percent of respondents also reported withdrawal of some tests. Reasons given included a reduction in demand, unmanageable workload and redeployment Tests withdrawn included faecal analysis, andrology services, food and water testing and low-throughput assays. Point-of-care testing (POCT) played a significant role in the response to COVID-19, with almost half of respondents (47%) reporting that additional POCT equipment was introduced. When extrapolated, the additional POCT equipment referred to blood gas analysers in all institutions, with one including glucometers also. Almost all respondents reported that verification of new instrumentation was completed prior to installation. As part of the response to COVID-19, the National Clinical Pathology Programme developed a rapid verification protocol for installation of blood gas analysers which was used by 50% of respondents (Fig. 1e) .",

Despite these efforts, 32% of respondents reported that there was an overall increase in total wastage of red cells of between 0 and 25% during this period. Prior to the onset of the first wave, in an effort to preserve stock and reduce wastage, an initiative was introduced across a number of hospitals to reroute blood products to other hospitals to ensure their usage. This continued during the pandemic. However, three laboratories reported that they had to extend the rerouting of blood products.

Individual graphs labelled (a) to (b) represent answers to two questions: (a) immediately prior to COVID-19 what were the staffing levels in your department and (b) during the course of the pandemic were staffing levels maintained additional hyper-inflammatory, cardiac and haemostasis biomarkers [8, [10] [11] [12] [13] was also implemented (or existing capacity increased, where these tests were already available).",

Increased volumes of requests for inflammatory biomarkers such as ferritin, and CRP were seen, as well as an increased test repertoire, which was reported by 66% of respondents, mostly within a very short time frame of 6 weeks or less. Changes in pre-analytical processes and staff rosters were also rapidly implemented at many sites. Unsurprisingly, the majority of new tests were in Microbiology departments, with the introduction of molecular testing for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Novel tests were also introduced, such as IL-6 in clinical chemistry laboratories. POCT played a significant role in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients and laboratories across the country rose to the challenge, with nearly half of respondents reporting introduction of additional POCT instrumentation. In line with best practice and quality management, all respondents reported verification protocols were followed including IQC and EQA. The introduction of additional tests e.g. cytokine markers and use of specific panels has been widely reported [7, 10] .",

These changes were also reported in a European survey where the use of surgical masks was report in 82% of respondents. However, the use of social distancing provided a mixed response with 24.6% of respondents advising obligatory requirements for surgical masks and social distancing, 16.9% obligatory requirement for social distancing but not for the use of masks, the remaining did not report any obligatory requirements for social distancing [14] .",

During phase 1 of the pandemic, the Irish Blood Transfusion Board also experienced the impact of the lockdown which impacted on the amount of blood donations. Despite best efforts, there were some reports of increased product wastage by 0-25%, however, increased rerouting of products ensured this was kept to a minimum.",

This study confirms the extent of the staffing deficit, with some respondents reporting shortage of staffing levels entering into the pandemic but also with further decrease in staffing levels when exiting the first wave. As with all areas in healthcare, it is important we learn the lessons from this exceptional period in our history.
