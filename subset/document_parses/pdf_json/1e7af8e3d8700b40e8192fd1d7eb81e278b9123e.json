To assess the case fatality rate (CFR) in patients with cancer during this wave of the pandemic, we performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 cases seen in a New York hospital system between December 1, 2021 and January 17, 2022. A total of 285 patients with COVID-19 and cancer were identified: 223 with solid tumors and 62 with hematologic malignancies. A CFR of 14/285 (4.9%) was identified, and mortality was associated with increased age, metastatic involvement, and increased co-morbidities. Mortality in the cancer cohort was higher when compared to a control cohort (odds ratio [OR] 2.57 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-4.56, p = 0.0022]) after adjusting for age, gender, and vaccine status. These results highlight increased mortality in patients with cancer during the recent COVID-19 wave, although mortality was significantly lower than with the initial variant, likely due to vaccination, better therapeutics, and possibly decreased virulence. Mortality among patients with cancer was associated with identifiable risk factors and comorbidities.",

A large number of mutations in the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein allow the Omicron variant to spread quickly through communities in the USA (Cele et al., 2021) . We and others have previously demonstrated an elevated CFR for cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Liu et al., 2021; Mehta et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021) . To determine the CFR during this present Omicron wave of the pandemic, a total of 285 patients with cancer and COVID-19 were identified in the Montefiore Health System (New York) from December 1, 2021 to January 17, 2022. Of this patient cohort, 270 (95%) patients tested positive for COVID-19 after December 19, 2021. Even though we did not genotype viral isolates, more than 90% of viral isolates in December starting December 19, 2021, and 95%-100% starting January, were Omicron variants in both the Montefiore Health System and NYC; this shows that our cohort consisted predominantly of patients infected with the Omicron variant (https://www1.nyc. gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/ omicron-variant-report-jan-13-22.pdf).",

In several cases, patients acquired COVID-19 while admitted to an inpatient facility. The absence of respiratory symptoms and/ or findings of hypoxia in several patients suggested that these patients had incidental COVID-19 infections but died from their underlying cancer diagnoses (5 of 14). Of note, all the patients from this cohort who had received booster vaccinations appeared to have died from other underlying causes with incidental COVID-19 infection. Second, a cohort of patients had readily identifiable immune predispositions for a poor outcome with COVID-19 with either: (1) a lack of immunization, poor and/or partial immunization status (n = 3; Ad26. COV2.S only or mRNAx1) or (2) underlying severe immune suppression (n = 3; one with advanced AIDS and two patients with a documented poor or nonresponse by anti-Spike antibody testing to COVID-19 vaccination).

In addition, 27/206 (13%) of the vaccinated patients in our cancer cohort had received the Ad26.CoV2.S vaccine, with 21 (10%) having received just one dose. One dose of the Ad26.CoV2.S vaccine is now considered an inferior vaccination strategy due to waning immunity (Lin et al., 2022) , and this has also been demonstrated in our study with lower IgG titers specifically in cancer patients compared with mRNAbased vaccines (Thakkar et al., 2021) .

            "text": "Cohort: Data from patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between December 1, 2021 until January 17, 2022 were extracted from the electronic medical record from an urban, academic medical health system (Montefiore) encompassing multiple hospitals in New York City and Westchester County. Patients with a cancer diagnosis were identified as those with a history of a pathologically confirmed malignancy via histology or cytology. The authors conducted a manual retrospective review to verify the diagnosis of malignancy and collect clinical data. Patients identified as having benign neoplasms, patients with local skin cancer requiring only excision, and patients with no available information regarding cancer treatment were excluded. Demographic information and clinical information such as cancer diagnosis, comorbidities, chemotherapy and/or radiation in the past 90 days, immunotherapy in the past 90 days, and the presence of metastatic disease were recorded. If a patient had more than one malignancy (n=6), the determination of whether a malignancy was solid or hematologic malignancy was by which malignancy required either the most recent treatment or required the most active management at the time of the COVID-19 diagnosis. Vaccination status, including number of doses and specific vaccine given, was also recorded if available. \"Fully vaccinated\" patients were defined as patients with 2 doses of a BNT162b2 (BioNTech, Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna, NIAID), or one dose of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson and Johnson) vaccine. COVID-19 symptoms and severity were recorded; many asymptomatic patients were tested due to a testing requirement upon hospital admission or prior to planned procedures. SARS-CoV-2 status was determined by reverse transcriptase qPCR for all patients. Data on the need for emergency room visit, hospital admission, ICU admission, mortality and when the patient tested positive for COVID-19 and received their vaccines were collected for all patients. Data collection was finalized on January 27, 2022 to ensure a minimum of 10 days follow up after the diagnosis of COVID-19. All expired cancer patient's case was adjudicated as to apparent cause of death by one author (BH) with adjudication call confirmed by consensus.A control group of individuals without malignancy diagnosed with COVID-19 during the same time period at our institution was compared to the cancer cohort using age and gender matched controls. Case fatality rates of cancer patients were compared to the control group. Viral genome sequencing of the individual patients in our cohort to determine the specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 was not performed. In our cohort, 94% of patients in our cohort tested positive for COVID-19 after 12/22/2021. At this time, Omicron had largely become the predominant variant in New York City, with 94% of COVID-19 cases being Omicron by random sampling (https://www.gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/). By 12/31/2021, nearly 99% of all COVID-19 cases were Omicron. Pilot testing conducted at Montefiore showed 61/62 (95%) of patients were positive for Omicron variant.",

The first statistical analysis was with multivariable logistic regression, modeling mortality dependent on cancer status and adjusting for age and gender as confounders. The second analysis was with a 5-1 nearest neighbor pairing of controls to cancer by propensity score based on age and gender, then running a Fisher's exact test on the 2x2 mortality by cancer contingency table.Consort diagram depicting the cohort determination used for the 5-1 nearest neighbor pairing of controls to cancer based on age and gender. A fisher exact test on the 2x2 mortality by cancer contingency table was used to determine an odds ratio and association.",
