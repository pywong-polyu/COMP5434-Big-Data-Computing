Using SHAPE probing, we explore the secondary structure of the yeast Ty1 retrotransposon RNA genome in its native in vivo state and under defined in vitro conditions. Comparative analyses reveal the strong impact of the cellular environment on folding of Ty1 RNA. In vivo, Ty1 genome RNA is significantly less structured and more dynamic but retains specific well-structured regions harboring functional cis-acting sequences. Ribosomes participate in the unfolding and remodeling of Ty1 RNA, and inhibition of translation initiation stabilizes Ty1 RNA structure. Together, our findings support the dual role of Ty1 genomic RNA as a template for protein synthesis and reverse transcription. This study also contributes to understanding how a complex multifunctional RNA genome folds in vivo, and strengthens the need for studying RNA structure in its natural cellular context.",

Genome-wide in vitro, in virio and ex virio RNA structure models were presented for several infectious RNA viruses (1) . However, since these RNA structure models may not reflect conditions in vivo, elucidating the native structure of viral RNA genomes exposed to the cellular environment is necessary to reach a comprehensive view for how genome architecture influences viral replication. In vivo RNA structure models are available for Zika and Dengue viruses (Flaviviridae), and the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2) (3) (4) (5) . There is also a transcriptomewide in vivo secondary structure model of influenza A virus (IAV) mRNAs (Orthomyxoviridae) (6) . These studies reveal important differences in the in vivo folding of viral RNAs, but it remains unclear what factors account for remodeling of the structure of viral RNAs in cells.",

            "text": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ty1-5 retrotransposons continue to provide fundamental insights into the mechanism of retrotransposition and the impact of retroelements on eukaryotic cells (8, 9, 14) . Compared to other eukaryotes, the compact yeast genome contains a relatively small fraction of transposon sequences (1.3-3.4%) (15) . Except for Ty3, yeast Ty elements belong to Ty1/Copia family, and Ty1 is the most abundant mobile genetic element in many S. cerevisiae strains (16) . Ty1 resembles simple retroviruses, but lacks an ENV (envelope) gene required for infectivity (17) . Ty1 gRNA is 5.6-kb long and contains two partially overlapping GAG and POL ORFs, flanked by a 53-nt 5 UTR and 318-nt 3 UTR (18) . Ty1 transcripts are not spliced and about 15% of total Ty1 gRNA is polyadenylated. Unlike cellular mRNAs, however, Ty1 transcripts lacking a poly(A) tail do not undergo rapid degradation (19, 20) . Ty1 gRNA's unusual stability (21) contributes to its high abundance, comprising about 0.8% of total cellular RNA (22) . Cytoplasmic Ty1 gRNA is utilized as mRNA for translation of Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein or is directed to cytoplasmic foci, termed retrosomes (19) , where full-length Ty1 gRNA and proteins assemble into virus like particles (VLPs) (23) . Within the VLP, Ty1 gRNA is reverse transcribed to a linear dsDNA copy that integrates predominantly upstream of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . Numerous functional studies show that analogous to retroviruses, the 5 and 3 termini of Ty1 gRNA are rich in regulatory sequences directly involved in encapsidation, dimerization, cyclization and reverse transcription (25, (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) .",

However, the in vivo structure of Ty1 gRNA or other LTR-retrotransposon transcripts has not been determined. Moreover, as compared to Escherichia coli, plant or mammalian cells, much less is known about the folding of mRNA in yeast (34) . The first transcriptome-wide measurement of yeast mRNA structure was performed in vitro using an enzymatic PARS method (Parallel Analysis of RNA Structure), which suggested that mRNA transcripts with similar biological functions or cellular localization have common structural features (35) . PARS analysis also suggests that yeast mRNAs contain more secondary structure in the coding sequences (CDSs) compared to the untranslated regions (UTRs), and unstructured sequences adjacent to the start codon is positively correlated with translation efficiency (TE). In contrast, transcriptome-wide DMS-seq mapping in vivo suggests that yeast mRNAs are largely unfolded, and secondary structures are similar in the CDS and the UTRs (36) . Also, the correlation between the CDS structure and ribosome occupancy is not detected. Therefore, reconciling RNA structures determined in vitro with those determined in vivo is required to understand how structure relates to function.",

Using SHAPE probing, we establish the secondary structure of the entire Ty1 RNA genome in its native in vivo state as well as under defined in vitro conditions. We find that in vivo Ty1 gRNA undergoes significant remodeling, is more dynamic and strongly destabilized, in large part by translating ribosomes. Nevertheless, Ty1 gRNA still contains well-structured regions harboring functional cissequences. The present work increases our understanding of viral RNA folding in living cells, and helps explain the interplay between translation and RNA structure. Furthermore, we show that commonly used SHAPE reagents, NMIA, NAI and 1M7 robustly modify RNA in yeast, as evidenced by strong correlations between position-dependent reactivities in vivo for all three reagents.",

Some lowSS regions were expanded or combined to preserve the entirety of helices predicted in the MFE structure. The pseudoknot helix was ignored in lowSS regions identification, because its presence caused the lowSS region 1 extension to high entropy and low base-pair probability regions. RNA structures were visualized with VARNA (http://varna-gui.software.informer. com/) (44) .",

            "text": "We used SHAPE followed by capillary electrophoresis to explore the structure of gRNA of an active Ty1 retrotransposon at single-nucleotide resolution. We probed Ty1 gRNA structure under three experimental conditions: in S. paradoxus cells expressing an active Ty1 element, in vitro in the absence of cellular components, and in cells partially inhibited for translation following treatment with kasugamycin ( Figure 1A ). The parental yeast strain DG1768 lacks fulllength chromosomal Ty1 sequences [(37) and Garfinkel and Bergman, unpublished results], and expression of Ty1 occurs exclusively from a multicopy pGTy1 plasmid driven by the inducible GAL1 promoter (23, 46) . Galactose induction produces a high level of correctly initiated Ty1 RNA that participates in all steps of the replication cycle, including translation, co-localization into retrosomes, encapsidation into VLPs, and reverse transcription (38) . The resulting cDNA copy integrates into host DNA, and a high frequency of Ty1 retromobility can be measured. Based on the available data, we assume that the major fraction of Ty1 RNA is present in the cytoplasm or associated with retrosomes, and a much smaller amount is packaged in VLPs (38) . As this approach allowed us to obtain SHAPE reactivity data from a homogenous Ty1 gRNA population, a more reliable RNA secondary structure model was gener-ated. In contrast, the widely used S. cerevisiae S288c laboratory strain background contains 32 full length Ty1 elements comprised of three subfamilies: Ty1, Ty1/Ty2 hybrids, and the ancestral Ty1 element (15, 47, 48) . Ty1 elements are expressed at different levels that vary up to 50-fold, with 75% of total Ty1 expression coming from eleven highly expressed elements, and eight of these are Ty1/Ty2 hybrids (49) . Additionally, some full length Ty1 copies contain deletions and mutations that may affect transposition, but they can be still expressed.",

Generally, SHAPE reactivities are inversely proportional to local nucleotide conformations, such that flexible or unpaired nucleotides are reactive, while structurally constrained or base-paired nucleotides tend to be less reactive (51) . Diverse cell types have different permeabilities to SHAPE reagents, and in general, those growing in a suspension culture are more permeable than adherent cell lines (52) . Surprisingly little is known about yeast permeability to SHAPE reagents and only NAI (2-methylnicotinic acid imidazolide) has been used in SHAPE analyses in yeast (53) (54) (55) . To the best of our knowledge, other well-validated SHAPE reagents, such as NMIA (N-methylisatoic anhydride) or closely related 1M7 (1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride) have not been used for RNA structure mapping in yeast, however, their ability to modify RNA occurs in other cell types (52, (56) (57) (58) (59) .

            "text": "SHAPE reagents have local-structure and nucleobase biases that can impact reactivity profiles (52, 61, 62) . All prior studies of Ty1 RNA structure have been performed using NMIA as the probing reagent (30, 32, 33, 63) . We reasoned that the application of the same SHAPE reagent for Ty1 RNA structure mapping in vivo would allow for direct and unbiased comparison of reactivity patterns with those presented for Ty1 RNA 5 terminal region in virio and ex virio (33) . This approach also facilitates detection of NMIA reactivity changes in vivo that result from Gaginduced RNA dimerization (30) , pseudoknot formation (32, 33) , and primer tRNA annealing (30, 33) . Therefore, we initially tested the ability of NMIA to modify the 5 end of Ty1 gRNA in yeast, and compared this data with that obtained from NAI and 1M7 probing. We clearly detected high reactivity signals well above background for all three reagents using capillary electrophoresis for analysis of adduct-induced cDNA truncations ( Figure 1B ). Since the signal-to-background ratio is the raw measurement of structure-dependent RNA modification, these results show that NMIA, NAI and 1M7 robustly modify RNA in S. paradoxus. Additionally, E. coli and S. cerevisiae treated with NMIA also displayed high reactivity above the background ( Figure 1B ). Our data indicate that NAI is slightly more efficient than NMIA in both yeast and E. coli, but a recent study suggests that NAI has stronger nucleotide biases and less effectively differentiates paired and unpaired C and G residues (52) . Despite that, we observed strong correlations between position-dependent NMIA, 1M7 and NAI reactivities in vivo, but some local single-nucleotide reactivity differences were also detected ( Figure 1C) . Therefore, the reactivity patterns obtained with the same SHAPE reagents are more informative for detailed analysis of RNA structure alterations specific for diverse biological or experimental states. Using NMIA, we obtained high-quality SHAPE data for 98% of the nucleotides in the Ty1 gRNA in vivo and under defined conditions in vitro. SHAPE data derived from in vivo and in vitro experiments were used for structural modeling of Ty1 gRNA using SuperFold pipeline, which incorporates a windowing approach along with the Partition and Fold functions implemented in RNAstructure (41, 42) .",

The difference in overall median SHAPE reactivities between in vivo and in vitro Ty1 gRNAs was smaller than expected (0.07) for such distinct environmental conditions ( Figure 2A) . However, the correlation between datasets from these two states was moderate (r = 0.49), which indicates a significant change in the pattern of SHAPE modifications in vivo ( Figure 2B ). In contrast to experiments under defined in vitro conditions, SHAPE reactivities in vivo are dependent not only on local nucleotide flexibility, but also on interactions with proteins or other RNA molecules (59, 64) . In general, increased in vivo SHAPE reactivities, relative to the in vitro state, usually reflect RNA conformational changes induced by the cellular environment, whereas decreased reactivity in vivo tends to reflect the binding of proteins and other biomolecules (65) . The comparison of median SHAPE reactivity profiles across the Ty1 RNA genome showed that many regions were significantly more reactive in vivo than in vitro, some were less modified in vivo, and several had quite similar reactivity in both states ( Figure 2C, D) . Overall, the differences in SHAPE reactivity between both states ( SHAPE, Figure 2D ) suggest there is a strong destabilization of Ty1 gRNA in the cellular environment, and the few specific regions protected from NMIA modification in vivo may serve as protein binding sites. However, all protected regions are probably not detected due to strong destabilization of RNA structure in vivo that reduces the impact of protein binding on the total SHAPE reactivity measurement.",

The SHAPE reactivity at any given nucleotide position does not provide information about a single RNA structure but represents the average reactivity over the ensemble of all coexisting RNA structures (66, 67) . Nucleotides with low SHAPE reactivity (<0.4) are conformationally constrained and likely to be double-stranded in most conformers, whereas those with intermediate reactivity may be involved in diverse coexisting RNA conformations (68) . To consider the entire structural ensemble, we calculated a probability for each base pair across all SHAPE-directed structures predicted for the Ty1 RNA in vitro and in vivo (45) . A significant increase in the number of low-probability base pairs and a concurrent decrease of high-probability pairings was detected in vivo ( Figures 2G and 3C, F) . Consistent with these findings, Shannon (base-pairing) entropy distributions indicated that 2-fold fewer nucleotides form well-defined structures (with low entropy) in vivo and the median entropy was significantly higher than in vitro (0.11 and 0.04, respectively) ( Figures 2H and 3B, E) .

Importantly, RNA regions with persistent stable structural motifs tend to be functionally important and contain cis-acting regulatory sequences (73) (74) (75) . Based on low SHAPE and low Shannon entropy metrics (lowSS regions), we identified 11 lowSS regions within in vivo and in vitro Ty1 RNAs ( Figure 3B ,E; numbered dark violet strips). They were separated by conformationally dynamic regions that exhibited higher Shannon entropy even if SHAPE values remained below the global median reactivity. The 5 and 3 terminal lowSS regions (regions 1 and 11) detected in vivo correspond well with sequences required for transposition of a minimal Ty1 element when Gag and Gag-Pol are provided in trans (28, 76) . The 5 and 3 ends of Ty1 RNA contain cis-acting sequences directly involved in retromobility, such as palindromes (PAL) required for Ty1 RNA dimerization, PBS, BOX0 and BOX1 that anneal with primer tRNA i Met , CYC5 and CYC3 required for genome cyclization, and the polypurine tract, which is required for plus-strand synthesis (23,25,28-30,32) ( Figure 3A) . These important RNA sequences were embedded in low SS regions identified in vivo. Thus, our data highlight the correlation between well-determined RNA conformation and biological function. An interesting but expected exception is the sequence mediating Ty1 translational frameshifting. Although the frameshift heptamer is not nested within a well-structured region, Ty1 frameshifting depends on the low abundance of a specific isoacceptor tRNA and does not require a specific RNA structure (77) .",

Our data indicate that such regions in Ty1 gRNA exhibit equal or higher reactivity values than the median reactivity in each state. A decrease in SHAPE reactivity at boundary RNA regions is also not detected for Zika and Dengue gRNA in vivo, suggesting different strategies of ribosome elongation regulation (3).

SuperFold takes a windowing approach, combines base pairs predicted for overlapping windows, incorporates base pairs with the highest probabili-ties (>99%), and the final structure is predicted by requiring base pairs that occur in more than one-half of the windows. Comparing the resulting MFE structures in terms of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) showed a significant difference in the folding of Ty1 RNAs. Both parameters were in the range of 49-55%, which indicated that only about half of the base pairs were shared between in vitro and in vivo MFE structures, while the rest of the parings remained unique for each model (Figure 4A, B) . Despite these differences, roughly 50% of the nucleotides were predicted to be base-paired in both MFE structures, suggesting similar levels of Ty1 gRNA structure in vitro and in vivo (Figure 4E ). In contrast, analysis of SHAPE reactivities, basepairing probabilities and Shannon entropies strongly suggest that Ty1 gRNA structure is destabilized in yeast cells. A single MFE model, even predicted as a consensus structure, represents one conformer from an ensemble of possible RNA conformers with similar free energies ( G) (42, 45) . Thus, focusing on a single MFE structure can lead to an incomplete or biased understanding of RNA folding, especially for structurally dynamic long RNAs.",

Therefore, we compared the MFE structures of Ty1 RNAs across all identified in vivo and in vitro lowSS regions by calculating a sensitivity value and PPV for these selected RNA segments. Most of the base pairs predicted in the in vivo lowSS regions were retained in the in vitro MFE structure, even if they were not in lowSS regions of the in vitro RNA (median sensitivity and PPV -92% and 76%) ( Figure 4C ). This trend was not observed when we compared base pairs from in vitro lowSS regions with the in vivo MFE structure (median sensitivity and PPV -30.5% and 38.5%) ( Figure 4D ). However, higher structural similarity was found for lowSS regions that partially overlapped in in vitro and in vivo Ty1 gRNA. Lower sensitivity and PPV metrics for overlapping region 1 can be caused by cis-acting sequences that mediate inter-and intramolecular RNA interactions that may occur in vivo but not in vitro (see below). Together, these analyses suggest that a large fraction of well-defined structural motifs detected in vivo are preserved in vitro, but not vice versa.",

HP bps are predicted with the highest confidence and are more likely to be present in the gRNA structure (45) . Although a similar number of MFE base pairs was predicted for both Ty1 gRNA states, the contribution of high-probability base pairs in the in vivo MFE structure was much lower. Accordingly, 17% of Ty1 gRNA nucleotides participated in HP bps in vivo, representing 37.5% of the base pairs in the MFE structure, whereas 34.1% of nucleotides were involved in HP bps in vitro, and they represented 68% of the MFE base pairs (Figure 4E, F) . We found that only 39% of in vitro HP bps were also predicted to occur in the in vivo MFE structure, while almost 80% of in vivo HP bps were shared with in vitro MFE structure ( Figure 4F ). This disparity arises from the lower number of HP bps predicted for the in vivo model of Ty1 gRNA. We observed that among HP bps the short-range interactions representing locally stable secondary RNA structures were preferentially shared between both Ty1 gRNA states ( Figure 4G ). In contrast, a majority of highly probable longer-range base pairings in vitro were disrupted or became less probable in vivo. These analyses confirm that Ty1 gRNA possesses a significantly lower and more dynamic structure in vivo, and show that only part of stable (highly probable) base pairs in vitro are retained in vivo, consistent with the findings from comparison of the MFE structures across lowSS regions.",

            "text": "We analyzed SHAPE reactivity changes in the 5 -end of Ty1 gRNA in more detail to establish whether critical RNA -RNA interactions could occur in vivo prior to packaging into VLPs. Ty1 gRNA dimerization, cyclization or primer tRNA annealing do not occur under the in vitro conditions employed here because Ty1 proteins such as Gag and tRNA are absent in the analysis. RNA sequences involved in tRNA i Met binding (PBS, BOX0, and BOX1) and genome dimerization (PAL1 and PAL2) were engaged in intramolecular base-pairing in vitro, and we did not detect changes in reactivity patterns that could directly support these processes occurring in vivo ( Figure 5A ). This problem arises from a limitation of the SHAPE method that, like other classical RNA structure mapping techniques, cannot discriminate intra-from intermolecular base-pairing. However, changes in reactivity of nucleotides separating PALs were detected in vivo, analogous to those detected in VLPs and in Gag-induced Ty1 RNA dimerization in vitro, and supporting PALs involvement in the intermolecular PAL1 -PAL2 interactions (30, 33) . We also detected SHAPE reactivity increases for nucleotides between the PBS and BOX0 (105 -107) that occur in Gag-or temperature-induced tRNA i Met /Ty1 RNA in vitro complexes and that are also observed in VLPs (30, 33) . Highly significant reactivity in- Figure 2 . For simplicity, only 5 and 3 ends are shown. The present RNA structure was predicted with PAL, CYC and tRNA i Met binding sequences forced to be single-stranded. The intermolecular base-pairs and long-range CYC5/CYC3 interaction were introduced manually based on differences in SHAPE reactivity patterns in vitro and in vivo and published data (30, 32, 33) . creases were also observed in vivo in the sequence (88) (89) (90) (91) (92) (93) (94) preceding the PBS (compare Figure 3D and G, leftmost structures). The majority of this sequence was base-paired and unreactive in vitro. In vivo SHAPE reactivity increases likely reflect disruption of the helical region preceding the PBS caused by tRNA i Met hybridization ( Figure 5A, B) . This interpretation is further supported by reactivity increases in the opposite strand (173-176) of the helix. In addition, destabilization of this helix may be enhanced by CYC5 interaction with CYC3. In the absence of tRNA i Met , CYC5 base-paired with the PBS and BOX1 in vitro, thus the reactivity increases in CYC5 were expected as a consequence of tRNA i Met hybridization in vivo. Since CYC5 remains unreactive in vivo, this region may be involved in long-range base-pairing with CYC3 at the 3 end of Ty1 gRNA (Figure 5B) , as suggested by genetic studies (29) . Although SHAPE can detect RNA structure changes resulting from long-range interactions, the prediction of such interactions is challenging because the accuracy of the predicted RNA structure model decreases with distance between base-pairs (80) .",

However, interplay between ongoing translation and mRNA structure in vivo is not detected in global yeast transcriptome mapping, and the average in vivo structure of coding regions is not distinguishable from that of the UTRs (36) . Interestingly, our results suggest Ty1 gRNA may not fit this pattern. The in vivo median SHAPE reactivities of GAG and POL ORFs were higher than that of UTRs, indicating that the Ty1 RNA coding region was less structured in cells than non-coding sequences, while this correlation was not detected in vitro ( Figure 6A ).",

This experimental approach was used recently to show the impact of translating ribosomes on mRNA structure in E. coli (73) . Cells were treated with kasugamycin for 20 min to allow ongoing translation elongation cycles to finish (84) followed by the addition of NMIA. Comparison of median SHAPE reactivity profiles revealed that in cells treated with kasugamycin Ty1 gRNA was less reactive toward NMIA, and thus is likely more structured than under native in vivo conditions ( Figure 6B ). As expected for mRNA undergoing translation, statistically relevant decreases in SHAPE reactivity was observed for ORFs (P < 0.0001) but not for UTRs ( Figure 6C ). To better understand the effect of translating ribosomes on RNA conformation, MFE structures of a +1-2500 fragment of Ty1 RNA were compared in each probing condition. Ty1 gRNA from kasugamycin-treated cells contains more MFE and HP base pairs than RNA in vivo, but less than RNA in vitro ( Figure 6D ). The structural model of +1-2500 Ty1 gRNA from kasugamycin-treated cells shared roughly 60% of MFE base pairs with the in vivo or in vitro RNA model ( Figure 6E ). Nevertheless, the Ty1 gRNA in kasugamycintreated cells appeared more similar to the in vitro state, since the gRNAs shared more highly probable base pairs with the in vitro than in vivo structure (70% and 50%, respectively) ( Figure 6F ). Together, our results show that ribosomes participate in the unfolding and remodeling of Ty1 gRNA in vivo, and support the idea that inhibition of translation initiation partially stabilizes Ty1 gRNA structure.",

About half of the MFE and <40% of HP base pairs are shared between in vivo and in vitro structure models, indicating significant remodeling of Ty1 gRNA occurs in vivo. Base-pairing probabilities and Shannon entropy calculations suggest that Ty1 gRNA adopts a significantly lower and more dynamic structure in vivo when compared to the structure in vitro. In the in vivo state, Ty1 gRNA contains 50% less HP base pairs, and is more likely to form alternative less probable pairings. The observed increase in structural heterogeneity in vivo may result from the parallel occurrence of various Ty1 gRNA conformers or from structural transitions through different stages of the replication cycle. Our results are in agreement with recent studies investigating in vivo and in vitro structures of viral RNAs, which suggest a more open structure for ZIKV gRNA (2) and a large unfolding of IAV mRNAs in infected cells (6) . ZIKV and DENV gRNAs are also less structured in infected cells than in virio (3) . Consistent with these findings, comparison of in vivo SHAPE reactivity data with those obtained previously in virio and ex virio for the first 1482 nts of Ty1 RNA (33) show that Ty1 gRNA is also less structured in cells than in VLPs (Supplementary Figure S4A) . Additionally, the overall similarity between in virio, ex virio and in vitro MFE structures of Ty1 gRNA is quite high despite the fact that in virio RNA is probed in a protein-bound state (Supplementary Figure S4B ). Whereas the in vivo structure differs significantly from those observed in other experimental states (Supplementary Figure S4B) .",

However, the reasons for RNA structural alteration in vivo are poorly understood. Whereas some studies show that ribosomes account for RNA remodeling in vivo (73, 82) , others suggest a more significant role for RNA binding proteins, ATP-dependent helicases and covalent RNA modifications (36, 85, 86) . To date, the mechanisms underlying viral RNA destabilization in vivo have not been thoroughly studied. Our observations indicate that ribosomes play an important role in Ty1 gRNA structure remodeling in yeast. First, the coding region of in vivo Ty1 gRNA is less structured than the UTRs. Secondly, kasugamycin treatment leads to stabilization of Ty1 gRNA structure. An analogous effect of translation initiation inhibitors is also observed for E.coli and zebrafish mRNAs (73, 82) . In yeast, a marked increase in mRNA structure is detected under ATP-depleted conditions, and the strong contribution of energy-dependent processes other than translation to mRNA remodeling in vivo is proposed (36) . However translation is one of the major energy-consuming cellular processes, and upon ATP depletion yeast shut global protein synthesis (87, 88) . Thus, we conclude that translation is one of several energy-dependent processes contributing to mRNA structure destabilization in yeast. In addition, other cellular and viral factors may be involved in Ty1 gRNA structure remodeling in vivo.",

            "text": "Although Ty1 gRNA is generally less structured in vivo, it retains well-structured 5 and 3 terminal regions that contain functional cis-acting sequences directly involved in dimerization, cyclization and packaging of the Ty1 genome, primer tRNA annealing, and reverse transcription (8, 11) . However, our results suggest that Ty1 gRNA may contain additional functional cis-acting sequences in POL where we identify eight well-structured regions. Recent studies show that low-SHAPE and low-entropy analyses can identify previously unknown functional motifs in viral RNA and cellular transcripts (43, 74, 75, 90) . Perhaps the stable RNA motifs in POL serve as specific binding sites for cellular proteins, as multiple cellular factors influence Ty1 replication (8) . Alternatively, these well-structured motifs might contribute to the stability of Ty1 gRNA in vivo since cis-elements within the coding region help stabilize certain yeast transcripts in addition to the poly(A) tail (91) . Although a small fraction of Ty1 transcripts are polyadenylated, Ty1 gRNA half-life is longer than the average half-life of many cellular transcripts (19) (20) (21) , suggesting the presence of additional stabilizing elements. The correlation between the CDS structure in vivo and yeast RNA half-life remains unclear, and codon optimality is proposed as a major determinant of mRNA stability in yeast (92) . A significant increase of yeast mRNA halflife is detected when non-optimal codons are converted to optimal codons in a manner minimizing changes in the GC content and the predicted RNA secondary structure (92) . Interestingly codon-optimized Ty1 gRNA (CO-Ty1 gRNA) is about as stable as Ty1 gRNA (93) . The secondary structure of CO-Ty1 RNA has not been analyzed, but the lack of an increase in stability suggests that the positive effect of codon optimization may be masked by recoding-induced changes in other Ty1 transcript features, such as RNA secondary structure in the CDS. Furthermore, Ty1 gRNA stability is enhanced by interactions with Ty1 Gag (38) . Thus, the 1209 base changes in CO-Ty1 gRNA may also induce sequence or structure changes that alter Gag or cellular factor binding. Although extensive sequence recoding in the CO-Ty1 element does not alter the level of retrotransposition or protein expression, there are examples of mutations that strongly inhibit Ty1 mobility located in coding sequences and the UTRs (30, 31, 76) . Indeed, a Rap1 binding site fortuitously introduced into CO-Ty1 during recoding dramatically alters Ty1 gRNA expression (93) . Therefore, it stands to reason that RNA structural elements mimicking functions of natural Ty1 gRNA could also have been introduced in CO-Ty1.",

There is growing evidence that the low structure (high G) of 5 UTRs and the high structure (low G) of 3 UTRs are associated with longer half-lives and a higher abundance of yeast transcripts (94, 95) . The 5 UTR of Ty1 RNA has a low GCcontent (30%) and is very short (53 nts), consequently, its folding free energy is relatively high. Our data also sup-port the formation of a long stem-loop structure within the 3 UTR of Ty1 RNA in vivo and vitro ( Figure 3C , F and Supplementary Figure S3 ). Previous work indicates that stable stem-loop motifs in the 3 UTR but outside the poly(A) tail increase the stability of yeast mRNAs (96) . Additional analyses will be required to address the function of wellstructured regions in POL and the 3 stem-loop motif in the Ty1 life cycle. Future work on RNA folding in the powerful yeast model will also be enhanced by our discovery that diverse SHAPE reagents can be used successfully in growing yeast cultures.",
