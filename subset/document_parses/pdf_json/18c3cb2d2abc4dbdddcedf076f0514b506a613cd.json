In clinical practice, it is common to find whitish or an opacity of one of the lungs when affected by pneumonia. This is due to the production of mucus. Differently, Covid-19 is a disease that affects the blood, which can lead to thickening of the blood and thrombosis. As a consequence, the gas exchanges carried out at the level of the alveoli in the lungs are impaired. Therefore, before patients experienced breathing difficulties, it is common to notice changes in saturation. In this case, surfactant is damaged, leading alveoli to collapse and, therefore, reducing respiratory capacities. The tendency is both lungs be affected equally, unlike traditional pneumonias.
