Thus, activating it becomes an attractive approach for targeted cancer therapies. In this regard, our lab has previously discovered a small molecule, Inauhzin (INZ), as a potent p53 activator with no genotoxicity. Method: To improve its efficacy and bioavailability, here we employed nanoparticle encapsulation, making INZ-C, an analog of INZ, to nanoparticle-encapsulated INZ-C (n-INZ-C). Results: This approach significantly improved p53 activation and inhibition of lung and colorectal cancer cell growth by n-INZ-C in vitro and in vivo while it displayed a minimal effect on normal human Wi38 and mouse MEF cells. The improved activity was further corroborated with the enhanced cellular uptake observed in cancer cells and minimal cellular uptake observed in normal cells. In vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation of these nanoparticles showed that the nanoparticle encapsulation prolongates the half-life of INZ-C from 2.5 h to 5 h in mice. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that we have established a nanoparticle system that could enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of INZ-C as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic.",

Several small molecules, such as Nutlin, Prima-1, and Tenovin 1 and 6, have been developed in an attempt to target this pathway in various ways [2, 4] . These small molecules increase levels of p53 within the cancer cell through various mechanisms, ultimately resulting in cell death. For example, Nutlin blocks MDM2/p53 binding, preventing ubiquitylation of the latter and increasing its levels [5] . Tennovin 1 and 6 inhibit SIRT 1 and SIRT 2 deacetylases preventing deacetylation of p53, and ultimately resulting in increased levels of p53 [4, 6] . A class of anthraquinones has been shown to induce MDM2 degradation as a way to upregulate p53 [7, 8] . While several of these small molecules have been developed, investigated and employed for anti-cancer activity, many of them are insoluble in water which limits many of their bio-applications [9] .",

These nanoparticles can be Ivyspring International Publisher comprised of lipids, peptide/drug conjugates, polymers, and metal components. Lipid based nanocarriers have been employed for both mRNA based cancer therapy and the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine delivery. In both cases, the lipid nanoparticle is known to protect the nucleic acid from degradation [10, 11] . Several peptide based nanoparticles have been developed for activation of p53 and have shown promising activity [12] [13] [14] [15] . Other studies demonstrate promising in vitro and in vivo applications of drug encapsulated within organic/polymer-based nanodrug delivery systems [9, [16] [17] [18] [19] . In this regard, chitosan is a polymer that has been widely used for nanodrug fabrication due to its biocompatibility, low toxicity, high stability and ability for versatile routes of administration [20] [21] [22] . Cyclodextrin (CD) is a cyclic oligomer that has also been employed nanodrug delivery and has shown great promise in enhancing the bioavailability of lipophilic drugs through drug encapsulation. \u03b2-CD has been the most widely investigated for drug encapsulation due to its optimal cavity size, high encapsulation efficiency and low cost [20, [23] [24] [25] . Addition of chemical modifications, such as hydroxypropyl (HP) and methyl groups, further aid in the solubility of CD, and thus these modified \u03b2-CD's (HP-\u03b2-CD and methylated \u03b2-CD) are widely used for lipophilic drug complexation to enhance the bioavailability [23, 24, 26] . Several groups have also investigated the efficacy of nanodrugs fabricated from a combination of chitosan and cyclodextrin [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

Intriguingly, while INZ displayed significant activation of p53 in cancer cells, minimal to no p53 induction was observed in normal cells [4] . Moreover, while most chemotherapeutics employ DNA damage as their mechanism of action, INZ was found to be a nongenotoxic p53 activator [32, 33] . Investigation of INZ was furthered by developing several analogs of INZ and assessing their in vitro activity to determine the role of structure on activity of this molecule. One analog INZ-C had the most improved IC50 and p53 induction; thus, in the study presented here, we will focus on this analog [34] . As shown in our previous studies, INZ-C had activity towards p53 wt and null cell lines with minimal to no activity in wi38 normal fibroblast cell lines [34] . However, despite its promising in-vitro activity, similar to other lipophilic chemotherapeutic agents, INZ-C is highly hydrophobic and insoluble in water; thus, its half-life and bioavailability may have limitations.",

The final synthesized product was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). NMR characterization was first used to confirm formation of the CD/INZ-C complex before encapsulation in the chitosan nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 1B and S1, shifting in several NMR peaks was observed with the complex formation as compared to the INZ-C and CD alone. As shown in Figure 1B , the up-field shift of the doublets observed at 8.32 ppm and 7.68 ppm along with the indole (NH) proton at 12.6 ppm were indicative of cyclodextrin encapsulation of the INZ-C. Additionally, as shown in Figure 1C , a red shift was observed in UV-Vis absorption spectra of the CD-INZ-C complex and the INZ-C alone. This, along with the increased hyperchromicity, is also suggestive of successful encapsulation of INZ-C within the CD cavity. FTIR characterization of the nanoparticle is presented in Figure 1D . Together, these results suggest that the final synthesized product contains INZ-C, chitosan and cyclodextrin combined as expected.",

As shown from the TEM Image and the DLS characterizations in Figures 1E and S2A , respectively, and the histogram in Figure S3A , TEM microscopy portrayed nanoparticles of 105 nm while DLS indicated formation of nanoparticles of around 150 nm. Figure  S2A shows the DLS measurements of nanoparticles suspended in PBS + 10% serum immediately after synthesis and re-suspended after storage in -20 \u00b0C for a month. This study demonstrates that while a minor decrease in size is observed after 1 month, the nanoparticle size is relatively stable following long-term storage (up to a month) in -20 \u00b0C. Aggregation is not observed as no substantial shifting of the size distribution curve toward larger size is observed. Additionally, as shown in Figure S2B , the zeta potential of the nanoparticles was -10 mV for the sample suspended immediately after synthesis and -35 mV for the sample tested after a month of storage in -20 \u00b0C in PBS + 10% serum. A zeta potential of \u00b130 mV is indicative of stable nanoparticles since the large charge leads to an electrostatic repulsion between the nanoparticles and aids in their suspension. From our results, it seems the nanoparticles display stability following long term storage in PBS + 10% serum in -20 \u00b0C. Following characterization of the chemical makeup and nanoparticle size of n-INZ-C, the drug encapsulation efficiency and release of this nanodelivery system were investigated. Characterization of nanoparticle drug encapsulation efficiency was evaluated by modifying a previously used technique and revealed a 30% drug encapsulation efficiency (Figures S3B and S3C ) [27] . The loading capacity was also calculated using a similar technique and was found to be 37%. Subsequently, the release of INZ-C from the nanoparticles in PBS solution (pH 7) + 10% serum was evaluated using a dialysis membrane. As shown in Figure 1F , more than 90% of the drug was released after 5 h. These findings were consistent with those presented in a previous investigation of chitosan/ cyclodextrin nanoparticle encapsulation of paclitaxel [27] . Together, these results indicate that we have successfully generated nanoparticles-encapsulated and effectively released INZ-C.",

This result was also reproduced in other p53-containing cancer cells, such melanoma and breast cancer cells (Figures S6A and S6B) . Although this inhibitory effect was less dramatic in p53-null lung and colorectal cancer cells, it was evident in these cells ( Figure S5B) , suggesting that n-INZ-C might possess some p53-independent activity against cancer cells, which is consistent with our previous observation [4] . Dose dependent inhibition of cell proliferation was then investigated to determine the IC50 concentration. As shown in Figure 2D , the IC 50 concentration of INZ-C was reduced by two-fold following nanoparticle encapsulation, which further corroborates the enhanced p53 induction and improved inhibition of proliferation observed with n-INZ-C.

As shown in Figure 3A , a larger wound width was observed at the endpoint for HCT116 p53+/+ cells treated with INZ-C or n-INZ-C as compared to the DMSO and nanoparticle controls. In addition, the wound width for n-INZ-C was significantly (p \u2264 0.005 where n=4) larger than that of INZ-C ( Figure 3B) . Consistent with the results from the wound healing assay, results from our trans-well migration assay also demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of cells migrated to the 24 well plate following 5-day treatment of n-INZ-C as compared to INZ-C ( Figure 3C) . Intriguingly, HCT116 p53-/cells also demonstrated some degree inhibition of wound healing and cell migration with n-INZ-C and INZ-C treatment suggesting some p53 independent activity. However, comparison of the change in wound width of HCT116 p53-/and HCT116 p53+/+ cells following treatment of n-INZ-C indicates a 4-fold larger change in wound width in the HCT116 p53+/+ cells. This suggests that while this mechanism could be partially p53 independent, it seems to be predominantly p53 dependent. Further studies will be needed to dissect the underlying mechanisms; however, from these results, we can conclude that in addition to enhancing the p53 induction and inhibition of cell proliferation, the nanoparticle encapsulation also results in enhanced inhibition of wound healing and migration properties.",

In this regard, normal human fibroblast Wi38 and murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were used to assess the in vitro toxicity of the nanodrug. As shown in Figure 4A , no p53 induction was observed after either INZ-C or n-INZ-C treatment in both cell lines. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4B , no difference in the inhibition of cell proliferation as compared to the controls was observed after INZ-C or n-INZ-C treatment in either cell line suggesting minimal to no toxicity of this drug. To further confirm these results, toxicity of n-INZ-C treatment was then evaluated in vivo, as toxicity of INZ-C alone has already been previously evaluated and published in our lab [36] . Figure 4C presents the H/E staining of tissues from mice following n-INZ-C or PBS control treatment for 7 days. H/E staining of tissues from mice treated with a high and low dose of nanoparticle control is presented in Figure S8A . The weight of the mice during the 7 day treatment is depicted in Figure S8B .These results were corroborated with our pathology expert to ensure proper interpretation as well. From these results, we can conclude that n-INZ-C displays minimal toxicity both in vitro and in vivo, as all of the H/E staining displayed no apparent pathological alternations, and the body weights of the mice in the all of the groups did not show any difference (Figures 4C, S8A, and  S8B ).",

Figure 6A is a picture representation of the end-point tumors from the H460 xenograft model. As shown by the final tumor weights (Figure 6B ) for the mice as presented in Figure 6B , n-INZ-C repressed the growth of the xenograft lung tumors by 5.5-fold in comparison with the tumors treated with NPC, while INZ-C only reduced it by ~2-fold at the same dose as that used for n-INZ-C. Additionally, as shown in Figure 6C , a statistically significant difference in tumor volume as compared with the control was observed for the n-INZ-C treated mice starting from day 6 after treatment. In contrast, a significant difference in tumor volume of mice treated with INZ-C as compared to the control was only observed after 15 days of treatment. Evaluation of the p53 and p53 target gene expression using IB is displayed in Figure  6D . Intriguingly, enhanced p53 and p21 induction were observed in tissues from mice treated with n-INZ-C or INZ-C alone as compared to the mice treated with NPC. Throughout this experiment, there were no changes in mice's body weights ( Figure  S10A) . Also, the regressed xenograft tumors were evident in the H/E staining of the tumor tissues ( Figure S10B) . Hence, these results indicate that n-INZ-C more effectively inhibits the growth of xenograft lung tumors than INZ-C alone.",

Our detailed characterization confirms the encapsulation of INZ-C within the nanoparticle (Figure 1 ). Upfield shifts in the aromatic hydrogens following INZ-C/CD complexation in our NMR characterization confirms encapsulation of INZ-C within the cavity of CD (Figures 1B and S1 ). This is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated upfield shifting of guest molecule hydrogens with CD encapsulation [37] [38] [39] [40] . Furthermore, the red shift observed in absorbance (to longer wavelength) for our studies further confirms this CD encapsulation. Previous studies have attributed this red shift in absorbance to change in environment of the guest molecule following CD encapsulation. In this regard, the guest molecule is encapsulated in the nonpolar cavity of \u03b2-CD in contrast to the polar aqueous environment in the case of the free guest molecule [41] . Moreover, from these results we can conclude that the CD has formed a host/guest complex with INZ, and this host/guest complex has been encapsulated within the chitosan nanoparticles observed in the images obtained from TEM as well as DLS characterization (Figure 1E and S2) . Stability of the nanoparticles was confirmed from the zeta potential and DLS measurements presented in Figure  S2 . Drug release studies also confirmed the release of the drug from the nanoparticle in PBS pH 7.4 + 10% serum.",

These results are consistent with many nanomedicine studies that attribute enhanced internalization of nanoparticles into tumors to the enhanced permeability and retention phenomenon [42, 43] . In this regard, the leaky tumor vasculature allows for enhanced permeation of nanoparticles into tumors cells, while the rigid vasculature of normal cells prevents the rapid internalization into normal cells [42, 44, 45] . The 2-fold enhancement in the cellular uptake in lung and cancer cells ( Figure 5 ) suggests that this improvement in p53 induction is also probably attributed to the enhanced bioavailability. Consistent with the minimal activity, minimal internalization of INZ-C and n-INZ-C was observed in normal cells as depicted in the cellular uptake analysis ( Figure 5 ). In addition to enhanced in vitro bioavailability, the 2-fold enhancement in the half-life confirms that enhanced bioavailability is most probably observed in vivo as well ( Figure 5 ). This enhanced in vivo bioavailability is further corroborated by the 2-fold enhancement in tumor reduction in our xenograft model ( Figure 6) . Additionally, consistent with the minimal activity and cellular internalization observed in vitro, the in vivo toxicity studies further confirmed the promising biocompatibility of both INZ-C and n-INZ-C ( Figure  4) .",

In this regard, the improved cellular uptake has been a common advantage of nanoparticle drug delivery systems due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect. This improved cellular uptake will in turn most likely enhance the efficacy of the drug as we observed here. This improved bioavailability was also confirmed from the improved in vivo \u00bd life of INZ that is observed with the nanoparticle encapsulation. All of these factors contribute to the improved in vivo tumor reduction as shown in Figure 6 .",

Firstly, the effect of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with INZ-C alone or CD-INZ-C complex was investigated. Since the nanoparticles loaded with the CD-INZ-C complex displayed better p53 activation, the effect of the ratio of INZ-C and CD in the activity of n-INZ-C was then evaluated by testing the potency of different ratios (1:20, 1:15 and 1:10) of INZ-C and CD on p53 activation. Our results demonstrated that 0.5 \u00b5M of 1:20 ratio (INZ-C/ CD) was the most optimal for enhanced activity of n-INZ-C; thus, this ratio and concentration was employed for all further studies, (Figures S4A and S4B). Stability of the n-INZ-C was also evaluated after storage for 1 month in PBS buffer (Figure S4C), and minimal difference was observed in activity suggesting a good stability. The result from the IB analysis (Figure 2A) indicated that p53 is more significantly induced in HCT116 +/+ colon cancer and H460 (p53 wt) lung cancer cells by n-INZ-C than that by INZ-C only, following 18 h treatment with DMSO (control), CD, and nanoparticle control (NPC), INZ-C or n-INZ-C. Quantification of the IB bands revealed about a 2-fold induction of p53 by INZ C in both cell lines, while about a 3-3.5-fold induction was observed for the n-INZ-C (",
