Objectives: To determine proximal DVT prevalence with POCUS screening among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients/Methods: Lower limb POCUS was performed in all patients admitted either to the ward or intensive care unit (ICU) between April 22nd and 30th 2020. Clinical and laboratory features, prescriptions, thrombotic complications and outcomes were assessed. Results: 87 patients were screened, of which 26 (29.8%) either had been discharged from ICU (19.5%) or were still in critical condition (10.3%). DVT was found in 4 patients (3 femoral, 1 popliteal), of which 1 had not received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis. 21 CT pulmonary angiograms were performed, being positive for PE in 5 cases (23.8%); only 2 of these patients suffered DVT. Conclusions: Screening lower extremities with POCUS did not find a high rate of DVT among patients receiving LMWH-prophylaxis. However, there was a noteworthy amount of PE without DVT.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia may increase events such as venous thrombosis (VT). 1,2 Different research has been conducted to prove an increase of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) prevalence in those patients admitted to the hospital, despite proper prophylaxis. Additionally, there seems to be a gap between deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), being the former higher. 3, 4 It has been hypothesized that this difference is due to local inflammation, known as endotheliitis, which lead to the formation of thrombi without distal embolism. 5 Following the hypothesis, COVID-19 disease is associated with elevated D-dimer values. In fact, higher levels of D-dimer lead to a poorer prognosis. 6 Moreover, there is a special concern in determining which D-dimer level could predict thrombotic phenomena. 7 Screening lower extremities with an ultrasound exam is an option to detect clots. The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) by properly trained physicians is highly accurate and an alternative option, especially when the critical situation of many patients dramatically limits feasibility of performing CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) to diagnose PE.",
