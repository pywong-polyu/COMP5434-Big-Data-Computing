People are using social media such as Twitter to express their opinion and share information on a number of issues related to the COVID-19 in this stay at home order. In this paper, we investigate the sentiment and emotion of peoples in the U.S.A on the subject of reopening. We choose the social media platform Twitter for our analysis and study the Tweets to discover the sentimental perspective, emotional perspective, and triggering words towards the reopening. During this COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have made some analysis on various social media dataset regarding lockdown and stay at home. However, in our analysis, we are particularly interested to analyse public sentiment on reopening. Our major finding is that when all states resorted to lockdown in March, people showed dominant emotion of fear, but as reopening starts people have less fear. While this may be true, due to this reopening phase daily positive cases are rising compared to the lockdown situation. Overall, people have a less negative sentiment towards the situation of reopening.",

When the whole world is COVID-19 stricken, the lockdown has been the only solution to get a hold (Ghosal et al., 2020) . Since then much of the debate has been going on how the countries should ease the lockdown program. As lockdown is not the ultimate solution, easing the restrictions is the only way to minimize economic loss and keep the society functional. As the whole world is still not free from the deadly clutch of corona and continuing to claim human lives, reopen decisions from the government is a huge step to take. Public sentiment towards this reopen decision can help policymakers and general people to better understand the situation through classified information.",

If we analyze the social media posts then we can find the insights of those posts along with emotions and sentiments.

Twitter has a large number of daily active users all around the world where people share their thoughts and information regarding any topic of recent concern through this medium. It is a searchable archive of human thought. The affluence of publicly available data shared through Twitter has encouraged researchers to determine the sentiments on almost everything, including sentiments towards any product, service. Researchers and practitioners are already giving useful information on issues related to this COVID-19 outbreak. We have mainly contributed to the issue of the reopening phase giving an insight into people's reactions. Coordination of responses from online and from the real-world is sure to reveal promising results to address the current crisis. Our major finding is that during this reopen phase fear among people is less dominant compared to the previous times when the states made lockdown decisions. Another finding is that as the reopen phase starts, the number of new cases is also increasing. People are sharing their thoughts and opinions to combat this situation.",

(Barkur et al., 2020) analyzed Twitter data and found that people of India were positive towards the lockdown decision of their government to flatten the curve. (Dubey, 2020) made a sentiment analysis on the tweets related to COVID19 in some or the other way from March 11 to March 31 on twelve different countries, USA, Italy, Spain, Germany, China, France, UK, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherland, and Australia. They found that while most of the countries are taking a positive attitude towards this situation, there is also negative emotion such as fear, sadness present among people. Countries specially France, Switzerland, Netherlands, and the United States of America have shown distrust and anger more frequently compared to other countries. (Rajput et al., 2020) Made a statistical analysis of Twitter data posted during this Coronavirus outbreak. The number of tweet ids tweeting about coronavirus rose rapidly making several peaks during February and March. An empirical analysis of words in the messages showed that the most frequent words were Coronavirus, Covid19, and Wuhan. The immense number of tweet messages within a period of 2-3 months and the frequency of these words clearly show the threats the global population is exposed to. (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2020) Aimed to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic between February 2, 2020, and March 15, 2020. Users on Twitter discussed 12 main topics related to COVID-19 that were grouped into four main themes, 1) the origin of the virus; 2) its sources; 3) its impact on people, countries, and the economy that were represented by six topics: deaths, fear, and stress, travel bans and warnings, economic losses, panic, increased racism, and 4) the last theme was ways of mitigating the risk of infection. (Cinelli et al., 2020 ) ran a comparative analysis of five different social media platforms Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, and Gab about information diffusion about COVID-19. They wanted to investigate how information is spread during any critical moment. Their analysis suggests that information spread depends on the interaction pattern of users engaged with the topic rather than how reliable the information is. (Samuel and Ali) Identified public sentiment using coronavirus specific tweets and provided insights on how fear sentiment evolved over time specially when COVID-19 hit the peak levels in the United States. As they classified tweets using sentiment analysis, the fear sentiment, which was the most dominant emotion across the entire tweets and by the end of march its seriousness became clearly evident as the fear curve showed a steep rise.",

As word cloud visualization consists of the size and visual emphasis of words being weighted by their frequency of occurrence in the textual corpus, we can get insights from the most frequent words occurring. From figure 1a , we can see that along with the words 'COVID', 'corona', or 'virus', words like 'new', and 'cases' got a large number of mentions. No wonder the rising number of new cases everyday around the world contribute to the good number of mentions of these words. Our main goal is to see the effect of reopening in our analysis that's why we also investigate the most frequent words used in reopen related tweets. Figure 1b represents only the reopen related most frequent words within the United States. We can see that 'businesses', 'schools', 'gyms', 'economy', and 'protesters' are the most frequently used words. Few tweets are 'Protesting to reopen the economy', 'reopen the economy against shelter in place which is a false choice', 'As schools make plans to reopen after #COVID19 shutdowns, how should we proceed?', 'Any rush to reopen without adequate testing and tracing will cause a resurgence.', 'As we reopen shuttered offices and buildings, there is a danger of an outbreak of Legionnaire disease'. From these few tweets, we can see that few people are protesting to reopen, but most of the people are concerned about the reopening timing, aftermath of reopening, and thinking about the precaution measures needed after reopening.",

The top 15 most frequent chunks, known as n-gram, are shown in Table 1 economic breakdown and necessity to overcome this situation through reopen. The 'plan', 'case', 'testing', and 'phase' surely emphasize the safety measures that need to be followed while reopening as a control measure. The 'state' and 'people' surely stands for how all states beginning to reopen in some way. From 2-grams, the 'social distancing', 'stay home', 'wear mask', and 'contact tracing' imply users try to raise awareness through their posts. The 'testing site', 'public health', and 'task force' imply the safety measures people and policymakers should abide by to curb the spread during the reopen situation. The 'state begin', 'small business', 'back work', and 'business begin' indicate as people are going to resume their work after states are reopening.",

We make an effort to understand whether there is a change in public sentiment from the lockdown phase to the reopen phase. We have made our analysis on Twitter data on reopening related issues during this COVID-19 outbreak. From our analysis, we have found that even though people are showing a positive attitude to reopen their areas to make the economy functional, they are also urging the authority in concern to make plans for avoiding the highly predictable second wave. From real data, we have seen that the new cases are increasing as the reopen phase starts. Given this situation, the coordination of responses from online and from the real world is sure to reveal promising results to address the current crisis.
