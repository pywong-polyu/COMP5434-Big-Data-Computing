Here we bring experimental evidence that pre-exposure to mRNA-LNPs or its LNP component has effects on both innate and adaptive immune responses. Preexposure to mRNA-LNPs led to long-term, platform-specific inhibition of the adaptive immune responses. As such, mice responded with lower antibody responses when exposed the second time to the mRNA-LNP platform, but with undisturbed adaptive immune responses to protein-based Alum or AddaVax-adjuvanted vaccines. On the other hand, we report that after pre-exposure to mRNA-LNPs, resistance of mice to heterologous infections with influenza virus and Candida albicans is likely enhanced.",

In summary, the mRNA-LNP vaccine platform induces long-term immunological changes that can affect both humoral responses and heterologous protection against infections. More studies are needed to understand in-depth the mechanisms responsible for these effects. reprogramming induced by certain vaccines can interfere with the immune responses induced by other vaccines (Netea et al., 2020). The possible short and long-term immunological changes of the mRNA-LNP vaccine outside the induction of antigenspecific anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses are unknown. A recent human study awaiting peer-review reported innate and adaptive immune reprogramming with this platform (F\u00f6hse et al., 2021), while single-cell RNA-seq studies on human white blood cells derived from vaccinated people also revealed significant changes in innate immune 4 cells (Arunachalam et al., 2021). Whether the reported changes are long-lasting and can influence immune fitness or interfere with the responses induced by other vaccines remains to be determined.",

At the same time, the lipid nanoparticle (LNP) component was considered an inert carrier and protector of the mRNA. However, recently has been shown that the synthetic ionizable lipid component of the LNPs is highly inflammatory (Ndeupen et al., 2021) , and this is a critical component to support induction of adaptive immune responses. These LNPs mixed with proteins induce comparable responses to mRNA-LNPs (Alameh et al., 2021) .",

Furthermore, the innate immune weeks post-inoculation, the anti-HA responses were determined in the serum using ELISA and the GC B cell responses in the skin draining lymph nodes monitored by flow cytometry (Supplemental Figure 1 ), as we previously described (Ndeupen et al., 2022) .

To define this, we performed similar experiments as detailed above, but one group of mice received the second shot in an area distinct from the first inoculation site (Figure 2A) .

Two weeks post-inoculation, we found that even mice injected four weeks post pre-exposure showed a significant decrease of anti-HA responses ( Figure 3B and C).

We also found significantly less Candida fungal burden in the mRNA-LNP-pre-exposed mouse kidneys (Figure 5C ), which are the target organ in this mouse model of disseminated candidiasis. No differences in fungal loads were observed in the liver ( Figure 5D ). Similar enhanced resistance in an influenza infection model was observed after administration of mRNA-LNP ( Figure 5E ).

In humans, lower overall mortality has been reported in infants whose fathers had been vaccinated with BCG (Berendsen et al., 2021) , and maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with increased cytokine functionality and nonspecific immune imprinting in neonates (Gee et al., 2021) . Finally, trained immunity has been shown to be transmitted in newborn infants of hepatitis B virus-infected mothers (Hong et al., 2015) . Since the mRNA-LNP platform is highly inflammatory, and we observed that pre-exposure to it enhances resistance to heterologous infections, we hypothesized that some of these traits might be inherited by the offspring. To test our hypothesis, we immunized adult WT B6 male and female mice intradermally with 10 \u03bcg of mRNA-LNP coding for influenza PR8 HA, as we previously described (Ndeupen et al., 2022) . Two weeks postimmunization, the mice were screened for successful immunization by anti-HA ELISA (Supplemental Figure 3A -B) and then mated ( Figure 6A ) as follows: immunized males with unimmunized (DI; dad immunized) or immunized females (DMI; dad-mom immunized), and immunized females with unimmunized males (MI; mom immunized).",

Interestingly, we found that indeed the antibody response was inhibited after an earlier administration of mRNA-LNPs. This inhibition of adaptive immune responses was relatively long-lasting, with effects seen for at least 4 weeks, while starting to wane after 8 weeks. Humans receive a 2-dose standard regimen of mRNA-LNP vaccines at 3 to 4 weeks intervals (Walsh et al., 2020) and booster shots at different time points. Our data are strongly supported by recent studies showing that a delay of the second dose of an mRNA vaccine from 3 weeks to 3 months significantly improves the antibody response (Hall et al., 2022; Ooi and B, 2022; Parry et al., 2022) . Indeed, inflammation has been related to a poor responsiveness to vaccination in earlier studies (Trzonkowski et al., 2003) , and it is rational to hypothesize that the acute inflammatory side effects of the LNP platform negatively impedes induction of antibody responses during the second dose administration. Increasing the interval between vaccination doses, thus giving time to the immune system to return to homeostasis, is likely to improve the effects of the second dose of the vaccine. Thus, our findings have important implications for improving the schedules of administration for the current mRNA vaccines. However, more studies are needed in the future to assess these effects in more detail.",

However, stimulation of cells with other stimuli such as influenza and different TLR ligands showed no significant difference before and after 1 st vaccination, and these effects seem to be lost after subsequent doses (F\u00f6hse et al., 2021) . If the potential innate immune fitness benefits from the first exposure to mRNA-LNPs reported here for mice and supported by human in vitro restimulation data might be dampened by the subsequent shots, then we would expect that people exposed to multiple mRNA-LNP shots ultimately become more vulnerable to infections.",

            "text": "In humans, many vaccines, including the mRNA-LNP vaccines are administered intramuscularly for ease of use (Ols et al., 2020) . The preclinical animal intradermal and intramuscular vaccine studies revealed induction of similar adaptive immune responses, with slightly better responses with the intradermal delivery (Laczk\u00f3 et al., 2020; Pardi et al., 2018a) . The inflammatory reactions in nature and magnitude induced by the mRNA-LNP platform are independent of the delivery route (Ndeupen et al., 2021) . They are characterized by robust and transient neutrophil influx and activation of multiple different inflammatory pathways and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Thus, it is unlikely that the immune reprogramming observed here would be limited to intradermal exposure, especially since data from mRNA-LNP-vaccinated individuals collaborate our findings (F\u00f6hse et al., 2021) . The vaccine doses used in mouse and human studies differ significantly, and human vaccines doses adjusted to weight are much lower than in mice (Nair and Jacob, 2016) . In our studies, we used doses at the lower end of the amounts used for mouse vaccine studies (Laczk\u00f3 et al., 2020). While we did not perform a wide dose range for our studies, we observed that pre-exposure to 2.5 \u03bcg of empty LNPs and 2.5 \u03bcg mRNA-LNPs (2.5 \u03bcg refers to the amount of mRNA, which is complexed with LNPs at ~1:20 weight ratio, i.e., ~50 \u03bcg of LNP) resulted in similar inhibition of adaptive immune responses. Thus, while dose might play a role in the magnitude and length of inhibition, our data combined with human data support that the LNPs have similar effects in a wide dose range. or tolerance across generations in mice (Bomans et al., 2018; Katzmarski et al., 2021) , although not all of them (Kaufmann et al., 2022) . Our independent study initiated and performed before these data become public seem to support the existence of transgenerational inheritance of immune traits. The highly inflammatory properties of the mRNA-LNP platform might have induced the inherited changes, and it would be very important to determine whether if any such immune inheritance may be observed in humans vaccinated with mRNA vaccines. Cross-generational protection of infants of parents vaccinated with BCG has recently suggested in epidemiological studies (Berendsen et al., 2021) . Whether these changes in innate immune genes could also directly or indirectly affect adaptive immune responses remains to be determined. Our experimental platform was able to detect the innate contribution of males. The passively transferred maternal antibodies largely masked the innate female contribution.",

These findings have important biological and clinical implications. First, our data show that the administration of mRNA-LNPs inhibits humoral responses to a second dose of the vaccine for at least several weeks: this finding is highly relevant from a human health perspective as it suggests that a second dose of a mRNA vaccine may be more effective if given at a later timepoint and different location than currently used. This conclusion is strongly supported by recent human studies suggesting that indeed the delay of the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine leads to a better humoral and cellular response (Hall et al., 2022; Parry et al., 2022) . Second, our study suggest increased heterologous protection against fungal and viral infections by the mRNA-LNPs platform, that may thus expand its beneficial effects. Third, our study also shows the capacity of these vaccines to transmit protection trans-generationally, thus supporting the concept of Lamarckian inheritance in mammals (Skinner and Nilsson, 2021). However, our study only partially opens the door towards understanding the various immunological effects of mRNA-LNP platform. Considering the broad exposure of a large proportion of human populations to vaccines based on this novel technology, more studies are warranted to fully understand its broad immunological and physiological effects.

To limit possible interference of melanin in B6 mouse skin with the signal generated by the luciferase activity, we used WT Balb/c mice for these experiments. Mice injected with PBS, mRNA-LNP coding for luciferase or PR8 HA, were intraperitoneally injected with D-Luciferin (Potassium Salt, Goldbio) at the dose of 150 mg/kg. Five minutes later, the mice were anesthetized in a chamber filled with 3 % isoflurane for 1 minute, then transferred to the imaging platform with maintained 2 % isoflurane via gas ports. With the Living Image Software provided by Caliper, the signal was acquired by measuring total flux (photons/sec) for 5 seconds exposure time. The total flux is the radiance (photons/sec/cm 2 /steradian) in each pixel summed or integrated over the region of interest (ROI) area (cm 2 ) x 4\u03c0. The total flux values were normalized to ensure accurate quantitation and comparability. Briefly, the normalized value (Vn) in each independent experiment was calculated as following:",
