With 23 hospitals (including specialty hospitals) and nearly 800 outpatient practice sites, the organization cares for over 2 million people in greater metropolitan New York. A team of registered nurses in the corporate quality department retrospectively reviewed medical records from 15 acute care hospitals. This team routinely conducts clinical reviews of all adult acute inpatient mortalitiesapproximately 5000 per year. A physician advisor was available to the team to consult on clinical questions. Database elements were based on Northwell's experience with treating COVID-19 patients, literature review from countries that had early experience in treating patients, and clinical trials being conducted at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research. Also, the data were captured in the database established under the direction of critical care intensivists at the epicenter of the pandemic, other subject matter experts, and quality leadership. During data abstraction, modifications and enhancements were made to the database based on trends and emerging information.
