Identifying the modes of transmission that drive this phenomenon is a perquisite in devising effective control measures, but to date it is still under debate. To address this problem, we have formulated a detailed mathematical model of discrete human actions (such as coughs, sneezes, and touching) and the continuous decay of the virus in the environment. To take into account those discrete and continuous events we have extended the common modelling approach and employed a hybrid stochastic mathematical framework. This allowed us to calculate higher order statistics which are crucial for the reconstruction of the observed distributions. We focused on transmission within a household, the venue with the highest risk of infection and validated the model results against the observed secondary attack rate and the serial interval distribution. Detailed analysis of the model results identified the dominant driver of pre-symptomatic transmission as the contact route via hand-face transfer and showed that wearing masks and avoiding physical contact are an effective prevention strategy. These results provide a sound scientific basis to the present recommendations of the WHO and the CDC.",

However, the mechanism that enables this transmission is not fully understood. Generally, respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 propagate via four modes of transmission 2 : direct physical contact between people, indirect physical contact via intermediate objects, droplets and droplet nuclei. Transmission by droplets and droplet nuclei is mediated by virus-containing particles that were emitted when a person coughs, sneezes or speaks. The droplets travel less than 1.5 m 3 , due to their size, and settle on the facial membranes of nearby individuals or on surfaces. Droplet nuclei remain suspended in the air and may infect a susceptible individual once they penetrate the respiratory tract. The commonly accepted cutoff between droplets and droplet nuclei is 5 \u00b5m 2 . However, Xie et al. 3 showed that droplets that are smaller than approximately 100 \u00b5 m evaporate to their nuclei size before reaching the ground.",

The close contact transmission hypothesis relies on the analysis of COVID-19 cases 6 and the relatively low secondary attack rate (SAR, the probability of an infected person to infect a susceptible person) of 10-16% that was observed in households 5,10-13 . The droplet nuclei hypothesis relies on several theoretical investigations 8, 9 .

The approach taken here is an integrative detailed mechanistic modelling that describes explicitly the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 between individuals in OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ different modes of transmission. Similar approach was used by Nicas and Sun 20 and by Atkinson and Wein 21 for quantifying the modes of transmission of respiratory viruses. In this work we have extended the mathematical framework of Atkinson and Wein 21 to take into account random discrete human actions (such as coughs, sneezes and contact with objects and other people), rather than considering only the mean kinetics. This was achieved by employing a hybrid stochastic mathematical framework which combines a description of the various discrete human action with continuous virus decay. This allows us to explicitly calculate higher order statistics which are crucial for the reconstruction of the observed distributions. Following this, the model is validated by reconstruction of observed fundamental attributes of the pandemic, the secondary attack rate (SAR) and the serial interval distribution. Then, the model is used to assess the contribution of each of the transmission modes as well the effectiveness of different prevention measures.",

The model takes into account four modes of transmission: direct or indirect contact transmission, droplets and droplet nuclei. Contact transmission begins when the primary touches his facial membranes and, as a result, contaminates his own hands. Then, the primary transfers the virus either through direct physical contact (Fig. 1 , mode 1) or indirectly via small frequently touched object (fomites), such as a doorknob or a faucet, (Fig. 1 , mode 2) to the hands of the secondary. Eventually, the secondary places his hands into his nose, mouth or eyes, which might cause an infection 21, 22 . The droplet and droplet nuclei modes of transmission (Fig. 1 , modes 3 and 4, respectively), begin when the primary coughs, sneezes, or speaks and expels virus-containing droplets. Droplets larger than 100 \u00b5 m settle by gravity within 1.5 m 3 and contaminate large surfaces such as furniture and table tops (environmental surfaces), while smaller droplets dry out (by evaporation) and form droplet nuclei which remain suspended in the air. As a result, the droplet nuclei may be carried over distances greater than 1.5 m by the air currents of the room 3 . The deposition of droplets directly on the mocusa of close contacts is a rare event in workplace or household settings 21 . Therefore, we have considered here only the contamination of environmental surfaces by the droplets after they have settled. The contaminated areas on the environmental surfaces might contaminate the hands of the secondary individual when he touches them. Finally, the probability of infection increases with the number of SARS-CoV-2 particles that reach the facial membranes of the secondary individual.",

In order to take into account these regimes, we formulated the model equations using a hybrid continuous and stochastic-jump framework 23 . In this framework, the actions of the individuals are described as stochastic jump Poisson processes, and represent behavior patterns that typically occur in the living room, kitchen, bath, and bedrooms (for simplicity, it does not take into account sleeping). The model describes the transfer of virus particle that result from each action, and consequently it is not required to follow the specific whereabouts of each individual. The environmental decay processes of the virus on the hands and on surfaces are described using continuum dynamics. A complete list of the model equations and values of the corresponding parameters are provided in the \"Methods\" section. The model explicitly tracks the dynamics of the concentration on the hands of the individuals (Eq. 8), the concentration on the fomites (Eq. 9), concentration on environmental surfaces (Eq. 11) and the concentration of the droplet nuclei in the air (Eq. 10). Since the actions of the individuals are represented as a stochastic process, we have conducted a Monte Carlo simulation in which multiple realizations were computed to obtain the appropriate ensemble statistics. Hence, using the hybrid continuous and stochastic-jump framework allowed us to estimate the variance of the transmission process, and to calculate the distribution of the serial interval which was used to validate the model. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation allowed us to embed the probability distributions of input parameters directly. Each realization begins when the primary becomes infected and begins an incubation period whose duration is drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean of 5 days and standard deviation (SD) of 0.45 days 24 . The viral load of the primary increases exponentially with time 21 reaching a maximal level at the end of the incubation period 25 . During that time, the primary and secondary individuals perform a series of randomized actions such as touching fomites, touching environmental surfaces, coughing, sneezing, talking, touching each other, or each touching his own face. The probability that the secondary individual will be infected is determined from his accumulated exposure over a time interval (Eq. 12) using the dose-response curve that was reported for SARS-CoV-1 26 (Eq. 7), assumed to be similar to SARS-CoV-2. Each realization ends when the primary develops symptoms, in accordance with the public health policy that isolates the primary at the onset of symptoms. Since the secondary individual is not infected, he does not shed virus, and therefore, there is no cross infection between other secondary individuals in the household.",

Analyzing the realizations of the reference simulation, we have quantified the contribution of the different modes of transmission to the overall exposure in scenarios where the secondary was infected (Fig. 3) . Out of the total viral dose that was transmitted to the secondary, 64.5% (Inter quartile range, IQR 55-80%) was received during direct contact events (mode 1) and 26% (IQR 13-32%) was received during indirect contact via fomites events (mode 2). The contribution of the large droplet route (mode 3) was negligible while the droplet nuclei transmission (mode 4), contributed 9.5% (IQR 3.6-12%) of the total viral dose. Hence, according to our results, the contact mode of transmission (either www.nature.com/scientificreports/ direct or indirect) is the dominant mode of infection, accounting, overall, to the transfer of 90% of the viral dosage from the primary to the secondary. The main process that underlies the contact mode of transmission is the hand-face transfer. Therefore, hygienic and behavioral measures (HBMs) that operate on the elements that constitute the contact processes are expected to significantly reduce the risk of infection. These will be analyzed in the following section.",

            "text": "Reducing the risk of infection. The fact that contact transmission is the main route of pre-symptomatic transmission, suggests that the HBMs advised to the public should focus on reducing the contamination on the hands or somehow interrupting the hand-face transfer. We have examined five HBMs: washing hands, cleaning fomites, avoiding physical contact (i.e., maintaining social distancing), wearing a mask and gloves. Naturally, conservative precautions measures would be an implementation of all these measures simultaneously. However, strict adherence to all these HBMs would be difficult to endure and to maintain over a long period of time. Therefore, we have tried to sort out several combinations of HBMs that should be readily implemented by the public, while significantly lowering the risk of infection. As the SAR is a proportion, it is appropriate to compare the HBMs in terms of odds ratio (OR), i.e., the odds that the secondary would be infected when a given combination of HBMs is taken, compared to the reference scenario in which no HBM is applied. Generally, any HBM that results in OR less than 1 decreases the risk of infection (i.e., provide smaller SAR than the reference) 34 . However, in practice the lower the OR, the more effective the HBM combination is at lowering the risk. The values brought here are in terms of OR alongside with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Washing hands is known to remove (and also destroy) virus particles from the hands and it is the simplest measure to implement. Our simulations show that washing hands once every hour rather than 3 times a day, as (Table 1) , results in OR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.67-0.8) (Fig. 4A , column H). This result is consistent with intervention studies that have shown that increased hand washing decreased respiratory illness by 20% , albeit different viruses were studied 22 . This phenomenon seems counter intuitive, as we found that 90% of the viral dosage is transmitted through the hands and it was expected that washing it would remove the contamination. In order to understand the reason for the relatively limited effect of hand hygiene, we have examined the dynamics of the virus concentration on the hands of the secondary individual (Fig. 4B ). This concentration exhibits a periodic behaviour, with a period of approximately 30-40 min, governed by contact events on fomites and the face. Therefore, hand washing is expected to dramatically reduce the risk for infection if it occurs at a frequency higher than 40 min. Unfortunately, such frequent hand washing is unrealistic. Cleaning the fomites more frequently reduces the virus repositories that are available. Cleaning of the fomites 10 times a day rather than twice a day, as in the reference simulation, results in OR of 0.84 ( 95% CI 0.77-0.92), similar to washing hands more frequently (Fig. 4A , column F). A combined strategy that consists of frequent hand washing and cleaning fomites does not decrease the risk considerably and results in OR of 0.70 ( 95% CI 0.63-0.76).",

Available experimental results on N95 filtering face-piece respirators and surgical masks reported a protection factor of 2-10 for aerosols 36 . Hence, we have used a reduction of factor 2 in the hand-face transfer as well as in the exposure to airborne virus particles as a conservative estimate. With these parameters, the simulated OR was 0.49 ( 95% CI 0.44-0.54) (Fig. 4A , column M). Wearing gloves reduces the concentration of the virus on the hands since the transfer efficiency from and to surfaces is halved with latex gloves 37 . As a result, using gloves yields OR of 0.43 ( 95% CI 0.39-0.48) (Fig. 4A , column G).

A combined strategy that includes wearing masks and avoiding contact results in OR of 0.14 ( 95% CI 0.12-0.16, Fig. 4A , column M + S), which is lower than wearing a mask and gloves (OR of 0.18, 95% CI 0.16-0.21, Fig. 4A , column M + G) or frequent hand washing, cleaning fomites and avoiding physical contact (OR of 0.23, 95% CI 0.21-0.27, Fig. 4A , column H + F + S).

Using a validated model, we were able to identify the main mode of transmission as contact associated, mostly direct contact, but also contact mediated by fomites. The principal element in this transmission is hand-face transfer. Frequent hand washing and fomite cleaning coupled with the avoidance of physical contact result in a protection similar to wearing gloves and a mask. Although the present work does not account for highly populated indoor environments (such as work or commercial spaces), the relative importance of different processes is expected to remain very similar. However, in scenarios where people are in close proximity to each other (mass transit or during medical procedures), the contribution of the droplets to the transmission is expected to be larger. Hence, such scenarios require further investigation. The relative contribution of the airborne transmission route is currently under debate. Several theoretical investigations concluded that the contribution of the airborne transmission route is significant 8, 9 . These studies assume that the viral load in the expelled droplets due to cough, sneeze and talking is 10 8 \u2212 10 9 viruses/ml which is considerably higher than the reported median value 38 of 2 \u00b7 10 8 copies/ml that was used in this work. In order to examine the effect of this assumption we used our model with the same maximal viral load of 10 8 \u2212 10 9 copies/ml. This resulted in a significant overestimation of the SAR. Specifically, we obtained a SAR of 70% , and to a SAR of 36% when only the airborne route was considered.",
