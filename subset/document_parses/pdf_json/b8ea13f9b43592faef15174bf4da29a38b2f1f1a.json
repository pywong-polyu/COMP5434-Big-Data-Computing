It affects about 30% of the world's population and causes physical and psychological burdens for patients as well as tremendous direct and indirect costs for health care systems. [1] [2] [3] [4] It is widely assumed that an episode of back pain is self-limited, and most patients will recover within 2 or 3 months with adequate treatment. However, literature provides contrary evidence: According to two reviews, only 35% of acute back pain patients are pain-free after 3 months, while about 65% still report pain after 12 months. 5, 6 These findings indicate that the assumption that spontaneous recovery occurs in a large majority of patients is not justified. 5 Additionally, it is known that questionnaires like the STarT Back tool 7, 8 can identify high-risk patients for the development of chronic back pain at an early stage of the disease. This group of patients amounts to 28%, 7 andfrom a perspective of prevention of chronic painit is crucial to apply adequate, guidelineoriented treatment early on.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 289, "end": 292, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 293, "end": 296, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 297, "end": 300, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 301, "end": 304, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 641, "end": 643, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 644, "end": 645, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 773, "end": 774, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 846, "end": 848, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 849, "end": 850, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 997, "end": 998, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "However, NLBP is often not treated according to guidelines which recommend a conservative focus on patients' empowerment, rather than pharmaceutical strategies and surgery. [9] [10] [11] Furthermore, unnecessary diagnostics, especially spinal and vertebral imaging are frequently obtained. 12 Since an interaction of physical, psychological and social factors is involved in the development and maintenance of NLBP (biopsychosocial disease model) multidisciplinary pain treatment programs (MPT) comprised of physical, psychological and educational interventions are recommended by most of the guidelines for the treatment of NLBP. [9] [10] [11] Yet, such MPTs are expensive and availability is limited. Consequently, in practice, the majority of patients do not have access to adequate treatment, neither early nor late in the course of the disease. This, in turn, may fundamentally increase the risk of developing chronic back pain leading to further disease burden and costs. eHealth and mHealth elements, like mobile health applications, clinical decision systems or telemedical tools, are able to provide improved treatment to a broad range of patients. In actual times of world-wide pandemics stamped with social distancing of patients and health care professionals, the application of digital treatments may be a reasonable and sometimes ultimate way to initiate and/or maintain the communication and treatment. 13 For example, digital tools have been shown to be effective in the treatment of NLBP in retrospective analyses and randomized controlled trials. [14] [15] [16] [17] Yet, there is still a paucity of evidence for the efficacy of eHealth and mHealth embedded in treatment paradigms in large-scale scientific studies. This approach may be the most suitable method to investigate the efficacy and efficiency of digital elements applied to health care. 18 The ongoing cluster-randomized controlled Rise-uP trial in Germany 19 targets exactly these issues. It aims to include four digital elements to a GP-centered guidelineoriented treatment algorithm: 11 1) a shared electronic case report form (eCRF),(2) a treatment algorithm for guideline-based clinical decision making, 3) teleconsultation (TC) between GP and pain specialists for patients at risk, based on STarT Back score, 7 and 4) the multidisciplinary Kaia App for the empowerment of the patient using educational content, physiotherapy and mindfulness exercises throughout the whole treatment period. 15, 17 In the present study, the IG was treated according to the Rise-uP algorithm and compared to CP who received standard of care with consideration of the \"National guideline for the treatment of unspecific back pain\". 20 The primary outcome measure was pain intensity, using the numerical pain score.

The randomization ratio of participating GPs (Rise-uP and CG) was 2:1 (Rise-uP: CG). Thereby, the 2:1 ratio referred to physicians, not to physician practices. More precisely, practices with more than one affiliated GP were randomized with all affiliated GPs to one of the study arms. In order to perform subgroup analyses in the Rise-uP arm, we randomized GPs in a 2:1 ratio and expected to achieve a 3:1 ratio in patients, since traditionally the recruitment of patients into the intervention arm of a study is more straightforward. Clinical experience and literature have shown that patients are more likely to participate in studies when innovative tools are examined and when more information about the study and the benefits for the patient are provided. 21 All GPs in the Rise-uP intervention group were trained by staff from Rise-uP headoffice, the Center of Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine, Klinikum rechts der Isar (MRI), Technical University of Munich for the management of digital tools.

However, our data show a clinically significant improvement in the Rise-uP group but not in the CG. This is especially important for securing the claim of superiority for the Rise-uP algorithm. 35, 36 One goal of the Rise-uP treatment approach was to prevent patients from developing chronic LBP by effective treatment in an early disease stage. Therefore, GPs with patients at risk received teleconsultations from pain specialist to provide counseling and assure optimized management.

Yet, explorative analysis revealed that the HRP with TC showed a substantially stronger adherence to the Kaia App training. This fully mediated the impact of TC on pain outcome. Therefore, as far as our analysis could show, TC were not effective primarily due to pain-specific expertise committed to the treating GP, but TC rather led to higher adherence to the app in patients what in turn improved pain outcome.

Some patients may continue training because it has led to improvement (\"it is good for me, go on\"), while some patients train because they have not achieved improvement yet (\"I need to continue, then it will be fine\"). Other patients may quit training because they have improved and achieved the desired outcome (\"I'm fine, don't need it anymore\"), while another group quits because they have not improved (\"It doesn't help, so it makes no sense to continue\"). Well-established processes from motivation and learning psychology support these considerations. First, patients who show a high adherence and a large improvement may be reinforced to continue frequent training due to pain relief and therefore continue. In contrast, patients who do not improve may quit training since reinforcement is not received (operant conditioning) [37] [38] [39] which in turn may facilitate perceptions of low self-efficacy 40 and learned helplessness. 41 Physical passivity and deficient coping strategies may be a further result that may increase the risk of developing chronic LBP. 42 Therefore, this group should receive special attention in the course of the disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 236, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1261, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1266, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1271, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1334, "end": 1336, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1365, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1497, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Next, for some patients who achieved the desired pain reduction further improvement may not work as reinforcement anymore (extinction of behavior). 38 Lastly, patients who continue training without improvement as a reinforcement may reveal higher frustration tolerance 43 than patients quitting because of no improvement.

Second, the claim of digital treatments for back pain does not necessarily implicate to prove superiority to the face-to -face treatment that still is the standard in health systems. 18 Regardless of these theoretical assumptions, the current data show that superiority is feasible even in a setting when a digital approach is compared to an \"active control group\" receiving standard of care.
