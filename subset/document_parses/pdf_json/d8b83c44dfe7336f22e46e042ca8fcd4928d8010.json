With refined diagnostic criteria, the public's awareness of ASD has continued to increase. Many countries have reported that the prevalence of ASD is increasing year by year, and the global prevalence rate is estimated to be \u223c1-2% (1). According to reports, 1 in 54 children in the United States may have ASD (2) . To date, only a regional survey of ASD has been conducted in China, and a national epidemiological survey has not yet been available. A meta-analysis based on studies in China revealed that the prevalence of ASD was 39.2/10,000, which was lower than the reported rates by other countries. The study explained that due to the use of varied screening and diagnostic tools, interpretation of the results should be cautious (3) . Another study in 2019 demonstrated 1% prevalence of autism in Jilin city in western China (4) . A recent multicenter survey conducted in China showed that the prevalence of ASD was 0.7%, but the participants were 6-12 years old, which excluded the younger populations (5) .",

Studies from high-income countries have shown that the mean age of diagnosis in ASD children is delayed to 50 and 60 months of age (7) .

The CHAT-23 was the first localized screening tool designed for Chinese ASD children in 2004. In 2010, Wu et al. (12) first introduced this approach in Shanghai and verified the effectiveness of the CHAT-23 as an early screening tool based on its diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (0.941 and 0.884, respectively). Ren et al. (13) reported slightly higher sensitivity and specificity values of 0.971 and 0.961, respectively. The CHAT-23 is a localized ASD screening tool that is being gradually promoted in China. In 2017, the developmental behavior group of the science branch of the Chinese Medical Association formulated an expert consensus on the early identification and screening of ASD for the first time. According to the expert consensus (14) , ASD screening for 18-and 24-month-old infants based on the three-level prevention and monitoring network of child healthcare should be a routine item in China, and the CHAT-23-A was recommended as the instrument for preliminary screening. However, at present, ASD screening in China is mainly performed offline. The successful implementation of screening requires specific conditions. First, medical staff and screening subjects need faceto-face interaction. Second, professional screening personnel are required to distribute questionnaires and judge the results, which requires private and quiet places. The high cost of human resources and long screening time limit the implementation of routine large-scale ASD screening in some hospitals, especially community health service centers.",

This field has also become a research hotspot in recent years. WeChat is a mobile application widely used in the medical industry due to its versatility in the management of chronic diseases (15) . However, there are no reports on the application of telemedicine for early ASD screening. Therefore, to resolve the disadvantages of offline questionnaire screening, we designed a remote screening system for ASD based on the WeChat platform and CHAT-23-A, combined with independent Research and Development (R&D) procedures. This system was applied to explore its practical clinical applicability in detecting ASD among children aged 18-30 months who visited our child healthcare department.",

Doctors require to conduct many routine health examinations during limited working hours, and no specialized pediatricians or psychologists are responsible for screening. (2) The screening environment is limited. Some community health service centers do not have quiet, private rooms where primary caregivers can fill in CHAT-23-A. (3) The economic feasibility of screening is limited. If routine screening is carried out for all 18-and 24month-old children in China, many paper-based questionnaires need to be printed, which is very costly and not conducive to environmental protection. (4) The screening efficiency is limited. Offline screening requires medical staff to distribute questionnaires, collect responses and compile statistical results, which is time-consuming and inefficient. (5) The authenticity and screening rate of the questionnaire are limited. In many cases, children are accompanied by grandparents or other nonprimary caregivers during their health checkups. Grandparents' comprehension is uneven, as they are not fully aware of their grandchildren's situations, which can lead to an inaccurate CHAT-23-A screening rate. Taken together, the traditional offline screening model requires a large workforce, material resources, time and costs, which results in limited screening rate, feasibility and effectiveness. The above factors are not conducive to the routine screening of ASD in children's health clinics or hospitals at all levels, especially community health service centers.",

            "text": "In China, the WeChat public account platform is widely used in the management and even treatment of chronic diseases (25) (26) (27) . This study applied telemedicine technology to the early screening of ASD for the first time, used the WeChat public account platform and CHAT-23-A to develop an online screening system named \"The Network Center for Early Screening of Autism Spectrum Disorder\" and evaluated its clinical applicability. In this study, the diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 combined with the results of CARS evaluation served as the guidelines, and the age of the children for the CHAT-23-A was 30 months, according to the recommendations for China (12) . The results showed that the CHAT-23-A fulfilled the standard criteria (6/23 items or 2/7 key items) with a high sensitivity of 0.92, specificity of 0.90, and kappa value of 0.802. The sensitivity was slightly lower than the value of 0.968 reported by Jun et al. (28) . A possible reason is that the DQ value of the four children in the ASD group in the study was close to the normal range, so the screening results were negative. Notably, the specificity of the 23 items meeting six of the individual criteria was up to 100%, which was higher than that meeting any standard (99%), according to the study by Jun et al. (28) . In addition, the present study used the ROC curve to evaluate the screening value of the scale, and the results proved that it was a comprehensive, accurate, and effective screening test. The data showed that the AUCS of all 23 items and 7 key items were close to one, indicating that the diagnosis was highly authentic. Thus, it can be deduced that the online screening model has high sensitivity and specificity, which satisfies the requirements of high sensitivity and a low missed diagnosis rate of screening tests. In addition, compared to offline screening, this online screening system could have following advantages. (1) Change in the health care model. This screening is mainly conducted online, allowing children to carry out ASD early screening without leaving their villages or communities and promoting the development of an active child healthcare model that is different from a traditional passive healthcare model. The screening system has broad participation and allows timely interaction of Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org parents, communities, and pediatricians. (2) Automatic reporting of screening results. While primary caregivers fill in children's basic information and screening scale online, the results are synchronized to mobile phones. The online screening system does not need to issue scales, statistics, and analysis results, thus reducing the demand on medical resources, avoiding errors in medical staff judgment, ensuring the accuracy of screening results, and improving screening efficiency. (3) Timely feedback of screening results. Positive screening results will be directly fed back to parents and doctors' mobile phone clients, and a dialog box will pop up to prompt the user to take the children to the community health service center or Wuxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital for further screening. (4) Data management of screening results. The internal management system can automatically aggregate all screening data, including statistics of screening numbers, positive rate, and negative rate in different community health service centers, which facilitate pediatricians to search and manage data. (5) Online consultation with the doctor. The system provides an online consultation service for users that helps parents make convenient further screening appointments. Compared to traditional paper screening methods, the online screening system could have the advantages of high efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness, which is suitable for early screening in a large sample population. The online screening system based on telemedicine is not restricted by location, screening frequency, or medical resources, which can greatly reduce the costs for patients and the workload of the medical staff. It can significantly improve efficiency with high sensitivity and specificity, rendering it suitable for clinical ASD screening of infants and young children. Moreover, the online screening system can be used in hospital childcare institutions, especially primary childcare institutions.",

Therefore, in future research, screening will be tested in general child populations who have not seen a specialist for diagnosis to further explore the screening's performance in detecting new cases of ASD. In addition, nonautistic children with other mental disorders will be added to test the ability of the CHAT-23 to distinguish ASD from other disorders. Furthermore, the advantages of the online screening system compared to traditional paper screening methods mainly come from a functional point of view. In future research, the specific time and cost of the online screening system and traditional offline screening will be calculated statistically.
