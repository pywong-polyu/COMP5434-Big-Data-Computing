Although this policy was meant to limit the spread of the virus and its effects, it has caused psychological trauma, increased stress on parents, and raised child abuse. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the issue of child abuse during online learning, its underlying factors, and its implications on children's mental health. A descriptive qualitative method was used along with a survey technique utilizing Google Forms, involving 317 parents as respondents. The results showed that there was physical, emotional, and verbal child abuse and negligence during online learning. This happened because children were often assumed of neglecting studies and misusing gadgets. Furthermore, the stress levels in parents increased due to the dual role, i.e, working and being teachers at home.",

Consequently, the whole community experiences trauma due to unpreparedness, incomplete health care system, and lockdown policy in dealing with the virus spread (Abdullah, 2020; Shammi et al., 2020) . This negatively affects the economic, environmental, and social development and growth, as well as education system. The current policy requires everyone to work from home and even children to study from home. This new rule inevitably brings about a significant impact on parents and children. In addition to working from home, parents also assume additional responsibilities and duties to teach children at home. During the current pandemic, unemployed parents or those who have to work from home experience increased pressure in their businesses along with the task of guiding children to learn (Munastiwi and Puryono, 2021) .",

Schools were asked to facilitate learning from home using either government or private digital platforms that provide free content and online learning opportunities across regions (UNICEF, 2020) . Cindy Vallely, the Executive Director of the Children Advocacy Center in Florida, was concerned about school closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. She asserted that schools, in many cases, have become shelters for children, and their closures mean that their protective structure has more or less reduced (Vallely, 2020) . These conditions give rise to many new conflicts, including increased domestic violence to spouses and children at home. Parents lose their source of income, worry about paying their bills, and many cannot manage their mentality. Consequently, they vent this anxiety by committing child abuse (Rosalin, 2020) . Therefore, data show that stress and poverty are some triggering factors of child abuse and neglect (Jonson-Reid et al., 2020) .",

Since its first outbreak in China between late 2019 and early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly affected the entire community lives and habits. The most affected countries, unavoidably face health crisis causing a long-term impact on their economic and social structure. Furthermore, there is a policy to enforce social restrictions, such as changing face-to-face learning at school environment to distance, home basis online learning (Favale et al., 2020) .

According to Leny Nurhayati Rosalin, Deputy for Child Development at the Ministry of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection, in a webinar entitled \"The New Face of Early Childhood Education Programs in Indonesia Post-COVID-19 Pandemic: School and Family Synergy\" organized by UHAMKA PGPAUD, held in Jakarta, Saturday, May 16, 2020, a total of 368 abuses were experienced by 407 children. Furthermore, she stated that many parents were not ready with the conditions to work and stay at home. Moreover, equal relations within family had not been established, and parents were not adequately prepared to be good caregivers (Kemenpppa, 2020) . Boserup et al. (2020) examined the alarming trends in US domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that work-from-home policies and school closures increased child abuse cases in the household. According to the US Police Department, there was an increase in domestic violence in Portland by 22%, San Antonio by 18%, Jefferson County, Alabama by 27%, and New York City by 10% (Boserup et al., 2020) . Research by Ghosh et al. (2020) maintains that children studying online are vulnerable of becoming violence victims in cyberspace. Lack of parental supervision during online learning may also lead them to suffer from mental and psycho-social disorders (harassment/bullying) (Ghosh et al., 2020) . Furthermore, Nurfauziah et al. (2020) asserted that ineffective online learning and piled up school assignments produce stressful and bored children, and are even vulnerable to cyber-bullying crimes (Nurfauziah et al., 2020) .",

According to Newberger, child abuse is divided into Physical, Emotional, and Verbal and Neglect (Newberger, 1994) . Child physical abuse is a form of harsh treatment of a person against a child's body by punching, biting, burning, poisoning, strangling, slapping, or kicking. It causes diverse effects, such as bruises, fractures, injuries, and wounds (Mathews et al., 2020) . The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines child physical abuse as the intentional use of physical force against children, resulting in or potentially causing physical injury (Mogaddam et al., 2016) .

This is in line with Kerns and Brumariu (2014) , who stated that insecurity contributes to children's anxiety and other mental problems (Kerns and Brumariu, 2014) . On one hand, seen from the parents' perspective, online learning does not necessarily reflect children's neglect. Parents embrace dual role during pandemic i.e., working from home to be able to survive and assisting children schooling from home. The former which is considered as the main task by parents has occasionally been misinterpreted by children as giving less attention and learning assistance. In addition, parents are not prepared and do not master the learning materials delivered by teachers.

The findings show that child verbal and emotional abuse committed by parents was increasing during the online learning. The economic pressure experienced by parents due to the lockdown policy, lack of digital literacy, and unpreparedness as a 'new teacher' are common stressors manifested through child abuse. Therefore, a thorough investigation on this problem is crucial as it may lead to vulnerability of children's mental health. Social restrictions (lockdown) policy and school closures have been enforced by government without any direct assistance to families.

This study has limitations, especially in terms of extracting information, which mostly focused on parents.
