            "text": "Introduction Uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (uLUTI) are a common problem in primary care. Current local guidelines recommend the use of a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin. However, most general practitioners (GP) prefer short-course therapies to single-dose therapy. No study has compared head-to-head short-course antimicrobial agents for uLUTIs. Therefore, the aim of this randomised clinical trial is to compare three different short-course antibiotic therapies with a single-dose of fosfomycin for these infections. Methods and analysis This will be a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, open trial. Women aged 18 or older and with symptoms of uLUTI and a positive urine dipstick analysis will be randomised to one of the following four groups: a single dose of 3 g of fosfomycin, 2 days of 3 g of fosfomycin o.d., 3 days of pivmecillinam 400 mg three times per day (t.i.d) or 5 days of nitrofurantoin 100 mg t.i.d. A total sample of 1120 patients was calculated. The primary endpoint is clinical effectiveness at day 7, defined as cure of symptoms reported by the patients in a diary including four symptoms: dysuria, urgency, frequency and suprapubic pain, which will be scored on a 4-point severity scale (not present/mild/ moderate/severe). Follow-up visits are scheduled at days 7 (phone call), 14 and 28 for assessing evolution. Urine samples will be collected in the three on-site visits and urine cultures performed. If positive, antibiograms for the three antibiotics studied will be performed. Bacterial eradication will be measured at days 14 Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This will be the first randomised controlled trial to investigate the clinical effectiveness and bacterial eradication of four antibiotic regimens administered to women with symptoms of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection. \u25ba Although masking techniques are not used, observer bias will be reduced to a minimum as the primary objective and some of the secondary objectives will be based on symptoms recorded by the patients themselves and on urine cultures. \u25ba Symptom diaries only contain four domains and are used for only 7 days, and therefore completion is simple. Nonetheless, if symptom diaries are not returned, a phone call will be made at day 7. \u25ba In the unlikely event that the COVID-19 pandemic is still present throughout the period that the clinical trial is conducted, and this hampers the inclusion of patients, the number of clinicians participating will be increased.",

            "text": "Lower urinary tract infections (LUTI) are a common problem in primary care consultations. More than 50% of all women experience at least one episode during their lifetime. 1 In more than 80% of cases, LUTI is caused by Escherichia coli. 1 2 In many clinical settings, urine cultures are not routinely performed, and women with symptoms of acute cystitis are treated empirically. Thus, empirical treatment in LUTIs should cover E. coli. Resistance of uropathogens to the classical antibiotics has significantly increased in the last years in Spain, mainly because of the high use of antibiotics. 3 The resistance of enterobacteria to third generation cephalosporins, mediated by the production of extended spectrum \u03b2 lactamases (ESBL), is a growing problem in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Indeed, in 2019, more than half of the E. coli isolates reported to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network and more than a third of the K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial group under surveillance. 4 According to recent data, the percentage of E. coli resistance to quinolones, cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin and clavulanate, although variable, ranges from 20% to 40% in Spain and approximately 10% of the isolates of E. coli are ESBL-producers. [5] [6] [7] LUTIs caused by resistant microorganisms are associated with longer symptom duration and treatment failure is more likely compared with infections caused by susceptible strains. [8] [9] [10] According to the recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, empiric antibiotic therapy should be substituted when the rates of resistance surpass 20%. 11 This means that the use of amoxicillin and clavulanate as well as quinolones are no longer recommended for the empirical treatment of LUTIs in our country. Current guidelines recommend prescribing a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin or nitrofurantoin 100 mg three times per day (t.i.d.) for 5 days. 12 13 The rationale for this strategy is based on the narrow spectrum of aetiologic agents causing acute cystitis and knowledge of their local antimicrobial resistance patterns. 14 Over the last years, the use of fosfomycin as the preferred therapy for these infections has significantly increased in Spain. However, more than half of the Spanish doctors prefer the use of short-course therapies over single-dose therapy. 15 Pivmecillinam, an antibiotic widely used in Scandinavian countries for the treatment of LUTIs, has been authorised by the Spanish Agency of Drugs and Medicine Products (2017), although it is still not marketed. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in different randomised clinical trials (RCT) and is also recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated LUTI. 16 17 The dose that will be used in our RCT has been shown to be the more effective in a recent systematic review. 18 A recent RCT including a total of 513 women with uncomplicated LUTIs found that clinical resolution at day 28 occurred in 70% of patients taking 100 mg of nitrofurantoin three times per day for 5 days and in 58% of patients assigned to a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin. The authors hypothesised that a single 3 g dose does not appear to be optimal. 19 Fosfomycin resistance is rare in areas with limited use but is on the rise in countries with higher usage, although the susceptibility rates are variable and do not exceed 10% of the isolates. [20] [21] [22] However, the use of a single dose is associated with a higher percentage of relapses, mainly in patients with recurrent LUTIs. 23 A single dose of fosfomycin-tromethamine and short-courses of nitrofurantoin and pivmecillinam are now recommended by the latest guideline of the European Association of Urology for empirical therapy of uncomplicated LUTI, 24 but no study has compared more than two short-course antimicrobial agents for uncomplicated LUTIs. 25 ",

A perprotocol analysis of those who complete the entire trial without violating the protocol, will also be performed as a sensitivity analysis of the primary results. A subgroup analyses of the main variables will be carried out by age groups (premenopausal, postmenopausal) and by region. Missing outcomes will be accounted for using multiple imputation with chained equation. 33 Twenty imputed samples will be generated, and estimates will be combined using Rubin rules. 34 Direct healthcare costs will be calculated by adding the costs derived from medication consumption, medical tests, use of health-related services, cost of relapses and cost of the staff running the intervention, for each arm. Indirect costs will be calculated considering the proportion part of quality adjusted life year indicator, the number of days with symptoms and sick days taken. 35 All the analyses will be carried out with the statistical software R V.4.0 or higher, and the level of significance will be 0.05.",

LUTIs caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as with higher treatment costs due to an increased risk of complications (urosepsis and pyelonephritis) and admission to hospital and productive losses. 9 10 The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for women with uncomplicated LUTIs has been shown to increase and spread the antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens. After two decades of increased antibiotic resistance, the urgency of the problem is now widely understood and inappropriate use of antibiotics is the main driver for the growing development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. The SCOUT study will mark a significant move forward from theory to practice in relation to promoting responsible stewardship regarding treatment of uncomplicated LUTIs in women. In our country, the increase in resistance to antibiotics used empirically in LUTIs, such as amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and quinolones, is very worrisome, and even more so at this time in which quinolones have restrictions due to safety problems. This problem, along with the fact that most GPs are reluctant to follow the national guidelines and avoid the prescribing of a single 3 g-dose of fosfomycin, makes this study very important in an area such as Spain with high resistance rates. Therefore, having comparative data in real-life can constitute the basis for implementing the most efficient option with less exposure to antibiotic treatment and contribute to reducing the increase in resistance.",

Since no RCT comparing the four available regimens has been carried out to date, we still do not know which of the three short courses is more effective in terms of clinical effectiveness and bacteriological eradication.
