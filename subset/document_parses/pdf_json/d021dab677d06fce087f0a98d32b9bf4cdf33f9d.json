In fact, the decrease in virally induced HCC might be offset by increased steatogenic HCC (Baffy, 2013) . Because few patients undergo invasive biopsy for diagnosis of NASH, the true prevalence of NASH-associated HCC is underestimated. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and HCC are more prevalent in men than in women (Lonardo et al., 2019; Natarajan et al., 2020) . On the other hand, women are four times more likely to have autoimmune hepatitis than men (Manns et al., 2010; Sohn, 2021) . This disparity in the prevalence of liver diseases neither is fully understood nor is considered in clinical practice guidelines for patients with NASH or HCC. Although sex hormones could impact the incidence of NAFLD, they are not considered to be major factors, as both premenopausal and postmenopausal women show lower incidence of NAFLD compared with men (Hamaguchi et al., 2012) . It appears that gender is a modifier rather than a driving factor for HCC.",

            "text": "Increasing evidence suggests that the immune system plays paradoxical roles in the promotion and inhibition of the hepatic inflammation and HCC. For instance, in a mouse model of chronic liver disease, the adaptive immune system in the liver improved survival of animals during liver damage and paradoxically promoted HCC (Endig et al., 2016) . In addition, CD8 + T cells and anti-PD1 immunotherapy increased NASH-associated HCC, but the outcome was reversed when tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) was blocked (Pfister et al., 2021) . In the clinic, anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy was less effective against non-viral HCC, while overall survival was similarly improved for both non-viral and viral HCC (Bonilla et al., 2020) . In regards to CD4 + T cells, while some reports suggest that Th17 cells play no role in liver injury and inhibit HCC (Xie et al., 2010; Zenewicz et al., 2007) , other reports show that Th17 cells promote liver injury and HCC (Ma et al., 2020; Nagata et al., 2008) . Similarly, M1 macrophages are reported to inhibit HCC and promote liver damage and NASH (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2019) . This immunological paradox is in large part due to a reductionistic approach by focusing on specific immune cell function or a ''cause-effect'' direction. A recent review of literature explored the complexity of tumor microenvironment (Fares et al., 2020) , suggesting that understanding and modulating the pattern of interactions might be more important than each cellular or molecular component. Discovery of such immunological patterns is feasible by taking a higher dimensional approach correlating immune cell types, their interactions, and functional changes over time. To this end, we took a perturbation three-dimensional approach (Paus, 2005) and demonstrated that the pattern of the immune response reflecting the ratio and proportion of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells, Th1/Th2/Th17 cells, NKT/NK cells, M1/M2 macrophages, and T cell phenotypes as well as an acute versus chronic pattern of inflammation are better indicators for understanding how NAFLD-associated HCC is promoted or inhibited. We found that a predominant hepatic Th1, but not Th17, inflammatory pattern was associated with the promotion of HCC. Also, we demonstrated that an equilibrium Th1 = Th17 = Th2, NKT = NK, M1 = M2 pattern, or predominant Th1 > Th17 > Th2, NKT > NK, M1 > M2 pattern could exhibit opposing outcomes, perhaps because of distinctively collective function independent from the cellular components. Accordingly, therapeutic attempts should focus on discovering methods for immune modulation toward restoration of healthy immunological patterns rather than the induction or suppression of specific immune cell types.",

In order to determine whether a higher susceptibility of males to HCC was because of their distinct ability to handle fat deposition, biological variables, including blood glucose, body weight, liver weight, and structural fat deposition in the liver and abdominal area, were investigated longitudinally during a WD. Both males and females showed similar patterns of weight gain ( Figure 1A , left panel) and elevated blood glucose during WD compared with mice being on a chow diet (CD) ( Figure 1A , middle panel). However, liver weight was significantly increased in males compared with females while being on a WD ( Figure 1A , right panel). A greater increase in the liver weight of males 24 weeks after being on a WD (during NAFLD) was associated with predominant fat deposition in the liver shown by a fatty discoloration ( Figure S2A ) compared with females showing a predominant visceral fat deposition as abdominal obesity ( Figure S2B ). Males and females showed similar patterns of abdominal fat during NASH and HCC (data not shown). Similar observations were made in a mouse model of alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) ( Figure S3C ).",

Among 44 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the serum, females showed significantly decreasing trends for four pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (CCL11, CCL22, CXCL10, and interleukin-9 [IL-9]) while males showed a significantly decreasing trend only for the pro-inflammatory CXCL9 (Figure 2A) .

Analysis of the splenic immune cells showed that aging was associated with a significantly increasing trend (**p = 0.001) toward the CD8 + > CD4 + pattern in males (***p < 0.0001), while females sustained the CD8 + > CD4 + pattern (***p < 0.0001; Figure  2B ).

By 40 weeks of being on a WD, four inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (CXCL9, IL-2, LIF, and TIMP1) showed significant changes, with females exhibiting an acute pattern of response during WD by significantly raising at week 19 and subsequent drop compared with those during CD ( Figure S3A , upper panels). In contrast, these cytokines and chemokines showed chronic patterns in males by continuously increasing or persisting during WD ( Figure S3A , lower panels). By 48 weeks of being on WD, distinct patterns of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected in males and females ( Figure S3B ). Specifically in females, seven cytokines and chemokines significantly increased (granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor [GM-CSF], p = 0.001; IL-13, p = 0.04; KC/CXCL1, p = 0.04; LIX/ CXCL5, p = 0.004; MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3, p = 0.004; MIP-1\u03b2/CCL4, p = 0.0004; TIMP-1, p = 0.04) and four cytokines and chemokines significantly decreased (CCL22, p = 0.0004; EPO, p < 0.0001; IL-11, p = 0.04; MIP-3\u03b2/CCL19, p = 0.03) during HCC. In males, discordantly three cytokines and chemokines increased (IL-12 p40, p = 0.002; LIX/CXCL5, p = 0.003; MIP-1\u03b2/CCL4, p = 0.02) and four cytokines and chemokines decreased (IL-20, p = 0.02; M-CSF, p = 0.04; MIP-3\u03b2/CCL19, p = 0.008; EPO, p = 0.004) during HCC ( Figure S3B ). Among 44 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, MCP-1/CCL2 was found to have a prognostic value in females, but not in males, by a significant increase during the progression of HCC ( Figure S3C ; p = 0.05) and a significant decrease during the rescue from HCC ( Figure S3B ; p = 0.05). Similarly, analysis of 65 cytokines and chemokines in the sera of patients during the progression of NASH versus healthy controls showed significantly decreased CXCL1 (p = 0.05) and CXCL12 (p = 0.03) as well as significantly increased CCL7 (p = 0.03), CXCL10 (p = 0.001), IL-1R\u03b1 (p = 0.001), IL-33 (p = 0.02), IL-16 (p = 0.02), and IL-28\u03b1 (p = 0.02) only in women during NASH ( Figure S4 ). Men with NASH did not show significant changes in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with healthy controls ( Figure S4 ).",

Reversal of WD to CD resulted in insignificant decline in hepatic immune cells in males or females ( Figure 4C ). In order to determine the cellular component of lobular inflammation, hepatic immune cells were analyzed during WD compared with those during CD. An earlier lobular inflammation in females during WD contained different immunological patterns compared with males, with females showing a shift from an equilibrium CD8 + = CD4 + pattern to a predominant CD8 + > CD4 + pattern inversely correlated with their patterns in males ( Figure 4D ; ***p = 0.003). Also, females sustained M1 > M2 pattern and switched from NKT > NK to NKT = NK pattern while males significantly decreased M1 > M2 pattern and sustained NKT > NK pattern ( Figure  4D ).

            "text": "Men show a higher incidence with severe manifestations of NAFLD and NASH and HCC than women (Lonardo et al., 2019; Natarajan et al., 2020) . This disparity is thought to be due to the ability of women to resolve inflammation and inhibit chronic inflammation better than men (Rathod et al., 2017) . In fact, women produce higher levels of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), such as lipoxins, protectins, resolvins, and maresins (Rathod et al., 2017) . Paradoxically, women are four times more likely to develop autoimmune hepatitis than men (Manns et al., 2010) . Therefore, these disparities cannot be fully explained in the context of inflammation without understanding of the adaptive immune response in the liver. Genetically, the X chromosome is suggested to play key role in the immune response since many proteins that are involved in immune responses are encoded on the X chromosome (Libert et al., 2010) . For instance, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), CD40 ligand, and the main proteins associated with nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling pathway are linked to the X chromosome (Spolarics, 2007) . Although one of the two X chromosomes in females is randomly inactivated by methylation, about 15% of X-linked genes escape methylation, resulting in increased proteins linked to the X chromosome in women compared with men (Carrel and Willard, 2005; Chitnis et al., 2000) . In other words, females are composed of a mosaic of cells from paternal and maternal X chromosomes, providing them with greater diversity of immune responses (Spolarics, 2007; Spolarics et al., 2017) and enabling them to show lower levels of some inflammatory cytokines and better immune responses compared with men (Conti and Younes, 2020) .",

Here, we demonstrated that, similar to humans, female DIAMOND mice had a lower incidence of NAFLD-associated HCC. A lower susceptibility of female mice to NAFLD was associated with distinct anatomical deposition of fat predominantly in the abdominal region compared with males showing fat deposition mainly in the liver. Also, female mice responded to a corrective diet better than males by a complete rescue from steatohepatitis and HCC.",

            "text": "Longitudinal studies during aging on a CD revealed gender predisposition of males to NAFLD-associated HCC. In fact, females were able to modulate aging-associated several inflammatory cytokines compared with males. In the liver, females tend to modulate the hepatic inflammation by establishing the Th1 = Th17 = Th2 and NKT = NK patterns while males tend to mount the inflammatory Th17 > Th1 > Th2 and NKT > NK patterns during aging on a CD. In addition, females tend to sustain predominant hepatic CD4 + and CD8 + Te phenotypes, while males tend to dominate CD4 + and CD8 + Tcm phenotypes during aging (Table 1) . A stronger hepatic immune system by sustaining Te phenotypes while maintaining an equilibrium Th1 = Th17 = Th2, NKT = NK pattern in the liver of females could explain their lower susceptibility to NAFLD and HCC as well as their higher susceptibility to autoimmune liver disease compared with males. In response to a WD, females mounted an early and acute pattern of the inflammatory cytokines CXCL9, LIF, IL-2, and TIMP-1, whereas males mounted a delayed and chronic pattern of these cytokines. An acute versus a chronic pattern of inflammation is important because of short-term anti-fibrotic and longterm pro-fibrotic effects of CXCL9 (Berres et al., 2015; Tacke et al., 2011; Wasmuth et al., 2009 ) and TIMP-1 (Thiele et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2011) .

Also, females elevated seven inflammatory cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-13, CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL3, CCL4, and TIMP-1), while males increased only three inflammatory cytokines IL-12, CXCL5, and CCL4. Similar trends were detected in patients with NASH, with women, but not men, elevating six inflammatory cytokines IL-1Ra, CXCL10, IL-16, CCL7, IL-33, and IL-28\u03b1.

Our findings are consistent with other reports showing a higher frequency of interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-producing Th1 cells during the progression of NAFLD to NASH (Rau et al., 2016) . IFN-\u03b3 has also been reported to be involved in the initiation stage of diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC due to its inflammatory function (Matsuda et al., 2005) and during NAFLD (Alisi et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2017) . Also, CD4 + Th1 cells are reported to be involved in obesity-related insulin resistance (Cho et al., 2014) . On the other hand, anti-tumor function of Th17 has been supported in a systemic review of literature on cancer, showing that Th17 cells are associated with improved prognosis while IL-17 is associated with poor prognosis (Punt et al., 2015) . In fact, IL-17-producing Th17 cells are reported to exacerbate tumorigenesis and liver damage (Chang, 2019) , while IL-22-producing Th17 cells could facilitate recovery of the liver from injury (Arshad et al., 2020) . In regard to macrophages, M1 macrophages, while displaying anti-tumor function, could also cause liver damage (Zimmerer et al., 2018) . Very recent analysis revealed that M1 macrophages with an M1 > M2 pattern were associated with aggressive cancer biology without any survival benefit (Oshi et al., 2020) . Also an M1 > M2 pattern promoted NAFLD-associated HCC (Wu et al., 2020) . Our data also suggest that the hepatic CD8 + and CD4 + Te phenotypes might initially have anti-tumor function but could promote tumor growth when they remain chronically elevated throughout a WD. This possibility is supported by very recent observations in non-viral HCC such that increased hepatic CD8 + T cells resulted in increased incidence of liver damage, NASH, and HCC in preclinical models as well as in patients with NASH (Pfister et al., 2021) . It is also reported that CD8 + T cells can increase glucose uptake and glycolysis after activation (Macintyre et al., 2014) .",

A very recent report demonstrated that patterns of dendritic cells and monocyte subsets are associated with the severity and mortality of patients with liver cirrhosis (Cardoso et al., 2021) . In fact, an equilibrium Th1 = Th17 = Th2, NKT = NK, M1 = M2 pattern; semi-equilibrium Th1 = Th17 > Th2, CD8 + = CD4 + , NKT = NK pattern; or predominant CD8 + > CD4 + , Th1 > Th17 > Th2, NKT > NK, M1 > M2 pattern could each exhibit distinctively collective functions independent from the cellular components. This is because of the counter-regulatory role of cytokines released by these cells. For instance, Th1 cytokines inhibit Th2 cells vice versa, resulting in the formation of different functional entities when these cells display in equilibrium or dominant pattern.",

This would be possible by deep sequencing at a single-cell level encompassing the hepatic immune cell types, network of their interactions, gene regulations, and functional changes over time.

Sera were collected at 19, 24, and 40 weeks of being on CD or WD for multiplex cytokine analysis. A reverse diet group (RD) were put on CD after 36 weeks of being on WD, when animals developed progressive NASH , and were followed by weeks 48 through 60. Animals were sacrificed at weeks 24, 40 or 48-60 of being on diet, and their livers and spleens were subjected to multiplex flow cytometry analysis of immune cells as well as IHC analysis of fatty liver and HCC. Five mice per group were used unless stated otherwise. The time points were chosen because of our previous observations on clinical manifestation of NAFLD (24 weeks), progressive NASH (36-40 weeks) and stage III HCC (48-60 weeks) . These studies have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Virginia Commonwealth University. Flow cytometry and immunophenotyping-In order to perform multiparametric measurements of specific subpopulations within gated lymphoid or myeloid cells, and capture their pattern of rearrangements as gated and total frequency, flow cytometry analysis was performed. After taking small samples for formalin fixation, the whole spleen and liver collected from animals at weeks 24, 40, and 48-60 of being on a CD or a WD or a RD, were homogenized into a single cell suspension as described previously by our group (Payne et al., 2018) . The Fc blocker anti-CD16/32 Ab was used for all staining panels. We used T cell phenotyping panel ( ). All panels were used with APC/Cy5-FVS in order to gate on FVSviable cells. All reagents were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA), except for BD Horizon APC/Cy5-FVS and BUV395-CD3 (SK7) which were purchased from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). We showed that CD4 + CXCR3 + CCR8 -CCR6 -Th1 cells mainly express T-bet, but not much of other Th transcription factors ( Figure S1 ). CCR6 is universally expressed on Th17 cells (Wang et al., 2009) , which was confirmed by detecting the Th17 transcription factor RoRgt in CD4 + CCR6 + CCR8 \u2212 CXCR3 -T cells ( Figure S1 ). The expression of Foxp3 in the hepatic Th cells was relatively negligible during disease progression as shown by a representative data in Figure S1 . All reagents were used at the manufacturer's recommended concentration. For lymphocytes and myeloid cells, gated lymphoid and myeloid regions were analyzed, respectively. Multicolor data acquisition was performed using a LSRFortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences) and a ImageStreamX Mark II Imaging Flow Cytometer (Millipore Sigma, Billaerica, MA). Data were analyzed using FCS Express v5.0 (De Novo Software; Glendale, CA).",

The ''out of (upper/lower) range'' values were replaced by the maximum/ minimum measures, respectively, and other OOR values were set as missing values. The cytokine measures were log2-transformed. For the time course analysis ( Figures 3A and  S3B ), linear regression was used to model the change in the cytokine measure over time separately for male and female subgroups. For the significant cytokine changes due to diet analysis ( Figure S3A ), linear regression modeling the effect of cytokine, diet, time, and their interactions were used. In the case of missing data, we use complete case analysis to exclude that time point. All analysis was performed in R version 3.6.0. p-values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg method. We also used Wilcoxon rank sum twosided tests to compare between the various cytokine groups as desired, varying with gender and diet. Due to the small sample sizes, exact tests were used. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was performed to determine progression-free survivals for two groups. For cellular analyses, statistical comparisons between groups were made using two-tailed Student's t-test per the specific hypothesis. A p value % 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
