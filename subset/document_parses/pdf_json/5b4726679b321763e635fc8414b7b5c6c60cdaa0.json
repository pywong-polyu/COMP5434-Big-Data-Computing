In addition to the threat of infection, public mental health and well-being were expected to deteriorate in tandem with these dramatic changes at personal (eg, restricted freedom), social (eg, due to isolation and distancing) and economic levels (eg, unemployment and financial hardship), particularly for vulnerable individuals. 3 5 Studies from China in the very early stages of COVID-19 pandemic have found high levels of mental health problems and distress in the general population. 6 7 Previous epidemics where similar public health measures were taken, for example, SARS, resulted in an elevated suicide rate in elderly population (over 65 years) in Hong Kong in 2003. 8 9 This was associated with",

However, important psychological factors such as loneliness, perceived stress level and coping were not examined. Loneliness, the self-perceived deficiency of an individual's social relation network in quantitative or qualitative terms, 10 has been identified as an important factor associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviours. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The effect of loneliness on suicidal thoughts and behaviours is more prominent in younger (16-20 years) and older (>58 years) populations because these two age groups similarly experience periods where drastic changes in social status occur. 13 Previously, social isolation and loneliness were linked to health protection measures similar to those taken in the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a deterioration in children and young people's mental health. 18 Similarly, individuals' perceived stress level is often associated with suicidal behaviours alongside mental disorders such as depression. [19] [20] [21] Perceived stress and poor coping mechanisms are associated with suicidal behaviours in both younger [22] [23] [24] [25] and older individuals. 26 A UK-wide lockdown was announced on 23 March 2020 which included instructions to the general population to stay at home, socially/physically distance and self-isolate if they had symptoms. This was accompanied by guidance regarding movements outside the home for exercise and grocery shopping. These restrictions were fully in place until 13 May 2020 when they were gradually eased. Given the potential for such measures to be implemented in any further waves of COVID-19 or other pandemics, it is important to understand the effects of these measures on mental health and well-being in order to mitigate them in the future and address them currently. A growing body of emerging research focuses on assessing mental health and well-being in response to the pandemic and measures taken to curb its spread at a population level. 27 Outcomes related to self-harm and suicidality have not been commonly reported in repeated surveys although they are included in some. 28 29 This study aimed to explore the risk factors for suicidal thoughts and selfharm in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK population using a repeated cross-sectional online population survey representative of the adult UK population. We assessed the effects of known modifiable psychological risk factors including loneliness and coping, as well as pre-existing mental health conditions and other sociodemographic covariates.",

We examined the public's mental health by assessing emotional responses, sources of social distress, coping, suicidal thoughts and self-harm in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic from individuals aged \u226518 years living in the UK. Data for the 'Coronavirus: Mental Health in the Pandemic' study were first collected shortly before the UK-wide lockdown was announced and repeated approximately every 3-4 weeks. In this study, we report on the first four waves with wave 1, wave 2, wave 3 and wave 4 conducted on 17-18 March 2020, 2-3 April 2020, 24-26 April 2020 and 28-29 May 2020, respectively. We aimed at a sample size of ~2000 in waves 1 and 2 but this was then doubled to ~4000 in later waves to increase statistical power for subgroups. Data collection is still underway although at increased intervals and all surveys were administered online by YouGov, a social market research company that recruited participants to form a panel containing over 1 million individuals from the UK. 27 Quota sampling was used and data were weighted to be representative to the UK adult population. Detailed procedures for sampling and weighting were described in the Suppl Methods (online supplemental file 1). Participants were different in each wave but taken from the same panel and representative of the UK adult population. Weighted bases, counts and percentages were reported unless otherwise specified to avoid identification of individuals in the case of small counts.",

To pool data from two waves, sampling weights for each wave were reweighted using the sample population of each wave according to previously described methodology for analysing multiple independent surveys. 34 Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses for suicidal thoughts and self-harm were performed with the independent variables including time (wave 3 vs wave 4), loneliness, coping, sex, age, marital status, social grade, working status, pre-existing mental health conditions, household information, variables for living arrangements and urban/rural characteristics.

We also included wave-by-loneliness, wave-by-coping, wave-by-sex, wave-by-age and wave-byworking status interaction terms in the adjusted model to explore change in effects of risk factors over time. Due to model convergence issues, the 'employed' category of the working status variable was not further stratified by furlough status in the regression analyses. We reported both risk ratios (RR) and risk difference (RD) with the corresponding 95% CIs and p values for independent variables. For the adjusted analysis, we also reported the Wald \u03c7 2 statistics to examine the significance of overall effects for all independent variables and interactions. To assess the trend of the effect sizes over age, we performed the \u03c7 2 test for linear trend to the model coefficients for the age variable in the adjusted analyses.

Similar patterns were observed for self-harm although the RD between unemployed and employed categories was marginally nonsignificant (RD=0.022, 95% CI \u22120.001 to 0.045, p=0.055). The effect sizes of the variables on suicidal thoughts and self-harm were reduced in the adjusted models (table 2, online supplemental tables 10 and 11). For suicidal thoughts, effect sizes of loneliness and coping 'not well' with stress remained statistically significant. The effect sizes were the largest in the younger age group (18-24, 25-34 and 35-44 years) and remained significant in the adjusted analysis but decreased monotonically with older age groups (for RR: \u03c7 2 for testing linear trend=8.8, df=1, p=0.003; for RD: \u03c7 2 for testing linear trend=8.5, df=1, p=0.004).

Loneliness and coping remained significantly associated with suicidal thoughts whereas coping with stress but not loneliness was an important factor for self-harm when we adjusted our analyses for other covariates at a personal, household and area level. Having pre-existing mental health conditions or psychiatric diagnosis was a strong and statistically robust risk factor for both outcomes. For sociodemographic factors, we found that effect sizes remained the largest and statistically significant for the youngest (18-24 years) and monotonically decreased with older age groups for both suicidal thoughts and selfharm. In contrast, the effect of employment status was not statistically evident. Our results did not identify significant temporal changes in the risk of having suicidal thoughts/ self-harm and the effects of the interested risk factors on the outcomes remained constant between wave 3 and wave 4. Our sensitivity analysis was in agreement with the main analysis with minor exceptions. We believed that those disagreements stem from the omission of important risk factors (eg, pre-existing mental health conditions) due to data unavailability at wave 2 in the sensitivity analysis, resulting in overestimation of other effects and interactions. Interestingly, loneliness was a statistically robust risk factor for self-harm only in the sensitivity but not in the main analysis where more covariates, including preexisting mental health conditions, were included in the adjusted model. This difference and our other results are consistent with the findings of a recent review on the impact of loneliness and social isolation measures related to disease containment which showed high correlation of loneliness and mental health symptoms in children and young people. 18 Due to differences in sampling methodologies and measures used, direct comparison of prevalences found in our study with other studies is not robust. Our measures on suicidal thoughts/self-harm were asked in relation to them being a consequence of the pandemic. Thus, the respective prevalences are lower than those from similar UK population-based survey (eg, Iob and colleagues 28 ) since instances not related to the pandemic might not be captured. Nonetheless, our prevalence of having mental health conditions (~20%) is in keeping with other UK studies (~17%-26% 28 29 36-38 ) . After the UK lockdown from early April 2020 (wave 2 onwards), we did not observe any further significant increase in the proportion of participants with suicidal thoughts, self-harm, loneliness and coping not well. This is consistent with the constant or even decreasing trends of various mental health outcomes for the general population shortly after lockdown. 29 37 38 Notably, our increasing, although nonsignificant trend of suicidal thoughts from early April to the end of May 2020 qualitatively tallies with the increase of suicidal ideation over the same period in a similar study. 29 Results from our unadjusted analyses are similar to others suggesting suicidal thoughts and self-harm are higher among women, younger ages, people experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage and those with pre-existing mental conditions. 28 29 These factors are strongly associated with other adverse mental health outcomes during the pandemic as reported elsewhere. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Comparison of effect sizes from multivariable analyses across studies is more challenging because of the differences in the use and definitions of outcomes and covariates. Nonetheless, pre-existing mental health conditions and lack of coping are strongly associated with suicidal thoughts/self-harm. Young people with pre-existing mental health issues and not coping well were unsurprisingly more likely to experience adverse outcomes, the effect size of loneliness reduced (especially in relation to self-harm) when all measured psychosocial, demographical and environmental factors were adjusted for.",

We made use of an online population survey, the only feasible method of recruitment during lockdown that contained questions on suicidal thoughts, self-harm, loneliness coping with stress alongside a broad range of other factors. Since data were collected from panellists recruited from all UK nations with quota sampling and weighting, our results are representative for the UK adult general population. The survey is repeated approximately every 3-4 weeks, began prelockdown from mid-March 2020 so that change in outcomes and other factors due to the evolving nature of the outbreak (eg, increase in loneliness after lockdown) were captured.

Doubts have also been cast on the representativeness of non-probability internet-based samples as the outcome of interest may differ from that of the target population even when quotas and weighting were applied. 49 Digital poverty (particularly for older population) and the digital divide may hamper representativeness and data validity. It is worth noting that full-time students were over-represented (~7%) in our sample when compared with available statistics (~4%, from ~2 million students studied in higher education institutions out of ~52 million UK adult population in 2019/2020 50 51 ). In order to increase statistical power for subgroup analyses, sample sizes in waves 3 and 4 were approximately doubled compared with those in waves 1 and 2. Therefore, our prevalences should not be regarded as precise and conventional estimates.

The same limitation applies to establishing causation from data across time points. However, our results are still comparable across waves and representative of the adult UK population. Questions on suicidal thoughts and self-harm were asked as a result of the pandemic. Thus, interpretation of the prevalences requires caution as the actual prevalence of these outcomes may be underestimated due to under-reporting of instances not related to the pandemic. As a public mental health survey, we did not include validated measures for screening of mental disorders and psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety as adopted by others. 52 Not all individuals with mental health conditions experienced the same level of stress during the pandemic in the same way (eg, those with social phobia, differences in symptom severity and chronicity 53 ). Thus, our findings of a strong association between pre-existing mental health conditions and having suicidal thoughts/self-harm may vary across those with specific mental health issues. Not all participants provided conclusive answers on having pre-existing mental health conditions and we found similar relative risks of having suicidal thoughts/self-harm between participants having mental health conditions and those with missing/inconclusive responses. Given such similarity, we may surmise that those who made inconclusive responses were likely to have mental health conditions. However, we cannot reliably exclude other factors that may have contributed to the elevated risks. In any case, we demonstrated that having pre-existing mental health conditions/psychiatric diagnosis was a robust factor associated with suicidal thoughts and self-harm.",

We also considered our data as preliminary given the early stage of our study with limited number of waves of data collection and the rapidly changing situation of the ongoing pandemic and the associated policy response.

While a rise in suicide as a consequence of the pandemic is not inevitable, 5 the rise in loneliness in young people and the association with suicidal thoughts and self-harm are of concern particularly given the findings of a recent report from the National Child Mortality Database which identifies a potential increase (although not significant) in suicides in under 18 year-olds in the early period of time after lockdown. 57 In view of our findings, we argue that any lockdown measures should be accompanied by universal interventions aimed at the general population that could: (1) protect mental health against loneliness and isolation; and (2) enhance coping and resilience under stress. The Open access robust association between loneliness and suicidality in young people in our study could partially explain the deterioration of mental health subsequent to the pandemic containment measures which appears to have disproportionately affected young adults. 18 40 Hence, efforts should be made to repurpose existing psychological strategies for promoting mental health and behavioural change in young people that are suitable for social isolation/ quarantine settings. 3 18 Recent reviews suggested benefits of using digital interventions, for example, computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for young people when conventional therapies are limited or delayed. 58 59 However, further research evidence is required to evaluate the effectiveness of these digital interventions particularly for individuals lacking adequate digital resources, as well as to examine potential privacy issues. 3 5 18 Selective interventions may include exploring more effective ways of signposting, delivering mental health services and assisting individuals in crisis particularly for vulnerable groups, 3 5 as well as locally driven peer support programmes.",

Policy decisions about this and any future waves or pandemics should take into account the risks of loneliness.",
