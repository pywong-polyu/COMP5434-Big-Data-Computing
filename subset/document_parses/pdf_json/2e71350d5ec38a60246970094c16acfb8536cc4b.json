Thus, providing social and medical care to this vulnerable population is urgently needed at the public health level.",

Ear acupressure was applied to unilateral shenmen, kidney, heart, brain, and forehead points to improve cognitive function. 13 Sterile intradermal acupuncture needles (DongBang Acupuncture, 0.18 mm * 1.3 mm) were inserted, and she was instructed to perform self-acupressure for five sessions daily, 10 seconds for each acupoint per session, for a period of four to five days between visits. In the following visit, the existing needles were removed and new intradermal needles were attached to the acupuncture points on the contralateral ear. She was asked to remove the intradermal needles herself or contact the public health center if she felt severe pain, itching, tingling, or a sensation of heat in the place where the needle was attached. Thorough disinfection was performed using a disposable alcohol skin cleaner before and after acupuncture. Supportive counseling was conducted during the needle retention time to reduce depression. 14 The counseling mainly involved listening to the patient's painful thoughts with a tolerant attitude and comforting her when she expressed negative emotions. However, discussion of the painful thoughts of the patient was not forced. To assess pain, cognitive function, and depressive severity, the following scales were used: the numeric rating scale (NRS) 17 Pain assessments were performed at each visit, while the cognitive and depression assessments were performed every two months.",

            "text": "Initially, the patient had severe pain intensity at the low back, shoulder (bilaterally), and knee joint (bilaterally), mild-to-moderate impairment of cognitive function, and high depressive severity. During the one-year period, her pain initially decreased, increased steeply once farming season began, and then remained moderate until the end of the service. This suggests that body acupuncture at the ashi points was effective for pain relief but did not reduce the degree of pain in this patient to the extent that it did not affect daily life. This is likely due to the burden of parallel farming, especially as her pain intensity increased sharply in April-May, when the farming days became busy. However, there is a possibility that the effect size of the acupuncture intervention, especially the acupuncture on ashi points, was small. Due to the nature of the visiting care service, additional techniques such as electrical stimulation, moxibustion, and infrared irradiation could not applied. However, if the resources of the public health center permitted it, the use of a portable electrical stimulator, electronic moxibustion, and cupping may have increased the effect size. In addition, simple and inexpensive complementary therapies such as aromatherapy have the potential to be used to improve pain and depression. 19 No noticeable changes were observed in cognitive function as assessed by the MMSE-DS or depression as assessed by the GDS-SF-K. Interestingly, however, the cognitive function assessed by the MoCA-K steadily increased and eventually reached the normal range at the final assessment. In particular, naming and attention domains showed the most consistent improvement results. Given that the MoCA is more effective at screening MCI than the MMSE and that her initial MoCA-K score was estimated at less than 17, 18 the results of this case suggest that her cognitive function was between normal and dementia initially and that it was improved through the visiting care service. The possibility of other influencing factors cannot be excluded. However, her cognitive improvement is likely to be related to the service, given that she had few social activities and did not attend dementia prevention classes conducted by the welfare center. Nevertheless, it should be acknowledged that it remains unclear whether the improvements in her cognitive function were attributable to the ear acupressure, acupuncture, the visit itself, or pain relief. Also, given that MoCA tools may be vulnerable to practice effects, 20 the observed positive effects of our treatment on cognitive function may still be controversial. Finally, her depressive symptoms barely changed and remained severe overall. The questions in the GDS-SF-K mainly inquire about happiness, vitality, and the meaning of life, with either yes or no answers. The KM doctor felt that the patient's depressive symptoms were alleviated over time, but since the GDS-SF-K did not detect the depth of the depressive severity, no change was observed in this index. Therefore, in future studies, while the use of the GDS-SF-K may be appropriate for in-depth psychological therapies that directly address the meaning of life or profound distress, it may be more appropriate to use other Likert scales to better assess severity in studies aimed at alleviating depressive feelings.",
