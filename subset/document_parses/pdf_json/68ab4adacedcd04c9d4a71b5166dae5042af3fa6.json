Research on MI has made significant progress in feature information detection and machine learning decoding algorithms, but there are still problems, such as a low overall recognition rate and large differences in individual execution effects, which make the development of MI run into a bottleneck. Aiming at solving this bottleneck problem, the current study optimized the quality of the MI original signal by \"enhancing the difficulty of imagination tasks,\" conducted the qualitative and quantitative analyses of EEG rhythm characteristics, and used quantitative indicators, such as ERD mean value and recognition rate. Research on the comparative analysis of the lower limb MI of different tasks, namely, high-frequency motor imagination (HFMI) and low-frequency motor imagination (LFMI), was conducted. e results validate the following: the average ERD of HFMI (\u22121.827) is less than that of LFMI (\u22121.3487) in the alpha band, so did (\u22123.4756 < \u22122.2891) in the beta band. In the alpha and beta characteristic frequency bands, the average ERD of HFMI is smaller than that of LFMI, and the ERD values of the two are significantly different (p \ufffd 0.0074 < 0.01; r \ufffd 0.945). e ERD intensity STD values of HFMI are less than those of LFMI. which suggests that the ERD intensity individual difference among the subjects is smaller in the HFMI mode than in the LFMI mode. e average recognition rate of HFMI is higher than that of LFMI (87.84% > 76.46%), and the recognition rate of the two modes is significantly different (p \ufffd 0.0034 < 0.01; r \ufffd 0.429). In summary, this research optimizes the quality of MI brain signal sources by enhancing the difficulty of imagination tasks, achieving the purpose of improving the overall recognition rate of the lower limb MI of the participants and reducing the differences of individual execution effects and signal quality among the subjects.",

At the same time, a mode similar to simulated exercise is a kind of self-movement in the brain, that is, motor imagination [1] [2] [3] . Motor imagination (MI) is defined as having no movement of oneself, simply relying on one's own brain to perform the movement of imagining oneself [4] . In the process of MI, it can enhance the ability to activate a specific motor function area in the brain and then achieve the purpose of improving the motor function [5, 6] . In addition, motor imagination and actual action execution have similar cognitive processes, which can reveal the inner relationship between the neural mechanism of motor imagination and actual action execution [7] . MI has the characteristics of independence and spontaneity that do not depend on external stimuli and has been widely used in the neurorehabilitation of stroke patients, sports training, brain-computer interface, and other fields and has become a research hotspot [8] .",

Nonetheless, a low overall recognition rate, large differences in individual execution effects, and variances in signal quality are still problems that must be solved, which impeded the application in home-based remote neurorehabilitation [8] . Studies by scholars have confirmed that high-frequency upper limb MI can enhance the intensity of MI by enhancing the difficulty of imagination tasks [11] [12] [13] [14] ; it could be also an effective way for lower limb MI and has potential value for leg motor rehabilitation and motor skill training [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, given that the EEG signals of lower limb MI are difficult to identify, there are few reports on the study of lower limb MI with divergent frequencies [16, 17] . is study aims to investigate various frequency leg-raising imagination tasks for MI to compare high-and low-frequency lower limb MI and to ensure whether HFMI can increase the difficulty of imagination tasks, strengthen the activation ability of the brain motor neural network of the participants, and improve the MI implementation effect. e results suggest that HFMI can optimize the quality of the brain signal of MI, improve the recognition rate, and reduce the difference in individuals in some respects that may be beneficial to leg motor rehabilitation and motor skill training. Section 2 deals with the methods and materials for building the proposed paradigm of the study. is experimental paradigm is based on noninvasive measurements. Section 3 presents the results of the comparative analysis of the lower limb MI of HFMI and LFMI. Section 4 discusses the differences between distinct tasks. Subsequently, the conclusion and the arrangement of future works are tackled.",

In addition, they were required to imagine strictly with video actions on the process of MI in the first-person perspective. Before the MI, there will be a red circle on the screen to indicate that it will last for 1 second, and then the subjects will start the MI task induced by the video.",

In the beta characteristic frequency band, the difference in ERD values among the HFMI task participants is small, and the difference in ERD values among the LFMI task participants is small. Figure 6 shows the statistical analysis produced p-values and r-values of HFMI and LFMI in the alpha and beta frequency bands obtained by statistical analysis. Figure 6 (a) illustrates that the ERD mean values of HFMI and LFMI are significantly correlated with the alpha band (p \ufffd 0.001 < 0.01; r \ufffd 0.811). Figure 6 (b) displays the correlation of the ERD mean between HFMI and LFMI in the beta frequency band (p \ufffd 0.0002 < 0.01; r \ufffd 0.212). In addition, Figure 5 depicts that the characteristic frequencies of HFMI and LFMI are significantly correlated with a frequency range of 0-30 Hz (p \ufffd 0.0074 < 0.01; r \ufffd 0.945).",

In the preparatory experiment, twice leg lifts in 4 seconds are set as a low-frequency leg lift, which is the lower limit frequency; four times lifts in 4 seconds are the high leg lift frequency, which is the upper limit frequency. is study is conducted by comparing the two experimental paradigms of HFMI and LFMI: the time-frequency diagram shows that from the beginning of the two types of the experimental tasks of HFMI and LFMI to the end of the task (t \ufffd 0-4 second), the ERD phenomenon induced by HFMI is more significant than that of LFMI (as shown in Figure 3 ). Because the ERD phenomenon can truly reflect the activity state of cerebral cortex neurons, the motor imagination task does not require the subjects to perform any exercises, and the subjects must inhibit their own motor behaviors and complete the motor imagination tasks at the same time. As the difficulty of imagination increases, the subjects exert greater inhibition activities to prevent the occurrence of the exercise behavior of performing the movement, resulting in a significant ERD phenomenon. e ERD phenomenon is that when a person performs imaginary limb movements, the EEG signal of the corresponding brain area is inhibited, which leads to an evident and short-term energy attenuation in a specific frequency band. e imagination task of HFMI is comparatively more difficult; hence, HFMI has a stronger activation state of cortical neurons in the sensory-motor area of the brain. erefore, the motor imagination intensity of HFMI is greater than that of LFMI.",
