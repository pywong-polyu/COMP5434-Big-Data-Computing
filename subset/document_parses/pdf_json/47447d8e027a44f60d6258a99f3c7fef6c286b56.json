In this prospective study of a cohort of 46 SARS-CoV-2 patients infected with the Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 we longitudinally analyzed changes in humoral and cellular immunity upon early and late convalescence. Antibody neutralization capacity was measured by surrogate virus neutralization test and cellular responses were investigated with 31-colour spectral flow cytometry. Spike-specific, isotype-switched B cells developed already during the disease phase, showed a memory phenotype and did not decrease in numbers even during late convalescence. Otherwise, no long-lasting perturbations of the immune compartment following COVID-19 clearance were observed. During convalescence anti-Spike (S1) IgG antibodies strongly decreased in all patients. We detected neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan strain as well as the Alpha and Delta but not against the Beta, Gamma or Omicron variants for up to 7 months post COVID-19. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a strong association",

However, lack of neutralizing antibodies against the Beta, Gamma and Omicron variants even during the peak response is of major concern as this indicates viral evasion of the humoral immune response.",

Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists 10 VBM (5) . Hence, possible viral escape through mutation has become a subject of increasing interest. This concern grew with recent evidence of antigen divergence of the B.1.351 (Beta) and the P.1 (Gamma, formerly named B.1.28.1) VoC (2, 6) . Moreover, the newly discovered B.1.1.529 VoC termed Omicron (7) , contains so far the highest number of mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD), providing fuel to the fear of viral escape of acquired immunity (8, 9) . It is likely that the current range of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is underestimated and further VoCs are already on the rise. In this context, assessing the level of protection conferred by convalescence to (re)infection by VoCs is of great importance.",

We developed a 31 color staining panel to identify all major leukocyte subsets (Supplementary Table 2 ). The gating principle is shown in Supplementary Figure 1 . Of all major leukocyte subset tested, we found B cells, and to a greater extent, natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes, to be elevated during convalescent phases. In contrast, T cells and the heterogeneous pool of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), basophils and other cells (not fulfilling the criteria of any of the listed populations, altogether shown as \"Rest\") only displayed a mild transient increase in early convalescence ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 2A) . A more detailed analysis of T cells revealed that CD8 + and CD4 + CD8 + were the major T cell subsets increasing in early convalescence ( Figure 1B ). NK cells can be subdivided based on their CD56 and CD16 expression in \"early\" (CD56 bright CD16 -), \"mature\" (CD56 dim CD16 + ) and \"terminal\" (CD56 -CD16 + ) (14, 15) NK cells. Interestingly, we found all three subsets to be significantly elevated in the blood of both early and late convalescing patients compared to disease patients ( Figure 1C ), likely due to general lymphopenia of severe COVID-19 patients (16) . However, only terminal NK cells were also increased in frequencies (Supplementary Figure 2C ). Of note, we observed no differences in numbers or frequencies of monocyte subsets during convalescence ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 2D ). Next, we assessed the memory phenotype of T and B cells. Several major T cell memory subsets, identified by differential CCR7 and CD45RA expression (17) , have been shown to play a role in clearing infections. Interestingly, in our cohort, we failed to observe differences in cell numbers or in frequencies of the 3 major CD4 + subsetsna\u00efve, TEMRA, effector/memorybetween disease and convalescent phases ( Figure 1E ). On the other hand, compared to active disease, early convalescing patients had noticeably expansions of all antigen experienced -TEMRA, effector/memory, central memory -CD8 + T cell populations ( Figure 1F) . A comparable trend was followed in cell frequencies, however without reaching statistical significance (Supplementary Figure 2G) . Importantly, CD38 + HLA-DR + CD8 + T cells have been demonstrated to contain the pool of cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigens (18, 19) . We found that pool of cells to be drastically reduced at late convalescence ( Figure 1G and Supplementary Figure 2G) indicating contraction of the T cell response following infection clearance.",

We therefore analyzed the Spike + B cell compartment in the present cohort ( Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 3) . As reported before, Spike-specific isotype-switched B cells already form during the disease phase (20) , however they did not decline in frequencies nor numbers during early and late convalescence ( Figure 2B) . Also in the paired analysis of samples collected during the early, as well as late convalescent phase we also observed a moderate increase in absolute cell counts of Spikespecific B cells ( Figure 2C ) further indicating persistence of immunological memory. Spike + isotype switched B cells actually showed a phenotype closely resembling that of endogenous memory B cells and only differ in increased CD127 expression ( Figure 2D ).

In line with earlier reports (4, 21), we observed a significant reduction of anti-Spike and anti-NCP antibody levels during early and late convalescence ( Figures 3C, D) . To confirm the apparent reduction in humoral response during late convalescence, we performed an intra-patient paired analysis of antibody levels in patient samples collected during active disease with samples taken between 3 and 7 months post COVID-19 ( Figures 3E, F) . Data from this analysis were in line with results from our bulk analysis and revealed a steep decline of humoral responses in late convalescence samples. Taken together, these data confirm previous reports and point towards a substantial decline of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 with time (4, 6, 20, 22, 23) .",

We then compared the neutralization capacity of patient's sera against the different VoCs, in regard to disease and convalescence stages. This analysis revealed that sera showed the highest efficacy against the original Wuhan strain during the disease and both convalescence phases ( Figure 4B) . Overall, the convalescent sera exhibited very low to no neutralization capacity against the Beta, Gamma and Omicron VoCs at any time point tested, while the same sera possessed considerable neutralization efficacy against the Alpha and Delta variants. Interestingly, neutralization of Alpha was diminished compared to the Delta strain ( Figure 4B) . Moreover, while the neutralization efficacy against both the original Wuhan strain and the Delta VoC was highest in the disease phase and decreased over time, sera collected from individuals during the early or late convalescent phase had showed a tendency of increased neutralizing capacities against the Alpha VoC compared to sera taken during the disease phase ( Figure 4B ). These observations were further validated in the paired analysis ( Figure 4C ). These data indicate that antibodies produced during active disease are already able to neutralize the Wuhan strain and the Delta variant, while neutralization of the Alpha variant requires antibody affinity maturation.",

This analysis revealed strong correlation of anti-S1 levels with sVNT titers against Wuhan, Alpha and Delta across all time points analyzed. In addition, correlation in the case of Wuhan and Delta did not prominently differ between the disease and convalescent phases ( Figure 5 ). However in case of Alpha we observed a significant increase in correlation from disease to early and late convalescence ( Figure 5 ), further indicating that affinity maturation is required for efficient neutralization of Alpha.",

We provide evidence that all these patients developed Spike-specific memory B cells that, on average, did not drop in frequency during the 7 months observation period. However at the same time, a considerable drop of neutralizing antibody titers against the Wuhan strain and the Alpha and Delta VoC was observed, while hardly any of the patients developed sizable neutralizing titers again the Beta and Gamma and none against the Omicron variants during disease or convalescence. The latter finding is of particular interest as it indicates that convalescent patients might be hardly protected from reinfections with the, Omicron variant this currently dominating in many countries. This finding is also reflected by observations made in vaccinees that also developed considerable lower neutralizing titers against Beta, Gamma and particular Omicron compared to Alpha, Delta or the Wuhan stain (12, 24, 25) . Our results are also in line with data reported in publications indicating that COVID-19 convalescent individuals possess little if any serum antibodies able for neutralizing the Omicron variant (24, 26) It seems likely that the B cell-mediated protection of infection is severely affected due to the high mutational load in the RBD domain of Omicron (9).",

However, we found numbers and frequencies of bulk antigen-experienced CD8 + T cell subsets to be transiently increased during convalescence. These findings are indicative of a normal contraction of the CD8 + T cell pool after the infection had been cleared. However, drawing definite conclusions about lymphocyte kinetics in this study is challenging as our study lacks healthy controls due to the difficulty in recruiting non-vaccinated age-and sex-matched individuals. Still, recent data suggests that the majority of patients do undergo restoration of homeostatic immunity during convalescence (30) and the values of major lymphocyte populations reported in this study also fall into the normal range for previously published healthy control cohorts (16, 31) . In the present study we used cryopreserved PBMCs and therefore decided not to assess frequencies of virus-specific T cells. Restimulation of frozen PBMCs frequently results in IFN-gamma production by T cells even in the absence of specific peptides, making it difficult to determine rare events in already lymphopenic patients (32) . This is presumably due to molecules released from damaged cells. Re-stimulation of previously frozen PBMCs with virus-specific peptides thus only allows rather limited conclusions about frequencies of T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2. Along these lines, CD8 + effector/ memory type 1 cells (CD38 + HLA-DR + ) have been shown to contain Spike-responsive T cells (18, 19) and our results also demonstrate a strong decrease of this cell pool following late convalescence, implying the contraction of Spike-specific T cells from circulation. Similar kinetics for Spike-reactive T cells have been described in recent reports (33) (34) (35) .",

In contrast to serum antibody levels which decrease with time, we found even in late convalescence persisting frequencies or even increasing numbers of Spike-specific B cells. Our data indicate that these cells bear the phenotype of memory B cells and thus corroborate the results of a recent study (23) . While the long-term presence of these cells is likely good news, it remains to be determined to what extent Spike-specific B cells ameliorate COVID-19. Since only antibodies on mucosal surfaces can prevent infection, it seems unlikely that memory B cells play a role at the very early step of the infection process.",

Interestingly, the kinetics of neutralization efficacy against the Wuhan strain closely resembled those against the Delta strain, but were different for the Alpha strain. While during late convalescence, 95%, 87% and 92% of our patients possessed antibodies capable of neutralizing the Wuhan strain, the Alpha and Delta VoC respectively, the kinetics of the response differed between the 3 strains. During the disease phase 8/24 (33.3%) patients did not develop antibodies, able to neutralize the Alpha variant which was only the case in 1/24 (4%) patients for the Wuhan and Delta variants.",

While the presence of neutralizing antibodies against Wuhan, Alpha and Delta variants is encouraging, a complete lack of neutralization against the Omicron variant observed even during peak response indicates viral escape and subsequent reduced immune protection against this variant as well as Beta and Gamma. Our findings corroborate reports from others of reduced efficacy of current vaccines and convalescent sera against the aforementioned variants (6, 25, (37) (38) (39) . Furthermore, bona fide memory Spike-specific B cells seem to remain in circulation for long periods of time post COVID-19, implying a certain layer of defense against severe disease, even in patients with low antibody titers. Vaccination provides good protection against severe forms of COVID-19 and more studies are urgently needed to evaluate the change and duration of immune responses in convalescing people who got vaccinated.",
