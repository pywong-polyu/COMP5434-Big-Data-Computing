This investigation highlights the ability of both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients to transmit the virus equally.

(which was not certified by peer review) Post onset of disease, samples were collected within 1-3 days, 5-7 days and 8-10 days. In most of the asymptomatic (except one) and symptomatic patients (except two), the Ct values were increased in OP samples over time. However, there was no significant difference in Ct values of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (Fig.1A ). This suggests that the viral load in OP sample does not correlate with disease severity. In contrast, the viral load estimation from plasma samples demonstrated that symptomatic patients had high viral load (low Ct value and high viral copy number) as compared to asymptomatic patients (Fig.1B) . The data for viral copy number is not shown. Three symptomatic patients (patient no. 9, 10 and 11) who died of SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher amount of plasma viremia, compared to those who were discharged from the hospital. All the symptomatic patients (except one) were on ventilator support. The analysis of serum samples demonstrated that the Ct values of serum samples of asymptomatic patients were more [less viral copy number (data not shown)] than the symptomatic patients and this finding correlated well with the Ct values of plasma samples for both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (Fig.1C) . Hence, the result indicates that development of clinical complications is mostly associated to high viral load in plasma and serum samples.",

Four out of six asymptomatic patients (patient no 2, 4, 5 and 6) along with all symptomatic patients were found to be ELISA positive (with low Ct values in plasma) (Fig.2) . Samples of three healthy individuals were collected as control and were negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies (data not shown). Thus, the data underline that patients with high viral titer developed sufficient amount of antibodies To comprehend infectivity, live virus was isolated from 6 clinical samples. The virus was readily isolated from OP samples from patient 7 (viral load >10 7 copies/mL) which has highest viral load among all the samples. This indicates the presence of significantly high copy number of virus in this patient. Next, the differential dynamics of circulating cytokines and chemokines in the SARS-CoV-2 infected asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were investigated. Interestingly, the levels of soluble CD40L, GRO and MDC were higher in asymptomatic patients as compared to the symptomatic. On the other hand, the symptomatic patients showed higher levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, IP-10, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-\u03b12 and IL-15 in comparison with the asymptomatic patients (Fig.3) . Whereas, there were no significant difference in the plasma levels of MCP-3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-17A, IL-12 p70, eotaxin and TNF. Therefore, this data suggest that cytokines and chemokines may serve as \"predictive indicator\" of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contribute to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",

IgE has already been reported to be high in COVID-19 patients particularly those with Type II Diabetes. Out of 6 symptomatic patients in this study, 4 were suffering from type II Diabetes and had enhanced IgE levels (22, 27) . Overall increase in IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 responses in symptomatic patients explains the increase in inflammatory immune responses (22) . Since IgE was high in these patients there was no significant difference in IgG4 level as they compete for fixation sites in basophils and mast cells (28) . There was no difference in IgM and IgA levels of the two groups suggesting that patients were at early stage of infection, as peak of virus specific IgM is developed approximately 14-28 days after the onset of symptoms (29) .",

Surprisingly, most of the changes were observed in Orf1ab region. In India, these three clades were predominant in the months from May to July , 2020 (30) . It was observed in this study that the three symptomatic patients with high viral load and among them two patients who had severe disease symptoms and died, were infected with the virus possessing the D614G mutation in the spike protein. This strengthens the previous hypothesis that the infectivity rate and enhanced transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the D614G mutation (9, 31) .",
