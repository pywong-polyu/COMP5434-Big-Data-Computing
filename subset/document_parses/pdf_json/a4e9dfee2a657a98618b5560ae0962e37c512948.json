Flights have been canceled, concerts have been called off, and dorms have been closed, just to name a few. Do these all count as breaches of contract-or are the parties excused due to the extraordinary circumstances? And how should the losses be allocated between the parties? The law provides one set of answers to these questions; ethics offers another. With a focus on American law (developed over the past two centuries) and Jewish ethics (developed over millennia), this paper shows that the two systems are in accord with some respects and differ in others: Both law and Jewish ethics would excuse a party who cannot complete his contract due to a force beyond his control, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet Jewish ethics would require that the excused party still be paid, while American law would not.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 global pandemic broke out at the end of 2019 and by the end of 2020 there were roughly 100 million confirmed cases-and nearly two million deaths-across the world. At first, most of the morbidity was seen in China, but from the middle of February 2020, the virus started to spread rapidly and by the middle of March had reached 150 countries and caused a worldwide panic. At the beginning of March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. The responses of governing bodies and health systems around the world have included various restrictions, from imposing curfews to canceling flights, to closing down complete sectors of the economy, to issuing 'stay-at-home' orders that require everyone in a city, state or even entire country to self-isolate (quarantine) in their homes. 2 Self-isolation at home has been recommended for both those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect that they may have been infected. The virus has reached the stage of 'community spread' in nearly every corner of the world, which means that it is proliferating within communities whose members have not traveled to areas with widespread transmission. Government health agencies recommend that individuals self-isolate if they develop a continuous cough or a high fever. The self-isolation period should last for at least 14 days but preferably longer. 3 Many government health agencies have ordered individuals who have traveled to a country with widespread transmission or who have been in direct contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 to self-quarantine or practice social distancing for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure. 4 The UK National Health Service, and others, has recommended that people stay two meters (6.6 feet) away from one another, especially the elderly and chronically ill. 5 Everyone should wash their hands regularly so that they do not spread the disease to others or onto surfaces and objects that others will touch.",

Even though performance is still 'physically' possible, it is considered legally impossible, and the party will be excused. 11 Of course, the extraordinary event must not have been caused by the party itself; if performance becomes impossible due to the fault of the very party claiming relief, the doctrine will not apply. 12 On the other hand, if the other party caused the impossibility, then the doctrine remains in force.

            "text": "More recently, the Impossibility doctrine has been expanded and liberalized such that it now also applies if performance is 'physically' possible, but the extraordinary event has made it so much more difficult and dangerous than expected as to be 'impracticable'-meaning effectively impossible. 14 True to its roots, the law imposes a very high standard for a claim of impracticability: A \"mere change in the degree of difficulty or expense due to such causes as increased wages, prices of raw materials, or costs of construction, unless well beyond the normal range, does not amount to impracticability since it is this sort of risk that a fixed-price contract is intended to cover.\" 15 \"Furthermore, a party is expected to use reasonable efforts to surmount obstacles to performance, and a performance is impracticable only if it is so in spite of such efforts.\" 16 Requiring a very high standard for a claim of impracticability makes good sense, for the doctrine undermines, to some extent, the very nature of a contract as a legally enforceable promise. If courts regularly excused parties from their contracts when performance turned out to be tougher than expected, then parties would lose faith that contracts really are legally enforceable. 17 An additional element of the Impossibility doctrine is the issue of foreseeability. Legal decisions often suggest that the doctrine only applies when an 'unforeseeable' event renders performance impossible (or impracticable). As one court has written, in typical fashion, \"Because the purpose of a contract is to place the reasonable risk of performance upon the promisor,... it is presumed to have agreed to bear any loss occasioned by an event that was foreseeable at the time of contracting.\" 18 Despite its intuitive appeal, however, this line of thinking is not ultimately persuasive. First, the most common types of events that have been accepted by the courts as grounds for a claim of Impossibility defense are natural disasters ('Acts of God'), such as fires, floods, and earthquakes. But these sorts of things have happened countless times in the past and will surely happen again in the future; thus they are foreseeable, and still qualify. Second, and more fundamentally, \"anything and everything is foreseeable, at least to those with good imaginations.\" 19 If the water in a river were to suddenly turn into blood, making a water-supply contract impossible to perform, that might be foreseeable, especially as that precise scenario is described in the Book of Exodus. But there is no doubt that the water supplier should properly be excused from his contract on the basis of Impossibility.",

Importantly, whether the pandemic was 'foreseeable' does not really matter to the Impossibility analysis. Pandemics have happened before, such as the Spanish Flu of 1918, and scientists and others have repeatedly warned that a pandemic should be expected to eventuate one of these days. 24 But the same can be said of hurricanes, avalanches, or any other natural disaster, and yet the Impossibility doctrine is regularly applied in such circumstances.

Rashi (1040-1105, France) explained: \"Since he has to go, he should not be fined totally and half of his salary should be forthcoming.\" In other words, since he left his job out of necessity, he should not be treated as someone who deliberately violated a contract, who would then not be compensated for the losses he caused to his employer.

Under the Impossibility doctrine, a contracting party who is himself at fault for the extraordinary event will not be excused from his contract. Maimonides seems to agree. Following Maimonides, this line of analysis was adopted by many halakhic arbiters. Rabbi Moses Isserles (also known as \"the Rema\"), the head of a yeshiva in Krakow, Poland, and a theologian, is considered one of the most important among sixteenth-century Ashkenazi rabbis. He wrote many essays concerning halakhah as well as several philosophical treatises. Most notably, he became famous for his glosses to the Shulkhan Arukh, which was written by Rabbi Yosef Karo (1488 Karo ( -1575 in Safed in 1563 and first printed in Venice in 1565. Considered one of the most important books in the Jewish world of law, it is de facto a pillar that shaped the Jewish way of life.",

In his view, a national calamity did not occur, and a contracting party should not be excused, if the problem \"can be fixed by hard work and strategies.\" This is just the same as under the Impossibility doctrine, where performance is deemed impracticable only if the party seeking excuse used reasonable efforts to surmount the obstacle and still found the task effectively impossible.",

Recall that the doctrine will only excuse a party when the extraordinary event was not caused by the party itself, and the party was not at fault in letting it happen. In addition, \"a party is expected to use reasonable efforts to surmount obstacles to performance, and a performance is impracticable only if it is so in spite of such efforts.\" 32 Rabbi Katzenellenbogen's analysis is similar. He would only excuse a party on the grounds of national calamity if the harm affected every single inhabitant of a place. This is an even stricter standard than the one offered by Maimonides but likewise can be understood to suggest that a calamity is truly unavoidable only if everybody in the locality suffers equally. If not, then those who do suffer are probably at least partially at fault for their own misfortune. This concept is illustrated by the story of the 'Three Little Pigs.' In that fairy tale, one pig builds his house out of straw, the second out of wood, and the third out of brick. The 'Big Bad Wolf' huffs and puffs and blows down the first two houses but is unable to destroy the third. Under Rabbi Katzenellenbogen's rule, the Big Bad Wolf would not qualify as a national calamity because the harm was not imposed unanimously on all three pigs. Under the Impossibility doctrine, the Big Bad Wolf would likewise not qualify as an extraordinary event because the third pig showed that maintaining one's residence was within the power of the builder, and the first two pigs were partially responsible for the collapse of their houses.",

The lawful obligation to obey to the authorities is also considered a religious duty in Judaism. 33 The underlying rationale is found in the Talmud: Dina de-malkhuta dina (the law of the land is the law) is a principle in Jewish religious law, which holds that the civil law of the country is binding upon the Jewish inhabitants of that country and, in certain cases, overrides Jewish law. That concept, which is similar to a conflict of laws in other legal systems, means that for Jews, obedience to the civil law of the country in which they live is viewed as a religiously mandated obligation and that, according to Jewish law, disobedience is a transgression. 34 Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic qualifies as a force majeure and a national calamity. Even though the Talmudic sources discuss national calamity in the context of leasing properties and not of hiring workers, the Maharam of Rothenburg, one of the most important of the medieval rabbis, does address the concept of national calamity in the context of hiring workers (the Maharam was quoted by his student, Rabbi Mordechai ben Hillel HaKohen (1250-1298) in his commentary on the Talmud (Baba Batra, Sect. 343)).",

The institutionalization of education as an essential part of Judaism was mandated in halacha by 32 Id. 33 For further details on this matter, see Rashi, 2020. 34 For further discussion, see Galas, 1979; Lorberbaum, 2000. the Maimonides (Laws of Talmud Torah, Chap. 2, Halacha 1): Teachers for children should be appointed in every country, region, and town. And if any town does not have children in school, the townspeople should be boycotted until teachers are appointed, since the whole world is maintained by the words of children in class. In other words, according to Maimonides, this is not a choice given to the society, but every community is obligated to institutionalize its educational system, and each community must ask itself what the community expects from the teachers who work within it. Jewish educational ethics are rooted in the principle, cited in the Ethics of the Fathers, that calls for and commands Jewish communities to deal with education: 'Raise many students' (Mishna, Ethics of the Fathers, Chap. 1, Mishna 1), in order to maintain the traditions and heritage of Israel. Therefore, one can see quite a few discussions between different rabbis throughout history around the employment of teachers and the termination of work in different circumstances. 35 Maharam of Rothenburg was dealing with the case of a teacher who was unable to work owing to a national calamity, and ruled that if the cancelation of the teacher's work was due to the decree of the town's governor, which made it impossible for him to teach, then it was a national calamity and thus the employer's loss. That is to say, he differentiated between something that happened only to the single teacher and a national calamity, declaring that in the latter case, the employer must honor his contract, and continue to pay the teacher's wages. The Rema also ruled in this spirit: \"A teacher whom the governor has decreed shall not teach is a case of national calamity, and the entire loss is on the employer\" (Choshen Mishpat, Sect. 321, subsection 1).",

He further emphasized that had if it been an event designated as a national calamity, such as all the students of the town fleeing, then, like the Maharam of Rothenburg, he would have ruled in favor of the teacher: It does not seem right to call our case a national calamity.

However, specifically the student was forced to flee Venice because he was faint hearted, and the principle of \"Impossibility\" applies even in this case. In the light of the foregoing, the directives of the government authorities to close nonvital businesses and educational institutions constitute a national calamity. In various emergency situations such as war or an epidemic that paralyzes the entire economy -both employers and employees -various halakhic arbiters hesitated to exempt the employer from paying the worker's wages and recommended a compromise between the parties. In his book Chatam Sofer, Rabbi Moshe Sofer wrote a particularly interesting account concerning the stopping of studies in 1809 because of Napoleon's war against Austria: I in all modesty said that I do not know how to decide according to Torah law, and I pay my employees their salaries in full without deducting a cent. 36 And you will apply the law through compromise, to pay half the salary and the teacher will lose half of his wages. And my reasoning and rationale is that it is clear that this is the same as a national calamity\u2026. And logically it appears that the fate of both is at stake. Therefore, I made a compromise that suited both of them, that 36 The Chatam Sofer acted this way out of moral and ethical considerations and not according to the letter of the law, as it was recounted (Tractate Bava Metzia 83A) about Rabbah Bar Chanan, who paid full wages to the workers who broke his barrels through negligence, based on the verse \"Thus you will walk in the ways of the good\" (Proverbs 2:20). 35 For further details on this matter, see Rashi, 2019. both would bear a loss, but I did not know the law of the Torah [and we must wait] until someone will come whose mind is clearer and will pronounce the true law. 37 Unlike other rabbis, Rabbi Sofer analyzed the chaotic reality of the war as a reality that makes it difficult for both employers and employees. He therefore believed that in order that people will continue working after the end of the chaotic period, reality obliges them to compromise. Perhaps because he experienced the war and its aftermath he led to a much more compromising and practical line than other rabbis who did not experience reality but were asked about it from a geographical and chronological distance.",

            "text": "It appears that a compromise that is close to the law that nursery school teachers and nannies should be paid close to fifty percent of their salaries. And this is for as long as they are prevented from working owing to directives of the Ministry of Health. However, when the authorities allow nursery schools, etc., to operate and the parents elect to keep their children at home to prevent the risk of sickness, then it will be a question of whether they have to pay the nursery school teachers and nannies their full salaries. It appears in my humble opinion that since this disease is truly still prevalent among us and has not disappeared from the world and is extremely infectious, even though the authorities have decided to allow reopening of the nursery schools in order to let the parents go to work, and to let the nursery school teachers earn a living, it is still in the category of \"national calamity.\" And because of that, parents who decide to send their children to the nursery school will pay the full fee, while those who hesitate and do not send their children still have the law of national calamity as discussed above. In the interim period when the authorities allow the nursery school teachers to accept only groups of three children, everything depends on the number of children in the nursery school, and the parents who send their children only part of the time will have to pay proportionately for the time their children are in the nursery school. The parents who decide that it is not worthwhile for them to send their children to nursery school for a half, third, or quarter of the time have a perfect right to make that decision and one cannot impose on them any extra payment beyond the above payment to which the nursery school teacher is entitled for when the school is closed down completely.",

As we saw, Jewish ethics generally concurs with the legal doctrine of Impossibility, but rejects the rule of Restitution. In light of the complexity of the issue and the plethora of approaches, the principal course supported by Jewish ethics is the one proposed by the Chatam Sofer, that is, to bring the parties to a compromise.",

In practice, however, most parties would resolve a dispute through a negotiated settlement that is acceptable to both sides. The terms of the settlement would depend on the strength of their legal positions, however, and so may end up much more favorable to one side. Under Jewish ethics, by contrast, any settlement must be fair and just-not simply acceptable to the parties. The compromise must accord with the proper behavior of professionals and absolute values. A compromise that is acceptable to the various parties, yet inconsistent with the values of justice, would not be a proper compromise according to Jewish ethics.",
