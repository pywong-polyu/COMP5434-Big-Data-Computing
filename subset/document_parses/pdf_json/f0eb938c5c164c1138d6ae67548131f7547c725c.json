Hesitant attitudes to vaccination are prevalent and may be increasing since the influenza pandemic of 2009 [1] . The term \"vaccine hesitancy\" is used to describe patients who contemplate delaying vaccines or are reluctant to receive vaccines, implying that the hesitant can be swayed toward or away from acceptance [2] , this hesitancy can vary across vaccines. Public acceptance of a vaccine is required to maintain herd immunity and prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses [3] . The issue is of the utmost importance, to the extent that the World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019 [4] . A significant barrier to vaccination is misinformation regarding the benefits, composition, and adverse effects of vaccination. Different populations experience vaccine hesitancy to a varied extent and this may influence hesitancy among healthcare workers from these populations. Identifying at risk populations can help guide public health campaigns that specifically targets these groups.",

            "text": "The factors that contribute to hesitancy can vary between communities including demographic, socioeconomic, and societal factors. There are racial differences in trust and confidence when an individual is in the vaccine decision-making process [5] . Arab Americans (AA) are a rapidly growing ethnic minority in the United States (US) with a growth rate of 72% from 2000-2010 [6] . Arab Americans are individuals with roots or origins from the 22 countries that constitute the \"Arab world\" who now live in the United States [7] . Attitudes to vaccines vary across geographical boundaries and little is known about the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among AA living in the US. One recent analysis by Sallam reports that some of the lowest rates of vaccine acceptance are in the Middle East [8] , and interestingly, vaccine acceptance is higher among Arabs living outside of their home country [9, 10] . A recent study surveyed multiple populations from different Arab countries and noted that only 29.4% of respondents to a survey stated that they would be vaccinated [11] , compared to approximately 68% of respondents in the US [12] . Another study showed that the rate of acceptance to the COVID-19 vaccine varies across Middle Eastern countries, from 35% in people from Iraq to 17% in individuals from Jordan [13] . While a number of societal factors may play a role in vaccine hesitancy in Arab counties, distrust for government and healthcare policies are commonly reported reasons [13, 14] .",

According to one survey, 36.4% of Arabs reported that their major source of information regarding the COVID-19 vaccines was obtained from medical doctors, scientists, and scientific journals [11] . Another study noted that 53.1% of respondents sourced information about the COVID-19 vaccines from medical websites, while 32.7% accessed information about the vaccine from social media [13] . Amongst healthcare providers from the Arab world, one survey noted the vaccine acceptance rate was as low as 26.7%, and acceptance varied between countries [10] . Recent literature also suggests that Arab-speaking physicians have higher receptivity of COVID-19 vaccines when compared to nursing and allied health professionals [15] . According to Arab-speaking healthcare providers, the most frequently chosen barrier to vaccine acceptance was fear of side effects [10] . As AA turn to their providers for recommendations, determining the extent of vaccine hesitancy among this subgroup of AA living in the US is crucial. This information could guide or influence public health outreach efforts to increase acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among AA as a whole.",

NAAMA, which has 27 chapters across North America, also has a separate distinct mission of enhancing the careers of undergraduate and graduate students who are members of the association and aspir-ing to practice in the healthcare field [17] . These undergraduate and graduate students comprise NAAMA NextGen. The second is the Arab-American Center for Economic and Social Services (ACCESS), which is the largest and most comprehensive Arab communitybased health and mental health center in North America. Established in 1971, ACCESS is considered a \"one stop service center\" for medical, public health, mental health, and environmental programs for this particular community [18] . ACCESS is located in southeast Michigan and caters to residents of Arab descent in the area. In addition, ACCESS employs hundreds of AAs, including healthcare providers. These organizations provide a unique opportunity to determine the prevalence and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among AA healthcare professionals based in the United States. We therefore aimed to study AA healthcare workers' attitudes surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine and to determine the factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and confidence.",

Vaccine hesitancy was defined using the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy definition: \"a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services\" [19] . Hesitancy was defined as binary (Yes vs. No, with No used as reference) using the question \"I plan to receive a COVID-19 vaccine\". We considered that a participant may hesitate to receive a COVID-19 vaccine if one answered, \"will probably get the vaccine\", \"will probably NOT get the vaccine\", \"will definitely NOT get the vaccine\", and \"don't know/not sure\". Vaccine confidence was defined as those who answered, \"will definitely get the vaccine\" or \"have already received the vaccine\". Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to see the associations between vaccine hesitancy (Yes vs. No, with No used as reference) and participant characteristics and attitudes toward the vaccine. We allowed the events per variable at least to be 5 [20] and further used Firth's logistic regression to improve the accuracy of regression coefficients [21] . Initially, vaccine hesitancy was considered as an ordinal variable and univariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were used. However, six covariates (age, marital status, country origin, education, health care professional, and knowing a COVID-19 person) violated the proportional odds assumption. To resolve this violation, we dichotomized vaccine hesitancy and used binary logistic regression analysis.",

Vaccine hesitancy is an urgent public health problem that is unfortunately more prevalent in minority groups [22] [23] [24] . An enormous hurdle to overcome among AA is the misinformation surrounding vaccines, especially when combined with several conspiracy theories that circulate on social media [11] . Thus, trust-building and regular assessments of vaccine hesitancy will be crucial to achieving COVID-19 vaccine compliance.",

Our findings agree with other studies in which individuals who previously received an influenza vaccine were more likely to also receive the COVID-19 vaccine [13] . Among healthcare workers, prior influenza vaccine behaviors were an independent predictor for COVID-19 vaccine intentions [25] . This suggests that prior vaccine behaviors, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, influence future vaccine behaviors as well. This may imply that those who deferred prior vaccinations may in fact hold strong vaccine beliefs (\"anti-vaccination\"), and thus may be unlikely to change despite education on the consequences of not vaccinating [26] . Of note, amongst our cohort of healthcare providers, just 3% of respondents reported prior vaccine behavior of delaying their children's immunizations, which is low compared to the general population [27] . As the world moves toward childhood immunizations for COVID-19, the relationship between vaccine hesitancy for oneself vs. for one's child is a topic that should be explored in future studies, particularly among minority groups who may be at higher risk [28] .",

Our study found that on univariate analysis, being born in North America or Europe, rather than the Middle East or North Africa, was significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. Comparatively, respondents who had immigrated to the US over 20 years ago were significantly less likely to be vaccine hesitant. While not significant on multivariable analysis, prior studies have noted that Arabs living outside of their home country [9] or in North America [10] were more likely to be vaccine acceptant than those living in Arab countries. As noted by the WHO SAGE Working Group, vaccine hesitancy rates and reasons vary by global region, and do not remain static within a country over time [34] .

With limited health data on this growing demographic, we were able to receive more than 500 responses to the surveys sent. The information gathered on the attitudes and perceptions of AA healthcare workers towards the COVID-19 vaccine may be used to plan public health campaigns and programs that specifically targets this ethnic group, with the aim of increasing vaccine acceptability within this demographic.

The use of e-mail for participant recruitment may have further limited the study, yielding a response bias, given it selected out individuals who do not check their e-mail regularly, those with undeliverable mail, and those who may have filtered out e-mail from certain senders. In addition, this study only focused on AA healthcare professionals with a large representation of physicians. Thus, we recognize that while some of the findings may be applicable to the AA population in general, it is also possible that our findings may not be reflective of the entire AA ethnic group or the American population in general, given that our study only examined healthcare professionals. In addition, we acknowledge that there are other confounding variables that our study did not include, such as health conditions among the participants that would make them more hesitant to receive the vaccine. Religion and cultural factors, which have been factors implicated in vaccine hesitancy in the past [32] , were also not evaluated in our study. Finally, our study only captured vaccine attitudes at one point in time, whereas it is understood that vaccine hesitancy is fluid and complicated in nature, does not always translate into behaviors [39] , and can readily change with time or exposure to new information.",

As people turn to their healthcare providers for trusted information, addressing vaccine hesitancy among clinicians, and particularly among allied health professionals, is of the utmost importance. Our study shows that prior vaccine attitudes, income, and healthcare role have an impact on willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, vaccine advocacy campaigns should be carefully crafted to address these factors. Additionally, vaccine hesitancy among health care providers could have substantial impact on vaccine attitudes of the general population. Campaigns should be geared at vaccine education, particularly among those with lower median income and education levels as well as addressing negative emotions including fear, anxiety, and mistrust. These data should inform policy by government ministries to implement vaccine promotion campaigns in different healthcare provider groups.",
