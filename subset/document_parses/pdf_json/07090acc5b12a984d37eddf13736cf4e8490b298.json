Due to its serious effects on human health, it can also damage mental health by increasing levels of anxiety, stress, and worry among health professionals, and the general public (Qiu et al., 2020) . Although older adults are considered one of the most vulnerable groups to COVID-19 (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) , some global surveys found that older adults reported less depression and anxiety (Bruine de Bruin, 2020; Losada-Baltar et al., 2020) . However, few studies so far have examined whether the daily wellbeing of older adults was indeed better than their younger counterparts. To this end, I examined the daily perceived stress of Chinese people across different age groups in adulthood during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, I examined age differences in the relationship between daily perceived stress and daily wellbeing.",

            "text": "In the literature on aging and emotion, older adults generally report a higher level of positive affect (e.g., happiness, enthusiastic, and calm) and a lower level of negative affect (e.g., anxiety, sadness, and stress) than younger adults in global surveys and daily diary studies (Gross et al., 1997; Carstensen et al., 2000) . These results have been explained by socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) (Carstensen et al., 2003) . SST postulates that older adults prioritize emotionally meaningful goals (e.g., experience positive emotions) over knowledge goals (e.g., learn new knowledge) more than younger adults, because they view future time as more limited. Prioritizing emotionally meaningful goals, older adults are more motivated to regulate their emotions toward a positive end (Fung and Carstensen, 2006) . Therefore, they report better wellbeing in general even after experiencing negative affect. In a laboratory experiment, Scott et al. (2017) found no age difference in regulating momentary negative stressors (0-10 min), but older adults better regulated stressors after being exposed to stressors for 10 min to 2.5 h. The COVID-19 outbreak is a situation that induces tremendous psychological distress (Qiu et al., 2020) . Although older adults reported better mental health in one-off surveys (Bruine de Bruin, 2020; Yang et al., 2020) , it is unknown whether older adults can still regulate their emotions better than younger adults in real-time daily life. Therefore, I examined age differences in daily perceived stress and its relationship with daily wellbeing using a 14-day daily diary study in a lifespan sample.",

In particular, I focused on daily stress, and daily experiences of the positive affect (POS), high arousal positive affect (HAP), low arousal positive affect (LAP), negative affect (NEG), high arousal negative affect (HAN), and low arousal negative affect (LAN). Based on SST (Carstensen et al., 2003) , I predicted that older adults would experience a lower level of perceived stress related to COVID-19 (H1). In addition, I predicted that the relationship between daily perceived stress and daily wellbeing (indexed by higher levels of POS, HAP, and LAP, and lower levels of NEG, HAN, and LAN) would be weaker in older than younger adults.",

We found that older adults reported a lower level of perceived stress related to COVID-19 than younger adults. In addition, we found that the negative association between daily perceived stress and daily high arousal positive affect was weaker in older than younger adults; and that the positive relationship between daily perceived health and daily high arousal negative affect was also weaker in older than younger adults. Consistent with the previous findings on age differences in perceived stress after stress induction (Scott et al., 2017) , we found that older adults reported a lower level of daily perceived stress than younger adults during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings could be explained by SST that found that older adults are more motivated to regulate emotion than younger adults (Carstensen et al., 2003) . In addition, these results are consistent with a recent one-off surveys on age differences in loneliness during home quarantine in Spain (Losada-Baltar et al., 2020) and China (Qiu et al., 2020) . These findings, taken together, may suggest that older adults indeed perceived less stress during the outbreak of COVID-19.",

            "text": "We only found significant age differences in the relationship between daily stress and high arousal affect, regardless of valence. Such findings may be attributable to the fact that stress is a high arousal affective state. Therefore, the feeling of stress might be more relevant to high arousal positive and negative affect than the low arousal ones. It may also be possible that individuals regardless of age prefer low arousal affect states over high arousal affect states, when they see future time as increasingly limited (Jiang et al., 2016) . The situation of COVID-19 induces a more limited future time perspective, because it damages both mental and physical health (Yang et al., 2020) . Low arousal affective states are more relevant to the situation of COVID-19 for both younger and older adults. Therefore, the age differences were only observed in high arousal affective states. Future studies should clarify the mechanism of the age differences in the relationship between daily stress and different types of daily affective states. Although older adults are considered as one of the most vulnerable groups during COVID-19, the findings of this study, together with the previous findings, may suggest that older adults indeed have a better ability to cope with the psychological distress caused by COVID-19. However, more support and effort should be given to protect their physical health (Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020) .",

In particular, the education level in this sample was higher than that of the general population.
