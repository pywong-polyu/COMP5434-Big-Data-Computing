We hypothesized that LUS scores are associated with outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving invasive ventilation. This retrospective international multicenter study evaluated patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with at least one LUS study within 5 days after invasive mechanical ventilation initiation. The global LUS score was calculated by summing the 12 regional scores (range 0-36). Pleural line abnormalities and subpleural consolidations were also scored. The outcomes were successful liberation from the ventilator and intensive care mortality within 28 days, analyzed with multistate, competing risk proportional hazard models. One hundred thirty-seven patients with COVID-19-related ARDS were included in our study. The global LUS score was associated with successful liberation from mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.91 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-0.96; P 5 0.0007) independently of the ARDS severity, but not with 28 days mortality (HR: 1.03; 95% CI 0.97-1.08; P 5 0.36). Subpleural consolidation and pleural line abnormalities did not add to the prognostic value of the global LUS score. Examinations within 24 hours of intubation showed no prognostic value. To conclude, a lower global LUS score 24 hours after invasive ventilation initiation is associated with increased probability of liberation from the mechanical ventilator COVID-19 ARDS patients, independently of the ARDS severity.",

[4] [5] [6] The severity of loss of aeration, typically assessed by chest computed tomography (CT) scan, has been related to outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 7-9 but CT-scan capacity is limited and may not be available in resource-limited settings.",

Nevertheless, the role of LUS in evaluating the severity of patients after initiation of invasive ventilation is much less certain. 27 Evaluating lung disease severity with LUS may be important for ICU resource planning, especially in settings where resources are restricted, as well as for personalized ventilatory approach. 28 The aim of this study is to assess the association between global LUS score and outcome, specifically defined as liberation from the ventilator and survival in critically ill COVID-19 patients under invasive ventilation. We hypothesized the global LUS score to have prognostic value in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients independently of ARDS severity.",

In theory, the global LUS score can range from 0 (normal aeration in all regions) to 36 (severe abnormal aeration in all regions). 30 Presence of subpleural consolidations and abnormal pleural line was also assessed offline in each field using saved ultrasound clips. Thickening and fragmentation of the pleural line and the finding of subpleural consolidations do not currently contribute to the LUS aeration score but are often found in patients with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we assessed the number of fields with pleural line abnormalities and the number of fields with subpleural consolidations in a separate analysis. Pleural line abnormalities were defined as any deviation from the normally appearing thin, smooth and continuous hyperechoic line (Figure 1 ). 29 Subpleural consolidations were defined as one or more echo poor regions juxtaposed to the pleural line, which were not large enough to be scored as a tissue-like pattern or \"lobar consolidation\" in the lung aeration score (Figure 1 ). 30 Outcomes.

The analysis was repeated using the three categories resulting from these cutoffs. All analyses were performed in R through the R-studio interface (www.r-project.org, R version 3.3.1).

This finding is in line with a previous study that showed no association between decreased volume of well-aerated lung tissue as assessed by chest computed tomography and 30-day mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 ARDS. 36 Of note, that study also showed that global LUS score was a better predictor of outcome than the CT severity score. 36 In non-COVID-19 ARDS, the relationship between mortality rates and the amount of not aerated areas in invasively ventilated patients is not clear either. [37] [38] [39] [40] Even though the limited duration of follow-up of 1 month may have obscured associations with longer term mortality, 41 we conclude that the extent of parenchymal involvement is a poor predictor of outcome when applied to a cohort of critically ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.",

Moreover, we included only COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure undergoing invasive ventilation, a homogeneous group of patients that has been underrepresented in COVID-19 LUS cohorts. We accounted for competing risks and were able to distill an association with liberation of ventilation when accounting for the occurrence of mortality during the first 28 days of invasive ventilation. This study also has limitations. First, this is a retrospective study, and the indication and time point for a lung ultrasound exam was not prescribed in a protocol. Lung ultrasound exams were done as part of routine clinical practice and all performed within 5 days after start of invasive ventilation. Second, we could not assess the prognostic value of the changes in the LUS score over time as LUS exams were not performed repeatedly in the participating centers. Dynamic changes in LUS scores should be studied further as monitoring tool for reaeration of lung tissue. 50 Additional studies should focus on LUS because it is an excellent technique to use in a resource-limited setting as alternative for chest radiography or chest CT. 51 ",
