The level of agreement among researchers could be considered appropriate to assess the framework's feasibility for a pilot study [33] . Items in the framework were flexible enough to have a substantial inter-rater agreement; however, the items may benefit from more closed-ended criteria for more granular and consistent assessment. For example, a study assessing the usability of health information on medical institution websites (speed of information acquisition, the visual organization, and the discoverability via search engine) used a yes/no checklist which allowed for more consistency in terms of inter-rater reliability [34] . Future research should aim to assess the reliability and convergent validity of MHCIE in comparison to other health information tools [35] .",

The framework's generalizability is likely to be high because language or country should not fundamentally alter the relevance of any input criteria; an understanding of the local availability of multilingual health information may be required to adapt per-score levels for each category. As was noted in this pilot study, it was common for translated information to appear in English but not in Simplified Chinese or Korean. If scores in these languages were assessed, they would be much poorer than English, as has been documented in other multilingual health information research (French, German, Spanish) [36] . Using English as the anchor assessment language may be a viable option when using this framework. Comparing MHCIE scores between languages in the same locality and comparing to the distributions of nationalities of the foreign-born population would be another insightful usage.",

While not unexpected, one reason for variability may be because web-based health seeking is relatively uncommon in Japan [37] and therefore less prioritized in non-cosmopolitan areas than in foreign countries [38] . Another reason for variability may be that Japanese rural areas have issues with health care accessibility even in the primary language, due to low population density [39] . Conversely, in locales with a large metropolitan foreign-born population, 90.7% of local government websites were translated into at least one foreign language [40] . Similarly, US hospitals with higher bed numbers, higher revenue, and more admissions were positively associated with providing non-English language services information [41] . Only with short-sighted policy is multilingual health care information being translated, post-hoc, to support a current foreign-born constituency rather than to attract or prepare for new foreign populations.",

We observed that small municipal organizations independently disseminated some multilingual health care navigation including translated guides for daily life.

Second, the natural point of intervention based on these data would be at the prefectural level, promoting a top-down public health approach, which might not be flexible or specific enough to care for individual groups.
