A computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system calculated the total lung volume (TLV), the percentage of low attenuation areas (LAA%), the volume of pneumonia, the volume of ground-glass opacities (GGO), the volume of consolidation plus the GGO/consolidation ratio. The CT score was visually assessed by radiologists. Comparisons of lung and pneumonia parameters among the four stages were performed by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests. The relationship between the CT score and the volume of pneumonia, and between LAA% and the volume of pneumonia in four stages was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation analysis.",

Bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGO) with or without consolidation are the most common lung appearance of COVID-19 (2) . Some recent studies have depicted typical CT manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia during disease course into the early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages (3) (4) (5) (6) .

Previous studies failed to consider the coexisting chronic pulmonary abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, for instance, emphysema and interstitial lung diseases (7) . Colombi et al. found that well-aerated lung volume on initial CT may indicate the severity of disease and was a predictor of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (9) . To date, no lung functional data are available for COVID-19 patients during hospitalization except for Mo et al. who found the impairment of lung volume in COVID-19 patients prior to discharge, especially in severe cases (10) .

The results showed that the lung volume and LAA% significantly decreased in the progressive, peak, and absorption stages. The volume of pneumonia lesions, GGO, and consolidation continually increased in the progressive and peak stages. The GGO/consolidation ratio was significantly reduced in the progressive and peak stages and then recovered a little in the absorption stage. In addition, we found a moderate association between the visual CT score and the volume of pneumonia in the early, progressive, and absorption stages. The lung is the most involved organ by COVID-19 (18) , and typical pathological findings consist of diffuse alveolar epithelium destruction, alveolar septal fibrous proliferation, hyaline membrane formation, and capillary damage/bleeding (19) . The pathological changes are the basis of typical CT findings of COVD-19 pneumonia. Previous studies observed the timedependent changes of COVID-19 pneumonia in the extent and severity of lesions (3, 20, 21) , which could be classified as four stages. In the early stage, bilateral GGO with subpleural distribution was the primary manifestation. Subsequently, the infection rapidly progressed to diffuse GGO with crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram sign, and consolidation. After that, infections in some patients increased to peak involvement in regard to size, number, and density. After the infection was controlled by supportive treatment, the consolidation was absorbed gradually with fibrosis, but GGO appeared due to the absorption of consolidation. Our quantitative analyses perfectly reflected the time course of lung changes on chest CT. We observed a significantly increased volume of pneumonia lesions, GGO, and consolidation in the progressive stage, which slowly increased in the peak stage and significantly decreased in the absorption stage. The mean time to peak of the pneumonia volume was 5.2 \u00b1 4.8 days. The GGO/consolidation ratio was persistently reduced in the progressive and peak stages and then recovered a little in the absorption stage. Timely monitoring the changes of total pneumonia, GGO, and consolidation would be beneficial for the evaluation of treatment response and adjustment of the clinical staging of COVID-19 patients.",

This marker is simple and readily available in a clinical setting without any need of post-processing. However, it is somewhat subjective when the COVID-19 pneumonia lesions are multiple and irregular. CAD-based quantitative CT might outperform the traditional semiquantitative method based on the visual CT score. Despite the limitation of the CT score, we found a moderate correlation between the visual CT score and the volume of pneumonia measured by our CAD system, indicating that the CT score could be safely and effectively used in clinical practice. Our study showed that the CT scores of progressive and peak stages were significantly higher than those of the early and absorption stages, which may be correlated with elevated inflammation-related biomarkers (22) . Yang et al. showed that the CT score was higher in severe cases as compared to mild cases (23) . They found that using the CT score of larger than 19.5 could predict severe COVID-19, with high sensitivity (83%) and specificity (94%), which was consistent with the study of Liu et al. (24) . Mahdjoub et al. found that the admission CT score was an independent predictor for a 5-day outcome (i.e., mechanical ventilation or death) of COVID-19 patients (25) . Therefore, the CT score may help risk stratification and identify those patients at high risk of rapid progress who need timely treatment.",

Previous studies showed that a significant correlation between lung volume and PFT results in interstitial lung diseases (26) (27) (28) . Since the outbreak of this disease, its impact on lung function remains unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that recovered patients with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may be left with persistently damaged lung function (11) (12) (13) (14) . Mo et al. revealed that, in COVID-19 survivors, the most common abnormality of lung function is the reduced diffusion capacity, followed by restrictive ventilatory defect, which is associated with the disease severity (10) . A recent case report might suggest that older patients with COVID-19 were more likely to have residual radiological changes and impaired lung function after discharge (29) . These preliminary findings might suggest that lung function monitoring and rehabilitation in patients who recovered from COVID-19 is necessary.

Second, our selection criteria might have introduced selection bias since we excluded mild and critical illness. Third, the different CT scan parameters might have a potential impact on software-based quantification. Fourth, some patients could not hold well their breath, especially severe cases, which may pose an impact on the calculation. Fifth, the sample size is relatively small, specifically for the peak stage; more subjects are needed to better understand the infection's underlying mechanism and its spread pattern. Sixth, the impact of other patient demographics, such as smoking status and preconditioned respiratory disease wasn't identified, which may play as a confounder. Finally, the effect of other lung structures, such as airways, vessels, and fissures, wasn't observed for analysis.",
