HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that causes cervical, anal, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers, and genital warts. While HPV vaccination can prevent most HPV-related cancers, more than 20,000 women and 14,000 men are diagnosed with HPV-associated cancers each year in the United States (1) . This is troubling given that HPV vaccination rates remain substantially lower than national targets (80% by 2030 for adolescents aged [13] [14] [15] (2) . Indeed, only about 54% of adolescents have met this target in more than 13 years after the vaccine was recommended for girls and 8 years after the recommendation for boys (3) .

At the patient level, individuals often lack awareness of the importance of vaccination, experience fear or fatalism, or are dissuaded by prevailing anti-vaccination norms (10, (14) (15) (16) (17) . Rural residents may experience limited healthcare access: studies show that rural adolescents are less likely than urban counterparts to attend a well-child visit and to receive a provider recommendation for HPV vaccination (6) . In addition, providers and clinics are often limited by a lack of systematic methods for identifying patients eligible for vaccination; inadequate reimbursement and time for counseling about vaccination; and follow-up systems that do not track intervals for repeated doses (18) . Rural clinics also face shortages of medical providers, especially pediatricians, well-versed in delivering adolescent vaccines (11, 19, 20) .",

In the United States, the vast majority of non-essential medical care (e.g., well-child visits) did not occur during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (22, 23) . In the early months of the pandemic, up to 40% of appointments for children's immunizations and 80% of appointments for teen's HPV vaccinations have been missed (24) . As well-child visits have been resuming, adolescents have been the least likely to catchup on immunizations, compared to younger children and infants (25) . Furthermore, publicly-insured adolescents have experienced larger declines in immunization since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 than privately insured adolescents (3, 26) .",

Current studies find that multi-level interventions display a synergistic effect, with interventions targeting parents and providers achieving higher levels of HPV vaccine uptake than interventions targeting each group alone.

The development of the parent/caregiver and young adult reminder intervention included three video calls between the University team and TMC providers and support staff at the end of 2020. Calls consisted of an environmental scan of existing HPV vaccination efforts, a discussion on possible approaches for improving HPV vaccination rates and delivery, and conversations around the facilitation of TMC provider and support staff vaccination efforts by the University team. The video calls also included a walkthrough of the EHR workflow and immunization preparation activities at TMC. The team determined prioritization of the target population, the development of a vaccination patient reminder campaign and messaging content, and campaign implementation within the EHR. The team also completed a walkthrough of running the campaign with TMC team members as completed via virtual meeting. A step-by-step documentation and guide for EHR implementation developed by the University team were provided offline to the providers and support staff at TMC.",

The number of providers and support staff identifying a lack of educational materials as a barrier to vaccination decreased more than 17% points following the intervention, as did lack of time to discuss vaccination (Figure 1) . The most frequently identified barrier to HPV vaccination selected by providers and support staff at TMC, in both the pre-and post-healthcare team training surveys was parental vaccination hesitancy or refusal, which declined 41.2% points, the greatest decrease (by percentage point) seen across vaccination barriers. Lack of standing orders (\u221211.8%), lack of time to administer the immunization (\u221211.7%), cost (vaccine is expensive) (\u221211.8%), lack of a provider reminder system for discussing vaccination (\u22125.9%), lack of HPV knowledge and training (\u22125.9%), and being unconvinced of the vaccine efficacy (\u22125.9%) all decreased by more than 5% points following the intervention. There were three (3) barriers that were selected more frequently by providers and support staff following the campaign and those included: lack of EHR use to track vaccination (11.8%), being unsure of the need for vaccination (11.7%), and a personal fear of adverse and/or side effects (5.9%), which all increased by at least 5% points (Figure 1) . When examining what had been helpful in facilitating HPV vaccination by providers and support staff via free-text responses (data not shown), three general themes emerged as helpful: framing HPV vaccination as cancer prevention, education and materials provided, and education and discussion on HPV and vaccinating both male and female patients prior to the 15th birthday of the patient. An example of a statement of framing HPV vaccination as cancer prevention was \"We have really taken on the approach as presenting this vaccine as part of cancer prevention, which parents are much more likely to receive well\". A characterization of the helpfulness of the education and discussion of HPV and vaccination was \"We also have been able to provide valuable statistics on the prevalence of HPV once a patient becomes sexually active, and by stressing that we vaccinate early when children can mount a strong response long before they are exposed has helped parents understand why we vaccinate early against HPV\". Feasibility measures and usability among providers and support staff at TMC were favorable overall in both the pre-and post-intervention surveys ( Table 3) , with most strongly agreeing that: \". . . the benefits of current practices in place for HPV vaccination at my facility outweigh the costs/risks\" (70.6 and 52.9%, respectively), \". . . the practices in my clinical setting are valuable and address barriers to HPV vaccination\" (47.1 and 64.7%, respectively), and \"current strategies I use for HPV vaccination in my clinic are easy to understand\" (58.8 and 72.7%, respectively). Although, none of the feasibility and usability measures showed a significant difference ( Table 3) following the facilitation and education campaign intervention (p > 0.2 for each).",

Our findings indicate that patients who did not receive the HPV vaccine at the time of visit, although they were due for the vaccination (i.e., missed opportunities), declined significantly following the HPV vaccination intervention period. Parental vaccination hesitancy or refusal, the most commonly reported vaccination barrier by providers and support staff, also declined by 41.2% points. While most barriers decreased in the frequency of selection by providers and support staff, there were a few vaccination barriers that were selected more frequently following the campaign. These included: lack of EHR use to track vaccination; personal fear of adverse and/or side effects; and being unsure of the need for vaccination. The lack of a system for provider reminders to discuss immunization decreased during a time of clinic overburden from COVID-19, while lack of an EHR to track vaccination and being unsure of the need for vaccination both increased following the education intervention. This likely characterizes sentiments expressed by providers and support staff in person during the educational campaign of a lack of a national immunization registry and a largely seasonal and/or transient patient-population that is often unsure of their own and/or child's HPV vaccination status. Future work for enhancing immunization uptake, particularly in rural settings, could include better integration of immunization registries at a national level with enhanced optimization of provider reminders which would improve provider and support staff confidence for the need of vaccination among transitory patient populations.",

Small cell sizes, due largely to unequal pre-post intervention population sizes, were present. At this time, we are unable to accurately characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HPV vaccination in this population. The COVID-19 pandemic paused regular in-person appointments for many and may also have resulted in fewer people getting the HPV vaccine; counts may be underestimated as some people may get vaccinated once the pandemic is over; or counts may be accurate as some people may forego vaccination. This would be consistent with previous research indicating a preference for a single vaccine per visit, and many may prioritize the COVID-19 vaccine over the HPV vaccine.",

Neither the number of wellness visits, patients up-todate on an HPV vaccination schedule, patients receiving an HPV vaccination during the visit, nor patients declining a vaccination at the time of visit varied between pre-and post-intervention. A lower proportion of patients following the intervention were due for the HPV vaccination initial dose and/or booster compared with those due prior to the intervention (20.2% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.0035).
