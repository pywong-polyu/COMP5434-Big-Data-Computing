            "text": "Nearly all organisms found in nature have evolved and developed their own specific strategies to cope with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Catalase, a heme-containing tetramer protein expressed in a broad range of aerobic fungi, has been utilized as an essential enzymatic ROS detoxifying mechanism, and shows remarkable efficiency in degrading hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for fungal cell survival and host invasion. Here, we demonstrate that catalase inactivation with blue light renders fungal cells highly susceptible to ROS attack, thus resembling a 'strength-toweakness optical switch'. To unveil catalase as the underlying molecular target of blue light and its inactivation mechanism, we systematically compared wild-type Candida albicans to a catalasedeficient mutant strain for susceptibility to ROS in the absence/presence of 410 nm treatment. Upon testing on a wide range of fungal species and strains, we found that intracellular catalase could be effectively and universally inactivated by 410 nm blue light. We find that the photoinactivation of catalase in combination with ROS-generating agents is highly effective and potent in achieving full eradication of multiple fungal species and strains, including multiple clinical strains of Candida auris, the causative agent of the global fungal epidemic. In addition, photoinactivation of catalase is shown to facilitate macrophage killing of intracellular Candida albicans. The antifungal efficacy of catalase photoinactivation is further validated using a Candida albicans-induced mouse model of skin abrasion. Taken together, our findings offer a novel catalase-photoinactivation approach to address multidrug-resistant Candida infections.",

Candida species are the most common cause of human fungal infections (2) , such as oropharyngeal, cutaneous candidiasis and mucosal or deep-seated organ infections (3) . Invasive Candida infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients, partly due to the growing spread of antifungal resistance (4) . The growing emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida species poses an alarming trend worldwide (5) . Especially of concern is Candida auris (C. auris) which has resulted in multiple worldwide healthcare outbreaks with record-breaking mortality rate due to its multi-drug or even pan-drug resistance nature and biofilm formation (6, 7) . Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated C. auris outbreaks (8) . Life-threatening invasive mycosis has been recorded to accompany COVID-19 patients due to impaired immune responses, forcing higher than normal usage of antifungal agents (9) . At a higher level, the long-term imprudent usage of antifungal agents has been shown to accelerate the resistance of anti-fungal development (need a reference here). Confronted with this severe situation, novel therapeutic approaches are highly desired.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial blue light, especially in the 400-430 nm range, has drawn increasing attention in recent years as a non-drug approach to treat wide-ranging bacterial (10, 11) and fungal infections (12, 13) . The antifungal efficacy of blue light has been studied by many research groups worldwide. Blue light at 415 nm has demonstrated the capability to inactivate C. albicans both in vitro and in vivo mouse burn infection models, and the susceptibility of C. albicans to blue light-induced inactivation did not change even after the 10 th passage in the presence of blue light exposure suggesting the unlikelihood of fungi developing photoresistance (14) . Gupta et al. achieved 4.52-log10 reduction of C. albicans after delivering 332.1 J/cm 2 of 405 nm irradiance (15) . Rosa et al. reported a 2.3-log10 reduction of C. albicans in a biofilm setting under the treatment of 455 nm exposure with a dose of 45.16 J/cm 2 (16) . Raquel et al. further demonstrated significant antimicrobial effect of 405 nm on C. albicans both in monomicrobial and polymicrobial biofilm schemes (17) . Blue light was also utilized to combine with other agents to eliminate C. albicans. Leon at al. showed that quinine chloride could enhance the fungicidal effects of blue light 405 nm on the elimination of C. albicans both in vitro and in vivo. Besides C. albicans, blue light can also inhibit the growth of microconidia of molds, such as Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (18) . Studies also demonstrated that 405 nm light has detrimental effect on additional yeasts such as Sacchromyces cerevisiae and obligate molds including Aspergillus niger (19) . Noteworthy, no significant loss of viability on human keratinocytes was observed after 216 J/cm 2 blue light treatment (17) . Collectively, these studies demonstrate that blue light works effectively against major pathogenic fungal species without developing resistance and no significant cytotoxicity on host cells, thus emerging as a drug-free alternative approach to combat fungal infections.",

Bacterial/fungal inactivation are eradicated by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced through photodynamic reaction between these molecules and blue light (20) . However, this perspective remains controversial. First, it has been reported that the total amount of coprotoporphyrins inside the microbes was not a contributing factor to the antimicrobial efficacy of blue light (21) . Second, the intracellular concentration of porphyrins or riboflavin is as low as 2-4\u00d7 10 \u22123 mg/ml (22) . Given the situation that research of antimicrobial blue light on fungi stays understudied and the working mechanism of antimicrobial blue light has yet to be clarified, other possible molecular targets are assumed to exist.",

Catalase from wide-ranging fungal species could be effectively inactivated by 410 nm blue light. Subsequently, photoinactivation of catalase renders fungal cells highly susceptible to non-fungicidal low-concentration hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ROS-producing antifungal drugs. Moreover, the synergy between photoinactivation of catalase and H2O2 can enable total eradication of multiple notorious drug-resistant C. auris isolates whereas either alone has limited efficacy. Furthermore, photoinactivation of catalase substantially boosts macrophages activity against C. albicans indicated by shorter hyphae length and higher eradication percent of C. albicans were observed in the case of 410 nm involved group. Finally, we validated the synergistic effect between photoinactivation of catalase and H2O2 in a C. albicans-induced mouse skin abrasion model without noticeable skin damage. Collectively, our findings provide a novel catalase-targeting strategy to treat multi-drug resistant fungal infections.",

It was reported as early as in 1965 that bovine liver catalase can be inactivated by visible light exposure (23) . Nonetheless, photoinactivation of catalase remained underexplored over the decades. To better understand how photons inactivate catalase, especially catalase inside fungal cells, we first quantified the remaining catalase percentage from bovine liver catalase (2.5 U/ml) after blue light exposure under various wavelengths using an Amplex red catalase kit. And we found that blue light, especially in the 400-420 nm window, inactivates catalase by 70% compared to control (Figure 1b) . 410 nm shows the best capability to inactivate catalase, which might be due to the fact that the optimal absorption peak of catalase is around 410 nm. In the following experiments, we used continuouswave (CW) 410 nm LED as the light source to inactivate catalase.",

As shown in Figure 1c -d, we indeed found that stationary-phase Candida spp. have more catalase compared to log-phase. Of note, catalase in log-and stationary-phase C. albicans could be consistently inactivated by 410 nm exposure. Moreover, this inactivation behavior exists in many other fungal strains apart from C. albicans (Figure 1e) .

A colony-forming unit (CFU/ml) assay was conducted by combining 410 nm with H2O2 at a non-fungicidal concentration (22 mM) . As shown in Figure 2a , photoinactivation of catalase significantly sensitizes wild-type C. albicans SC5314 to H2O2 by around six orders of magnitude, whereas H2O2 or blue light alone didn't have apparent killing effect. This result indicates a synergistic killing effect between photoinactivation of catalase and H2O2. To understand whether this augmented killing was due to intracellular accumulation of H2O2 after catalase inactivation, we utilized an established kit using H2O2-sensitive fluorophore to quantify intracellular H2O2 in C. albicans cells treated with H2O2 or 410 nm plus H2O2 through a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). As shown in Figure 2b -c, fluorescent intensity in the 410 nm plus H2O2 treated single C. albicans SC5314 was significantly higher than cells treated by H2O2 alone, suggesting that photoinactivation of catalase boosts intracellular H2O2 accumulation.",

For example, in the case of stationary-phase C. glabrata ATCC2001 (Figure 3b) , 410 nm exposure (30 J/cm 2 ) inhibited around 12% of the original fungal cells to proliferate. At a concentration of 22 mM, H2O2 alone prohibited the growth of around 40% of the original fungal cells. Once combining these two treatments together, total growth inhibition was obtained.

            "text": "To treat fungal infections in the clinic, currently there are limited classes of antifungals available, such as liposomal formulations of amphotericin B (representative of polyenes), miconazole (azole representative), echinocandin (antifungal which inhibits the cell wall synthesis). Interestingly, it was reported that all these antifungals are able to induce an intracellular ROS burst within fungal cells as part of their proposed antifungal mechanism (34) (35) (36) . Considering the pivotal role of catalase in scavenging ROS (37) and the fact that fluconazole and amphotericin-B resistance are associated with increased expression of catalase and superoxide dismutase (38) , we reasoned that photoinactivation of catalase could enhance the antifungal efficacy of these antimycotics against fungal cells. The same time-course PrestoBlue proliferation assay was applied for the evaluation when treating fungal cells with these antifungals at a sublethal concentration (supplementary Figure 4) . Figure 3e , in the case of C. albicans C17, 410 nm blue light alone (30 J/cm 2 ) inhibited around 36% of original C. albicans to divide, amphotericin B (AmB, 1 \u00b5g/ml) alone also gave out around 36% inhibition effects, whereas the administration of AmB after 410 nm blue light treatment drastically suppressed fungal growth by 75%. Similar phenomenon was found in the combinational behavior between 410 nm treatment and miconazole (micon, 0.5 \u00b5g/ml) against C. albicans (Figure 3e ). Micafungin (mica, 0.025 \u00b5g/ml) has demonstrated the augmented inhibition effect induced by photoinactivation of catalase against C. glabrata as well (Figure 3f ). In combination with the time-course calibration curves with known number of fungal cells under the same conditions, we can derive the relatively proliferated fungal cell numbers (supplementary Figure 5-6 ). Through comparison between the proliferated fungal cell numbers under different treatment schemes, we can clearly observe the enhanced inhibition effect by 410 nm (supplementary Figure 6) . Collectively, these data were in line with our hypothesis, that is, photoinactivation of catalase boosts the antimycotic efficacy of commonly used antifungal agents.",

To investigate whether photoinactivation of catalase and H2O2 could efficiently kill C. auris, we conducted CFU assay of multiple C. auris clinical isolates acquired from antimicrobial resistance bank (AR-BANK) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Here C. auris 1, 2, 5, 6 represent AR-BANK#0381, 0382, 0385, 0386, respectively. Log-phase C. auris isolates were exposed to 410 nm blue light (36 J/cm 2 ) followed by subsequent administration of H2O2 (4-h incubation at 30\u00b0C, 11-22 mM), serial dilution and CFU enumeration. As shown in Figure 4a , in the case of C. auris 1, photoinactivation of catalase renders this pathogen highly susceptible to H2O2 by around three orders of magnitude. Drastically, total eradication of C. auris 2 was obtained in the 410 nm plus H2O2 treated group (Figure 4b) . Similar augmentation effect appeared with regard to C. auris 5 and C. auris 6 as well (Figure 4cd) . These results underline the essential role of catalase for C. auris to defend external H2O2 attack.

Meanwhile, time-course PrestoBlue fluorescence intensity of untreated fungal cells with known CFU number were recorded as standard curves. In this way, we could derive the relatively proliferated fungal cell number from the treated groups based on the linear calibration curves (supplementary Figure 12-13) . Figure 5a -b, 410 nm blue light alone (30 J/cm 2 ) inhibits around the proliferation of C. auris 1 by 90%, and blue light alone (30 J/cm 2 ) significantly suppressed the growth of Candida auris. Total inhibition effect was obtained in the 410 nm plus H2O2 (5.5 mM) treated group. Meanwhile, we also observed that total inhibition of proliferation happened in the 410 nm plus amphotericin B (AmB) treated group whereas AmB alone exerted limited efficacy. Noteworthy, photoinactivation of catalase could enhance the fungistatic effects of fluconazole by around one order of magnitude (Figure 5a) . Similar phenomena were observed in the case of C. auris 3 (MIC of fluconazole is 128 \u00b5g/ml) and C. auris 10 (MIC of fluconazole is >256 \u00b5g/ml) as well (Figure 5c-d) . Strikingly, we further found that multiple C. auris strains are highly susceptible to 410 nm blue light treatment alone (Figure 5e -f) as total inhibition was observed, hinting that ample blue light-sensitive endogenous chromophores existing inside C. auris strains. Collectively, C. auris were highly sensitive towards blue light, and photoinactivation of catalase renders C. auris susceptible to various ROS-producing agents, even for some antifungal agents to which C. auris have developed resistance.",

After that, we performed a Live (SYTO 9)/Dead (PI) staining assay to visualize intracellular C. albicans. As shown in Figure 6a -c, after one hour of infection, C. albicans indeed exhibited hyphal morphology, and pierced through the macrophages. A small portion of C. albicans remained alive inside the macrophages (Figure 6a ). By comparison, in the 410 nm blue light-treated group, we not only observed significantly less C. albicans in their hyphal form, but also significantly shortened hyphal length (Figure 6d-f ). Quantitative analysis of the hyphal length under different treatment groups (Figure 6g ) further consolidated this finding. Furthermore, there is a significant reduction of C. albicans viability after macrophage phagocytosed 410 nm pre-exposed C. albicans (Figure 6h) . Collectively, these evidences suggest that photoinactivation of catalase attenuates the virulence of C. albicans, thus boosting macrophage elimination of intracellular C. albicans.

For severely ill or immunocompromised patients, this situation especially worsens, and systematic candidiasis or candidemia might happen. Association of invasive aspergillosis accompanying COVID-19 patients as secondary infection have been reported (53) . In addition, the global overuse of antifungals accelerates development of multidrug or pan-drug resistant fungal cells. Therefore, novel approaches to combat fungal infection are highly desired. Here, using wild-type C. albicans along with catalase-deficient C. albicans, we first identified catalase residing inside wide-ranging fungal species as a primary target of blue light. Its function in detoxifying intracellular H2O2 can be efficiently inactivated by blue light, especially around 410 nm range, which subsequently renders these fungal species highly susceptible to ROS-producing agents. In addition, the synergy between photoinactivation of catalase and H2O2 remains effective for various fungal species and strains, especially, the notorious clinical drug-resistant C. auris strains. Towards clinical applications, we found that photoinactivation of catalase boosts macrophage killing of intracellular C. albicans, and reduces C. albicans burden in a C. albicans infected mouse model of skin abrasion once combining with hydrogen peroxide. Consecutive blue light passage study indicates that neither catalase expression level nor cell susceptibility to blue light is changed for serial blue light treatment. These findings suggest the great potential of catalase-targeting blue light therapy as a new alternative to treat clinical multidrug resistant fungal infections.",

            "text": "Of note, blue light-mediated inactivation of C. albicans has been documented before (13) . However, the underlying molecular target and the eradication mechanism for blue light are still unclear, which seriously hinders follow-up developments in improving its efficacy as well as its clinical translations. Based on our studies here we unveiled that blue light alone only exerts limited efficacy by inactivating catalase and ROS-producing agents are essential to be administered as adjuvants to synergize with 410 nm blue light for strikingly improved fungal eradication. For example, the light dose and settings we applied here are well below the ANSI standard (200 mW/cm 2 for 410 nm), and blue light-mediated photoinactivation of catalase sensitizes C. albicans to non-fungicidal low-concentration H2O2 by around six orders of magnitude. As another example, AmB, the golden standard for antimycotic treatment for the most severe fungal infections (54), exhibits part of its killing efficacy through ROS burst after binding with ergosterol (55). However, high-dose AmB treatment often leads to acute renal failure as a well-documented serious complication (56) . Our findings suggest an alternative approach to tune down the usage of AmB by photoinactivation of catalase. Moving further, photoinactivation of catalase also revives certain antifungal agents such as fluconazole against azole-resistant clinical C. auris strains (Figure 5cd) .",

However, it remains enigmatic regarding exactly why C. auris has such high sensitivity to blue light. Likely, it possesses relatively higher amount of catalase when compared to other Candida species. Nevertheless, further quantitative characterizations of catalase amount and related mRNA expression levels are helpful to address this query. C. auris also demonstrates a propensity to persist on skin or environmental surfaces, a unique feature to distinguish it from other Candida species, thus highly transmissible (57) . Our data here demonstrates the high susceptibility of C. auris to blue light, and blue light alone can be developed as a novel approach for eradicating drug-resistant C. auris colonized on the skin or environmental surfaces.",

Particularly, shortened hyphae length was observed inside the macrophages infected by the 410 nm pre-exposed C. albicans, suggesting the pivotal role of catalase plays in the transition from yeast-to hyphae-form C. albicans. It has been reported catalase gene disruption did not induce hyphae formation in yeast-form Saccharomyces cerevisiae (47) . Therefore, further molecular-level study to further understand how 410 nm blue light treatment modulates such yeastto-hyphae transformation can be pursued. In addition, significant number of yeast-form C. albicans were found dead inside macrophages, suggesting an effective 410 nm blue light-mediated macrophage phagocytosis. Other immune cells like neutrophils also produce high level of ROS when phagocytosing fungal cells (58) . Therefore, we suspect that photoinactivation of catalase could assist neutrophils to eliminate intracellular fungal cells via a similar mechanism. Taken together, photoinactivation of catalase presumably enhances immune cells to phagocytose fungal cells, thus preventing the potential disseminated candidiasis.",

The current work unveiled catalase as a primary target of blue light in wide-ranging fungal species, thus broadening the scope of utilization of photoinactivation of catalase to an even wider range of pathogenic microbes. Although catalase is identified as the primary target of blue light, we believe that other molecular targets other than catalase might still exist. This is evidenced by enhanced H2O2 killing of catalase-deficient C. albicans by 410 nm blue light. To identify these peripheral targets in the future, endogenous pigments could be further examined as intrinsic chromophores e.g. staphyloxanthin, have shown striking sensitivity to blue light-mediated photobleaching (60) (61) (62) (63) . It has also been reported that melanin is the major pigment inside C. albicans playing a myriad of biological functions (64) . Photoinactivation or photomodulation of melanin might account for blue light-mediated killing as well. Another direction to pursue is to improve light penetration depth, as blue light currently can only penetrate a few hundred microns (65), thus limiting its applications only to superficial surfaces. For deepseated fungal infections, pulsed blue laser with high-peak power might offer improved and deeper penetration compared to the continuous-wave light (61) . Upconverting nanoparticles, capable of converting near-infrared red excitation into visible and ultraviolet emission (66), might suggest another potential way to treat deep-tissue fungal infections. In summary, our findings here suggest a fundamental molecular target and eradication mechanism of blue light elimination of multiple fungal species. These mechanistic insights create new possibilities to find highly effective treatment avenues for surface sterilization and for treatment of superficial fungal infections.",

Then co-culture was incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator to allow for the phagocytosis of fungal cells. After two hours, the infection co-culture was removed and replaced with normal growth media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES). A Live (SYTO 9)/Dead (PI) staining assay was to utilize to visualize the live and dead fungal cells inside macrophages, respectively. Briefly, after fixation with 10% formalin following infections, samples were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X for 3 min at room temperature. After that, a Live/Dead fluorescence kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L7007) was utilized to stain the intracellular fungal cells and confocal laser scanning microscope (FV3000, Olympus) was employed to visualize the stained samples.",

            "text": "To evaluate the potential toxicity of 410 nm exposure and short term, high concentration H2O2 exposure against mammalian cells, an MTT assay was performed using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) until a high confluence was obtained. CHO cells were then removed via trypsin, quantified, and diluted in serum-free DMEM media to a cell concentration of 1\u00d710 6 cells/ml. In a treated 96-well plate, 100 \u00b5l of cell suspension was added to each well, providing 1\u00d710 5 cells per well. The cells were allowed to adhere overnight at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The next day, the media was removed from each well and the cells were washed twice with PBS to minimize potential reactions between the phenol red present in DMEM and the blue light treatment. Washing conditions performed on one set of cells were also performed on all other sets to maintain consistency. Following washing, all wells were filled with PBS and the light treated wells were then exposed to 30 J/cm 2 of CW-410 (200 mW/cm 2 , 2.5 min) After light treatment, PBS was removed and replaced with DMEM. For the H2O2 treated groups, 0.1% H2O2 in DMEM was added to the H2O2 treatment groups for 1 min, after which the media was immediately removed and the wells were washed three times with PBS to minimize potential remaining H2O2 remaining. Three-fold washing was also applied to the other treatment groups. After washing, the wells were filled with 100 \u00b5l of fresh DMEM and the cells were allowed to recover from treatment over the course of 24 hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Once 24 hours have passed, an MTT viability assay was performed, where the DMEM was replaced with fresh DMEM alongside 0.5 mg/ml of MTT (Life Technologies, M6494) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. Once upon completion, the DMEM/MTT solution was removed and 100 \u00b5l of filtered DMSO was mixed in and provided with 45 min to dissolve the crystalized formazan, after which absorbance measurements were quantified via plate reader at 590 nm. The assay was performed in replicates of N=4.",

The abrasion fungal infection model was used. Twenty BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, 000651) were shaved on the dorsal side and placed under anesthesia, then a sterile #15 sterile scalpel was used to generate two ~1\u00d71 cm 2 abrasion wounds on both left and right by carefully scraping the epidermis of the skin until reddish dots appeared without drawing blood out of skin barrier. Once wounds were generated, a 10 \u00b5l aliquot containing 2\u00d710 8 /ml of exponential phase C. albicans SC5314 in PBS was placed onto the abrasion wound, and spread evenly across the wound with a pipette tip and air dried. Then 20 mice were divided into four treatment groups, each consisting of 5 mice (N=10 wounds in total): Untreated, 410 nm treated, H2O2 treated, and 410 nm plus H2O2 treated. Light treatment was applied by positioning mice under 200 mW/cm 2 (ANSI standard for human skin) 410 nm LEDs for 10 min (total 120J/cm 2 , 5-min exposure and 5-min break and then 5-min exposure again in order to prevent potential photodamage). For H2O2 treatment, 10 \u00b5l of 0.5% H2O2 was evenly distributed on the infected wounds and air dried. Combinational treatment consisted of the application of previously described blue light treatment (120 J/cm 2 ) followed immediately by the administration of H2O2. Treatments were applied to mice twice, the first treatment being applied 4 hours following infection, and the second treatment being applied 20 hours after the infection. 2 hours after the second treatment, mice were euthanized and wound tissue was harvested, either homogenized and serially diluted for CFU studies or fixation by 10% neutral buffered formalin for histology studies. CFU enumeration was performed on C. albicans-specific BiGGY agar plates (73608, Sigma Aldrich).",
