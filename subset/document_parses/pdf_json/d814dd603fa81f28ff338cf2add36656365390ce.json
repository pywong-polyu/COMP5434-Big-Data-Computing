In 2020, the world faced COVID-19, a globally effective virus leading to mass losses and socio-economic panic. Due to apparent psycho-social conditions, analyzing the potential economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic was inevitable. Thus, discussing economic effects of previous global and regional epidemics is considered beneficial. This research evaluated most of the known epidemics and their effects on economics and socio-politics by reviewing scientific literature. In addition to the vast literature and observations on the ongoing process, we assessed the potential impacts of COVID-19 and potential ways to overcome these impacts. The most urgent socio-economic measures needed to combat the negative effects of a contagious disease are related to unemployment with its income effects and security of all sectors. To prevent persistent unemployment, service, retail, and even industrial sectors need to be supported. Additionally, we discussed the need for reorganizing the funding and managerial sustainability of healthcare services to be prepared for future.",

            "text": "The world has witnessed many challenging situations throughout history. These challenges were wars sometimes or revolutions that reshaped the socio-politics completely. Yet, another challenge has been contagious diseases. The world had witnessed many epidemics. The plague of the Medieval and its variations and the great influenza of 1918-1920 were the most devastating ones. Yet, the contagious diseases having global effects had forgotten long time ago even if there appeared some recent encounters in the past 20 The differentiating features of COVID-19 or SARS-COV2 from the recent encounters are its geographical dispersion in terms of contagion and its causalities. However, its apparent size and global effects were underestimated at the beginning. It is sound to mention the scope of previous epidemics to differentiate COVID-19. SARS-COV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) had started in China and affected Taiwan, Singapore, USA and Canada. During its influential period, around 8,000 cases were reported and more than 900 people had died with an 11% fatality rate [36] . Avian influenza-H5N1 that spread from poultry to human resulted in 400 deaths as of 2008 [30] . The most recent epidemic of MERS-COV (Middle East respiratory syndrome) mostly affected the Middle East in 2012 with more than 400 deaths. The only out of region case was South Korea, where 150 deaths were reported in 2015. What makes COVID-19 more devastating is its speed of contagion mostly in Europe and the Americas, although it started in the East Asia. By the end of April, number of reported cases and deaths were more than 3 million and 200.000 consecutively around the world [3] . With its 7% fatality rate, this global disease was announced as a pandemic by the WHO on 11th of March 2020.",

Therefore, it is important to project the possible economic and leading policy level outcomes of this pandemic.

Besides, the change of labour endowments or declining labour supplies even led to the shift from feudalism to centralisation of governments [13] . The production structures shifted from labour to capital based and productive centres shifted from rural to urban during the Medieval, and plague had significant effects on these challenges [32] .

Spanish Flu took place between 1918 and 1920, resulted in around 39 million deaths in 43 countries and the loss of young and middle-aged group led to a path to the WWII [7] . The relationship of the war and the flu in Italy was portrayed in a population study that 70.000 of total 466.000 flu deaths encountered were of soldiers, meaning the loss of war power [16] . Barro and Ursua [6] focused on the effects of disasters experienced since 1914 on GDP and consumption. They found that the Spanish Flu was the fourth economic shock on income and consumption following WWII, WWI and the great depression. They also indicated that these sorts of disasters led to around 10% per capita income loss. In an earlier attempt to comment on prospective COVID-19 effects, Barro and his friends estimated growth of national income and consumption expenditures of 42 countries between 1901 and 1929 on human capital loss due to the WWI. The impacts of flu concerning the GDP and consumption loss were around 6% and 8% respectively. Accordingly, they concluded that the great influenza had affected the society and economics seriously as well [7] .",

With a different perspective, natural and manmade disasters like wars were compared for Sweden between 1915 and 1956 [16] .

The impact of Spanish flu was compared with spring frosts in Norway. It was understood that the psycho-social impact of the epidemic and loss of middle-aged labour led to an economic breakdown. However, the losses encountered due to frosts were long lasting that they affected the society till the end of 1940s until technological advancements purified the losses [33] . Therefore, it can be noted that morality effect is a major reason in longer recovery after an epidemic and people tend to develop technological solutions for cyclical and natural disasters. Due to changing labour market composition and economic conditions during and after the influenza, both productivity and overall income had declined and savings and investment potential were affected negatively. Influenza contributed to losses of the WWI and was one of the factors changing economics and politics of the world via centralisation of governments until the end of 1950s [9] .",

With changing economic outlay in terms of globalisation and growing services sector, the effects of these diseases were measured in a multidimensional way. Demand-oriented sectors had changed and affected other sectors due to changing income levels and unemployment. The economic impact of SARS-COV was analysed for Hong Kong [36] . Demandoriented sectors, as tourism and transportation, downsized critically. Consumption demand and foreign trade declined in the short term and the depression in these sectors resulted in unemployment. Yet the productivity in industrial sectors was unaffected and SARS-COV was considered as a demand shock and the revival did not take much time. Taiwanese tourism was overviewed [39] and it was noted that number of incoming tourists fell from 2.98 million in 2002 to 2.24 million in 2003. Consumption expenditures and GDP fell accordingly and labour demand for tourism and retailing had shrunk between 3 and 6% within a year. Accordingly, it was concluded that the economic impact of the disease was visible even in the short term.",

Potential economic effects of SARS were evaluated for China and Hong Kong [25] . The analyses indicated that taking precautions are more efficient and less costly than posterior healthcare services in terms of loss of labour force and foregone income. In a macroeconomic perspective, consumption and services demand and their supplies are directly attached that a fall in overall demand led to declination in the overall supplies. In addition, the declination in demand and supply referred to 15% fall in services income on average. Fan [15] also noted that transparency in data collection and information of the society is essential departing from SARS data. She concluded that getting prepared is much more important than utilisation of post-epidemic health services. This research was a projection and warning for future contagious diseases.",

Therefore, as awaited, the lockdown enforcements and declining demand are apparently leading to downsizing in all these industries. So, reducing prices are expected to lead stagnation and reduce the economic worth everywhere.

In other words, agro-food demand of hotels or restaurants has shrunk due to lockdowns. Therefore, excess food and agriculture supplies are expected to lead to declining prices.
