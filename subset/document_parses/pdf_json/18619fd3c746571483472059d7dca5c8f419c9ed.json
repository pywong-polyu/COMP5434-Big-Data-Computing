Here, we aim to clarify the transmission route, clinical features and outcomes of these infections. We present a meta-analysis of 176 published cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections that were defined by at least one positive nasopharyngeal swab and/or the presence of specific IgM. We report that 70% and 30% of infections are due to environmental and vertical transmission, respectively. Our analysis shows that 55% of infected neonates developed COVID-19; the most common symptoms were fever (44%), gastrointestinal (36%), respiratory (52%) and neurological manifestations (18%), and lung imaging was abnormal in 64% of cases. A lack of mother-neonate separation from birth is associated with late SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 4.94 (95% CI: 1.98-13.08), p = 0.0002; adjusted OR 6.6 (95% CI: 2.6-16), p < 0.0001), while breastfeeding is not (OR 0.35 (95% CI: 0.09-1.18), p = 0.10; adjusted OR 2.2 (95% CI: 0.7-6.5), p = 0.148). Our findings add to the literature on neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

It usually starts with influenza-like symptoms, eventually progressing toward pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but cardiovascular, renal, neurological, dermatological, and gastrointestinal manifestations have also been reported 4, 5 . The pathophysiology of COVID-19 includes the direct viral cytopathic effect, but also an exaggerated inflammatory response (the so-called \"cytokine storm\"), with hypercoagulable state and tissue damage 6 . COVID-19 is more frequent and tends to be more severe with increasing age and in patients with certain characteristics, some of which are represented by comorbidities typical of older adults (such as cardiovascular disorders and diabetes) 7, 8 . These risk factors have a role both in the disease occurrence and in the progression towards greater clinical severity and mortality 7, 8 . Moreover, children might be less prone to develop the chaotic inflammatory host response that contributes to the clinical picture of COVID-19 9 and the disease seems to have a milder clinical course in children than in adults 10 . However, the proportion of asymptomatic infections seems to be lower in children than in adults 11, 12 .",

Nine (5.1%) neonates required delivery room resuscitation 19, 20, 38, 41, 44, 69, 77, 87 and 67 (38.3%) needed to be admitted to the NICU 17, 18, 20, 27, 31, 33, 35, 36, 38, 41, 44, 45, [47] [48] [49] [51] [52] [53] [57] [58] [59] 61, 62, [64] [65] [66] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] 77, [80] [81] [82] [85] [86] [87] [88] . The median NICU stay was 8 [5;18] days (min 1; max 69 days). Of these neonates, five were extremely preterm (of 26, 27 and 28 weeks' gestation; birth weight ranging between 900 and 1410 g, respectively), five were preterm (31 and 32 weeks' gestation; birth weight ranging between 1580 and 2300 g), nine were moderately preterm (33 and 34 weeks' gestation; birth weight ranging between 1839 and 3280 g) and eleven were late preterm (35 and 36 weeks' gestation; birth weight ranging between 2000 and 2540 g); all other NICU-admitted neonates were term infants.",

Ninetyseven neonates presented with clinical features related to COVID-19: 18, 20, [26] [27] [28] 30, 32, [34] [35] [36] [38] [39] [40] [41] 44, 45, [50] [51] [52] 55, 56, 58, 60, 61, [65] [66] [67] [70] [71] [72] 77, 78, 80, 81, [85] [86] [87] [88] 90 their distribution is shown in Table 3 . Respiratory manifestations mainly consisted of signs of respiratory failure, such as tachypnoea, intercostal retractions, and rhinitis; neonatal ARDS was not diagnosed in any case. Gastrointestinal manifestations were primarily represented by feeding difficulties, diarrhea, and vomiting, while neurological ones consisted of hypertonia and irritability, but also hypotonia and lethargy, as well as apnea. Cardiovascular features were tachycardia and hypotension. Other manifestations included conjunctivitis, hypothermia and cutaneous rash. Laboratory abnormalities were evident in a minority of cases: 14 (14.4%) and 4 (4.1%) out of 97 neonates presented with lymphopenia 20, 41, 53, 55, 59, 64, 69, 72, [79] [80] [81] 88 and raised liver enzymes 35, 72, 79, 88 , respectively. Inflammatory markers (Creactive protein and procalcitonin) were increased in 15 (15.5%) out of 97 neonates 20, 27, 38, 40, 43, 45, 49, 59, 70, 72, [80] [81] [82] 88 . Lung imaging was abnormal in 62 (64%) out of 97 neonates and consisted of an interstitialalveolar pattern at lung ultrasound or chest X-ray and ground-glass opacities at CT-scan 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29, 32, 36, 38, 44, 45, 51, 53, 55, 58, 59, [64] [65] [66] [69] [70] [71] 73, [77] [78] [79] [80] 82, 85, 88, 90 . One neonate presenting with neurological manifestations also showed bilateral gliosis of the deep white periventricular and subcortical matter, together with signs of cerebral vasculitis, which was not totally remitted at the hospital discharge 77 . Seven neonates were treated with oral hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin, two with intranasal interferon-\u03b11b and one with intravenous remdesivir, oseltamivir and ritonavir/lopinavir, respectively 17 Factors influencing occurrence of late neonatal infection. Fig. 3 shows that the lack of mother-neonate separation from birth was significantly associated with the incidence of late (i.e. occurring after the first 72 h of life) SARS-CoV-2 neonatal infection (OR 4.94 (95% CI: 1.98-13.08), p = 0.0002; adjusted OR 6.6 (95% CI: 2.6-16), p < 0.0001), while breastfeeding was not (OR 0.35 (95% CI: 0.09-1.18), p = 0.10; adjusted OR 2.2 (95% CI: 0.7-6.5), p = 0.148); models goodness of fit was always satisfactory (Hosmer-Lemeshow test p = 0.654 and p = 0.573, for the two regressions, respectively).",

This is potentially important since neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are Classification is based on a system including several virological tests (on placental tissues, amniotic fluid, cord and newborn blood or nasopharyngeal swabs), as well as the presence of clinical manifestations 16 . Cases are divided into: (1) congenital infections, (2) intrapartum acquired infections, or (3) postpartum acquired infections and into five mutually exclusive categories of the likelihood of infection: \"confirmed\", \"probable\", \"possible\", \"unlikely\", and \"not infected\". Classification was applied to 122 cases (for 54 neonates, data needed to classify the infection were missing despite repeated requests to the authors of the articles). Areas in blue depict the infections confirmed or supposed to be environmentally acquired (i.e.: postpartum), while areas in brown depict confirmed or supposed to be vertically (either intrapartum or congenitally) transmitted infections; numbers represent the %. 97 . Thus, we believe that a correct and complete counselling should be given to families in order to allow a well-informed choice. This should factor in the benefits of mother-neonate bonding, the risk of neonatal infection, their usually (but not exclusively) benign outcome and the higher maternal contagiousness during the symptomatic period 98 . If rooming-in is chosen, appropriate hygiene advice and personal protective equipment should be given, as these may significantly reduce the risk of transmission 99 . Hygiene measures during mother-neonate contact were described inconsistently and only in a minority of articles 23, 24, 34, 39, 64, 67, 75 , and, given the differences in guidelines worldwide 97 , dedicated studies are warranted to understand what would be the ideal equipment and policy to be applied.",

However, not all these NICU-admitted babies may have actually needed critical care and this is not possible to be extrapolated with this type of analysis. The NICU-admission may be influenced by many factors such as local setting, logistics, and isolation policy, since the NICU could represent the only area to isolate infected babies and guidelines are extremely dissimilar between different countries and settings 97 .

Although the quality of the reviewed reports is intermediate, we should remember that uncontrolled case descriptions and their synthesis are at the bottom of the evidence pyramid 103 . As this is a meta-analysis of mainly case series, the rating of the quality of evidence is 4, according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine classification (https://www.cebm.net/2009/06/oxford-centre-evidence-basedmedicine-levels-evidence-march-2009/). However, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidelines admit the decision-making process based on lowquality evidence in some particular circumstances 104 and the pandemic surely represents an extraordinary situation. The classification system for diagnosing maternal, fetal, and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections may be cumbersome, as it requires consideration of clinical data and of the results of several virological tests 16 : the relatively low number of confirmed infections may be due to the difficulty in obtaining the virological tests in various samples (placenta, amniotic fluid, blood, swabs). However, this represents the best way so far to correctly identify these infections for epidemiological and clinical purposes and it should be promoted. Furthermore, the classification may be adjusted, and a case can be re-classified, if its likelihood of infection changes, as more information becomes available. Similarly, the availability of new diagnostic tests may lead to changes in the diagnostic criteria. Only one case was diagnosed based on positive IgM and negative RT-PCR 29 , thus this is not likely to change the global results of our synthesis. We cannot exclude that some of the clinical features presented by the analyzed cases were due to other concomitant disorders, as this level of detail is not attainable with a synthesis of published reports; however, the analyzed data are coherent and consistent with those from older COVID-19 patients. We have almost no information on neonatal COVID-19 therapies, as these will require more experience and it is unclear if the neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection may have longterm consequences, as no follow-up studies have been performed so far. Finally, we also enrolled manuscripts posted on preprint server while waiting for peer review and final publication. This might introduce a bias as the quality and reliability of these papers can be suboptimal. However, we provided our own peer review applying rigorous criteria and a specific quality evaluation tool to every and each article 105,103 and we actually have only three reports as preprint. Moreover, the role of preprints during pandemics has been widely recognized as they facilitate the spread of vital information and a recent analysis focused on COVID-19 found the quality of preprint similar to that of final publications 106 .",

Approximately half of the infected neonates develop clinically apparent COVID-19, which is often characterized by febrile status, features similar to those of older patients and favorable outcomes. Mother-neonate roomingin is associated with a higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring after the first 72 h of life.",

No language restriction was applied: non-English publications were translated personally by the investigators or using the Google translation service. We excluded conference abstracts, any report of neonates exposed to but not infected by SARS-CoV-2 (according to the aforementioned criteria), articles describing only stillbirths or children aged more than 30 days and paper reporting hypotheses or opinions without any clinical data.
