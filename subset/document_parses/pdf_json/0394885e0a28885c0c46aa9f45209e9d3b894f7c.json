            "text": "In the moment of preparation of this paper, the world is still globally in grip of the Corona (COVID-19) crisis, and the need to understand the broader overall framework of the crisis increases. As in similar cases in the past, also with this one, the main interest is on the \"first response\". Fully appreciating the efforts of those risking their lives facing pandemics, this paper tries to identify the main elements of the larger, possibly global, framework, supported by international standards, needed to deal with new (emerging) risks resulting from threats like Corona and assess the resilience of systems affected. The paper proposes that future solutions should include a number of new elements, related to both risk and resilience. That should include broadening the scope of attention, currently focused onto preparation and response phases, to the phases of \"understanding risks\", including emerging risks, and transformation and adaptation. The paper suggests to use resilience indicators in this process. The proposed approach has been applied in different cases involving critical infrastructures in Europe (energy supply, water supply, transportation, etc., exposed to various threats), including the health system in Austria. The detailed, indicator-based, resilience analysis included mapping resilience, resilience stress-testing, visualization, etc., showing, already before the COVID-19, the resilience (stress-testing) limits of the infrastructures. A simpler (57 indicator based) analysis has, then been done for 11 countries (including Austria). The paper links these results with the options available in the area of policies, standards, guidelines and tools (such as the RiskRadar), with focus on interdependencies and global standards-especially the new ISO 31,050, linking emerging risks and resilience.",

More than any other crisis before, the Corona crisis comes as probably the most global one so far, not only in terms of geography. The crisis is unique also because it appears to be one of the first globally experienced emerging risks. Affecting resilience of the world and stress-testing the resilience of both the healthcare system and the society as a whole. Did it come as a surprise? Hardly. Despite the numerous preceding warnings and mentioning of new kind of pandemic risk in the WEF Global Risk Report starting as early as 2006, and the detailed OECD reports (2011a; b), preparedness level of almost all healthcare systems around the globe to fight a pandemic outbreak remained insufficient. The critical mix for a \"successful pandemic outbreak\" is a fast and efficient human to human transfer of the pathogen where, humans have little or no immunity against it, no vaccines currently exist and supply of antiviral drugs is insufficient or not existing. Most of these can now be seen during the current COVID-19 outbreak. In other words, the outbreak of COVID-19 is not a real surprise, the surprise is linked to its extremely high infection rate allowing a very fast worldwide progression. In the Global Risk Report of 2006 (written after the Avian Flu H5N1 Pandemic in 2003), it is mentioned that if the virus can no longer be contained and person to person infection were to become common place, \"the vulnerabilities of our interconnected global system would intensify the human and economic impact. The worldwide spread would be facilitated by global travel patterns and insufficient warning mechanisms. Short term economic impacts would include severe travel impairments, tourism and other service industries, as well as manufacturing and retail supply chains. Deep shifts in social, economic and political relations are possible\". What else could one have added? In its voluminous, almost 300 pages long report, OECD (2003, p. 31) has been forecasting this as follows:",

The report points out, that \"survival under a pandemic global shock clearly refers to taking every action to minimize morbidity and mortality as well as to minimize the effect of the pandemic on the economic, social and political stability of communities, nations and transnational organizations\". Furthermore, the authors argue, that the global shock to public health in the form of a pandemic is unique among global shocks in having profound positive and negative externalities and interdependencies. But being officially classified as pandemic by WHO, 1 would COVID-19 qualify as \"global shock\", too? Table 1 shows that it is clearly the case. But six months after the outbreak of COVID-19, it is rather understood and perceived as a \"global threat\" and the focus is on monitoring of the threat (e.g. Johns Hopkins 2 ), media focused on response measures and science unable to make reliable predictions, or even provide consistent explanations.",

Among these providers are 122 hospitals throughout the country and about 5000 primary care providers that provide services covered by the mandatory social insurance in Austria. The focus is on the General Hospital of Vienna, the largest hospital in Europe and employing about 9000 people and treating around 95,000 inpatients annually ( Fig. 9 ). The Austrian healthcare system is highly segmented with responsibilities being split up between various regional or national organizations in different health sectors. For instance, responsible for outpatient care in Austria are mostly more than 20 different social security institutions that have recently been restructured into only five institutions. In the inpatient sector, hospitals are managed by regional carrier organizations, next to some exceptions of hospitals that are managed directly by the Republic of Austria. From this fragmentation (presumably an issue in other countries, too) arises the challenge of harmonizing and integrating data from all of these institutions, which is necessary to give a comprehensive picture of the efficiency and resilience of healthcare in Austria. In practical terms, this means that there are databases that integrate these heterogeneous data sources. They include all relevant inpatient and outpatient services (which allows connecting activities in the health sector to other sectors, such as transportation). But, there is no real-time monitoring on a comprehensive, nation-wide scale of such activities and, therefore, no (non-)automatic adaptations to events observed in real time.",

As a consequence of these pressures, healthcare systems are constantly pushed towards operating at their maximal capacity, e.g. in terms of patients treated at hospitals and the occupancy of hospital beds. If the system is already close to its maximum capacity in the normal mode of operations, how will it react in the situations of severe shocks such as COVID-19? How resilient will the system be with respect to sudden and unexpected surges in patient numbers if waiting rooms in outpatient wards and doctor offices are already full?

The figure (a) shows for one selected provider its dependence relations to other providers as blue lines. The thickness of these blue lines gives estimates for how likely it is that services provided by the selected provider can be substituted by services from the linked providers (which is estimated from the data based on factors like geographic proximity, overlap in patients, type of services provided, etc.). A surge in the number of patients at this provider will overload its capacity and cause secondary effects for the other providers (b), where the levels of redness indicate how much of the initial shock each provider is expected to absorb. As a result, tertiary cascades might occur (c). This kind of assessment can either be done directly \"by hand\" in the healthcare assessment module developed within the project, or automatically for each doctor and district in Austria. A more detailed description of this stress test of a healthcare system can be found in Lo Sardo et al. (2019) . The approach is comparable to those applied to other critical infrastructures (e.g. transportation, Ganin (2017) or epidemic outbreaks (Massaro et al. 2018) ). For the inpatient setting, i.e. hospitals, we developed a different assessment module that is, however, based on the same functioning principles and the same indicators. As a concrete scenario here we consider an urban flooding event in Vienna. The initial event is a surge in the number of patients to be treated as an initial impact of the flood (in the current scenario, it was assumed that the subway system is flooded in the morning close to rush hour leading to the load of an entire subway train needing to be transported to the hospital). The assumed situation was further that the flood cuts off access to hospitals at the other side of the Danube, that only become accessible again later in the day, see also Fig. 11. ",

While a substantial amount of resources went into the exact formulation of these indicators, they have the advantage that they can easily be applied to all Austrian districts once their methodology has been fixed. In order to comprehensively quantify all relevant aspects of resilience as defined by the SmartResilience approach, these big data indicators where complemented with more conventional, \"supervised\" suitable indicators. Most of these indicators apply across all districts, as the healthcare infrastructure (in particular in the inpatient sector) is operated by a small set of carrier organizations. The most important regional variations however, such as healthcare coverage indicators, numbers of cases, number of available hospital beds, population density in affected areas and such are evaluated in an unsupervised way from big data sources. Only the results from one specific district (Vienna 9th district that contains the country's largest hospital, the General Hospital of Vienna), out of 122 evaluated districts are shown here (Fig. 14, 15 ). For the remaining districts, the assessment reports containing the data-driven indicators are available in the ResilienceTool. 5 A further study has been performed by Sardo et al. (2019) looking for the answer to the question, is there a point beyond which these pressures will severely impair the quality of care? Resilience captures how fast and the extent to which it is possible to deliver adequate healthcare services to the entire population in the wake of such an assumed shock (\"stress-test\"). The questions like the one above were, at the time of working at the study, the assumptions . They are linked if they share patients in the patient sharing network, a (black arrows). The colour represents their current capacity; green means that they have capacity, and red means that they can no longer accept new patients. b Doctor \"a\" retires at time step 1; his/ her patients are distributed to other doctors according to the weights of the links from \"a\" to \"b\" and from \"a\" to \"c\" (yellow arrows). This, in turn, changes the capacity of the other doctors. c As c has reached its capacity limit (red), he/she must send patients to other doctors (blue arrows from \"c\" to \"b\" and \"d\"). This creates a cascade of patient displacements of size 2 for hypothetical scenario, similar to the COVID-19 one. Although the assumptions for the stress-test were by far less severe than those of COVID-19, the results are showing quite a different picture than the one in Fig. 13. ",

In some areas in healthcare, paper-based record keeping is still the de facto standard, with digital data imputation only occurring as an afterthought in order to claim financial compensation from the social security institution. The consequence is a lack of real-time information on how the current \"load\" (numbers of patients at specific providers in a given region-a serious problem in COVID-19 pandemic) is distributed at any given time. Rather, one has to infer this knowledge in the simulations from historical data.

How many beds are right now free in department X within hospital Y? What is the waiting time for treatment Z in region U? While it is beyond doubt that such kind of information is vital to improve resilience of the healthcare system, it must at the same time be taken into account that healthcare data is highly sensitive and needs to be processed accordingly. It therefore requires a unique set of skills to be able to (i) appropriately handle the high-volume dynamic and sensitive data that healthcare systems produce and (ii) have the required domain knowledge to transform this data into actionable knowledge this can ultimately be used to improve population health. A new kind of institutional setup is therefore needed to simultaneously fulfil both needs, as current institutions either lack Fig. 11 Snapshot of the hospital assessment tool.

If these scenarios start to materialize more frequently, further development (maturation) might lead to the creation of interest groups leading to actions to clarify and/or prevent the emerging risk.

In the example of such a model calibrating the framework to data from 56 industrial sectors in 43 countries between 2000 and 2014 (Fig. 23) , it was possible to model the susceptibility of individual industrial sectors to economic shocks across countries, sectors, and time. In this work we proposed an analytic approach to compute the susceptibility of a given sector in a country to shocks from other countries and sectors. Predictions based on these susceptibilities outperformed thus, by far, standard macro-econometric time series models. They are analytically more rigorous, empirically more testable, and flexible enough to address even highly uncertain non-linear policy-relevant scenarios, as shown at the example of the impact of the, in 2019, imposed tariffs on US imports (steel and aluminium) on specific sectors across European countries. This clearly speaks for use of these methods also in the prediction of interdependencies (e.g. those among health, economy and society) in the prediction of the COVID-19 related recovery. In the same context, the recovery will obviously be part of the resilience cycle, involving the phases described in chapters 2 and 3. Applying the method described in chapter 3.2 and assuming the values of some of the (currently extremely volatile) indicators, one can model the scenarios and the interdependencies as shown in Fig. 24 and 25.

Based on the risk analysis and the risk dialogue capacity planning, on the community, canton and state level, as well as on a company /SME level, should be conducted. Thereby the threat of a pandemic spread is one of the biggest risks, but by far not the only risk, that requires preparation. Therefore, each of the disaster prevention plans should be aligned with Safety policy and strategy of the Swiss Government. In the case of COVID-19, it is apparent that the virus does not stop at national boarders and joint multinational efforts are needed to generate the necessary capacities to prepare and fight the virus. But, all disaster prevention measures come at a price. In this context, the returns on safety investments are hard to quantify and most often do not generate a return within a short time frame.

Risk enters every decision in life, but clearly some decisions need a structured approach and the more complex and uncertain the issues, the more an adaptive and comprehensive policy, framework and processes are required. Dealing with risk is part of governance and leadership. These considerations are at the heart of ISO 31,000, Risk management-Guidelines, which delivers a clearer, shorter and more concise guide that will help organizations use risk management principles to improve planning and make better decisions. In the standard, risk is defined as the \"effect of uncertainty on objectives\", which focuses on the effect of incomplete knowledge of events or circumstances on an organization's decision-making. This requires a change in the traditional understanding of risk, forcing organizations to tailor risk management to their needs and objectivesa key benefit of the standard. The framework supports all activities, including decision-making across all levels of the organization. The ISO 31000 framework and its processes should be integrated with governance, strategy and management systems to ensure consistency and the effectiveness (Steinbeis 2020) crisis management and security. All of which are relevant to responding to a pandemic. Resilience is built on understanding current and emerging risk and building the adaptive and responsive elements of the organization to deal with the risk one knows and anticipate, through a resilience strategy to address both the known and unknown \"Knowns\" and the known and unknown \"Unknown\". The application is supported by the methodologies available in IEC/ISO 31010 Risk Management-Risk assessment techniques, providing guidance on the selection and application of techniques for assessing risk in a wide range of situations.",

Some political disturbances were recorded, but no social unrest (possibly looming for the time of the economic ripple effect of the health crisis). The rather optimistic self-assessments of own performance were rather the rule then exception (see Annexes) and the expectations that the world will overcome the COVID-19 crises were high.
