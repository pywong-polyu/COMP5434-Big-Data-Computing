Health disparities have been exacerbated for marginalized populations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, similar to in past pandemics in both the U.S. and internationally [2] . Among marginalized populations, seasonal farmworkers in the U.S. have been particularly devastated by SARS-CoV-2 and are at increased risk for being infected [3] . Specifically, seasonal farmworkers, composed of individuals, and family members, who are \"employed in temporary farmwork but do not move from their permanent residence to seek farmwork\", often face health disparities related to their working status such as barriers to mental and physical health services (e.g., language, illiteracy), overcrowded working and living conditions that make transmission of the virus easier, and limited options for mental or physical healthcare in the event of getting sick and being unable to work [4] . In the United States, seasonal farmworkers are mainly male, Spanish-speaking, and Latinx. Additionally, this group suffers not only from physical health disparities, but also faces stressors that exacerbate mental health issues [5] .",

SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations among Latinxs, and especially among Latinx seasonal farmworkers, may be especially high due to unique testing, vaccination, and treatment barriers. Previously identified healthcare accessibility factors are language and cultural barriers, health illiteracy, lack of insurance, lack of finances, undocumented immigration status, immigration stress, fear of deportation, and worry of healthcare-related discrimination [7] [8] [9] . SARS-CoV-2 may amplify these disparities. Due to these factors, and in accordance with the Latinx cultural value of fatalism, the Latinx seasonal farmworker community may view SARS-CoV-2-related treatment at healthcare centers as an extreme last resort, as hospitalization is either equivalent to death or deportation.

The goal of this commentary is to outline challenges to pandemic tracking, treatment, and acceptance of vaccination among Latinx seasonal farmworkers and to explore how social network approaches have been successfully utilized among this community and may be tailored as a strategy to overcome the aforementioned challenges. The authors present this commentary for a global audience to consider how social networkbased approaches may have utility in developing health programs for marginalized groups during periods of hardship such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

Since that time, many Latinx seasonal farmworkers no longer live around their extended families. Most mothers no longer raise children with the children's fathers nor have other family members to help with childcare [12] . Since the closure of schools due to SARS-CoV-2, some children have been staying unsupervised at home, straining family finances to provide extra food and home-schooling supplies. Latinx parents may sometimes experience feelings of isolation due to the nature of seasonal work and immigration issues [13] . In addition to families, the church plays an important community role among Latinx seasonal farmworkers [13] . Connections made in church are important trusting relationships and for many seasonal farmworkers, the same people they work alongside in the fields and factories are the ones they sit beside at church, prayer meetings, or home bible study. The church is playing an important role in identifying and engaging families affected by SARS-CoV-2. This poses a unique exposure risk, considering how interconnected seasonal farmworkers are to one another. Despite changes in Latinx seasonal farmworker communities since Hurricane Andrew, families and friends are physically and emotionally tight knit, which makes practicing or enforcing social distancing a particular challenge. Some myths developing around SARS-CoV-2 in the community make treatment difficult. Due to the Latinx cultural value of fatalism, some families that have a member(s) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 may refuse to seek treatment for the fear that a hospitalization is equivalent to death.",

Some Latinx seasonal farmworkers have felt compelled to work even while showing SARS-CoV-2 symptoms because of fear of losing their jobs or because they cannot survive without the income. The fear of losing their job is especially strong when workers are supporting their families in the U.S. and their home countries. In the Latinx seasonal farmworker community, several families typically live in a single house and share bills to help pay the rent [13] . State and national financial-aid initiatives tend to be household-based, meaning that for families where household expenses are shared, applying for benefits means possibly having to share a small monetary check to offset needs between two or more families, if they qualify at all. Undocumented Latinx seasonal farmworkers do not qualify for unemployment benefits or food assistance, which makes taking time off work almost impossible. Many Latinx seasonal farmworkers do not own vehicles and are forced to carpool to work and elsewhere. Carpooling places workers in a vulnerable position by crowding them into small spaces for extended periods of time. Finally, some job sites in this community may not be following CDC-recommended safety protocols for their employees (e.g., hand sanitizer is not provided, social distancing is unenforced, and masks are optional and not provided).",

We found that legal and discrimination concerns are associated with increased at-risk drinking among women and emotional abuse with increase drug abuse among farmworkers. Drug abuse particularly might be associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination.

Using community-based participatory research approaches, we identified a community partner located in a Latinx seasonal working community in South Florida to implement the study. It is important that recruitment and intervention procedures for SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination programs incorporate Latinx cultural values such as personalismo and collectivism. The cultural value of personalismo refers to a preference for friendship with close individuals with similar sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., homophily), suggesting a preference for familiarity in these relationships [16] . Thus, personalismo was incorporated into our social network recruitment in a way that reflected the preference for holding conversations about sensitive topics, such as HIV prevention, only after establishing friendships based on trust, support, and empathy [17, 18] . Members from our community partner-identified twenty seed individuals, the \"Latinx leaders.\" Seeds were respected women in this community who had the ability to reach many peers. Recruitment procedures also incorporated the cultural value of collectivism. In Latinx communities, collectivism is a cultural orientation that values close, nurturing, and supportive interpersonal relationships over individualistic behaviors and attitudes. According to this orientation, a person is seen as part of a family and the broader community of friends and acquaintances and should accept responsibility for this role [19] . Consistent with collectivism, Latinx leader seeds can disseminate SARS-CoV-2 information within their social networks, so that underserved Latinxs in their community could support one another.",

The first-order friends were further asked to invite three of their own friends (i.e., second-order friends) [20] . As a result, for each seed, a network of 13 participants was recruited in three respondent-driven waves, with wave 1 including the seed, wave 2 including three first-order friends, and wave 3 including nine second-order friends. Seeds were asked to have all members of their social network contact the project coordinator. If any invited friend declined participation, the seed/friend was asked to invite a substitute friend until a social network of 13 participants was formed. We provided Latinx Leaders with additional instructions on how to promote interactions and conversations about HIV prevention within their friendship networks. The same approach can be used to promote SARS-CoV-2 information. These types of wordof-mouth recruitment strategies incorporating Latinx cultural values have been shown to work successfully in similar populations and settings [21] .",

To address this issue, the Florida Department of Health recruited public health students to support community contact tracing [24] . Because contact tracing is a time intensive endeavor for HCPs, social network mapping can assist HCPs with having a conversation about a patient's social circle, who needs to be contacted to limit further spread. Social network mapping can also identify social network members who should be contacted to disseminate SARS-CoV-2 information [25] . These methods have been successfully employed in previous projects that sought to increase HIV prevention activities, such as condom use and HIV prevention knowledge [26] .",

Regarding mental health and social networks, frameworks have been developed in other marginalized communities to show the interrelatedness between health beliefs, health education, and cultural appropriateness of health behavior [30] . One such model is the PEN-3 model, which has been used to identify elements of the social network that help or hinder reception of health information. Social network mapping can expand on models such as this, to identify the elements of social networks that promote mental health changes, and thereby can be strengthened with interventions that focus efforts on those elements [30, 31] .

However, homophily may also act as a confound in social network analyses when examining causal relationships within social networks [35] .",

Looking to the future, mental and public health researchers must also expand from this current pandemic to other stressful situations that may occur with marginalized populations globally, such as climate change and its effects on migration [29] . By combining the integration of cultural values with social network approaches, we can understand how marginalized communities such as Latinx seasonal farmworkers function during a pandemic and investigate the potentially protective factors of community bonds that safeguard against difficult situations arising from events such as SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "This commentary documents SARS-CoV-2 healthcare disparities affecting the Latinx seasonal farmworkers community and discusses social network-based activities for future research and treatment approaches. Latinx seasonal farmworkers may avoid seeking SARS-COV-2 testing and treatment due to determinants that include their living conditions, transportation, mental health, and substance use disorders. Local efforts to provide protection from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic to such vulnerable populations should be undertaken. Like HIV, SARS-CoV-2 is heavily stigmatized, resulting in a lack of discussion, the promotion of misinformation, and a lack of knowledge regarding healthcare options. In this commentary, we presented a social network approach that has been successful in engaging Latinx seasonal farmworkers for HIV prevention: why reinvent the wheel for SARS-CoV-2? Instead, we believe that social network approaches can highly engage underserved communities for SARS-CoV-2 interventions and understand the mental health implications that result from the stressors and situations caused by the pandemic. Once these maps of social networks are developed for a community, there is more research to be undertaken to analyze the directionality of the relationships within these networks and how they are affected during a pandemic or other large scale stressful events. With regards to SARS-CoV-2, members of the group may face stigma for trying to encourage others to get vaccinated or may not feel that they have the social status in a network to be taken seriously regarding health decisions or information; these types of questions can be answered by a combination of social network mapping and qualitative data to provide context on these social connections [36] . Social network mapping may explain how key persons influence the health of the social structure, and when pandemics affect these persons negatively, the resilience of the social networks in which they reside is also negatively impacted.
