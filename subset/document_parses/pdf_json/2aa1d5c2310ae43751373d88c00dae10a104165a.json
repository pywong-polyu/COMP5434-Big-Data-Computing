Interestingly, Creel-Bulos et al. reported the development of ACP in patients with severe forms of COVID-19 (Creel-Bulos et al., 2020) . It has also been suggested that alterations in the coagulation process and augmented levels of D-dimer are important attributes of the form of pneumonia that develops in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Tang et al., 2020) . Recent study has also revealed that tissue plasminogen activator can be used as a treatment in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS and provides some some initial and transient improvements .

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities that predominantly involved the lower lobes. The patient was obese and suffering from arterial hypertension. He was receiving a range og treatments, including oral enalapril, atenolol and rosuvastatin. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by the positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab.",

CT pulmonary angiograms and bilateral lower limb Doppler scans did not show any signs of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, enoxaparin (prophylactic dose), and tocilizumab (800 mg intravenously). Furthermore, we treated the patient with off-label recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA; approved by the local medical multidisciplinary consilium). rtPA was applied at a dose of 25 mg over a period of two hours; then, 25 mg of rtPA was infused over the next 22 h . During rtPA treatment, the body temperature of the patient was stable (approximately 37 C). Blood glucose levels were measured several times each day. On the day of the rtPA administration, and thereafter, the blood glucose levels were in the range of 5.2-6.9 mmol/L. Following rtPA treatment, there was a strong reduction in SPAP, hypercapnia, alveolar dead space, and ventilatory ratio, and a slight increase in static compliance (Table 1 ). In addition, there were improvements in the oxygenation status of the patient (Table 1) . Interestingly, rtPA treatment also resulted in the reduction of various parameters in the blood, including ferritin and several markers of liver status, tissue damage, and inflammation (Table 1) . Unfortunately, the patient passed away on 14 th May 2020 due to ventilator-associated pneumonia and septic shock (Acinetobacter baumannii).",

A markedly reduced level of fibrinolysis plays an important role in the hypercoagulable state and thromboembolic risk in patients with COVID-19 (Kruse et al., 2020) . This process may underline the possible use of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. Recent publications suggested the application of rtPA as a potential treatment option for patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS Orfanos et al., 2020) . Our COVID-19 patient developed ACP and had high values of ferritin, C-reactive protein, hypercapnia, and alveolar dead space; all of these parameters were reduced after rtPA treatment. In the line with our findings, Papamichalis et al. reported reduced levels of ferritin and C-reactive protein following the administration of rtPA and tocilizumab (Papamichalis et al., 2020) . Hypercapnia has also been linked with the development of ACP and is thought to represent one of the factors responsible for vasoconstriction and the augmentation of pulmonary arterial pressure (Jardin and Vieillard-Baron, 2009; Biswas, 2016; Boissier et al., 2013) . Furthermore, in our patient, rtPA treatment resulted in the reduction of ventilatory ratio and an improvement in oxygenation status; this concurs with another article that was published recently (Price et al., 2020) .",

The respiratory pathophysiology of COVID-19 is very complex; it has been suggested that inflammatory diffuse micro-thrombosis contributes to severe hypoxemia (Ackermann et al., 2020; Vasques et al., 2020) . In cases of ARDS that are associated with COVID-19, it is possible that severe microthrombosis may be viewed as a unique phenotype that is characterized by elevated D-dimers levels, an increased fraction of dead space, hypercapnia, and pulmonary hypertension. Importantly, the patient described in our study had certain comorbidities, including obesity and hypertension. Therefore, one may ask whether the effects of rtPA could have been more prominent if the patient did not have such comorbidities. Future studies should focus on this interesting question and attempt to reveal the beneficial effects of rtPA in patients with different health conditions.",
