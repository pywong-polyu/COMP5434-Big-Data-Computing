            "text": "Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infections present the most severe health burden among viral liver diseases. As a satellite virus of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), transmission takes place via co-infection with HBV or super-infection of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Persisting infection leads to the establishment of chronic hepatitis D (CHD), which significantly increases the risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and acute liver failure, leading to a reduced life expectancy [1] [2] [3] [4] . HDV is a circular, single-stranded, negativesense RNA virus composed of 1679 nucleotides that codes for two isoforms of a single protein called the hepatitis delta antigen (large: L-HDAg, small: S-HDAg) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . For viral entry into hepatocytes, HDV requires the integration of the Hepatitis B virus S-antigen (HBsAg) into its envelope [10] [11] [12] . Antibodies against HDAg (anti-HDV), including IgM and IgG, are not neutralizing but arise in most infected patients [13, 14] . Up until recently, HDV therapy was limited to treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha, a regimen with some efficacy but a rare long-term virological response [15, 16] . Vaccination against HBV also protects against HDV co-infection, but not against HDV super-infection of HBV carriers. Furthermore, vaccination coverage gaps remain worldwide [17] .",

            "text": "The symptoms for HDV co-or super-infection are comparable to HBV mono-infection and can easily be missed. Therefore, international guidelines recommend follow-up testing for HDV in HBsAg-positive individuals with CHB during their first assessment [18, 19] . The direct detection of HDV in blood is performed via qRT-PCR, but the genetic diversity of HDV can lead to false negatives [20] . Recently, a consensus commercial kit has been described [21] . As PCR testing only detects patients with active HDV RNA replication, which can be suppressed during therapy, more robust and cost-efficient serological tests for anti-HDV are used for screening purposes [22] . Worldwide, 250 million people are estimated to be HBsAg-positive and are eligible for HDV diagnostics [17] . However, several studies suggest that only a fraction of these patients are tested for anti-HDV, such that HDV infection remains largely underdiagnosed. Retrospective analyses in developed countries revealed low clinical testing rates of 8% in the US [23] , 35% in Greece [24] , 40% in the UK [25] , and 47% in Germany [26] . In many developing countries, HBsAg-patients are not tested for HDV at all [27, 28] . Reasons for these trends are diverse and may vary across countries with different medical systems and infrastructures. In general, the awareness of HDV is poor compared to other hepatitis viruses, such as HBV or HCV. This applies to both developed and developing countries and may partly be related to the lack of curative therapy in the past. As several promising antiviral drugs are currently being evaluated in advanced phases of clinical trials [29] [30] [31] , or were recently approved (Bulevirtide), this may soon change. Insufficient testing rates may also be linked to the extensive requirements of the current mode of testing. Conventional anti-HDV detection assays are ELISA-, RIA-, or CLIA-based. These tests require time-consuming experimental protocols performed in a specialized laboratory environment with expensive equipment and trained medical staff [32] .

The rL-HDAg was derived from a consensus sequence of 54 published and non-published HDAg sequences to achieve pan-genotypic activity. It codes for a 25 kDa His-tagged protein with an isoelectric point of 9.9. All known functional elements and post-translational modification sites of the viral HDAg were maintained ( Figure 1A ). The chemically synthesized sequence was expressed in E. coli, and the rL-HDAg was purified via affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions ( Figure 1B ). Using Coomassie staining and Western blotting, we confirmed that the rL-HDAg protein is highly pure and does not contain any protein contaminations, besides two C-terminally truncated isoforms of rL-HDAg that have lost the His-tag ( Figure 1C,D) . To test the antigenicity of the novel rL-HDAg, we performed a semi-quantitative ELISA using anti-HDV-negative and -positive patient sera at high and low titers ( Figure 1E ). In a proof-of-principle experiment, we show that rL-HDAg binds to serum anti-HDV in a concentration-dependent manner and does not cross-react with anti-HDV-negative patient serum. Therefore, we conclude that the novel rL-HDAg is suitable for detecting anti-HDV in serum or plasma samples.",

In this assay, rL-HDAg is spotted as a test line on the membrane and binds to anti-HDV in the tested patient sample. As anti-HDV is previously labeled with gold-conjugated goat anti-human IgG present in the conjugate pad, a red test line appears for visual detection. On the control line, immobilized anti-goat binds to the gold-conjugates in a sample-independent manner, serving as an internal control for the test. The flow of the patient sample through the test strip is ensured by capillary forces and takes 5-20 min. For proof-of-principle experiments, the rapid test strips were assembled into plastic cassettes and anti-HDV-positive andnegative patient sera were applied ( Figure 2B ). We show that the novel HDV rapid test can effectively detect anti-HDV in patient serum and does not cross-react with negative serum. Strikingly, test positivity was maintained for a 1:10 and 1:100 dilution of the positive serum, indicating that the test is highly sensitive. To evaluate this in more detail, we complemented anti-HDV-negative patient serum with humanized mouse anti-HDAg mAb. We found that the minimum concentration resulting in a positive HDV rapid test result was 1.5 \u00b5g/mL, equivalent to 15 ng monoclonal antibody per test (data not shown). ",

The samples were previously tested positive (332 samples) or negative (142 samples) for anti-HDV using a commercially available diagnostic ELISA. We re-tested all samples using our novel HDV rapid test ( Figure 3B ). Out of 332 anti-HDV-positive patient samples in the diagnostic ELISA, 314 samples were also positive in the HDV rapid test, while 18 samples were negative. This corresponds to a sensitivity of 94.6% (95% CI: 91.6-96.5%). Furthermore, we found the specificity to be 100% (95% CI: 97.4-100%), as all 142 anti-HDV-negative samples in the diagnostic ELISA were also negative in the HDV rapid test. No cross-reaction with HBsAg was observed. To understand the performance of the HDV rapid test in more detail, we semiquantified the anti-HDV titers in all patient samples using an in-house ELISA and compared them to the results of the diagnostic ELISA and the HDV rapid test ( Figure 3C ). Interestingly, all samples that tested negative in the HDV rapid test but positive in the diagnostic ELISA had very low anti-HDV titers that were comparable to the unspecific binding signals in the 142 negative controls. Furthermore, all ambiguous samples were never confirmed to be HDV RNA-positive but had either an unknown HDV RNA status (17 samples) or were HDV RNA-negative (one sample). We also saw that HDV RNA-positive samples generally displayed high titers of anti-HDV, while the HDV RNA-negative samples were subdivided into three cohorts with either high, medium, or low anti-HDV titers. Our results indicate that the HDV rapid test can successfully identify positive samples with a broad range of anti-HDV levels but does not react to samples with low ELISA signals in the negative control range. It currently remains unclear whether these samples are true positives that are missed by our HDV rapid test or false positives of the diagnostic ELISA.",

To test the pan-genotypic activity, we collected sera or plasmas from patients with known HDV genotype 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, or 8 infections. By re-testing these samples for anti-HDV using the HDV rapid test, we confirmed that the test is reactive to all HDV genotypes ( Figure 4A ). Unfortunately, a genotype 4 sample was not available for testing. We already showed that anti-HDV can be successfully detected in the lateral flow assay format of our HDV rapid test. As HDV can only occur together with HBV, we were interested in testing whether the detection of HBsAg and anti-HDV can be multiplexed in our assay. Therefore, we added a second HBsAg test line to the test strip containing immobilized mouse anti-HBsAg mAb. Strikingly, this set-up was able to independently detect anti-HDV and HBsAg in pre-characterized patient samples ( Figure 4B ). This proofof-principle experiment shows that the HDV rapid test can easily be multiplexed with the detection of HBsAg to generate a one-step test to distinguish HBV mono-from HBV-HDV co-infection.",

However, international HDV testing guidelines are insufficiently followed, possibly due to a lack of awareness and costly, time-consuming diagnostic procedures requiring specialized equipment and training. Here, we developed a rapid HDV test for the detection of anti-HDV in serum or plasma within 20 min. The test is based on an easy-to-use and cost-effective lateral flow assay that can be applied in decentralized settings and regions with poor medical infrastructure [26] . Therefore, it can broaden the access to reliable HDV diagnostics worldwide and ease the burden of this life-threatening disease. The clinical relevance of LFA-based antibody tests was highlighted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, when conventional routine lab testing was overloaded and not available in multiple settings and regions.",

This is of especially high relevance in regions like Africa, Asia, and South America, where strains of almost all HDV genotypes are spreading. Interestingly, antigen-antibody binding on the rapid test was possible despite using denatured rL-HDAg. This is in agreement with previous studies which found that large segments of the HDAg protein sequence are intrinsically disordered but maintain the ability to form protein-protein interactions [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

On the other hand, ELISAs are more prone to lower specificity due to unspecific binding signals. In this study, we provide a comprehensive performance evaluation of the HDV rapid test compared to a diagnostic ELISA using a cohort of 474 pre-characterized samples. As expected, we found that the LFA has a higher specificity (100% vs. 99.0%) but a lower sensitivity (94.6% vs. 99.4%) compared to the diagnostic ELISA used. However, when evaluating the samples with non-corresponding test results in more detail, we found that they had very low anti-HDV ELISA signals closely resembling the included negative controls. Furthermore, these samples had not tested positive for HDV RNA to confirm HDV infection. Therefore, it currently remains unclear whether the observed differences were due to false negative test results of the HDV rapid test, or whether these samples were wrongfully considered positive by the diagnostic ELISA. To increase the objectivity and readability of LFA tests, their read-out can be automated by digital instruments. These hand-held or benchtop devices measure the colorimetric change on the test and control lines and generate a semi-quantitative test result. Such technology can assist medical professionals in their daily diagnostic routine, or operators of epidemiological studies.",

HDV hotspots were recorded in Mongolia, the Amazon basin, and the Mediterranean basin, as well as in some countries in Africa and western Asia [27, 28] . However, recent meta-analyses highlighted that for many countries the HDV prevalence remains entirely unknown, is insufficiently mapped, or only represents specific regions or risk-groups. While one meta-analysis study concluded that the HDV prevalence may be highly underestimated [27] , another study supported the WHO numbers [28] . Hence, the true HDV prevalence remains to be elucidated and may depend significantly on future epidemiological studies in countries that have previously lacked access to HDV diagnostics.",
