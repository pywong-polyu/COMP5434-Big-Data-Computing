We showed conditions necessitating the existence of the endemic equilibrium point and showed that the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable. We also tested the stability of our solution using the iterative Laplace transform method on our model which was also shown stable agreeing with the disease-free equilibrium. Conclusions: Numerical simulations of our model showed clear comparison with our analytical results. The numerical solutions show that given fractional operator like the Caputo-Fabrizio operator, it is less noisy and hence plays a major role in making a precise decision and gives room or opportunity ('freedom') to use data of specific patients as the model can be easily adjusted to accommodate this, as it a better fit for the patients' data and provide meaningful predictions. Finally, the result showed the advantage of using fractional order derivative in the analysis of the dynamics of HIV/AIDS over the classical case.",

            "text": "Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) is a lentivirus that attacks cells in the human immune system. It is known that the immune system is a shield in our body that is aimed at defending man from been easily affected by illness. The virus on entrance into the body system damages the white blood cell (T-helper cell), and replicates itself inside the white blood cells, making it difficult for it to be destroyed. This leads to the reduction of the T-helper cells which recognizes infected cells and thereby making room for the virus to cause permanent damage to the immune system. HIV can be transmitted through body fluid that includes (i) blood (ii) breast milk (iii) semen (iv) vagina and (v) rectal fluids (Cai et al., 2009 ). The number of viruses in human blood is what determines the stage of the disease. Most times, these stages are meant to conform to the CD4+ T-cell count ranges. In a complete person, the CD4+ counts are between 500 to 1500 per cubic millimeter and once this count is 200 per cubic millimeter or less than that, there is a high degree likelihood that the HIV patient is said to have fully developed into AIDS (Stoddart and Reyes, 2006) . AIDS has now become a global epidemic since the first incidence case as reported in 1981 . Reports show that over 75 million people in the world are now living with HIV infection, another 37.9 million people are currently been infected and another 32 million people all over the world have been reported dead due to AIDS as of 2018 (Bushnaq et al., 2018; Taneco-Hernandez et al., 2020) . If an individual infected with HIV remains untreated, such person's progress to AIDS within a decade from its infection period and the life expectancy is about three years after been diagnosed. This is not a lifeline, because some individuals tend to develop several opportunistic illnesses and such as limiting their survival within this period. However, treatment with antiretroviral can prevent AIDS from developing. In fact, worldwide, it is estimated that 3-4 million death were prevented in 2018 as there was an improved medication assisted treatment (MAT) to HIV/AIDS (WHO/UNAIDS, 2005).",

In their model, they assumed there will be a change of behavior by the treated HIV patients and thereby reducing their levels of exposure to the disease. Bachar and Dorfmayr (Bachar and Dorfmayr, 2004) show that treating individuals without reducing some of their dangerous conduct adds to the rise in the population of infected individuals.",

But it is evident that many challenges that abound in different field of learning such as engineering, sciences, finance, economics, and in particular epidemiology can be better understood and analyzed by using fractional order differential equations (FDEs) (Khan et al., 2020; Area et al., 2015; Farman et al., 2018) . One of the properties of fractional-order models that stand it out from the integer-order is their nonlocal property which considers that what determines the future prediction of a model is not just a function of its current state, but it also depends on the historical antecedents of such models. This can be attributed to its ability to consider derivatives and integrals of arbitrary order (real and complex). Facts and truths in recent research are now better enhanced with the help of developing a fractional-order model, which makes it a way to go in developing and discussing both infectious diseases and other areas that deals with dynamical systems ( (Diethelm, 2010) , the Caputo-Fabrizio derivative (May and Anderson, 1987) , and the Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative (Atangana, 2018) are that the Atagana-Baleanu fractional derivative is defined using a Mittag-Leffler law, the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative is defined using an exponential decay law and the Caputo fractional derivative is defined using a power law. Various problems confronting man and nature have been addressed by computing an appropriate model, especially if these problems are dynamic. Most of these problems today are infectious diseases.",

This implies that with fractional derivative, the effect of the disease on the susceptible class can be seen earlier than that of the classical case. From Figure 2 which is the infected asymptomatic individuals, it can be seen that the effect of the disease in the population is noticed earlier in the fractional case when compared to the classical case, as we can infer from the graph. In the infected symptomatic case, which is from Figure 3 , there is decrease in the population of infectious symptomatic individuals as the equilibrium point and converges to non-zero for integer and non-integer value of . These relations are also evident in Figure 4 respectively. From our figures, it is seen that HIV/AIDS begins to manifest earlier than reported in previous studies, but from our study it is seen that HIV/AIDS can be detected earlier using our model and method of analysis. This is helpful as earlier detection of this disease helps the individual in controlling and managing the disease to avoid escalating to a more horrendous level. It is also seen that as the fractional order ascends from to , the population of HIV/AIDS infected humans becomes asymptotically zero. The result of our simulation also agrees with the analysis of Cai, et al (Cai et al., 2009 ) which is the classical case of our model as it is seen that when we get the same result as in Cai, et al (Cai et al., 2009 ) on their variation of the different variables. There is little difference in the two, which can be attributed to the different initial conditions chosen by the different authors, but our result validates the previous work done by (Cai et al., 2009 ) and shows that the use of fractional order derivative gives a quicker or faster evidence of the impact of HIV/AIDS on humans. Also, our study has been able to show and agree with the work of Cai et al. (Cai et al., 2009 ) that to reduce HIV/AIDS we need to reduce the reproduction number (R0) to be less than unity, so with our study early detection is guaranteed and this will enable epidemiologist to design better control strategies to limit rate of interaction between infected humans and uninfected humans and other possible preventive measures.",

This shows that taken a given fractional operator like the Caputo-Fabrizio operator, it is less noisy and has a role in making a precise decision and thereby create opportunity ('freedom') to rewrite the model as to reflect data of specific patients, as it a better fit for the patients' data. Meanwhile, the hybrid characteristic of Caputo-Fabrizio is adequate to enable the complex model and provide meaningful predictions. Epidemiologically, this means that with fractional operator, the disease will not become epidemic before its detected and relevant studies carried out to mitigate the disease. Also, it will pose less challenge to health practitioners in combating the disease. Our model does not consider control strategies for combating HIV/AIDS, but to show the advantage of using fractional order derivative in the analysis of the dynamics of HIV/AIDS over the classical case.",

The fractional derivative of fractional order has been taken in the Caputo-Fabrizio sense which is a non-singular kernel. Further, by applying fixed point theory and an iterative method, the existence, uniqueness of the system of solutions for the model has been investigated and shown. The equilibrium points of the model were determined and the conditions for which the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable was also shown. An iterative Laplace transform method is used in obtaining numerical solutions of the fractional order system. We used the values of data used by (Cai et al., 2009) , to create a good relationship with their former work done in the classical term. This work does not take care of prevention and control of HIV/AIDS but is looking at which possible and effective method in studying the dynamics of HIV/AIDS to give significant predictions of infection. Our simulations have helped in making a good comparison between the classical method and the fractional-order methods and given future epidemiologists a better and effective method in handling infectious disease epidemics.",

The past studies on infectious diseases and other related diseases have been studied using Riemann-Liouville fractional order derivative or the Caputo fractional order derivative, but these has been in recent times faulted where it shown that these derivatives pose a little challenge. Present studies have shown that at the end point of the interval where these models are defined their kernels have a singularity which creates discontinuity of the system at such point (Loh et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2020). As a result of these, many new definitions of fractional derivatives have now been proposed in the literature (Shah et al., 2020; Abdo et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2020; Toh et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Loh et al., 2018). The differences between different fractional derivatives are evident on the choice of kernels. The kernels are chosen such a way as to match with the required area of application. For instance, the main difference between the Caputo fractional derivative",
