Summary Background Data: The advisory of postponing or canceling elective surgeries escalated a worldwide debate regarding the safety and feasibility of performing elective surgical procedures during this pandemic. Limited data are available on gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/ asymptomatic COVID-19 undergoing surgery. Methods: Clinical data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Surgically resected specimens of the cases with confirmed COVID-19 were obtained to detect the expression of ACE2 and the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Results: A total of 52 patients (male, 34) with a median age 62.5 years were enrolled. All the patients presented no respiratory symptoms or abnormalities on chest computed tomography before surgery. Six patients (11.5%) experienced symptom onset and were confirmed to be COVID-19. All were identified to be preoperatively pre/asymptomatic, as 5 were with SARS-CoV-2 presenting in cytoplasm of enterocytes or macrophages from the colorectal tissues and 1 had symptom onset immediately after surgery. The case fatality rate in patients with COVID-19 was 16.7%, much higher than those without COVID-19 (2.2%). Conclusions: Gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 were at high risk of postoperative onset and death. At current pandemic, elective surgery should be postponed or canceled. It highlights the need for investigating the full clinical spectrum and natural history of this infection. The early colorectal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 may have major implications on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.",

As of April 24, 2020, there were 2,626,321 confirmed cases and 181,938 deaths. 2 With the improvement of the emergency situations in some areas, ramping up to prepare for elective surgeries is becoming the present focus for an increasing number of facilities. However, it has been shown that estimated asymptomatic proportion was as high as 33.3%, 3 and SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by asymptomatic individuals. 4 Most importantly, a considerable number of pre/asymptomatic patients showed no abnormal signs in laboratory or radiological tests. 5, 6 There were gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/ asymptomatic COVID-19 seeking surgical care during this pandemic, and it is foreseeable that there will be a significant number in postpandemic period. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the epidemiologic features and clinical course of those patients.",

Although there is still a lack of definite evidence, studies in SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) have proven that the human intestinal tract may serve as an alternative infection route for the virus. [15] [16] [17] These coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, exhibit a predisposition for infecting the respiratory systems, but other organs may also be involved. [18] [19] [20] [21] Recently, SARS-CoV-2 was reported to enter cells by using its spike protein bounding with ACE2 and bioinformatics analysis on available single-cell transcriptome data of normal gastrointestinal system revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. [22] [23] [24] Our conventional histologic studies did not find evidence of viral inclusions in the surgically resected specimens, fortunately but unfortunately, electron microscopy showed coronavirus-like particles in the cytoplasm or surface of enterocytes from 5 patients' appendix, colon or rectum. Diameter of the particles in this study ranged from 50 to 90 nm, somewhat smaller than a diameter of approximately 60 to 140 nm (average 100 nm) for SARS-CoV-2, 25 which may be due to the sample processing methods. Martines et al has found that SARS-CoV-2 particles measured in FFPE samples were smaller than those observed from fresh tissue. 26 Moreover, most particles shown in our study had uniform appearance viral particles with a membrane outer covering and dots inside indicating the nucleocapsid. 27 Most importantly, the immunofluorescence and fluorescence ISH confirmed considerable ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the enterocytes or macrophages. This is the first report to show the presence of active SARS-CoV-2 in the appendix, colon and rectum of individuals alive with COVID-19, which is in line with a recent study showing this virus productively infects human gut enterocytes. 28 Most importantly, colocalization of most SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 adds to the evidence of ACE2 as an entry receptor. Moreover, the histologic and virologic results in this study also showed that there was only minimal disruption of colon epithelial cells by the coronavirus, which may explain why some patients with evidence of the virus did not present with diarrhea. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the stomach of 1 patient with gastric cancer, which might be partially explained by low pH of gastric secretions. 29 Unlike the high fatality rates of the earlier epidemics of MERS (35%) and SARS (10%) caused by a similar coronavirus strain, it appears that COVID-19 has a relatively lower case fatality rate so far. 1, 30 However, because tumors, adjuvant therapy, or surgery can cause systemic immunosuppression, cancer patients undergoing surgery are particularly susceptible to various respiratory pathogens and pulmonary infections than individuals without cancer. 31, 32 In a study including 2007 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, patients with cancer showed a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and poorer outcomes than those without cancer. 33 On March 13, 2020, the American College of Surgeons announced a formal recommendation to minimize, postpone, or cancel elective surgeries. 34 Though the advisory escalated a worldwide debate regarding the safety and feasibility of performing elective surgical procedures during this pandemic, most surgeons from the world followed this recommendation. In the current study, the case fatality rate of gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 having undergone surgery is 16.7%, much higher than those without COVID-19. The worse short-term outcomes might be overstated due to small numbers of patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 in this study. The longterm outcomes are still unknown. Since both cancer and surgery can cause systemic immunosuppression, gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 are at high risk of postoperative onset and death. In the current pandemic, elective surgery should be postponed or canceled. Even during postpandemic period, repeated FIGURE 3. Multiplex immunofluorescence assay of 5 colorectal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19. Representative images of multiplex immunofluorescence assay showed positive signals for extensive expression of ACE2 (green) and coronavirus spike protein (red) in enterocytes or macrophages of appendix, colon, or rectum of the patients, and colocalization of ACE2 and spike (yellow, merge).

An extension of this line of work would be of great value in learning about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this clinical illness in cancer patients. Second, all patients in this study did not undergo preoperative nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 testing to exclude infection, as this test was not available in our hospital until January 21, 2020. Notably, most previous studies mainly focused on the more severe cases admitted to the hospital, and our clinical description pertains largely to relatively mild gastrointestinal cancer patients who experienced both virus infection and major surgery. This may add little information to the full clinical spectrum of emerging coronavirus infections.",

Last but not least, the colorectal tropism of the SARS-CoV-2 may have major implications on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease. Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19, surgeons and pathological specialists should not display a capacity of willful blindness that allowed the virus in surgical specimens to hide in plain sight, only in this way, we may potentially advance our medical knowledge of this disease and improve our clinical practice in future.",
