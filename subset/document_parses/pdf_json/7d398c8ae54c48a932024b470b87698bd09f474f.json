            "text": "The analysis of causation is a challenging task that can be approached in various ways. With the increasing use of machine learning based models in computational socioeconomics, explaining these models while taking causal connections into account is a necessity. In this work, we advocate the use of an explanatory framework from cooperative game theory augmented with do calculus, namely causal Shapley values. Using causal Shapley values, we analyze socioeconomic disparities that have a causal link to the spread of COVID-19 in the USA. We study several phases of the disease spread to show how the causal connections change over time. We perform a causal analysis using random effects models and discuss the correspondence between the two methods to verify our results. We show the distinct advantages a non-linear machine learning models have over linear models when performing a multivariate analysis, especially since the machine learning models can map out non-linear correlations in the data. In addition, the causal Shapley values allow for including the causal structure in the variable importance computed for the machine learning model.

This trend is a pattern that has been historically observed for several diseases caused by viruses like HIV [15] , MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, Ebola [16] [17] [18] etc. Even beyond variances in socioeconomic conditions, ethnicity is a contributing factor [19] [20] [21] [22] for disparities in healthcare.

This is particularly important since the demographic nature of various parts of the USA are different. In addition, the pattern of disease spread were also observed to vary in different parts of the USA. The states with higher densities were significantly affected in the first wave of the pandemic while the southern states were significantly affected by the second wave. The states on the west coast were affected throughout the extent of the pandemic. Demographically, the northeastern states have several urban areas that are closely clustered together. However, in the southern states the urban areas are spread far apart and a large fraction of the population lives in rural areas where the socioeconomic conditions are different from the urban areas. The states on the west coast are a mix of urban and rural areas with a very different economic structure. Hence, we will focus on three different clusters of states.",

[27] for causal Shapley values accounts for indirect effects in order to take the causal structure of the data into account in when estimating the Shapley values. The approach recognizes that it is not practical to compute interventional probabilities to account for indirect effects and instead proposes a causal chain graph The (partial) causal ordering in the data is represented as a causal chain graph by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A causal ordering (CO) is then a nested list that maps to a sequence of the respective causal orderings of the socioeconomic metrics. Variables of equivalent causal importance are grouped into the same sub-list within the list. For example, [NW, [SC, Emp] ] would represent non-white as the most significant cause which influences the next set of variables, here Senior Citizen and Employed, each with equal importance 1 . More intuitively, the causal ordering depends on a hypothesis of how the socioeconomic metrics form subgroups that are causally connected.

In such dense areas, there is likely to be shorter commutes and better transit due to these areas being more populous [40, 41] . This causal ordering has the proportion of senior citizens causing the proportion of non-whites. Since senior citizens are less likely to be non-white, a higher fraction of senior citizens causes there to be a lower proportion of non-whites [42] . This causal ordering also has income per capita, the proportion of people in a county working in professions classified as Labor, unemployment, and employment on equal footing. This is the case since manual labor jobs are less temporary and pay lower wages [43] . Evidently, the decision on which causal ordering to choose is quite subjective and requires some prior knowledge of how the various metrics interact with each other. In the case of the problem we are addressing, the causal ordering can even change from region to region depending on the nature of the underlying socioeconomic fabric that governs the social structure. Thus it is important to check how robust the conclusion of our work is vis-\u00e0-vis a perturbation in the causal ordering. Ideally, the Shapley Index, S I 2 , should depend not only on the data but also on the causal ordering. However, S I should not be agnostic of either the data or the causal ordering since, after all, S I should encapsulate the information from the causal ordering and the data.",

The metrics that are less causally connected to the confirmed case rate, however, show large variation. Nevertheless, there is a clear distinction between the three most important ones and the less important ones. This result shows that while S I does depend on the causal ordering, the most important metrics are tied to the information that is gleaned from the data.

It was the second wave in mid-2020 that affected the parts that were spared by the first wave with vast majority of the southern states seeing a surge in the number of infected individual. So a study of socioeconomic conditions that might have affected the differential advent of COVID-19 across the social strata should include the months from February 2020 to July 2020. We shall refer to this as Phase I of our study. Consequently, we shall deem Phase II as the next phase of the disease spread from July 2020 to January 2021 keeping it safely before when vaccinations could possibly have any effects.

From the correlations in the plots being distinct for each region, one can expect the causal connections between the variables should be different too. This is indeed confirmed by the bar plots, the columns corresponding to the different regions and the rows corresponding to the different causal ordering. A very clear pattern emerges independent of the causal ordering. In the East Coast region during Phase I, the primary causation is driven by the fraction of non-white population, the mean commute and the population density. While the fraction of non-white population has by far the largest causal connection with the confirmed case rates, the mean commute and density variables interchange positions depending on the causal ordering used.

To begin with, we perform the White test and Breusch-Pagan test to detect the presence of heteroscedasticity. For each of the six datasets (three regions and two phases) we get a p-value < 0.05 from both the tests which leads us to reject the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity and we conclude that heteroscedasticity is present in the residual of this empirical model specification. Furthermore, we perform the Durbin-Watson test for auto-correlation and get test results of < 1 for all datasets leading us to the conclusion that there are significant positive auto-correlations in the datasets. Therefore, we need to use a random effect model with clustered standard error at the county level. These clustered standard errors allow for the presence of heteroscedasticity and correlation in the error term within a cluster. A fixed effect model cannot be used given the socioeconomic metrics do not change over the times during which the COVID-19 prevalence data is collected. The random effect model estimates the effects of time-invariant socioeconomic metrics as presented in the data collected from the US Census Bureau. We build the model with only a subset of the socioeconomic metrics that we consider in the previous analysis since highly correlated metrics cannot be used to fit a linear random effect model. Hence we chose four of the metrics that are not highly correlated and perform the analysis so as to reasonably compare it with the results obtained from the machine learning framework.",

These results highlight two implications of the causal analyses. Firstly, the initial health care policy intervention of some of the US states and the federal government seem to have helped in reducing the differential in the spread of the pandemic from what was seen at the initial stage and was disproportionately affecting the more vulnerable. Secondly, socioeconomic metrics prove to be important in shaping the possible policy interventions to control the spread of the pandemic.",

The lack of interpretability is, in fact, a major hurdle in the use of machine learning in computational socioeconomics.

Our use of an ensemble of BDTs, instead of other non-linear machine learning models, is motivated by the ease of computation of Shapley values from BDTs using available software packages and should not be taken as a limitation of the causal analysis we propose on a choice of the machine learning models that can possibly be used. The causal Shapley values we calculate are based on the hypotheses about the causal connections between the exogenous variables which are represented by causal chain graphs built on assumptions of the partial causal orderings between the variables. We have tested several hypotheses of these causal orderings to ascertain the robustness of the analysis framework and its dependence on such hypotheses.",

The extraction of causal Shapley values from these regression models allow us to infer on the causal connections between the socioeconomic metrics and the prevalence of COVID-19 at the county level.

We also include factors that relate to the mobility such as the mean commute time in any county along with the fraction of the population that uses a transit system 3 . We also include the fraction of senior citizen in a county which can also affect the mobility patterns in the county. For example, a population with a lower median age will, on an average, have higher mobility than a population with a much higher median age. Since studies have already shown that COVID-19 tends to affect the elderly preferentially, the fraction of a population that fall into the senior citizen category (over 65 years of age) is a good measure of quantifying both the mobility and the degree to which age plays a role in determining the spread of COVID-19. To account for professions that put individuals at higher risk of exposure to a larger number of people such as those in service industry, construction, delivery, labor etc., which increases their chance of being infected by COVID-19, we employ a metric that quantifies the fraction of the population that work in these industries per county.

This allows us to not assume a functional form for the model but rely on the data alone. We emphasize here that we are not trying to build a predictive model using machine learning but rather to perform regression in a model-agnostic manner. We use XGBoost [46] , a scalable end-to-end boosting system for decision trees that is particularly suitable for sparse data. For data augmentation we use an ensemble of BDTs as weak learners trained on random selections of the sample with replacement split 70/30 into training and testing sets. This also gives us a stable measure of the accuracy with which we can model the data. We use the coefficient of determination, R 2 , calculated from the test sample set aside for each BDT, as our regression accuracy measure and estimate the error of estimating R 2 from the ensemble. It is normal for weak learners to differ in their predictions (it is a consequence of bagging within the ensemble). The prediction of an ensemble of weak learners is taken as the average in a regression problem. The accuracy of the ensemble is represented by the mean R 2 .",

To test whether assuming the presence of confounding variables change the results of our analysis we performed all the analysis for the confirmed case rate (two phases, three regions and six causal ordering) assuming the presence of confounding variables in all the groups. The results of our analysis is shown in Figure S1 and Figure S2 . It can be seen that assuming the presence of confounding variables do not change the final result of the analysis at all. Hence, we can say with confidence that we safely ignore the presence of confounding variables. That being said, one can argue that variables like the average level of education in a county are highly correlated with several of the socioeconomic metrics that we consider and maybe it can replace one of the metrics that we consider here. However, since we test the causal connections between the variables under a certain hypothesis represented by the directed acyclic graphs, studying the details of all possible hypothesis is beyond the scope of our work and we would like to motivate future works to consider a different set of variable to understand better, what the true causations in the real-world are.",

To give some more possible scenarios for the causal dependence withing the socioeconomic metrics we propose three more causal ordering. We will try to motivate them here and provide the results in the figures that follow ]. This causal ordering builds upon the first causal ordering CO#1, except that the proportion of senior citizens is no longer on equal footing as unemployment and employed, but moved up in the causal chain. This causal ordering takes into account the fact that senior citizens who are looking for employment may not be able to find employment due to a skills mismatch with the required skills today and senior citizens may be structurally unemployed [1, 2] . ]. This causal ordering has income per capita, the proportion of a county working in construction, service, delivery or production, unemployment, employed, and the proportion of senior citizens on equal footing. The rationale here is that income per capita and the proportion of a county working in construction, service, delivery or production are on equal footing with unemployment and employment since construction, service, delivery, or production jobs are (a) more likely to be temporary (b) pay low wages and counties with people working in those job profiles tend to have fewer permanent jobs and a higher unemployment rate due to the decline of manufacturing in the last half century [3] . ]. This causal ordering has the proportion of senior citizens causing the proportion of non-whites, and is otherwise the same as the first causal ordering CO#1. Since senior citizens are less likely to be non-white, a higher fraction of senior citizens causes there to be a lower proportion of non-whites [4] . The results obtained by assuming these causal ordering between the socioeconomic metrics can be found in Figure S3 and Figure S4 . The results from these causal orderings are quite similar to the ones obtained from the CO#1, CO#2 and CO#3, pointing to the same sets of variables as the most causally connected ones in Phase I. In Phase II we see the diminished impact of the socioeconomic metrics in all regions except for the west coast states.",

There seems to be a higher causal connected between a larger set of socioeconomic metrics and death rates in Phase I. The top three causations are Density, Non-White and Mean Commute for the East Coast region irrespective of the causal ordering assumed. For the West Coast region the Senior Citizen metric seems to almost always appear on the top. For the Southern States region, Non-White and Density are always the top two causations. In Phase II the causal connection are significantly diluted between the exogenous and endogenous variables in all regions except that we still see some causal connection between Senior Citizen and death rates in the West Coast region and as always it is anti-correlated pointing to the fact that the death rates are higher in the counties in which the fraction of senior citizen is lower and the overall population is younger.
