            "text": "A fundamental challenge in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) eradication is to understand how the virus establishes latency, maintains stable cellular reservoirs, and promotes rebound upon interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) in HIV latency and reactivation. We show that reactivation of HIV is associated with downregulation of the key H 2 S producing enzyme cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CTH) and reduction in endogenous H 2 S. Genetic silencing of CTH disrupts redox homeostasis, impairs mitochondrial function, and remodels the transcriptome of latent cells to trigger HIV reactivation. Chemical complementation of CTH activity using a slow-releasing H 2 S donor, GYY4137, suppressed HIV reactivation and diminished virus replication. Mechanistically, GYY4137 blocked HIV reactivation by inducing the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, inhibiting NF-\u03baB, and recruiting the epigenetic silencer, YY1, to the HIV promoter. In latently infected CD4 + T cells from ART-suppressed human subjects, GYY4137 in combination with ART prevented viral rebound and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, prolonged exposure to GYY4137 exhibited no adverse influence on proviral content or CD4 + T cell subsets, indicating that diminished viral rebound is due to a loss of transcription rather than a selective loss of infected cells. In summary, this work provides mechanistic insight into H 2 S-mediated suppression of viral rebound and suggests exploration of H 2 S donors to maintain HIV in a latent form.",

Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), the persistence of latent but replication-competent HIV in cellular reservoirs is a major barrier to cure (Finzi et al., 1997; Sengupta and Siliciano, 2018; Cohn et al., 2020) . Understanding host factors and signaling pathways underlying HIV latency and rebound upon cessation of ART is of the highest importance in the search for an HIV cure (Deeks et al., 2016; Collins et al., 2020) . Host-generated gaseous signaling molecules such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) modulate antimicrobial activity, inflammatory response, and metabolism of immune cells to influence bacterial and viral infections (Chinta et al., 2016; Pal et al., 2018; Tinajero-Trejo et al., 2013; Rahman et al., 2020; Shiloh et al., 2008; Braverman and Stanley, 2017) . Surprisingly, while circumstantial evidence links NO and CO with HIV-1 infection (Blond et al., 2000; Devadas and Dhawan, 2006; Liu et al., 2016) , the role of H 2 S remained completely unexplored.",

            "text": "H 2 S is primarily synthesized in mammals, including humans, via the reverse transsulfuration pathway using methionine and cysteine metabolizing enzymes cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE/ CTH), cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), and cysteine-aminotransferase (CAT)-3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), respectively (Pal et al., 2018) . Because H 2 S is lipophilic, it rapidly permeates through biological membranes without membrane channels (lipid bilayer permeability, P M \u22650.5\u00b10.4 cm/s), dissociates into HSand S 2in aqueous solution, and maintains an HS -:H 2 S ratio of 3:1 at physiological pH (Pal et al., 2018) . Interestingly, expression and enzymatic activity of CTH was diminished in human CD8 + T cells and hepatic tissues derived from AIDS patients, respectively (Hyrcza et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2001) . Additionally, the levels of H 2 S precursors L-cysteine and methionine were severely limited in AIDS patients (Hortin et al., 1994) . Also, HIV infection reduces the major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) (Staal et al., 1992) , whose production is dependent on L-cysteine and H 2 S (Kimura et al., 2010; McBean, 2012) . Consequently, supplementation with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), which is an exogenous source of L-cysteine, has been proposed for AIDS treatment (Roederer et al., 1993) . Since functional CBS and CTH enzymes are known to promote T cell activation and proliferation (Miller et al., 2012) , endogenous levels of H 2 S can potentiate T cellbased immunity against HIV. Therefore, we think that the endogenous levels and biochemical activity of H 2 S, which critically depends upon the cysteine and transsulfuration pathway (Mathai et al., 2009) , are likely to be important determinants of HIV infection.",

In contrast, supraphysiological concentrations of H 2 S exert cytotoxicity by inhibiting OXPHOS, promoting inflammation, and inducing redox imbalance (Pal et al., 2018; Modis et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2012) . These H 2 S-specific physiological changes are also crucial for HIV-1 infection. First, chronic inflammation contributes to HIV-1 pathogenesis by affecting innate and adaptive immune responses (Deeks et al., 2013) , impairing recovery of CD4 + T cells post-ART (Nakanjako et al., 2011) , increasing the risk of comorbidities (Leng and Margolick, 2015; Alzahrani et al., 2019) , and worsening organ function (Tattevin et al., 2007) . Second, HIV-1 preferentially infects CD4 + T cells with high OXPHOS (Valle-Casuso et al., 2019) , relies on glycolysis for continuous replication (Hegedus et al., 2014) , and reactivates in response to altered mitochondrial bioenergetics (Tyagi et al., 2020) . Third, a higher capacity to resist oxidative stress promotes virus latency, whereas increased oxidative stress levels induce reactivation (Bhaskar et al., 2015; Savarino et al., 2009; Shytaj et al., 2020) . Fourth, H 2 S directly (via S-linked sulfhydration) or indirectly modulates the activity of transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1 (Sen et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2016) that are well known to trigger HIV-1 reactivation from latency (Williams et al., 2007; Brooks et al., 2003; Duverger et al., 2013) . Finally, the thioredoxin/ thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR) system crucial for maintaining HIV-1 reservoirs (Chirullo et al., 2013) has been shown to regulate H 2 S-mediated S-persulfidation (D\u00f3ka et al., 2016) . Altogether, many physiological processes vital for HIV-1 pathogenesis overlap with the underlying mechanism of H 2 Smediated signaling.",

To test this hypothesis, we utilized cell line-based models of HIV-1 latency and CD4 + T cells of HIV-1 infected patients on suppressive ART, which harbors the latent but replication-competent virus. Biochemical and genetic approaches were exploited to investigate the link between H 2 S and HIV-1 latency. Finally, we used NanoString gene expression technology, oxidant-specific fluorescent dyes, and real-time extracellular flux analysis to examine the role of H 2 S in mediating HIV-1 persistence by regulating gene expression, redox signaling, and mitochondrial bioenergetics.",

The U1 and J1.1/J-Lat cell lines are well-studied models of post-integration latency and were derived from chronically infected clones of a promonocytic (U937) and a T-lymphoid (Jurkat) cell line, respectively (Folks et al., 1987; Perez et al., 1991; Jordan et al., 2003) . Both U1 and J1.1/J-Lat show very low basal expression of the HIV-1 genome, which can be induced by several latency reversal agents (LRAs) such as PMA, TNF-\u03b1, and prostratin ( Figure 1B ; Folks et al., 1987; Perez et al., 1991; Jordan et al., 2003) . First, we confirmed virus reactivation by measuring HIV-1 gag transcript in U1 with a low concentration of PMA (5 ng/ml). Treatment of PMA induces detectable expression of gag at 12 hr, which continued to increase for the entire 36 hr duration of the experiment ( Figure 1C ). Next, we assessed the mRNA and protein levels of CBS, CTH, and MPST in U1 during virus latency (untreated) and reactivation (PMA-treated). The mRNA and protein expression levels of CTH showed a significant reduction at 24 and 36 hr post-PMA treatment as compared to the untreated control, whereas the expression of CBS was not detected and MPST remained unaffected ( Figure 1D-E) . As an uninfected control, we measured the expression of CBS, CTH, and MPST in U937 cells. In contrast to U1, PMA treatment stimulated the mRNA and protein levels of CTH in U937 ( Figure 1F -G), while CBS was barely detectable. Also, we directly measured endogenous H 2 S levels using a fluorescent probe 7-azido-4-methylcoumarin (AzMc) that quantitatively detects H 2 S in living cells (Chen et al., 2013) . Consistent with the expression data, reactivation of HIV-1 by PMA reduced H 2 S generation in U1, whereas H 2 S levels were significantly increased by PMA in the uninfected U937 ( Figure 1H -I).",

            "text": "Our results suggest that H 2 S biogenesis via CTH is associated with HIV-1 latency. Therefore, we next asked whether CTH-derived H 2 S regulates the reactivation of HIV-1 from latency. To test this idea, we depleted endogenous CTH levels in U1 using RNA interference (RNAi). The short hairpin RNA specific for CTH (U1-shCTH) silenced the expression of CTH mRNA and protein by 90% as compared to non-targeting shRNA (U1-shNT) (Figure 2A-B and Supplementary file 1a) . Moreover, using AzMC probe, we confirmed the reduction in endogenous H 2 S levels in U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1A-B ). In addition to H 2 S production, CTH catalyzes the last step in the reverse transsulfuration pathway to generate cysteine. However, levels of cysteine remain comparable in U1-shCTH and U1-shNT ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1C) , indicating that other routes for cysteine biosynthesis (e.g., de novo and assimilatory pathways) compensate for CTH depletion in U1. Next, we investigated the effect of H 2 S depletion via CTH suppression on HIV-1 latency by measuring viral transcription (gag transcript), translation (HIV-1 p24 capsid protein), and release (HIV-1 p24 abundance in the cell supernatant). We found that the low basal expression of HIV-1 gag in U1-shCTH was stimulated by 16-fold upon depletion of CTH (p=0.0018) ( Figure 2C) . Furthermore, while PMA induced expression of gag transcript by 73-fold in U1-shNT, a further enhancement to 200-fold was observed in U1-shCTH ( Figure 2C ). Consistent with this, levels of p24 capsid protein inside cells or We also depleted CTH levels in J1.1 cells using RNAi and monitored HIV-1 reactivation by assessing intracellular p24 levels under basal conditions. The depletion of CTH triggered HIV-1 reactivation from latency as evident from a sevenfold increase in p24 levels as compared to shNT (Figure 2-figure supplement 1E). A minor increase in p24 levels (3.8-fold) was also apparent upon the depletion of CBS in J1.1 (Figure 2-figure supplement 1E) . Finally, and consistent with U1 and J1.1, genetic silencing of CTH using a CTH specific shRNA or chemical inhibition by propargylglycine (PAG) reactivated HIV-1 in J-Lat cells (Figure 2-figure supplement 1F-I) . These data indicate that CTH and likely CTH-derived H 2 S supports latency and impede the reactivation of HIV-1.",

            "text": "The above results indicate that CTH is a target controlling HIV-1 reactivation from latency, prompting us to investigate the mechanism. Several pathways that induce HIV-1 reactivation from latency are also influenced by H 2 S. These include redox signaling (Banerjee, 2011) , NF-\u03baB pathway (Gao et al., 2012) , inflammatory response (Bhatia, 2012) , and mitochondrial bioenergetics (Szabo et al., 2014) . Hence, we conducted a focused expression profiling of 185 human genes intrinsically linked to HIV-1 reactivation using the NanoString nCounter Technology (see Supplementary file 1b for the gene list) to measure absolute amounts of multiple transcripts without reverse transcription. Because depletion of CTH promoted reactivation of the HIV-1 in U1, we compared the expression profile of U1-shCTH with U1-shNT to further understand the link between H 2 S biogenesis and HIV-1 latency. Examination of 84 genes related to oxidative stress response revealed differential regulation of 22 genes in U1-shCTH compared with U1-shNT ( Figure 2F and Supplementary file 1c). Interestingly, more than 90% of genes showing altered expression were downregulated in U1-shCTH. Of these, genes encoding key cellular antioxidant enzymes and buffers such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD1), peroxiredoxin family, thioredoxin family (TXN, TXNRD1 and TXNRD2), sulfiredoxin (SRXN1), glutathione metabolism (GCLM, GSS, and GSR), and sulfur metabolism (MPST, AHCY, and MAT2A) were significantly less expressed in U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT ( Figure 2F ). Further, while MPST was downregulated upon CTH knock-down, CBS remained undetectable in U1-shCTH and U1-shNT ( Figure 2F ). Since oxidative stress elicits HIV-1 reactivation (Bhaskar et al., 2015) , these findings indicate that HIV-1 reactivation through CTH depletion could be a consequence of an altered redox balance. Further, pathways involved in promoting HIV-1 reactivation, such as NF-\u03baB signaling (Williams et al., 2007) and apoptosis , were also induced in U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT ( Figure 2F) . Notably, multiple HIV-1 restriction factors are important for viral latency including type I interferon signaling (IRF2 and STAT-1) (Sgarbanti et al., 2002; Nguyen et al., 2018) , APOBEC3G (Gillick et al., 2013) , CDK9-CCNT1 ( Amini et al., 2002; Budhiraja et al., 2013) , SLP-1 changes in the expression of CTH, CBS, and MPST at mRNA and protein level in U937 cells with or without PMA treatment.

(H, I) U1 and U937 cells were treated with 5 ng/ml PMA for 24 hr or left untreated, stained with AzMC for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and images were acquired using Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (H).

HIV-1 proteins are known to target mitochondria to induce mitochondrial depolarization, elevate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis for replication (Badley et al., 2003) . Several genes involved in sustaining mitochondrial function and membrane potential (e.g., BAX, UCP2, LHPP, and MPV17) were repressed in U1-shCTH ( Figure 2F ), highlighting a potential association between unrestricted virus replication, mitochondrial dysfunction, and CTH depletion. Since PMA is known to reactivate HIV-1 (Pardons et al., 2019b) , we examined the gene expression in U1-shNT upon reactivation of HIV-1 by PMA. We found that 80% of genes affected by the depletion of CTH were similarly perturbed in response to PMA. Signature of transcripts associated with oxidative stress response, sulfur metabolism, anti-viral factors, and mitochondrial function was comparable in U1-shCTH and PMA-treated U1-shNT ( Figure 2F ). Based on these similarities, we hypothesized that combining PMA with CTH depletion would have an additive effect on the expression of genes linked to HIV-1 reactivation. Indeed, exposure of U1-shCTH to PMA induced gene expression changes, which surpassed those produced by PMA treatment or CTH-depletion alone ( Figure 2F) . Notably, significant expression changes in U1-shCTH upon PMA treatment are consistent with our data showing maximal HIV-1 activation under these conditions (see Figure 2C ). Overall, these results indicate that CTH contributes to HIV-1 latency by modulating multiple pathways coordinating cellular homeostasis (e.g., redox balance and mitochondrial function) and the anti-viral response.",

On this basis, we reasoned that the depletion of CTH could contribute to redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction, both of which are known to promote HIV-1 reactivation (Tyagi et al., 2020; Bhaskar et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2021) . We first measured total glutathione content (GSH+GSSG) and GSSG concentration in U1-shNT and U1-shCTH using chemical-enzymatic analysis of whole-cell extract (Bhaskar et al., 2015) . Whole-cell glutathione content was not significantly different in U1-shNT and U1-shCTH (p=0.2801) ( Figure 3A) . However, the GSSG concentration was elevated in U1-shCTH resulting in a concomitant decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio of U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT (p=0.0032) ( Figure 3A) . The increased GSSG pool and reduced GSH/GSSG poise confirm that cells are experiencing oxidative stress upon CTH depletion. We measured total ROS using a fluorescent probe, 5,6-chloromethyl-2\u2032, 7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H 2 DCFDA), which non-specifically responds to any type of ROS within the cells. Both U1-shNT and U1-shCTH showed comparable levels of cytoplasmic ROS (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A) , which remained unchanged after stimulation with PMA. In addition to cytoplasmic ROS, we also measured mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) using the red fluorescent dye MitoSOX, which selectively stains mitoROS. Lowering the levels of CTH severely increased mitoROS in U1, which was further accentuated after PMA stimulation ( Figure 3B ). We then studied the effect of CTH depletion on mitochondrial functions using a Seahorse XF Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent) as described previously by us ( Figure 3C ; Tyagi et al., 2020; Szabo et al., 2014) . Both basal and ATPcoupled respiration was significantly decreased in U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT ( Figure 3D -E), consistent with the role of endogenous H 2 S in reducing cytochrome C oxidase for respiration (Szabo et al., 2014) . The maximal respiratory capacity, attained by the dissipation of the mitochondrial proton gradient with the uncoupler FCCP, was markedly diminished in U1-shCTH ( Figure 3E ). The maximal respiration also facilitated the estimation of the spare respiratory capacity (SRC), which was nearly Source data 1. This file contains the source data used to generate Figure 2B .",

            "text": "Having shown that diminished levels of endogenous H 2 S are associated with redox imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactivation of HIV-1 from latency, we next examined if elevating H 2 S levels using a small-molecule H 2 S donor-GYY4137 sustains HIV-1 latency. The GYY4137 is a widely used H 2 S donor that releases a low amount of H 2 S over a prolonged period to mimic physiological production (Li et al., 2008) . Because H 2 S discharge is unusually sluggish by GYY4137, the final concentration of H 2 S released is likely to be significantly lower than the initial concentration of GYY4137. We confirmed this by measuring H 2 S release in U1 cells treated with low (0.3 mM) or high (5 mM) concentrations of GYY4137 using methylene blue colorimetric assay. As a control, we treated U1 cells with 0.3 mM NaHS, which rapidly releases a high amount of H 2 S. As expected, NaHS treatment rapidly released 90% of H 2 S within 5 min of treatment ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, GYY4137 uniformly released a low amount of H 2 S for the entire 120 hr duration of the experiment ( Figure 4A ). We systematically tested the effect of GYY4137 on HIV-1 reactivation using multiple models of HIV-1 latency and replication. As a control, we used N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) that is known to block HIV-1 reactivation (Roederer et al., 1990) . Pretreatment of U1 with a non-toxic dose of GYY4137 Figure 4B ). The effect of GYY4137 on p24 levels in the supernatant was even more striking as it completely abolished the time-dependent increase in p24 concentration post-PMA treatment ( Figure 4C ). As expected, pretreatment with NAC similarly prevented PMA-triggered reactivation of HIV-1 in U1 ( Figure 4C ). Pretreatment of U1 with spent GYY4137, which comprises the decomposed backbone, showed no effect on PMA induced gag transcript (Figure 4-figure supplement 1B). Because TNF-\u03b1 is a physiologically relevant cytokine that reactivates HIV-1 from latency (Folks et al., 1987) , we tested the effect of GYY4137 on TNF-\u03b1-mediated virus reactivation. Treatment of U1 with TNF-\u03b1 stimulated the expression of gag transcript by 42-fold and 169-fold at 24 and 48 hr, post-treatment, respectively ( Figure 4D ). The addition of GYY4137 or NAC nearly abolished the reactivation of HIV-1 in response to TNF-\u03b1 treatment ( Figure 4D ). Earlier, we showed that depletion of CTH stimulated HIV-1 reactivation in U1 (see Figure 2C ). Therefore, we tested if GYY4137 could complement this genetic deficiency and subvert HIV-1 reactivation. The U1-shCTH cells were pre-treated with 5 mM GYY4137 and p24 levels in the supernatant were measured. The elevated levels of p24 in U1-shCTH were reduced by twofold under basal conditions and 3.2-fold upon PMA stimulation in response to GYY4137 ( Figure 4E ). Both RNAi and chemical complementation data provide evidence that H 2 S is one of the factors regulating HIV-1 latency and reactivation in U1.",

Consistent with the role of PMA-mediated oxidative stress in preceding HIV-1 reactivation (Bhaskar et al., 2015) , expression of genes encoding ROS, and RNS generating enzymes (e.g., NADPH oxidase [NCF1 and CYBB] and Nitric oxide synthase [NOS2]) were upregulated ( Figure 5A) . Also, the expression of major antioxidant enzymes (e.g., GPXs, PRDXs, and CAT) and redox buffers (GSH and TRX pathways) remained repressed in U1-PMA, indicative of elevated oxidative stress. Additionally, pro-inflammatory signatures (e.g., TGFB1 and SERPINA1) and trans-activators (e.g., FOS) were induced, whereas host factors involved in HIV-1 restriction (e.g., IRF1 and YY1) were repressed in U1-PMA as compared to U1. In agreement with the reduction in endogenous H 2 S levels during HIV-1 reactivation, expression of CTH involved in H 2 S anabolism was downregulated and H 2 S catabolism (SQRDL) was upregulated by PMA.",

For example, GYY4137 elicited a robust induction of genes regulated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in U1-GYY+PMA compared to U1 or U1-PMA ( Figure 5A ). Nrf2 acts as a master regulator of redox metabolism (Pall and Levine, 2015) by binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and initiating transcription of major antioxidant genes (e.g., GSH pathway, TXNRD1, HMOX1, GPX4, and SRXN1). Interestingly, while the expression of Nrf2-dependent CTH gene was induced in U1-GYY+PMA, MPST remained unaffected.

We tested if the mechanism of H 2 S-mediated subversion of HIV-1 reactivation involves these pathways. H 2 S has recently been shown to prevent cellular senescence by activation of Nrf2 via S-persulfidation of its negative regulator Keap-1 (Yang et al., 2013) . Under unstimulated conditions, Nrf2 binds to Keap1, and the latter promotes Nrf2 degradation via the proteasomal machinery (Yang et al., 2013) . Nrf2 disassociates from the S-persulfidated form of Keap1, accumulates in the cytoplasm, and translocates to nuclei where it induces transcription of antioxidant genes upon oxidative stress (Yang et al., 2013) . We first examined if GYY4137 treatment accumulates Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. As expected, Nrf2 was not detected in U1 owing to its association with Keap1 under unstimulated conditions. However, a noticeable accumulation of Nrf2 was observed in U1-GYY+PMA compared to U1 or U1-PMA ( Figure 5B) . As an additional verification, we quantified the levels of an Nrf2-dependent protein HMOX-1. Similar to Nrf2, the levels of HMOX-1 were also induced in U1-GYY+PMA ( Figure 5B ). These findings are consistent with our NanoString data showing activation of Nrf2-specific oxidative stress responsive genes in GYY4137 treated U1.",

The cellular level of phosphorylated serine-536 in p65, a major subunit of NF-\u03baB, is commonly measured to assess NF-\u03baB activation (Zhong et al., 1998) . Since PMA reactivates HIV-1, we observed an increase in p65 ser-536 phosphorylation in U1-PMA ( Figure 5C ). In contrast, pretreatment with GYY4137 significantly decreased PMA-induced p65 ser-536 phosphorylation ( Figure 5C ). These findings suggest that GYY4137 is likely to affect the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB. Consistent with this idea, a two-step chromatin immunoprecipitation and values of >1.5 and p<0.05 were considered as significantly altered. (B) Total cell lysates were used to analyze the expression levels of Nrf2 and HMOX1 by immunoblotting. Results were quantified by densitometric analysis of Nrf2 and HMOX1 band intensities and normalized to GAPDH. (C) U1 cells were pretreated with 5 mM GYY4137 for 6 hr and then stimulated with 30 ng/ml PMA for 4 hr or left unstimulated. Cells were harvested to prepare total cell lysate. Levels of phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 (Ser536), NF-\u03baB p65, and YY1 were determined by immunoblotting. Results were quantified by densitometric analysis for each blot and were normalized to GAPDH. (D) Schematic depiction of the binding sites for NF-\u03baB (p65-p50 heterodimer) and YY1 on HIV-1 5\u00b4-LTR. Highlighted arrow in red indicates the regions targeted for genomic qPCR; ER site for NF-\u03baB, and RBEI and RBEIII sites for YY1 enrichments, respectively. (E, F) U1 cells were pretreated with 5 mM GYY4137 for 6 hr, stimulated with PMA (30 ng/ml) for 4 hr, fixed with formaldehyde, and lysed. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for p65 and YY1 and protein-DNA complexes were purified using protein-G magnetic beads. The enrichment of NF-\u03baB p65 and YY1 on HIV-1 LTR was assessed by qPCR for designated regions using purified DNA as a template. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and data are representative of three independent experiments *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; ***, p<0.001; ****, p<0.0001; ns, non-significant, by two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test.

The occupancy of YY1 at RBEI and RBEIII was significantly enriched in the case of U1-GYY+PMA as compared to U1-PMA or U1 ( Figure 5F ).

We used a previously established methodology of maintaining CD4 + T cells from infected individuals on ART for a few weeks without any loss of phenotypic characteristics associated with HIV-1 reservoirs (Kessing et al., 2017) . We isolated CD4 + T cells from PBMCs of five HIV-1 infected subjects on suppressive ART. The CD4 + T cells were expanded in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and feeder cells ( Figure 6A ). The expanded cells were cultured for 4 weeks in a medium containing IL-2 with ART (100 nM efavirenz, 180 nM zidovudine, and 200 nM raltegravir) either in the presence or absence of GYY4137 (100 \u03bcM) ( Figure 6A ). In this model, the virus reactivates by day 14 followed by progressive suppression at day 21 and latency establishment by day 35. The virus can be reactivated from this latent phase using well-known LRAs (Kessing et al., 2017) . We quantified the temporal expression of viral RNA using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) periodically at 7-day interval. The levels of viral RNA increased initially (days 7-14), followed by low to undetectable levels by day 28 ( Figure 6B) . By day 28, virus RNA was uniformly untraceable in cells derived from GYY4137 treated and untreated groups, indicating the establishment of latency ( Figure 6B) .",

In contrast, upon ART+GYY4137 removal followed by prostratin stimulation, viral reactivation was attenuated by 90% (N=5, mean) for all five patient samples, and individual inhibition ranged from 78.9% to 100% ( Figure 6C) .

As expected, CD38 expression increased, and CD127 expression decreased at days 7 and 14 during the activation phase, followed by a gradual reversal of the pattern during the resting phase at days 21 and 28 ( Figure 6E -F and Figure 6-figure supplement 1A) . Interestingly, GYY4137 treatment did not alter the temporal changes in the expression of activation and quiescence markers on CD4 + T cells ( Figure 6E-F) . Since memory CD4 + T cells are preferentially targeted by HIV (Chomont et al., 2009; Brenchley et al., 2004) , we further analyzed if the status of naive (T N ), central memory (T CM ), transitional memory (T TM ), and effector memory (T EM ) is affected by the GYY4137 in our ex vivo expansion model. We observed that the CD4 + T cells that responded to ex vivo activation were mainly composed of T TM and T EM in our patient samples ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1B-E) . This is consistent with the study reporting the presence of translation-competent genomes mainly in the T TM and T EM of ART-suppressed individuals (Pardons et al., 2019a) . Interestingly, the fraction of T TM shows a progressive decline, whereas T EM displays gradual increase during transition from activation (7-14 days) to quiescence phase (21-28 days) ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1D-E) . The addition of GYY4137 did not affect dynamic changes in the frequency of T TM and T EM subpopulations ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1D-E) .",

As described earlier, CD4 + T cells harboring latent virus upon prolonged (28 days) treatment of ART and ART+GYY4137 were stimulated by prostratin or left unstimulated and subjected to mitochondrial flux analysis. The unstimulated cells from both ART and ART+GYY4147 cultures did not show any difference in OCR ( Figure 7A ). In contrast, several features reflecting efficient mitochondrial activity such as basal respiration and ATP-coupled respiration were significantly higher in prostratin stimulated CD4 + T cells in case of ART+GYY4137 treatment than ART alone ( Figure 7B-C) . Consistent with this, mitoROS generation upon stimulation with prostratin or other LRAs such as PMA/ionomycin was reduced in ART+GYY4137 treated CD4 + T cells than ART alone (p=0.005 and p=0.014), and was nearly comparable to unstimulated cells ( Figure 7D-E) . The reduction in mitoROS could be a consequence of GYY4137-mediated increase in the expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant systems. We directly tested this by RT-qPCR analysis of a selected set of Nrf2-dependent genes on CD4 + T cells treated with GYY4137 for 28 days. Consistent with our findings in U1, treatment with ART+ GYY4137 uniformly induced the expression of antioxidant genes in the latently infected CD4 + T cells compared to cell treated with ART alone ( Figure 7F) .",

Decreased H 2 S also impaired the expression of genes involved in the maintenance of redox balance, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and HIV-1 restriction, which correlates with reactivation of HIV-1. This conclusion is supported in multiple cell line models of HIV-1 latency. Chemical complementation with GYY4137 identified H 2 S as an effector molecule. Finally, we confirmed the clinical relevance of our finding in primary CD4 + T cells isolated from ART-suppressed patients to recapitulate features of HIV-1 latency and reactivation (Kessing et al., 2017) . Overall, our data show that while H 2 S deficiency reactivates HIV-1, the H 2 S donor GYY4137 can potently inhibit residual levels of HIV-1 transcription during suppressive ART and block virus reactivation upon stimulation. Hence, our findings highlight that H 2 S based therapies (Szab\u00f3, 2007) can be exploited to lock HIV-1 in a state of persistent latency by impairing the ability to reactivate.",

Several studies revealed that HIV-1 reactivation is associated with loss of mitochondrial functions, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis (Tyagi et al., 2020; Bhaskar et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2015; Badley et al., 2003) . Several of these biological dysfunctions are corrected by H 2 S. For example, localized delivery of H 2 S in physiological concentrations improves mitochondrial respiration, mitigates oxidative stress, and exerts antiinflammatory functions (Tinajero-Trejo et al., 2013; Kimura et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2012; Banerjee, 2011; Gao et al., 2012; Bhatia, 2012; Szabo et al., 2014; Szab\u00f3, 2007) . Our NanoString findings, XF flux analysis, and redox measurement support a mechanism whereby H 2 S sufficiency promotes sustenance of mitochondrial health and redox homeostasis to control HIV-1 reactivation.

It is widely known that reduced OXPHOS leads to accumulation of NADH, which traps flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in the reduced state on respiratory complex I leading to mitoROS generation by incomplete reduction of O 2 (Murphy, 2009) . Also, H 2 Sdepletion increased nmOCR, which indicates elevated activities of other ROS producing enzymes such as NADPH oxidase and cyclooxygenases/lipoxygenase (Kim et al., 2008; Chacko et al., 2014) . All of these metabolic changes are likely contributors of overwhelming ROS and disruption of GSH/ GSSG poise in U1-shCTH, resulting in HIV-1 reactivation. In fact, consistent with our findings, oxidative shift in GSH/GSSG poise, deregulated mitochondrial bioenergetics, and ROI has been reported to promote HIV-1 reactivation (Tyagi et al., 2020; Bhaskar et al., 2015) . The addition of GYY4137 stimulated OXPHOS and blocked HIV-1 reactivation, which is in line with the known ability of H 2 S in sustaining respiration by acting as a substrate of cytochrome C oxidase (CcO) (Szabo et al., 2014) . Also, H 2 S can prevent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (Hu et al., 2009) , which is crucial for HIV-1 reactivation and infection . Finally, activation of Nrf2-specific antioxidant pathways upon exposure to GYY4137 agrees with the potential of H 2 S in augmenting the cellular antioxidative defense machinery (Pal et al., 2018; Kimura et al., 2010; Banerjee, 2011) . Importantly, cell lines (U1 and J1.1) modeling HIV-1 latency and PBMCs of individuals that naturally suppress HIV-1 reactivation (long-term non-progressors [LTNPs]) display robust capacities to resist oxidative stress and apoptosis (Bhaskar et al., 2015; Cohen et al., 2004) .",

Interestingly, a sustained induction of Nrf2-driven cellular antioxidant response is essential for the successful transition between productive and latent HIV-1 infection (Bhaskar et al., 2015; Shytaj et al., 2020) . Moreover, inhibition of Nrf2 promoted viral transcription and increased ROS generation (Shytaj et al., 2020) , whereas its activation reduced HIV-1 infection (Furuya et al., 2016) . On this basis, we think that H 2 S-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 is partly related to the activation of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes. In HIV-1 infection, the suppression of viral reactivation and pro-inflammatory mediator expression was paralleled by the inhibition of NF-\u03baB. Interestingly, H 2 S inhibited activation of NF-\u03baB in several models of inflammatory diseases, including hemorrhagic shock, lung injury, and paramyxovirus infections (Cao et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015) . Further, recent studies have highlighted the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory role of H 2 S in SARS-CoV-2 infection and envisage the possibility of including H 2 S donors in COVID-19 therapy (Renieris et al., 2020; Citi et al., 2020; Pozzi et al., 2021) . Similarly to these findings, we found that exposure of U1 with GYY4137 inhibited the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit and reduced its binding to HIV-1 LTR. Currently, no antiretroviral drugs inhibit basal transcription of provirus and blocks reactivation upon therapy (ART) interruption. It has been suggested that epigenetic silencing will be an important prerequisite for persistent latency (Lange et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2015) . Our expression and ChIP-qPCR data suggest that H 2 S could exert its influence on HIV-1 replication machinery via activating YY1-an epigenetic silencer of HIV-1 LTR (Coull et al., 2000; Bernhard et al., 2013) . Interestingly, another gasotransmitter NO modulates YY1 function via S-nitrosylation of its cysteine residues (Bonavida and Baritaki, 2012) , indicating that YY1 is amenable to thiol-based-modifications and raises the possibility of YY1 S-persulfidation by H 2 S as a mechanism to epigenetically reconfigure HIV-1/promoter LTR.",

            "text": "The inefficiency of current ART in preventing virus rebound after therapy cessation poses a major hurdle to HIV-1 cure. Using a primary cell system that has been successfully used to recapitulate latency and reactivation seen in patients (Kessing et al., 2017) , we confirmed that pretreatment with GYY4137 attenuated viral rebound in primary human CD4 + T cells upon stimulation with prostratin. Collectively, our results suggest that H 2 S reduces HIV-1 transcriptional activity, promotes silencing of its promoter, and reduces its potential for reactivation. The virus-suppressing effects of H 2 S were observed alongside its beneficial consequences on cellular physiology (e.g., mitochondrial function and redox balance). Both mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are major complications associated with long-term exposure to ART and contribute to inflammation and organ damage (Ibeh and Emeka-Nwabunnia, 2012; Hulgan and Gerschenson, 2012; Reyskens et al., 2013) . Future studies will investigate if the prolonged treatment with H 2 S donors results in a better outcome due to recruitment of specific repressor and/or epigenetic silencer of HIV-1 LTR without detrimental consequences on cellular physiology. In this context, it is important to carefully calibrate the concentration of H 2 S donors. The higher concentration of H 2 S is associated with toxicity and side effects (Shen et al., 2015) , whereas lower micro molar concentrations are beneficial (Szabo et al., 2014) . The absorption and metabolism are reasonably well characterized for exogenously administered high doses of H 2 S (Reiffenstein and Roth, 1992; Beauchamp et al., 1984) . The sulfide oxidation pathways are involved in the oxidation of excess H 2 S to thiosulfate and sulfate, which are cleared from the body via the urine in free or conjugated form (Kage et al., 1997) . These observations will be important for exploring future possibilities to use H 2 S donors in clinical settings. Importantly, several H 2 S donors are currently being tested in phase 2 and phase 3 human clinical trials for other indications (Wallace et al., 2020; Polhemus et al., 2015) .",

Cells were pelleted down washed once with complete RPMI and used in the cell proliferation assay. CTV-labeled cells were seeded at a density of 0.5\u00d710 6 /well and stimulated with either 1.7 \u03bcg/ml CMVpp65 (JPT Technologies), anti-CD3/ anti-CD28 T cell activator beads at a bead:cell ratio of 0.25:1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 100 ng/ml SEB (Sigma-Aldrich). After 3 days, IL-2 (20 U/ml) supplemented medium was added to the cells and cultured for another 2 days. Proliferation was measured by CTV dilution after 5 days by flow cytometry. In some experiments, after 5 days of culture CTV-labeled cells were pelleted and stained with antibodies to CD3, CD4, and CD25 and CD25 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry.",
