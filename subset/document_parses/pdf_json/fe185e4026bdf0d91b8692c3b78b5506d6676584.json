Pathophysiologically, it would be difficult to explain why road traffic noise should lead to coronary heart disease, including myocardial infarction, but not to stroke, because they share basic pathogenetic processes. 7 This points toward a research gap for road traffic noise and stroke.",

In a large cohort study, they estimate 10-year time-weighted mean noise exposure for 3.6 million Danes aged >35 years, of whom 184 523 developed incident stroke during follow-up from 2000 to 2017. The authors take into account a large number of potential confounders, including individual and area-level socioeconomic status and air pollutants [particulate matter with a diameter <2.5 mm (PM 2.5 ) and NO 2 ]. As a main result, the authors find a clearly increased stroke risk for individuals exposed to traffic noise at their home address. The authors' description of a levelling off at approximately 62 dB for L den max and 52 dB for L den min is not entirely convincing; against this is the fact that S\u00f8rensen et al. 8 find the highest risk estimators in the highest road traffic noise categories. Moreover, the finding of considerably decreased stroke risks by railway noise in the study by S\u00f8rensen et al. 8 is not biologically plausible; here, potential bias should have been discussed as a possible explanation.",

Whereas the WHO Guidelines-based on the systematic review of van Kempen et al. 5 -find a risk increase of 8% per 10 dB for the association between road traffic noise and the incidence of ischaemic heart disease (pooling of seven cohort studies), S\u00f8rensen et al. 8 reveal a 4% (95% confidence interval 3% to 5%) increase of the stroke risk per 10 dB road traffic noise. In both studies, risk increase starts at noise pressure levels around 50 dB. According to the NORAH (Noise Related Annoyance, Cognition and Health) study on disease risks, cardiovascular risks might already be increased from noise levels of about 43 dB L DEN onwards. [12] [13] [14] [15] For railway noise, S\u00f8rensen et al. 8 cannot find elevated stroke risks, and our own research group could only determine very small stroke risk increases for aircraft noise in a recently published systematic review. 7 That does not necessarily mean that railroad noise and aircraft noise do not cause strokes. Instead, this may point toward an inadequate reflection of railroad noise and aircraft noise by average sound pressure levels. Whereas road traffic noise is usually fairly constant, railway and air traffic noise are characterized by fluctuations through recurring noise events. Maximum sound levels may be more appropriate.",
