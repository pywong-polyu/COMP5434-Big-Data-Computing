            "text": "The trend prediction of the stock is a main challenge. Accidental factors often lead to short-term sharp fluctuations in stock markets, deviating from the original normal trend. The shortterm fluctuation of stock price has high noise, which is not conducive to the prediction of stock trends. Therefore, we used discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based denoising to denoise stock data. Denoising the stock data assisted us to eliminate the influences of short-term random events on the continuous trend of the stock. The denoised data showed more stable trend characteristics and smoothness. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the effective training algorithms for fully connected single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), which possesses the advantages of fast convergence, unique results, and it does not converge to a local minimum. Therefore, this paper proposed a combination of ELM-and DWT-based denoising to predict the trend of stocks. The proposed method was used to predict the trend of 400 stocks in China. The prediction results of the proposed method are a good proof of the efficacy of DWT-based denoising for stock trends, and showed an excellent performance compared to 12 machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)).",

            "text": "In the era of big data, deep learning for predicting stock prices [1] and trends has become more popular [2, 3] . The fully-connected feedforward neural network (FNN) possesses excellent performance, and is superior to traditional time-series forecasting techniques (e.g., autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)) [4, 5] . The FNN is mainly trained using the well-known backpropagation (BP) algorithm [6] . The traditional BP algorithm essentially optimizes parameters based on the gradient descent method, accompanied by the problems of slow convergence and local minima. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the effective training algorithms for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). In ELM, hidden nodes are initialized randomly, and network parameters at the input end are fixed without iterative tuning. The only parameter that needs to be learned is the connection (or weight) matrix between the hidden layer and the output layer [7] . Theoretically, if hidden nodes are randomly generated, ELM maintains the general approximation capability of SLFNs [8] . Compared with the traditional FNN algorithm, the advantages of ELM in terms of efficiency and generalization performance have been proven on a wide range of issues in different fields [9] . The ELM possesses a faster learning and better generalization performance [10] [11] [12] than traditional gradientbased learning algorithms [13] . Due to efficient learning ability of ELM, it is widely used in classification, regression problems, etc. [14, 15] . In addition to being used for traditional classification and regression tasks, ELM has recently been extended for clustering, feature selection, and representation learning [16] . For more research on ELM, please refer to related literatures [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

Regarding the advantages of ELM, in recent years, the use of ELM for time-series datasets has gradually increased. A number of scholars have applied ELM to carry out feature engineering on time-series data [27] , and ELM was extensively utilized to study various hybrid models for predicting time-series data. In order to discover the features of the original data, Yang et al. proposed an ELM-based recognition framework to deal with the recognition problem [28] . Li et al. proposed the design and architecture of a trading signal mining platform that uses ELM to simultaneously predict stock prices based on market news and stock price datasets [29] . Wang et al. introduced a new mutual information-based sentiment analysis method and employed ELM to improve the prediction accuracy and accelerate the prediction performance of the proposed model [30] . Jiang et al. combined empirical mode decomposition, ELM, and improved harmony search algorithm to establish a two-stage ensemble model for stock price prediction [31] . Tang et al. optimized the ELM by the differential evolution algorithm to construct a new hybrid predictive model [32] . Weng et al. presented an improved genetic algorithm regularized online ELM to predict gold price [33] . Jiang et al. proposed a hybrid approach consisting of pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) and ELM based on wavelet packet analysis (WPA) for predicting bulk commodity prices. That hybrid model possessed a better performance on horizontal precision, directional precision and robustness [34] . Khuwaja et al. presented a framework to predict the stock price movement using phase space reconstruction (PSR) and ELM, and results achieved from the proposed framework were compared with the conventional machine learning pipeline, as well as the baseline methods [35] . Jeyakarthic and Punitha introduced a new method based on multi-core ELM for forecasting stock market returns [36] . Xu et al. presented a new carbon price prediction model using time series complex network analysis and ELM [37] . In addition to the use of ELM for feature processing and developing hybrid models, a number of studies have modified ELM to make it highly appropriate for a variety of practical scenarios. Wang et al. introduced a non-convex loss function, developed a robust regularized ELM, and emphasized on solving the key problem of low efficiency [38] . Guo et al. presented a robust adaptive online sequential ELM-based algorithm for online modeling and prediction of non-stationary data streams with outliers [39] .",

            "text": "The research of stock prediction is inseparable from the hypothesis of market efficiency [40] . There are a lot of studies on market efficiency [41] . The general conclusion is that the market in which the stock trend can be predicted should be the ineffective market, otherwise it is impossible to predict the trend of stock. Relevant studies have pointed out that China's stock market is a relatively emerging market [42, 43] , which is relatively ineffective. Therefore, it is feasible to use various machine learning models to predict the trend of the stock through transaction data analysis. In order to predict the stock trend in an ineffective market, we need to consider the influence of noise on trend prediction. Due to the influence of various accidental factors on the financial market, the impact of noise on financial time-series data draws scholars' attention. To our knowledge, noise often distorts investors' judgments on stock trends and seriously affects further analysis and processing. However, financial time-series data possess non-stationary and non-linear characteristics, and the traditional denoising processing methods are often accompanied with several defects. The traditional methods of denoising the financial time-series data mainly include the moving average (MA) [44] , Kalman filter [45] , Wiener filter [46] , and fast Fourier transform (FFT) [47] . As a simple data smoothing technique, the MA approximately processes the time-series data. In the denoising process, it may also lead to a loss of useful information. The FFT generally treats high-frequency signals as noise, sets all Fourier coefficients above a certain threshold frequency to zero, and then converts the datasets to the time-domain through inverse Fourier transform to achieve denoising [47] . With respect to the low signal-to-noise ratio in financial data, it is difficult to achieve effective denoising due to more high-frequency effective signals. Kalman filter is a recursive estimator to estimate the state of a system based on the criterion of minimum mean-square error of the residual [48] . As financial time-series data are non-stationary and nonlinear, it is difficult to describe their state and behavior with a definite equation. In signal processing, the Wiener filter is a filter used to produce an estimate of a desired or target random process by linear time-invariant (LTI) filtering of an observed noisy process, assuming known stationary signal and noise spectra, and additive noise. The Wiener filter minimizes the mean square error between the estimated random process and the desired process. Wavelet analysis is a mathematical technique that can decompose a signal into multiple lower resolution levels by controlling the scaling and shifting factors of a single wavelet function. FFT has no locality, while wavelet transform not only has locality, but also scaled parameters that can change the spectrum structure and the shape of the window, so that wavelet analysis can achieve the effect of multi-resolution analysis [49] . The wavelet methods can be used to decompose a noisy signal into different scales and remove the noise while preserving the signal, regardless of the frequency content. The wavelet transforms are developed according to the requirements of time-frequency localization. They possess adaptive properties and are particularly appropriate for processing of stationary and non-linear signals [50] . A recent study employed wavelet transform to reduce the amount of noisy data [51] . Xu et al. proposed a novel method based on the wavelet-denoising algorithm and multiple echo state networks to improve the prediction accuracy of noisy multivariate time-series [52] . Bao et al. developed a deep learning framework, combining wavelet transform, stacked autoencoders, and long short-term memory (LSTM) for stock price prediction [53] . Yang et al. presented an image processing method based on wavelet transform for big data analysis of historical data of individual stocks to obtain images of individual stocks volatility data [54] . Lahmiri introduced a new method based on the combination of stationary wavelet transform and Tsallis entropy for empirical analysis of the return series [55] . Li and Tang proposed a WT-FCD-MLGRU model, which is the combination of wavelet transform, filter cycle decomposition and multi-lag neural networks, and that model possessed minimum forecasting error in stock index prediction [56] . Wen et al. used wavelet transform to extract the features of the Shanghai Composite Index and S&P Index to study the relationship between China's stock market and international commodities [57] . Mohammed et al. employed continuous wavelet transform and wavelet coherence method to study the relationship between stock indices in different markets [58] . Yang applied the differential method to highlight the trend of the stock price change. To further suppress the influence of stock noise data, they employed wavelet transform to decompose the stock data into principal component and detailed component [59] . Xu et al. presented design and implementation of a stacked system to predict the stock price. Their model used the wavelet transform technique to reduce the noise of market data, and stacked auto-encoder to filter unimportant features from preprocessed data [60] . He et al. proposed a new shrinkage (threshold) function to improve the performance of wavelet shrinkage denoising [61] . Yu et al. used wavelet coherence and wavelet phase difference based on continuous wavelet transform to quantitatively analyze the correlation effect of stock signal returns in the timefrequency domain [62] . Faraz and Khaloozadeh applied wavelet transform to reduce the noise in the stock index and to make the data smooth [63, 64] . Chen utilized a recursive adaptive separation algorithm based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to denoise data [65] . Li et al. proposed a hybrid model based on wavelet transform denoising, ELM, and k-nearest neighbor regression optimization for stock prediction [66] . There are several other similar studies as well [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] . Basically, related research has improved the effect of related time-series prediction through wavelet transform.",

The output weights can be determined by the system (i.e., the ELM algorithm randomly assigns input weights and hidden layer bias rather than completely adjusting all parameters (e.g., backpropagation neural network (BPNN)). For SLFNs, the ELM algorithm can analytically determine output weights. Through the proof of the previously presented theorems Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 in [76] , the minimum norm of the weights is given, which is simple to implement and fast in prediction.

It can simultaneously display functions and manifest their local characteristics in time-frequency domain. The use of these characteristics facilitates training of neural networks with accuracy to extremely nonlinear signals. It is a time-frequency localized analysis method that the size of window is fixed, while its shape may change [79] . In other words, it has a lower time resolution and higher frequency resolution in low frequency band [80] , and higher time resolution and lower frequency resolution in high frequency band, making it highly appropriate for analyzing non-stationary signals, as well as extracting the local characteristics of signals. Wavelet transform includes continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and DWT [81] . The aim of wavelet transform is to translate a function called basic wavelet with parameter \u03c4, then, scale the function with the scaling parameter a, and do inner product with signal x(t), as formulated in Equation (12), where a > 0 is the scaling factor used to scale the \u03d5(t) function, and the \u03c4 parameter is used to translate the function \u03d5(t). Both a and \u03c4 are continuous variables, thus, Equation (12) is called CWT [82] . DWT is a transform that decomposes a given signal into a number of sets, where each set is a time-series of coefficients describing the time evolution of the signal in the corresponding frequency band [83] . DWT discretizes a signal according to the power series based on the scaling parameter, and is often used for signal decomposition and reconstruction [84] .",

Hence, first, we imported the raw stock data, then used the labeling method to label the data, performed feature preprocessing on the raw data based on the Equations (17) and (18) , and then allocated the data into training datasets, validation datasets, and test datasets. Afterwards, the training datasets were used for the training of the proposed denoised ELM (DELM). Besides, we trained the ELM model and the 12 common algorithms using the training datasets based on the raw data, and the results on the corresponding test sets were employed to compare with the results of the DELM to examine the positive influence of DWT on the ELM classification results (i.e., C1 in Figure 3 ). The ELM-associated parameters are shown in Table 1 . Finally, the results of the 12 common algorithms were compared with those of the DELM method (i.e., C2 in Figure 3 ). The signal passes through a decomposed high-pass filter and a decomposed low-pass filter. The high-frequency component of the corresponding signal is output by the high-pass filter, which is called the detail component. The output of the low-pass filter corresponds to the relatively low-frequency component of the signal, which is called the approximate component [86] . In general, the short-term volatility of stock is often affected by various information and possesses the characteristics of short-term noise. The labeling method used in the third part of the present research is based on the continuous trend characteristics of stocks to label the data and generate training datasets. Therefore, noisy data may have an obvious impact on the labeling process. It is hoped that the continuous trend characteristics of the stock are relatively stable, and the short-term noise can be filtered in the process of data labeling, especially for data with Gaussian white noise in the majority of cases; thus, we denoised the raw data by wavelet transform, and labeled the data based on the denoised data to generate training dataset. The use of DWT to denoise stock data generally requires the selection of wavelet basis, the number of decomposition layers, and the selection of threshold [79] . The DWT-based denoising process is illustrated in Figure 2 . In the selection process of wavelet function, we used dozens of stocks to test the whole experimental process with different wavelet functions. The final trend prediction results are better with the wavelet function of db8. Then, we set the wavelet function as db8 with the threshold parameter of 0.04.",

The transaction data of each trading day are taken as the raw data, including stock code, opening price, the highest price, the lowest price, closing price, trading volume, etc. Some suspended stocks or newly listed stocks are deleted, and 400 stocks with more than 4000 rows of data are screened out as our dataset. The data are from https://tushare.pro/ (accessed on 2 January 2021), which can be downloaded in the sub-category of \"Backward Answer Authority Quotes\" under the category of \"Quotes Data\". The data can also be downloaded for free through https://github.com/justbeat99/400_stocks_data_zips.git (accessed on 2 January 2021). After downloading the raw data, we performed feature preprocessing on the data according to Equations (17) and (18) , and then labeled the data according to Equations (20)- (22) to generate labeled datasets, and segmented each stock data with the first 70% of the date for the training dataset, 15% in the middle part for the validation dataset, and the last 15% for the test dataset. As a result, the training, validation, and test datasets of 400 stocks with labeled data could be obtained. We checked the balance of the positive and negative samples on the training, validation, and test datasets of these 400 stocks, and it was found that all the datasets were relatively balanced. The balance table is submitted in the Supplementary Materials. Appendix A Table A2 provides the balanced datasets for some stocks. It can be seen from Appendix A Table A2 that for the listed data, the training datasets are half of the positive and negative samples, i.e., they are all relatively balanced. Regarding the validation datasets, the proportion of positive samples for 000005 is 39%, the proportion of positive samples for 000025 is 34%, and the proportion of positive samples for 000520 is 31% that are imbalanced. Regarding the test datasets, the proportion of positive samples for 000055 is 35%, the proportion of positive samples for 000068 is 37%, and the proportion of positive samples for 000523 is 39%. The balance of these situations is slightly worse. However, they all happen in the validation dataset or test dataset of a small number of stocks, and their impact is not great. We further checked the data of all stocks, and it was found that the training dataset was basically balanced. The sample balance sheet for positive and negative cases for 400 stocks is submitted as Supplementary Materials.",

It simply calculates the ratio, while it does not differentiate categories. Because type of error costs may be different, it is not advised to use only Acc to measure the case of unbalanced samples, because the generalizability of the model and the random prediction problem caused by sample skew are not considered. Generally speaking, the higher the Acc, the better the classifier. Our datasets are relatively balanced datasets, therefore, Acc is a promising evaluation metric. Precision is a measure of accuracy that represents the proportion of examples that are classified as positive examples but actually positive examples. Recall is a measure of coverage, which is used to measure the proportion of positive cases that are correctly classified as positive cases. F1 takes into account the Acc and Recall of the classification model [93] , and can be regarded as the harmonic average of the accuracy and recall of the model. The physical meaning of AUC is the probability of taking any positive/negative case, and the positive case ranks before the negative case. The AUC reflects the sorting ability of classifiers. It is noteworthy that the AUC is not sensitive to whether the sample categories are balanced or not, justifying why performance of a classifier is typically evaluated by the AUC for unbalanced samples [94] . For a specific classifier, it is impossible for us to simultaneously improve all the abovementioned metrics. However, if a classifier can correctly classify all instances, all metrics are optimal. Therefore, we mainly considered the actual effects (i.e., the results of Acc, the sensitivity of balanced samples, and the values of the AUC).",

As shown in Figure 4 , the line charts of raw data and denoised data of four stocks can be observed. Since the number of the raw data and the denoised data exceeds 4000, the visualization of all the data in one graph is not very intuitive. We partially enlarged the graph of the last 300 data for each stock. As displayed in Figure 4 , the trend of the time-series data after denoising is smoother, and the result of the continuous trend characteristics is more stable. An abnormal fluctuation in the raw time-series data is often caused by random accidents. Abnormal fluctuations in stock market caused by accidents often reflect short-term surges and plunges, causing stock price to deviate from the normal trend. However, when accidents pass, the stock price often returns to the original normal trend. Therefore, it is hoped that the denoised data can filter such abnormal noise and maintain better trend continuity. It can be seen from the Figure 4 that the denoised data are basically less sensitive to such abnormal points, improving the continuity of the trend after denoising the data. This result is in line with our needs and expectations. It was also noticed that after denoising the data, the relatively high-price point was basically lower compared to the raw data in a local area, and the relatively low-price point was higher compared to the raw data in a local area. This is also in line with our needs for denoising. It is hoped that the DWT-based denoising can enhance the trend characteristics of stocks, and then better train machine learning models for predicting changes in the trend of stocks.",

            "text": "In general, it is highly essential to standardize or normalize the data before the data are used to train the model, so that the data can be mapped to a relatively stable fluctuation interval with a relatively stable volatility, which is convenient for a model to learn such a norm according to the eigenvector. The traditional standardization or normalization methods are used to process all the data [95] , which are not appropriate for the time-series data and have the problem of look-ahead bias [96] . The raw data processed by Equations (17) and (18) were stable. It is necessary to conduct a stationarity test on the data processed by Equations (17) and (18) after DWT-based denoising to indicate whether there is a stable sequence, which is convenient for machine learning models to learn. Stationary data could improve the prediction ability of machine learning models. Figure 5 shows the results of feature processing based on Equations (17) and (18) for the DWT-based denoised data of stock code 000005. Figure 5a illustrates the sequence diagram of the denoised data. Figure 5a shows that the denoised data are not stable and do not have a stable fluctuation form. Figure 5b displays the featured data after the denoised data are processed by the Equations (17) and (18) . It can be seen from Figure 5b that after feature processing, the data are mapped to a relatively stable fluctuation interval, and the mean is around zero. Figure 5c is the autocorrelation graph, and Figure 5d is the partial autocorrelation graph. It can be seen that once the lag parameter exceeds 15, the corresponding autocorrelation value and partial autocorrelation value fluctuate around zero. It can be concluded that, basically, the features obtained by the Equations (17) and (18) from denoised data are stable ( Figure 5 ). In order to obtain the exact results from the statistical level, we conducted an enhanced ADF test on the 400 stocks [97, 98] . Appendix A Table A3 shows the results of ADF test for some stocks. Others are submitted as Supplementary Materials. From Appendix A Table A3 , we can see that the statistic based on ADF test of 000005 is \u221210.77, which is less than the critical values of 1% (\u22123.43), 5% (\u22122.86), and 10% (\u22122.57). Simultaneously, the p value is 2.37 \u00d7 10 \u221219 , which is close to zero. From the results of the ADF test, it can be observed that the features processed by Equations (17) and (18) from DWT-based denoised data are stationary. All the 400 stocks were checked, and these stationarity data for all stocks are consistent, i.e., these are all stable sequences. Figure 4 .

            "text": "The labeling method used in this paper is based on the continuous trend features of the corresponding stock. In the process of labeling the stock data, the volatility parameter \u03c9 needs to be given, based on \u03c9, the relatively high-and low-price points are calculated according to the Equations (19)- (21) , and the continuous trend indicator TD is calculated based on these high-and low-price points. The labeling method does not remarkably care about the short-term normal fluctuations of stock price, while it is more concerned with long-term, continuous trends. Because it uses the relatively high-and low-price points in a period to calculate the TD, the correct calculation of these price points for the corresponding period determines the labelling of all the data in such points. Then, if the stock price fluctuation caused by some short-term random events exceeds the threshold \u03c9, i.e., the short-term rises and falls suddenly and sharply, which is caused by accidental events, the labeling method may regard this fluctuation as a trend of rise or fall, and then label the data and use the labeled data for training the model. The worst result is that the labelled data in this period may be biased (especially if the price returns to normal after the abnormal event), which may cause biased training results of the model. Therefore, we used the DWT-based denoising algorithm to denoise the raw stock data in order to obtain the denoised data with better continuous trend characteristics, i.e., the denoised data can smooth such abnormal fluctuations, and then, change the relative high-and low-price points compared to the raw data for the corresponding period. Figure 6 shows the visualization process of the labeling of stock code 000005 with \u03c9 equal to 0.05. The red line indicates a downward trend and green line shows an upward trend. Figure 6a displays the labeling process of the DWT-based denoising data, and Figure 6b illustrates the labeling process of the raw data. Due to the denser data, it is roughly found that the continuity of the labeling process of denoised data is superior. The labeling process of the last 300 data from the two datasets was partially enlarged (Figure 6c,d) . It can be clearly seen that the data that underwent DWT denoising are labeled with the labeling method based on the proposed continuous trend feature, reflecting better trend continuity. In particular, in the section circled by the orange box in the lower right corner, it can be seen that in the c plot, the labeling method is applicable to all the corresponding stock trends as a downtrend, while the two small rebounds in plot d are labeled as green, indicating that they are uptrend. The difference in the results originates from the difference in the sensitivity of the calculation of the high-and low-price points during this period. Similarly, the same situation exists for the orange box in the upper left corner. In the plot c, the labeling method labels the trends of this period as (fall, rise, fall), and in plot d, trends are indeed labeled as (fall, rise, fall, rise, fall). It can be clearly seen that the smoothness of the data after denoising is better, and the labeling process is more realistic and better reflects the characteristics of the continuous trend. In plots c and d, the serial numbers from 100 to 200 achieve the same conclusion mentioned above. The difference in labeling caused by noise may appear in training of an oversensitive model, and the accuracy of prediction and other metrics may also be sensitive to the validation set and test set. Therefore, it can be seen from the graphical results that the data after DWT-based denoising possess good smoothness and continuous trend characteristics, which can better improve the labeling effect of our labeling method. The trend continuity of the labeled data is better, reflecting the continuous trend characteristics of the corresponding stocks. This is more in line with actual investment behavior. Figure 6 . The labeling process. The Y-axis represents the closing price of the corresponding stock, and the X-axis indicates the date. The green line indicates that the labeling method is significant in labeling this segment of data as an upward trend, and the red line indicates that the labeling method can be used to label this segment of data as a downward trend.",

In order to better evaluate the effects of DWT on the final results, we established two models: the ELM model based on feature training of raw data, and the DELM based on feature training of denoised data. In the ELM training phase, we used the \"High-Performance Extreme Learning Machines\" toolbox [99] . Tables 3-7 present the results of Acc, P, R, F1, AUC of the two models with some stocks. The results in the validation dataset were mainly used to verify the selection of relevant parameters, and to prevent problems, such as overfitting a model trained on the training dataset. We analyzed the results in the test dataset with concentration of the results in the validation dataset. As shown in Table 3 , in terms of the Acc, the results of the DELM in the test dataset significantly exceed those of the ELM model. For each stock, the Acc value of the DELM was higher than that of the ELM model for all stocks. The Acc of stock code 000007 increased from 0.5770 to 0.6483, with an increase of seven percentage points; the Acc of 000025 also increased from 0.6057 to 0.6894, with an increase of eight percentage points; the results of the improvement for codes 000048 and 000402 were not significantly different. With the Acc of 000520, the DELM significantly increased the result of the ELM model from 0.6225 to 0.7565, with an increase of 13%. In addition, the Acc for code 000530 was elevated by 10%. Other stocks' Acc improvement was basically five to six percentage points. The above-mentioned results were then averaged. The mean values showed that the DELM increased the ELM's Acc from 0.6445 to 0.6909, with an average increase of more than five percentage points. This is also in line with the average improvement result in the validation dataset, and the average improvement in the validation dataset is about three points. Table 4 , it can be seen that in terms of the value of the Precision metric, the values are not as improved as the Acc metric. The results of the Precision metric for the ELM model are partly good, and some represent the results of the DELM, e.g., the stock codes of 000005, 000150, 000151, 000402, 000404, 000420, 000430, 000507, and 000509. However, in general, it can be seen from the average results that the values of the Precision metric for the DELM increased from 0.6170 to 0.6506, indicating improvement to a certain degree.",

From Table 8 , it can be seen that the conclusion is basically the same. The values of Acc and AUC for the DELM have been significantly improved compared to the ELM model. The improvement of F1 for the DELM is not statistically significant (0.6343 versus 0.6369). It was also noticed that the P value of the ELM model improved (within 3.7%) compared with that of the DELM. The value of R metric decreased by an average of 2.4 percentage points. The average value of AUC rose from 0.6517 to 0.6892, with an increase of 3.75 percentage points. In the section of statistical metrics, we compared the differences between the different metrics, and concentrated on the values of Acc and AUC. The results of the 400 stocks were also checked, as presented in the Supplementary Materials, and it was found that in terms of the values of Acc and AUC metrics, for the DELM, the values for each stock were elevated, indicating that DWT-based denoising could remarkably improve the ELM model prediction results based on the labeling method. It was demonstrated that the interpretation regarding the combination of continuous trend-based labeling method and DWT-based denoising was correct. The results showed that the denoised data were highly appropriate for the continuous trend-based labeling method. The results also highlighted the rationality and superiority of the architecture of the proposed hybrid method. ",

As shown in Table 10 , among the results of all six stocks, the Acc values of the DELM were most promising, which significantly surpassed the Acc values of other common models, basically reaching an accuracy rate of 0.7. Additionally, the Acc values of the DELM surpassed the results of other common models, and again verified the efficacy of DWT-based denoising. In addition, the results of LSTM, RNN, RF, GBT, ABT, and SVC were relatively better than those of other common models (basically between 0.67 and 0.68). The values of the AUC metric were concerned, those of stock codes 000005, 000007, and 000025 for the DELM were not the best in all algorithms, and the most reliable were found in other stock codes. As far as the Acc values were concerned, these values in the proposed DELM were the best on all the stock codes, and the AUC values of the proposed DELM were the best among all the other algorithms. In addition to the six stocks, we checked the results of all 400 stocks, and the conclusions were basically consistent with those of the six stocks, i.e., the proposed DELM could significantly improve the values of Acc and AUC in prediction process. Regarding the values of P, R, and F1, as explained in the section of statistical metrics, in general, each model possesses its unique advantages. This paper mainly concentrated on the values of Acc and AUC. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed hybrid method DELM can better predict changes in the continuous trend of stocks and has a higher prediction accuracy and AUC value. Table 9 .

The raw data were first denoised based on DWT, feature preprocessing was performed after denoising data, and then, the DELM was trained based on the denoised data with the obtained features. Finally, the training DELM was compared with the initial ELM model on a dataset of 400 stocks. The prediction results greatly improved the values of the Acc and AUC metrics. The results fully proved the superiority of the DELM, and also showed that wavelet transform could improve the prediction ability of the ELM model. At the same time, the logical relationship between DWT-based denoising and the labeling method was analyzed based on the continuous trend, and logical explanations were provided for good results. Additionally, in order to better assess the efficacy of the proposed DELM, the predictive results of the DELM for the stocks were also compared with those of the 12 common algorithms, which the proposed DELM method outperformed. The results confirmed the superiority of the proposed DELM method as well. However, this paper does not investigate the influence of different wavelet function denoising results on improving the accuracy of stock trend prediction in-depth, which remains to be investigated by future research work.
