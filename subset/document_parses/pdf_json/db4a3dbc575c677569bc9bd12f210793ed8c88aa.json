VEGFR-2 IC 50 values ranged from 60.00 to 123.85 nM for the new derivatives compared to 54.00 nM for sorafenib. Compounds 15 a , 15 b , and 15 d showed IC 50 from 17.39 to 47.10 mM against human cancer cell lines; hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), prostate cancer (PC3), and breast cancer (MCF-7). Meanwhile, the first in terms of VEGFR-2 inhibition was compound 15 d which came second with regard to antitumor assay with IC 50 \u00bc 24.10, 40.90, and 33.40 mM against aforementioned cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, Compound 15 d increased apoptosis rate of HepG2 from 1.20 to 12.46% as it significantly increased levels of BAX, and P53 from 49.6274, 40.62, and 42.84 to 561.427, 395.04, and 415.027 pg/mL, respectively. Moreover, 15 d showed IC 50 of 253 and 381 nM against HER2 and FGFR, respectively.",

Figure 2 illustrates the four regions that were reported to be occupied by these features 27, 28 . We can see that the ATP-binding domain (Hinge region) is accommodated by a flat heteroaromatic moiety. The interaction between the heteroaromatic moiety and Glu917 and/or Cys919 residues in this region is important 6, 29, 30 . Secondly, the area between ATPbinding domain and DFG domain requires a linker with suitable length to fit 31 . Thirdly, Glu885 and Asp1046 residues in the DFG domain are essential residues to which the hydrogen bond acceptors and donors interact 29 . Finally, there are hydrophobic interactions between the allosteric region of the inactive confirmation of the receptor and the terminal hydrophobic group 29, 32 . Figure 3 shows a model for the designed compounds and demonstrates the consistency of their structures with the pharmacophoric features that reported to type II VEGFR-2 inhibitors. With respect to the flat heteroaromatic moiety, three nuclei were taken into account in our design: quinazoline, quinoxaline, and nitrobenzene. AZD-2932 6 (IC 50 \u00bc 8 nM) 33 is a quinazoline-based VEGFR-2 inhibitor (Figure 1 ). It clearly reveals the significance of quinazoline as flat heteroaromatic moiety in VEGFR-2 inhibitors. As a bioisoster to quinazoline, quinoxaline was also designed to study the effect of changing benzodiazine nitrogen positions on the activity. 2-Nitrobenzene was also designed in this work because that benzene is an isostere to pyridine of Sorafenib 1 and Regorafenib 2 ( Figure 1 ). It will show to what extent heterocycle is important for activity. Additionally, there is a nitro group at position 2 which may interact with the essential residues Glu917 and/or Cys919 in Hinge region.",

Figure 11(A,B) shows pi-cation interaction between the phenoxy group and Lys868 of the linker region. Meanwhile, N-H of the amide group demonstrated a hydrogen bond with Glu885, and the oxygen of carbonyl group formed anther hydrogen bond with Asp1046 at the DFG binding domain. Moreover, the chloride atom at position 2 of quinazoline formed hydrogen bond with Cys919 of the ATP-binding domain. Finally, pyridyl moiety accommodated the allosteric binding region showing hydrophobic interactions. Figure 11 (C) shows a superimposition of 15 d and sorafenib.",

These results are not only consistent with biological data obtained from the VEGFR-2 assay but also give an explanation to them. For example, quinazoline based derivatives (14 a,b and 15 a-d ) displayed the best docking energy (from -53.63 to -66.52 C-Docker energy score) as presented in Table 6 . Regarding VEGFR-2 inhibition, the same derivatives were the most potent (IC 50 ranged from 60 to 94.22 nM) as listed in Table 1 . The most potent candidates for VEGFR-2 inhibition were 15 d and 15 c with IC 50 \u00bc 60.00 and 65.24 nM, respectively. Similarly, these two compounds were the most promising in terms of docking score showed the highest binding free energies 64.11 and 66.52 C-Docker energy score, respectively. At the same time, quinoxaline-based derivatives (19 a,b and 20 a-d ) came the second with regard to both VEGFR-2 inhibition and docking score as illustrated in Tables 1 and 6 . It can also be seen that nitrobenzenebased derivatives came last in both biological activity and docking results.",

Quinazoline nucleus as a planar heteroaromatic moiety is much better than both quinoxaline and benzene ring. It can be noticed from Table 1 2. The nitrogen atom in the heteroaromatic moiety plays a key role in the activity. For example, the data of VEGFR-2 inhibitory assay revealed IC 50 \u00bc 67.05 nM for 14 a which is quinazoline-based candidate. Meanwhile, the corresponding nitrobenzene-based derivative (22 a ) displayed IC 50 \u00bc 123.85 nM. In a similar manner, compound 15 a (quinazoline derivative) showed significantly better antiproliferative results than 23 a (a nitrobenzene derivative). displayed far more potent antiproliferative activity than 15 a which contain plain phenyl ring. 7. Pyridine nucleus is better than benzene ring. The nitrogen atom increased the basicity of the pyridine ring than benzene ring which makes a chance to form pi-cation interaction more than benzene ring.

Biological results showed that compounds 15 d and 15 b are of particular interest as anticancer agents targeting VEGFR-2 kinase. In addition to their considerable inhibition of VEGFR-2, they have shown promising antitumor effects especially against hepatocellular cancer cell line (HepG2) with high degree of selectively. The data obtained from VEGFR-2 inhibitory assay revealed IC 50 \u00bc 60.00 and 86.36 nM for 15 d and 15 b , respectively compared to IC 50 \u00bc 54.00 nM for the positive control sorafenib. At the same time, the IC 50 values obtained for the two candidates against HepG2 were 24.10 and 17.39 mM, respectively. Further examination of compound 15 d revealed its importance as an apoptosis inducer at HepG2 cells where it raised the apoptosis rate from 1.20 to 12.46%. The mechanism of apoptosis induction was proved to compound 15 d through increasing the expression levels of caspase-3, BAX, and P53. Additionally, Bcl-2 level was decreased. Accordingly, this work suggests that compounds 15 b and 15 d should be considered for further evaluation and/or modification as promising anticancer candidates.",

The second compound against PC3 was 15 a which came third against both HepG2 and MCF-7. The other derivatives displayed the same descending order of activity against all cancer cell lines as follows: 14 a > 15 c > 19 b > 20 c > 23 a > 20 d .Of note, the cytotoxicity against normal human lung fibroblasts cell line (WI-38) were examined for the nine selected compounds. It is evident from Table 2 that the tested compounds have a significantly higher IC 50 versus WI-38 than the IC 50 versus cancer cell lines. It was found that compounds 15 b and 15 d showed the best selectivity. Compound 15 b showed selectivity indices of 13.57, 9.50, and 11.87 to HepG2, PC3, and MCF-7 cell lines, respectively, while it was found that selectivity indices of compound 15 d were 9.22, 5.53, and 6.92 to the cell lines, respectively.On the basis of the obtained data, Compound 15 d was the most promising derivative in VEGFR-2 inhibitory testing and showed promising antitumor activity against HepG2 cells with ",
