To allow convenient and rapid data collection from diverse samples, FORC is independently hosted yet integrated with the popular crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk through a reimbursement key mechanism. To validate the survey data quality and game mechanics of FORC, n = 101 participants were recruited, who answered an questionnaire on gambling habits and problems, then played both slot machine and card-draw type games.

As evident by its long historical roots and popularity around the world, gambling is a popular recreational activity, often without any serious negative consequences (1) . A subset of gamblers, however, develop problematic gambling behaviors such as loss-chasing, stake habituation, difficulty stopping, and gambling to escape negative emotions, and experience negative economic, psychosocial, and mental health consequences because of this (2) . Gambling is now recognized as an addictive behavior in psychiatric diagnostics (3), yet unlike alcohol and substance addictions, problem gambling does not involve consuming psychoactive chemical agents. From a clinical perspective, this makes it even more important to study the specific learning and extinction mechanisms involved in gambling in order to inform gambling-specific treatment strategies, both for clinical settings and to inform so called Responsible Gambling Tools (RGT) (4) .",

FORC features three types of games, which can be included in any sequence and with varying number of trials: a roulette wheel with a choice of betting on red or black color (potential instrumental learning task, Figure 1C ), a three-reel slot machine with no choice (potential Pavlovian learning task, Figure 1D) , and a simple cardchoice game with a choice of two decks placed side-by-side either vertically or horizontally (potential instrumental learning task, Figure 1B ). While the two former paradigms perfectly mimic real-life gambling, a deliberate design decision was made to not model existing casino card games in order to avoid evoking already learned play strategies that could interfere with the designed contingencies. All games feature realistic sound effects, both on interaction (button pressing) and win outcomes ( Figure 1D ). Continuous background music was not included due to technical reasons. Balance is by standard displayed in the lower right corner, as in real-life online casinos, but can be hidden by specifying this in the design matrix. Four distinct visual themes-different color schemes, all with graphical casino connotations (one with four variants with only minor differences in element composition)-are available for both the card game and slot machine, which can be randomly allocated per trial. A basic theme option is also available. For each arm, number of trials per sequence, starting balance, visual theme, bet size(s) and win amount(s) and win probabilities, per choice option (if any), can be conveniently set in the design matrix using an online administrator view. See Figure 1A . Short, customizable messages can be displayed in-between games (sequences) to e.g., mimic the sort of messaging used in RGTs (e.g., \"Remember that there is no guarantee that you will win back lost credits\") (21) .",

First, the observed random appearances of gambling outcomes (wins) during the slot machine phase (with different win percentages dependent on random stimulus shown) were compared to those programmed in the design matrix (50% for theme S1A and 20% for theme S2), both on a trial-by-trial basis and overall. Second, to ensure that random draws (outcomes) were made with replacement (i.e. independent of previous ones), we calculated percentage of win outcomes during the instrumental acquisition phase (same 45% win probability in all trials) as a function of outcome of the preceding trial. Third, change in credit balance over time during the slot machine phase (same 20 credit possible win outcome in all trials) was compared to the expected credit balance change based on programmed probability. Since win probability differed between 20 and 50% depending on what stimulus was randomly presented for each trial, a perfect distribution of stimuli across trials and participants would give a 35% win probability. Since each bet cost 10 credits (at time of validation data collection not refunded in case of win; changed after collecting data for the current study, altering only the return to player rate but no game mechanics), and the win outcome was 20 credits regardless of theme, the return to player rate was 0.7 credits, meaning that with perfect distribution of themes between trials, a player's balance should decrease with on average 3 credits per trial.",

The other two FORC games however are very similar to their real-life equivalents, albeit somewhat simpler in gambling options. Of importance to learning experiments, a deliberate design was made to require user input for every trial of the slot-machine, since we considered this to be a key feature of real-life gambling. Although requiring user action to initiate a learning trial deviates somewhat from traditional Pavlovian paradigms, users were presented with only a single option (to continue, i.e., no option to either quit, change bet etc.).

This observation makes deployment of FORC an ethical issue, rather than theoretically imposing a limitation on generalizability of findings (since little or no selection bias is apparent). As with any research on this topic and/or using similar methods, planned experiments should be vetted by an independent review board. Of importance, FORC includes several features that address this issue directly, including post-experiment debriefing, a reminder that the house always wins, that gambling strategies applied in FORC will not work elsewhere, and encouragements to seek help. Further, considering the ubiquity of online advertisements for gambling opportunities, it could also be argued that presenting AMT users with possibility of participating in a gambling experiments does not in any practical sense increase their exposure to gambling opportunities.",

Whether such measure shows convergent validity will however ultimately depend on the exact experimental setup and must thus be examined in each study carried out using FORC. Of note, another commonly used proxy measures of problematic gambling, gambling persistence (13), is not possible to examine with FORC since AMT participants have no incentive to continue playing beyond the required trials and reimbursement is fixed for both technical and ethical reasons.",

Although AMT experiments do tend to produce high-quality data (26) , this does not apply to 100% of participants. In the current study, we examined both within-questionnaire convergent validity and psychometric properties, as well as response variation-the latter on the grounds that fully repetitive gambling would be in violation of experiment instructions and the easiest way to play through the experiment and gain reimbursement as quickly as possible. Response variation is likely to be a sensitive proxy measure of quality, yet possibly at the price of some specificity, and the exact threshold should thus be carefully considered. Since collecting validation data, a new quality assurance feature has been added to FORC in the form of a pop-up question on contingency knowledge acquisition, used in previous research (37) . These questions, along with response variation patterns and timing of responses, should be sufficient to make an accurate assessment of data quality in any experimental setup.",

Return of bets upon winning is now explicitly explained in the pre-game instructions, and we can thus see no reason why it would change the game mechanics beyond calculation of the return to player rate, which with one exception (see Limitations below) can easily be adapted. Another change is that bet size, which could previously only be observed through change in the credit balance, is now displayed visually immediately upon pressing a button or selecting a deck, then fading rapidly.",

First, the experimental setup was designed to allow a detailed evaluation of the game mechanics, rather than to evoke spontaneous gambling behaviors perfectly reflective of real-life gambling. For example, the return to player rate of the slot machine game was 0.7, which is lower than in typical real-life gambling; although the degree to which participants could discriminate this is unknown (38) . For this reason, we refrained from examining associations between observed gambling behavior and collected measures of gambling habits and gambling problems. Instead, we emphasize that each study in which FORC is used should examine convergent validity in relation to what can be reasonably expected given the particular experimental setup used. If, for example, a study aims to immediately promote Pavlovian or instrumental learning in order to avoid possible confounding, the resulting gambling behaviors may be shaped more by the newly learned contingencies than regular gambling strategies, decreasing power to detect convergent associations with survey-reported gambling. Second, the current study did not collect any additional data to examine data quality (e.g., participant ratings or free-text evaluations), opting instead to examine data quality using the same metrics that would be available to subsequent experiments run using the same platform.",

First, although the aesthetic of FORC was designed to mimic that of modern online casinos, graphical quality is not fully comparable, at least to those prevalent in Western countries. To some extent, this was a deliberate design decision: too complex graphical presentations may have distracted participants and presented technical issues for users running the experiment on smartphones and cellular internet connections. Also for technical reasons, including background sound was not possible, although FORC does feature realistic casino sound effects. The impact of lack of background music on external validity remains unknown; although background music during e.g., slot-machine playing may drive immersion and put the gambler in a so called \"Dark Flow\" (39) , gambler may be equally likely to turn down repetitive background music of this kind if they find it disturbing or distracting.",

However, jackpot-type setups can still be simulated by setting up several consecutive trial sequences of the same game, with randomized allocation to different number of trials and specific jackpot outcomes if need be. Third, custom gambling options are not available and cannot be simulated at present, meaning that research questions on this particular topic cannot at present be investigated using FORC. Fourth, our subsequent choice to modify the game mechanic to always return the bet on a winning outcome, entails that FORC cannot at current be used to study the lossesdisguised-as-wins phenomenon (40) . Returning this parameter setting would however require only a minor change to the underlying source code. Finally, it should be acknowledged that as with real-life gambling outcomes, appropriate statistical methods may be necessary to properly analyze some outcomes, e.g., if a particular experimental setup generates an of excess zeroes (41) .",

(B2) Distribution of observed-expected discrepancies (vertical reference line of zero). (B3) Change in balance out as compared to the preceeding trial (vertical reference line corresponds to programmed return to player rate). Poisson distributed with excess zeros yet with a long tail. See Figure 3A. Participants who reported no past-year gambling had significantly lower PGSI scores (B = \u22124.53, SE = 1.88, p = 0.0183), and both number of gambling types (B = 0.82, SE = 0.37, p = 0.0278) and gambling frequency (B = 2.60, SE = 0.49, p < 0.001) were associated with PGSI scores in the expected direction. In a Poisson regression model, gambling frequency significantly predicted number of gambling types (B = 0.34, SE = 0.067, p < 0.001).",
