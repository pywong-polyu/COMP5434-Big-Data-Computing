The paper also examines the moderated mediation effect of supervisory trust. The paper presents the findings of two studies. Study 1 utilized two data sets collected through an online survey from 280 part-time students working full-time (Sample 1) and 292 working professionals (Sample 2) in Pakistan. Study 2 utilized data collected from N = 167 students recruited for a scenario-based experiment that manipulated whether a manager was fair or unfair. Results revealed that relational justice positively predicted feedback acceptance in Studies 1 and 2. LMX positively mediated the above-mentioned relationship in both studies. As expected, supervisory trust negatively moderated the relational justice-feedback acceptance relationship in Study 2. The present study contributes to performance management theory and practice by illuminating that raters can stimulate performance partnership by employing a relational justice approach that increases the likelihood that employees accept performance feedback.",

They suggest that raters and ratees are instituted in the same social environment of PA; therefore, ratees' reactions are closely related to the rater's actions. On the one hand, giving accurate performance feedback (the rater's action) is deemed essential for improvement of employee performance (Schaerer et al., 2018) , while on the other hand feedback acceptance (the ratee's reaction) is considered instrumental to the overall effectiveness of PA (Ilgen et al., 1979) . PA theory and practice have realized that if ratees' reactions to feedback are adverse, the PA system will be prone to failure (Murphy & Cleveland, 1995) .",

            "text": "In the wake of debates on getting rid of performance ratings (Adler et al., 2016) , PA literature has shifted its focus from performance ratings to performance feedback. Substantiating this notion, organizations have also shifted to more flexible PA activities, e.g., conversation days for providing employees with informal but regular feedback (Dessler, 2020) . Some PA studies have identified that getting ratees to accept performance feedback is a serious problem (e.g., Christensen-Salem et al., 2018) . One major factor shaping such acceptance is ratees' perceptions of justice demonstrated by the rater (Anseel & Lievens, 2009) . At a theoretical level, a paucity of research on how rater-centric justice perceptions determine ratee feedback acceptance in the PA system is an issue that needs more research attention. Hence, investigating feedback acceptance with respect to relational justice is timely. Relational justice includes procedural justice (Van Dijke et al., 2015) , informational justice and interpersonal justice (Nasr et al., 2019) , and excludes distributive justice (Sousa & Vala, 2002) .",

            "text": "Moreover, it is yet unclear how the quality of the rater-ratee relationship affects feedback acceptance, especially when raters exhibit relational justice. Indeed, recent research suggests that leaders having high leader-member exchange (LMX) with some members may offer more mentoring and empowerment to them, while giving less of these incentives to others with whom they have low LMX (Mumtaz & Rowley, 2020) . Nevertheless, research is equivocal regarding LMX as an antecedent to, or consequence of, justice as a proxy of ratee reactions to the PA system (Erdogan, 2002) . Despite numerous studies on antecedents and consequences of LMX (e.g., Harris et al., 2014) , the extant literature still calls for investigation on how justice perceptions predict LMX (Mumtaz & Rowley, 2020) in the context of a PA system. Drawing from the above, the present study investigates ratees' PA feedback acceptance as a function of their perceptions of relational justice. Furthermore, it investigates the role of LMX as a mechanism behind the above relationship. We expect to contribute to the PA literature by focusing on three issues. First, our study empirically examines relational justice based on three justice dimensions, that is, procedural, informational, and interpersonal. In so doing, our study attempts to emphasize relational needs of ratees, e.g., social connection, cooperation, respect, communication, fulfilling which can be helpful in motivating them to participate in the PA feedback process. Second, our study seeks to examine the underlying mechanism behind the relationship between relational justice and feedback acceptance. Being mindful of the relational context of PA, which is grounded in social exchanges, we add to our line of reasoning more support provided by LMX theory (Graen & Scandura, 1987 ) that explains the relationship between each rater-ratee dyad uniquely (Lam et al., 2017) . Therefore, we consider the quality of the unique rater-ratee relationship to be of importance for the relational justice-feedback acceptance relationship (Elicker et al., 2006) .",

Building on the notion that fairness often serves as a substitute of trust (Van den Bos et al., 1998) , it stands to reason that the relationship between relational justice and feedback acceptance, both directly and through LMX, can be stronger when supervisory trust is low than when it is high. This is because when people have high trust in their supervisor, as reflected in perceived consistency between actual and desired actions of supervisors (Javed et al., 2018) , they are likely to assume a high level of fairness anyway, rendering weaker effects of relational justice on feedback acceptance both directly and through LMX.

However, researchers have a lack of consensus about its conceptualization. They view it in four distinct ways. First, some researchers believe justice is an innate relational concept, as it is arguably linked to an individual's moral goodness (Wielsch, 2013) . Hence, there exists the need for virtue in all aspects of justice, including distributional, procedural, informational, and interpersonal (Malague\u00f1o et al., 2019) . Second, some scholars separate the distribution of resources and benefits to the target from the quality of interaction with the target. They hold that only interactional component(s) of justice represent relational justice (Nasr et al., 2019) . Third, some researchers maintain that procedural justice and interactional justice complement each other (Ndjabou\u00e9 et al., 2012) , and hence, these may together contribute toward the formulation of a target's relational justice perceptions.",

In addition, they also emphasize the exclusion of a distributional component (Gewirtz, 1998) . The key difference between the third and the final approaches is that the former is silent about distributive justice, whereas the latter explicitly excludes distributive justice while defining relational justice. Employee reactions to procedures are contingent upon their concerns for a social relationship with their supervisors who hold the authority to employ those procedures (Tyler & Lind, 1992) . In addition, distribution of resources and benefits is often specific to individuals, depending on levels of deservingness. Such deservingness separates distributional aspects from interactional aspects, as all individuals deserve respect and dignity regardless of what resources and benefits they should get (Gewirtz, 1998) . Extrapolating these considerations to organizational justice in the PA context, Sousa and Vala (2002) maintain that employees consider PA more accurate when they perceive procedural and interactional justice have been demonstrated than when distributive justice is upheld. Also, procedural and interactional components together are found to have predicted employee perceptions about the authority more strongly than the distributional component (Gouveia-Pereira et al., 2003) .",

The rater is supposed to demonstrate adherence to rules on the behalf of the organization. Hence, it stands to reason that ratees' feedback acceptance is closely tied with their relational justice perceptions of the PA process as administered by the rater (Wallace et al., 2016) . PA research suggests ratees' feedback acceptance is instrumental to success of the PA process. When ratees accept and internalize their feedback during the PA process, their likelihood to improve subsequent performance is high (Iqbal et al., 2019) . Feedback acceptance is defined as \"the recipient's belief that the feedback is an accurate portrayal of his or her performance\" (Ilgen et al., 1979, p. 356) . Thus, it reflects people's perception of accuracy of the performance feedback they receive (Anseel & Lievens, 2009) . Four factors are considered crucial for feedback acceptance: (1) the feedback content, e.g., accuracy; (2) the feedback context, e.g., legitimacy; (3) the feedback recipient, i.e., the ratee; and (4) the feedback provider, i.e., the rater (Boudrias et al., 2014) . In fact, feedback originates from the rater, s/he cannot be detached from the feedback content and the context. Therefore, characteristics of the rater are considered to influence ratee feedback acceptance the most (Ilgen et al., 1979) .",

So, employees consider fair feedback a valuable resource that can contribute to their development and self-worth (Krings et al., 2015) .

Similarly, employees may expect sensitivity of interpersonal treatment (interpersonal justice), as well as honest and open communication, and access to information (informational justice) (Cropanzano et al., 2002) . The raters may treat ratees with respect and dignity with the objective of making feedback delivery more interpersonally fair, increasing the likelihood of feedback acceptance (Leung et al., 2001) .

The interrelationship of agent and system lies in the fact that formulated procedures of an organization are mainly implemented by the rater, which may result in integrity and fairness of PA ratings (Jawahar, 2007) . Ratees' justice perceptions regarding procedures run by the rater and interaction with the rater serve as the foundation of employee satisfaction with agent and system, which may foster a high-quality rater-ratee relationship. This notion is supported by Cropanzano et al., (2002) , who argue that the ability of the rater to effectively implement PA procedures and to treat ratees with respect, dignity, and integrity may help them develop a high-quality relationship with ratees. It is noteworthy for managers who desire demonstration of relational justice that per actor-focused model (Scott et al., 2014) , raters have the maximum freedom in demonstrating interpersonal justice, followed by informational justice, and then procedural justice. Thus, establishing high LMX by demonstrating high relational justice is not beyond the control of a manager (Scott et al., 2009) .",

Supervisory trust hence reflects an enduring characteristic of the supervisor-subordinate relationship, which is developed over time through mutual interaction (Saunders & Thornhill, 2004) . The experiences and interactions of ratees with raters contribute to shaping the trust that ratees have in their respective raters (Ambrose & Schminke, 2003) . Supervisory trust is considered a general characteristic of relationships, which is an integral psychological context element of supervisor-subordinate interaction (Colquitt et al., 2007) . Hence, the presence of supervisory trust can be considered as an indication of a high-quality rater-ratee relationship.

However, in the presence of supervisory trust, the association of justice perceptions with LMX can be strengthened further (Aryee et al., 2002 ). So, the higher level of trust with which raters follow the organizational procedures and fulfil their role of performance evaluator may reflect the strength of relational justice-LMX relationship, especially in the eyes of ratees (Saunders & Thornhill, 2004) . Here, we argue that for ratees with low supervisory trust, relational justice demonstrated by the supervisor matters most for LMX. Ratees with high supervisory trust are expected to assume a high level of fairness anyway, and thus, for them there is a weaker effect of relational justice on LMX. Connecting the above discussion to recent review of Ashford et al. (2016) on performance feedback, we propose that supervisory trust is likely to moderate the intervening association of ratee relational justice perceptions and their feedback acceptance through LMX.",

Trust in supervisor not only weakens the association between justice perceptions of ratees and LMX, but it also amplifies the mediation effect of LMX on relational justice-feedback acceptance relationship (Elicker et al., 2006) . Thus, we hypothesized that:",

In fact, we borrowed a role-playing video, demonstrating two performance review meetings between a manager (Mike) and his employee (Abigail) having a non-apparent disability, and a meeting between the HR manager (Celeste) and the ex-manager (Nora) of the same employee. Job Accommodation Network (JAN) had developed this high-quality video for their professional use, and on our request, they permitted us to use it for the present research. From this video-taped material, we produced the following three videos. The first video shows a meeting between the HR manager and the ex-manager providing information that the employee has no performance problems. We used this video to control the performance of the employee across experimental conditions. The second video shows a performance review meeting between the manager and the employee in which the manager demonstrates unfair treatment with the employee (unfair condition). The third video shows another performance review meeting between the same manager-employee dyad in which the manager demonstrates fair treatment with the employee (fair condition).",

Therefore, Mike-the manager-in both the fair and unfair conditions can provide flexibility to his employees, if required. However, he turns down some employees' requests for a flexible work schedule and takes more serious actions against them, e.g., censure, but accedes to the similar request of some other employees. In this state of affairs, Abigail, an employee who is a good performer, but due to her therapy exercises, is unable to observe her office timings regularly. In the first scenario, Abigail expects Mike to set a flexible work schedule for her. Additionally, she does not want an adverse mid-term performance review. She also wants to be treated fairly, politely, candidly, and with dignity and respect by her manager. In the second scenario, Abigail expects Mike to set a flexible work schedule for her. Additionally, she wants Mike to help her in keeping her good performance continue by providing relevant feedback, so that she keeps on meeting the performance standards. Abigail also wants to have a trust relationship with Mike. Before reading the scenarios and watching videos about both fair and unfair conditions, each subject was asked to imagine him/herself as an employee shown in the videos and record responses concerning, justice perceptions, LMX, feedback acceptance, and supervisory trust.",

This finding helps us understand that high versus low relational justice matters in the formulation of ratee reactions to PA feedback. Put simply, when relational justice is high, ratees tend to accept feedback with less care about distributional aspects. When relational justice is low, it is less likely to get ratees accept feedback, and ratees tend to seek distributive justice before accepting feedback. This finding also suggests the relative importance of both components of SET over another. That, social exchanges overtake transactional ones when relational justice is high, and vice versa.",

This finding provides more clarity that when relational justice is high, LMX is more likely to be the underlying mechanism behind the relational justice-feedback acceptance relationship, compared to when relational justice is low. Although both possibilities may exist that in relational exchanges, LMX is likely to be sensitive either to relational justice perceptions or feedback acceptance, in the case of the present study, the latter holds true. Ostensibly, ratees perceive high quality LMX when they perceive high relational justice, and vice versa. Thus, the relationship between relational justice and LMX is likely to remain direct. However, congruence between high vs low LMX and positive vs negative feedback needs more clarity, especially under the tenets of SET. This entails more investigation about when relational exchanges alone suffice, and when economic exchanges insistently covariate, making the relationship between LMX and feedback acceptance, inverse, insignificant, or both.",

The other possible explanation is that the SET offers a notion of reciprocity, which provides that the development of employee perceptions of relational justice requires reciprocation in the form of favorable employee reactions. Taking it further, LMX theory provides that in high-quality professional relationships, people offer something of value to their dyadic partner, and the fairness of exchange is vital for defining the level of future interactions between them (Erdogan, 2002) . Corroborating the above theoretical explanations, our results suggest that for ratees to have the relational justice-feedback acceptance relationship strengthened, LMX appears to be a useful mechanism.",

Trust in the supervisor is an important factor in the above relations. It makes sense to expect whether employees are already earning benefits of their relationship with their supervisor, e.g., high relational justice, and they need supervisory trust the least. And, if they feel deprived of the same benefits, perceiving low relational justice, alternatively they will bank upon supervisory trust the most. More importantly, exchange relationships especially the relational ones are dynamic. That is, on the timeline, when employees feel benefited due to their relations with their supervisors, they tend to trust them more, and on the contrary when employees feel to have incurred costs due to their relations with supervisors their trust dwindles (Miles, 2012) .

Although our study had a repeated measure design, we realize that still there exists room for assessing a much longer relationship. Besides, per the design of our study, the supervisory trust could moderate a relational justice-feedback acceptance relationship because both these variables are specific to events, e.g., PA.

Hence, in order to put the above agenda into action, PA theory and practice have started shifting their focus from PA ratings to PA feedback. For instance, with the purpose of making their PM system more effective, Adobe has developed a toolkit, namely \"check-in,\" which has been downloaded by over 500 companies. On a brief note, \"Adobe's Check-in Toolkit\" provides a three-phase PM system (expectation-feedback-development), in which performance feedback plays a pivotal role (Stone et al., 2019) .",

As introduced by a global pharmaceutical giant, Bristol Myers Squibb, performance partnership is an alternative performance management system. Unlike a traditional PA process, in this system managers are not engaged in performance ratings, annual performance review meetings, pay increase decisions, etc.; instead managers and their employees hold regular meetings throughout the year. In these meetings, together they set and review performance expectations and goals. Employees do not have to wait for a formal year-end feedback from their managers, rather more readily, they receive timely performance feedback, as and when needed. As a result of performance partnership, employees become participants, managers become coaches, and both solve performance problems together. Hence, positive relationship between managers and employees being the central feature of performance partnership strengthens performance feedback approach (Mathis & Jackson, 2010) . Putting this research agenda forward, this study not only endorses PA feedback, but also suggests a relational approach to performance feedback which is likely to increase acceptance of feedback by its recipients, that is, by establishing a link between relational justice and PA feedback acceptance, as perceptions of injustice potentially inhibit employees' propensity to accept performance feedback (Murphy, 2020) .",

Toward building interactive working environments, organizations may impart sensitivity training to their managers (Robbins & Coulter, 2018) . In order to effectively impart a sensitivity training, organizations may take their managers away from their workplaces and put them in unstructured interactions among them. These open interactions are likely to provide them with insights into their own as well as their interactional partners' behaviors, which will help them learn that how their behaviors are seen by others. This sensitization encourages them to improve their interpersonal relationships with their employees. Such a congenial atmosphere in any workplace helps in strengthening quality relationship and thus aids in feedback acceptance, which is considered to make the PA system successful.

Notably, we tested only basic and mediation hypotheses using data collected for Study 1. Using the data collected for Study 2, we tested all hypotheses including the moderated mediation hypothesis. Another limitation of the present study is that the measurement of LMX was seized from the viewpoint of member/ratee only. The present study hence focuses on how ratees perceive their relationships with raters, whereas in future studies, an additional insight might be given by viewing the perceptions of both, that is, rater and ratee. The dyadic approach will help in analyzing the results more comprehensively, by considering the rater's views and perceptions during feedback provision. Regarding feedback acceptance, we realize that omission of the valence of feedback (positive vs negative) has limited our findings, as interplay between high vs low relational justice, high vs low LMX, and positive vs negative feedback could have provided more clarity, especially under the tenets of relational exchanges. At last, we also realize that PA activities often take place as regular events in organizations. Therefore, we urge for future researchers either to restrict range of data or control certain aspects of PA, e.g., frequency of events, degree of formality of feedback.",

            "text": "Performance feedback is a necessity of all PA stakeholders, including the rater, the ratee, and the organization. Organizations want ratees to accept their performance feedback so that they remain focused on organizational goals. Toward this end, the present study suggests organizations to employ a relational approach. The relational approach propagates that for ratees to accept performance feedback, the respective rater and the PA system (or organization) demonstrate relational justice. For this purpose, it is functional for them to develop a high-quality relationship with ratees and solidify a high level of ratee trust in the rater. The relational approach is expected to help managers develop a performance partnership. The present study was designed to provide empirical evidence for this idea. We more specifically tested whether (1) ratee relational justice perceptions predict their feedback acceptance; (2) LMX mediates the above relationship; and (3) supervisory trust has moderated mediation effect on the above relationship through LMX. Results support the first two relationships, and the third one could only get a partial support. The study concluded that ratees tend to accept performance feedback when they perceive the rater and the PA system to operate with high relational justice.",
