While usually connected via radio transmissions to a base station on the ground, such aircraft are increasingly equipped with decision-making capabilities that allow them to autonomously carry out complex missions in applications such as transport, mapping and surveillance, or crop and irrigation monitoring. Despite the obvious safety-criticality of such systems, it is impossible to foresee all situations an autonomous aircraft might encounter and thus make a safety case purely by analyzing all of the potential behaviors in advance. A critical part of the safety engineering of a drone is therefore to carefully monitor the actual behavior during the flight, so that the health status of the system can be assessed and mitigation procedures (such as a return to the base station or an emergency landing) can be initiated when needed.",

The development of a monitoring framework for an autonomous aircraft differs significantly from a monitoring framework in a more standard setting, such as network monitoring. A key consideration is that while the specification language needs to be highly expressive, the monitor must operate within strictly limited resources, and the monitor itself needs to be highly reliable: any interference with the normal operation of the aircraft could have fatal consequences.",

This is necessary in order to discover a deterioration of a sensor module. At the same time, the expressiveness and the precision of the monitor must be balanced against the available computing resources. The reliability requirement goes beyond pure correctness and robustness of the execution. Most importantly, reliability requires that the peak resource consumption of the monitor in terms of energy, time, and space needs to be known ahead of time. This means that it must be possible to compute these resource requirements statically based on an analysis of the specification. The determination whether the drone is equipped with sufficient hardware can then be made before the flight, and the occurrence of dynamic failures such as running out of memory or sudden drops in voltage can be ruled out. Finally, the collection of the data from the on-board architecture is a non-trivial problem: While the monitor needs access to almost the complete system state, the data needs to be retrieved non-intrusively such that it does not interfere with the normal system operation.",

In an RTLola specification, input streams that collect data from sensors, networks, etc., are filtered and combined into output streams that contain data aggregated from multiple sources and over multiple points in time such as over sliding windows of some real-time length. Trigger conditions over these output streams then identify critical situations. An RTLola specification is translated into a monitor defined in a hardware description language and subsequently realized on an FPGA. Before deployment, the specification is checked for consistency and the minimal requirements on the FPGA are computed. The hardware monitor is then placed in a central position where as much sensor data as possible can be collected; during the execution, it then extracts the relevant information. In addition to requiring no physical changes to the system architecture, this integration incurs no further traffic on the bus.",

Rather than focusing on data-flow, the family of Lola-languages puts an emphasis on statistical measures and has successfully been used to monitor synchronous, discrete time properties of autonomous aircraft [1, 23] . In contrast to that, RTLola [12, 22] supports real-time capabilities and efficient aggregation of data occurring with arbitrary frequency, while forgoing parametrization for efficiency [11] .

Such languages are a concise way to describe temporal behaviors with the shortcoming that they are usually limited to qualitative statements, i.e. boolean verdicts. This limitation was addressed for STL [10] by introducing a quantitative semantics indicating the robustness of a satisfaction. To specify continuous signal patterns, specification languages based on regular expressions can be beneficial, e.g. Signal Regular Expressions (SRE) [5] . The R2U2 tool [18] stands out in particular as it successfully brought a logic closely related to STL onto unmanned aerial systems as an external hardware implementation.",

However, signal reflection or a low number of GPS satellites in range can result in imprecisions in the position approximation.

To this end, it detects inconsistencies in the specification such as type errors, e.g. an lossy conversion of a floating point number to an integer, or timing errors, e.g. accessing values that might not exist. Further, it provides two execution modes: an interpreter and an FPGA compilation. The interpreter allows the specifier to validate their specification. For this, it requires a trace, i.e. a series of data that is expected to occur during an execution of the system. It then checks whether a trace complies with the specification and reports the points in time when specified bounds are violated. After successfully validating the specification, it can be compiled into VHDL code. Yet again, the compiled code can be analyzed with respect to the space and power consumption. This information allows for evaluating whether the available hardware suffices for running the RTLola monitor. An RTLola specification consists of input and output streams, as well as trigger conditions. Input streams describe data the system produces asynchronously and provides to the monitor. Output streams use this data to assess the health state of the system e.g. by computing statistical information. Trigger conditions distinguish desired and undesired behavior.

Sensors can produce incorrect values, e.g. when too few GPS satellites are in range for an accurate trilateration or if the aircraft flies above the range of a radio altimeter. A simple exemplary validation is to check whether the measured altitude is non-negative. If such a check fails, the values are meaningless, so the system should not take them into account in its computations. Geo-Fence. During the mission, the aircraft has permission to fly inside a zone delimited by a polygon, called a geo-fence. The specification checks whether a face of the fence has been crossed, in which case the aircraft needs to ensure that it does not stray further from the permitted zone. Sensor Cross-Validation. Sensor redundancy allows for validating a sensor reading by comparing it against readings of other sensors. An agreement between the values raises the confidence in their correctness. An example is the cross-validation of the GPS module against the accelerometer. Integrating the readings of the latter twice yields an absolute position which can be compared against the GPS position. Figure 5 points out some representative sub-properties of the previously described specification in RTLola, which are too long to discuss them in detail.

The following table details the resource consumption of each sub-specification reported by the synthesis tool Vivado. The number of flip-flops (FF) indicates the memory consumption in bits; neither specification requires more than 600B of memory. The number of LUTs (Lookup Tables) is an indicator for the complexity of the logic. The sensor validation, despite being significantly longer than the cross-validation, requires the least amount of LUTs. The reason is that its computations are simple in comparison: Rather than computing sliding window aggregations or line intersections, it mainly consists of simple thresholding. The number of multiplexers (MUX) reflects this as well: Since thresholding requires comparisons, which translate to multiplexers, the validation requires twice as many of them. Lastly, the power consumption of the monitor is extremely low: When idle, neither specification requires more than 156mW and even under peak pressure, the power consumption does not exceed 2.1W. For comparison, a Raspberry Pi needs between 1.1W (Model 2B) and 2.7W (Model 4B) when idle and roughly twice as much under peak pressure, i.e., 2.1W and 6.4W, respectively. 5 Note that the geo-fence specification checks for 12 intersections in parallel, one for each face of the fence (cf. Fig. 2 ). Adapting the number of faces allows for scaling the amount of FPGA resources required, as can be seen in Fig. 6a . The graph does not grow linearly because the realization problem of VHDL code onto an FPGA is a multi-dimensional optimization problem with several pareto-optimal solutions. Under default settings, the optimizer found a solution for four faces that required fewer LUTs than for three faces. At the same time, the worst negative slack time (WNST) of the four-face solution was lower than the WNST for the three-face solution as well (cf. Fig. 6b) , indicating that the former performs worst in terms of running time.",

In the meantime, the monitor was validated on log files from past missions of the superARTIS replayed under realistic conditions. During a flight, the controller polls samples from sensors, estimates the current position, and sends the respective data to the logger and monitor. In the replay setting, the process remains the same except for one detail: Rather than receiving data from the actual sensors, the data sent to the controller is read from a past log file in the same frequency in which they were recorded. The timing and logging behavior is equivalent to a real execution. This especially means that the replayed data points will be recorded again in the same way. Control computations take place on a machine identical to the one on the actual aircraft. As a result, from the point of view of the monitor, the replay mode and the actual flight are indistinguishable. Note that the setup is open-loop, i.e. , the monitor cannot influence the running system. Therefore, the replay mode using real data is more realistic than a high-fidelity simulation.",

Additionally, when replaying the sensor data of the experiment in the enclosed backyard from Sect. 2.1, the erratic GPS sensor data lead to 113 violations regarding the GPS module on its own. Note that many of these violations point to the same culprit: a low number of available GPS satellites, for example, correlates with the occurrence of peaks in the GPS velocity. Moreover, the cross validation issued another 36 alarms due to a divergence of IMU and GPS readings. Other checks, for example detecting a deterioration of the GPS module based on its output frequency, were not violated in either flight and thus not reported.",

The distinguishing features of our approach are the high level of expressiveness of the RTLola specification language combined with the formal guarantees on the resource usage. The comprehensive tool framework facilitates the development of complex specifications, which can be validated on log data before they get translated into a hardware-based monitor. The automatic analysis of the specification derives the minimal requirements on the development board needed for safe operation. If they are met, the specification is realized on an FPGA and integrated into the superARTIS architecture. Our experience shows that the overall system works correctly and reliably, even without thorough system-level testing. This is due to the non-interfering instrumentation, the validated specification, and the formal guarantees on the absence of dynamic failures of the monitor.",
