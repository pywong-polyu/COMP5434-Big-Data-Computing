Healthcare workers doing duties in COVID-19 areas showed 2.7% positivity, while those doing duties in non-COVID-19 emergency areas showed a positivity of 2.2%. Conclusion. Our study shows that the prevalence of detectable antibodies was low in the general population in India and many patients were asymptomatic as seen in the blood donors, especially the labor class. Maximum exposure was present in young healthy males of labor class who remained asymptomatic. e healthcare workers were more exposed to COVID-19 as compared to the general population probably due to lack of precaution and awareness. ose doing non-COVID-19 duties were also exposed appreciably and needed to take all the precautions required for COVID-19 duties.",

However, testing of specimens from multiple sites may improve the sensitivity and reduce false-negative test results [3] . Due to the high infectivity rate and a majority of patients being asymptomatic, widespread serological screening was required. Memory antibody (IgG type) assessment is useful as many healthy individuals in the epidemic area may be asymptomatic but infected and possess a threat for further spread of the virus. Monitoring IgG will in turn help us for guiding future decisions on the right time to relax social distancing measures and minimize possible epidemic outbreaks [4] . e role of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, verified by PCR, has shown positive results for confirming the infection [5] . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections were believed to originate in bats, and these were transmitted directly to humans [6] . Following the seroprevalence testing in healthy blood donors, we can monitor the spread of the virus among healthy people and, thus, will eventually lead to implementing strategies to reduce the spread. Evidence is also emerging that monocyte/macrophage dysfunction may be central to the immunopathology [7] and that the functional characteristics of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) might be a determinant of disease outcome. Antibody response against enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 comprises immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG3, IgG1, and IgA antibodies to glycoproteins of the virus envelope and nucleoproteins (NP, internal to the envelope). IgG (IgG3 and IgG1) antibodies against virus envelope glycoproteins have many functional characteristics that make up the most efficacious antibody response against viruses, as illustrated by human immunodeficiency virus-(HIV-) 1 infection [8] . Healthcare workers are the frontline workforces who provide care to both suspected as well as confirmed COVID-19 cases. us, they are at a higher risk of acquiring the disease, and if they are infected, they possess a serious risk for vulnerable patients as well as fellow healthcare workers. us, a need was felt to conduct a study to assess the IgG antibody status in healthcare workers differentiating those who were in COVID-19 and others in non-COVID-19 emergency duties during this pandemic. Antibodies in healthcare workers will help in maximizing our safe manpower resources and avoid unnecessary quarantine. Comparison with the general population which was represented by asymptomatic blood donors was carried out to assess the prevalence of antibodies in the population. e objective of the study was that, during the time of pandemics and panic amongst the general population and the government, we should be able to provide data regarding the safety measures of our medical staff and the development of antibodies in the population. A material and method setting study was carried out by the Department of Transfusion Medicine, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, in June 2020.It was carried out in 2121 asymptomatic blood donors and 560 medical healthcare workers working in COVID-19 and also non-COVID-19 emergency duties. e work was a part of university policy, and in order to screen its healthcare workers and blood donors for COVID-19 antibodies, adequate precautions and decisions could be taken accordingly. e department of transfusion medicine has one of the biggest blood banks in the country and caters to donors all over the state of Uttar Pradesh and, thus, represents a huge proportion of the asymptomatic population of the state of Northern India. King George's Medical University is the largest medical university in the country and is giving both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care to the patients. Sample collection: blood donors were allowed to donate blood only after fulfilling all the criteria laid down by the FDA of India with additional history of excluding COVID-19 suspects.",

Out of them, 114 had worked in COVID-19 duties and 446 had worked in non-COVID-19 emergencies areas. COVID-19 area duties were further subdivided into triage, holding area, isolation, and COVID-19-related duties. Healthcare workers working in different departments were screened to analyze the high-risk areas for COVID-19. 2 ml blood was collected from all the healthcare workers in EDTA vials. Blood was collected from healthcare workers from COVID-19 areas only after 14 days of quarantine which was the standing government policy. Non-COVID-19 workers were not quarantined; hence, blood was collected when they were on duty. e collection was carried out according to the guidelines of the university for understanding the spread of COVID-19 in the university which can be used later for duty rostering purposes. e samples were run on architect i2000 and evaluated for their Immunoglobulin G status. 24 samples that tested positive for antibodies were retested on a rapid card test Q Line Rapid for COVID-19 IgG to confirm its sensitivity and specificity.",

            "text": "Development of COVID-19 IgG antibodies in individuals indicated that they have been exposed to COVID-19 infection within the past two months, remained asymptomatic, and consequently developed antibodies against COVID-19. ese individuals had been asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 at some point in time. Bastian Fischere et al. also stated that all donors had undergone a complete medical examination before donation, they did not give any history of current or recent diseases and had no symptoms, and signs of infections were present such as fever Medicine 3 or an increased leukocyte count. None of their seropositive blood donors for IgG antibodies reported a known positive medical history of SARS-CoV-2 infection [11] . COVID-19positive antibodies were found in males only, which probably implied that females had not been exposed to COVID-19 due to the social and cultural structure of India in which majority of them remain mainly confined to their households while males tend to move out, mingle, and interact with groups. Hence, this increased the chances of exposure of males to COVID-19 during which they remained asymptomatic and, thus, resulted in the formation of antibodies. e age group commonly which was infected and remained asymptomatic was 18-29 years. Young males are usually more social and move in the community despite restrictions of lockdown. is was probably the reason for their exposure. As maturity and responsibility increased, people were more aware of the seriousness of the pandemic and, hence, avoided the exposure which was absent above 50 years of age. Iversen et al. reported that \"between April 15 and April 23, 2020, 29,884 healthcare workers were invited to take part in the study, out of which 29,117 (97%) participants were included, amongst which 28,792 (98%) provided SARS-CoV-2 antibody results. e mean age was 44\u00b74 years (SD 12\u00b76) years. 22,715 (78\u00b79%) participants were female, and 6077 (21\u00b71%) were male\" [12] . Our study showed a different age group and gender because India is a country with a separate social structure. Replacement donors were more exposed to COVID-19 as compared to voluntary donors, with the reason being probably the level of awareness. Voluntary donors are selfmotivated about blood donation, and the awareness levels for COVID-19 are also more as they are aware of their social responsibilities and needs. e hemoglobin status of blood donors was 14.05 and showed appropriate hemoglobin which signified that COVID-19 had not been detrimental to their general health. COVID-19 was supposed to be a disease of the affluent class, but higher positivity in the labor class implied that may be due to better immunity, in India, due to multiple exposures to organisms, they were able to tolerate the COVID-19 asymptomatically in contrast to the affluent class. No published literature was obtained for the abovementioned facts because of the geographical variation of each country.",

Maximum positivity and, hence, the highest level of infection were seen in the respiratory unit and prosthodontics as they were the specialties maximally exposed to infection in COVID-19. Chen WQ et al. performed IgG antibodies to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) among 1,147 healthcare workers in 3 hospitals that admitted SARS patients in mid-May 2003. ey had two groups: one which worked with SARS patients and the other which has never worked with them. eir seroprevalence rate was 88.9% (80/ 90) for healthcare workers with SARS and 1.4% (15/1,057) for apparently healthy healthcare workers. e seroprevalence in the reference group was 0.4% (3/709) [14] . ese findings suggested that inapparent infection was uncommon. Initially, healthcare workers did not realize the importance of precautions in these specialties which may be a contributing factor for their exposure to COVID-19 as indicated by the presence of COVID-19 IgG antibodies. A low level of immunity among unaffected healthcare workers reinforces the need for adequate personal protection and other infection control measures in hospitals to prevent future epidemics.",
