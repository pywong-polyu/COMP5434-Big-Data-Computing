Therapists treating the incarcerated face unique challenges that therapists in traditional settings do not, like security risks, maintaining confidentiality, navigating dual relationships, and acquiring appropriate training. As such, it is imperative that carceral therapists have access to incarcerated informed clinical supervision. Yet, the literature on this is sparse. In this paper, we propose the Tadros Theory of Change, a clinical supervision framework for working with incarcerated individuals and their families. Multicultural and ethical considerations are explored.",

Parallel to the rising rates of incarceration is widening racial disparities in carceral settings (Nellis, 2016) . The overrepresentation of racially minoritized individuals represent the \"mass incarceration\" era in the USA over the last fifty years (Shlafer et al., 2020) . Individuals with mental health and substance use issues are an often-overlooked population in carceral settings; frequently, these individuals are also racially and ethnically minoritized (Al-Rousan et al., 2017) .",

Many more are likely undiagnosed (Mobley, 2008) . Consequently, the US criminal justice system has become the nation's largest mental health provider. At present, there are ten times more mentally ill individuals in carceral settings than there are in psychiatric facilities (Torrey et al., 2010) . This phenomenon is exacerbated by a lack of quality mental healthcare options in carceral settings, resulting in a massive public health issue with social and economic implications (Al-Rousan et al., 2017) . Marginalized subpopulations such as women, the elderly, and people of color are among the most vulnerable in correctional settings (Al-Rousan et al., 2017) . Although there are books on the subject (e.g., Van Voorhis and Salisbury, 2016) , there are limited training pipeline opportunities for therapists to develop expertise in clinically treating the incarcerated population (Mobley, 2008) . Given the highly specialized nature of correctional environments, those who provide clinical services to the incarcerated must receive competent clinical supervision. Presently, however, the literature severely lacks research and guidance on clinical supervision in the criminal justice system.",

One method of rehabilitation is the direct provision of mental health treatment services. Historically, group therapy and case management were the primary mental health treatment services in correctional settings (Elliot & Schrink, 2013) . Counseling in correctional settings \"is an intensive, purposeful, interactive process between a counselor, who is prepared to deal with the special problems posed by a correctional environment, and a client, who has been\u2026 placed in a correctional facility\" (Elliot & Schrink, 2013, p. 24) .

A study examined conjoint group therapy with incarcerated people and their families, broadly finding group family therapy beneficial (Ostby, 1968) . Similarly, Frager (1978) recommended multiple family group therapy as an effective intervention in both psychiatric and correctional settings. However, since Ostby (1968) and Frager (1978) published their papers, security, confidentiality, and treatment practices have changed substantially, and to date, researchers have not reevaluated these relational approaches. It appears that therapists who would like to treat the family as a system within incarcerated settings, must do so individually, meaning that many facilities do not offer family therapy services . Marriage and family therapists (MFTs) are still able to work systemically with individuals by considering diagnosis and treatment through a systems lens (Tadros et al., 2021a, b, c) . However, working systemically with individuals is complex and best conducted with guidance from an experienced, systemic clinical supervisor; therefore, we offer suggestions from this model to effectively supervise MFTs who wish to work clinically with this population.",

Specifically, this theory had been utilized with a lesbian couple experiencing relational problems while one partner was incarcerated (Tadros & Smithee, 2021) . Below, elements of this model will be explained followed by a brief section highlighting how the integration of these models coalesces into the Tadros Theory of Change.

The structure of the family system is related to the formation of rules for the family in order for the family to function (Minuchin, 1974) . SFTs believe problems in the family system occur because of a maladaptive hierarchy or unhealthy boundaries in the system (Minuchin & Fishman, 1981) . SFTs believe problems may occur in family systems due to the family not being flexible enough to effectively execute a systemic or family life cycle developmental task (Minuchin & Fishman, 1981) . However, one must first understand the position and function of the problem behavior then, who the behavior affects, and perceptions of the behavior. A family who presents with boundaries on the extreme of either end of the spectrum may develop problematic patterns of interaction (Minuchin, 1974) . Subsystems in a family are constantly changing; thus, families consistently may change their roles, dynamics, and functioning (Minuchin & Fishman, 1981) .",

To apply structural concepts effectively in supervision, a therapist should be able to function on their own as an individual while still being connected to the system. Functioning autonomously is especially important in carceral settings where access to a supervisor may be limited. Supervisors should facilitate discussions with therapists surrounding external influences and their impact on supervision and therapy in the context of developing ways to maintain appropriate structure and boundaries (Bursky & Cook, 2016) . One structure-based strategy to use in supervision is to teach and practice role-plays that therapists can implement with incarcerated clients (Magaletta & McLearen, 2015; Mobley, 2008) . For example, a supervisor may teach a therapist how to conduct an effective therapist-client role-play, in which the client role-plays phone calls with family members at home that focus on creating/maintaining family boundaries and dynamics. Further, because working in carceral settings likely consist of multiple conflictual roles to both prioritize security and well-being, supervisors should help therapists accept their role as a necessary dual relationship for the purpose of clarifying and modeling hierarchy and boundaries conversations with their clients. In summary, supervisors should attend to therapist autonomy, hierarchy, and boundaries across all systems of a carceral setting, and fluidly navigate multiple roles.",

Narrative therapy focuses on the stories people tell about themselves, these stories can greatly impact how they perceive problems in general (Epston, 2016) . Therapeutic change becomes possible as clients gain insight which results in reauthoring their narratives (Suddeath et al., 2017) . White (2007) discussed narrative therapy as more of a \"way of being,\" rather than a set of steps or rules in theory, meaning that the therapists who employ this are a certain way more than they do a certain thing. The role of the therapist is to aid clients in uncovering origins of their problems in order to create newly constructed truths. Through social constructionism, therapists are to inquire about how clients experienced certain problems rather than asking about causal conditions (Epston, 2016) . A client brings their own expertise to construct their perspectives on what reality is (Suddeath et al., 2017) . Narrative therapy focuses on the client's perception as reality, language is used to describe a person's truth, and experiences are socially constructed and focus on the effects of problems not the problems themselves (White and Espton, 1990) . Helping clients shift perception in their stories is one of the main tenets of narrative therapy (Madigan, 2011) .",

Narrative reconstruction, and building a redemptive identity, helps clients see alternatives in their lives, for example, where they succeeded rather than when they did not. Supervision should focus on teaching and incorporating interventions such as highlighting turning points that are building toward a redemptive identity and \"a ceremony on accomplishments,\" or a letter listing the individual's successes, are an excellent visual representation of their accomplishments. In turn, one's journey can be reframed in a positive manner.

A clinician can instill hope within the client through psychoeducation in preparation for release. In solution-focused therapy, a therapist and client collaboratively set realistic, achievable goals through a positive, strength-based lens. This model focuses on what a client does presently and what they will do in the future rather than attempting to understand events of the past, which is what makes this model crucial for the incarcerated population. Individuals are incarcerated due to their past mistakes, and many see this punishment as a definition and a label of who they are.

As such, a supervision framework lacks cultural humility without a comprehensive approach to multicultural considerations (Patallo, 2019) . Individuals, couples, and families \"bring with them a myriad of diversity factors into therapy, multicultural competency has also become a crucial component in the development of clinicians during clinical supervision and training\" (Tohidian & Quek, 2017, p. 573). Interestingly, the literature indicates it was historically uncommon for therapists in training to be given the chance to work with a supervisor of a different ethnicity (Okafor, et al., 2014; Wieling & Marshall, 1999) . Additionally, individuals who did have this opportunity reported positive outcomes linked with this relationship. Further, research indicates that therapists considered ethnic differences as an additional benefit of the supervisory relationship due to the distinct insights and the stimulating of future dialogues of cultural differences (Okafor, et al., 2014; Wieling & Marshall, 1999) . Tohidian and Quek (2017) discussed six categories of multicultural supervision: supervisor's multicultural stances, therapist's multicultural encounters, competencybased content in supervision, processes surrounding multicultural supervision, culturally attuned interventions, and multicultural supervisory alliance. American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) (2019) guidelines for approved supervisors require supervisors to be sensitive to contextual variables including gender, culture, ethnicity, and economics. Therapists are recommended to utilize culturally appropriate interventions and to be mindful of what their client's culture allows (Tadros & Finney, 2018 Tadros & Owens, 2021) . Specifically, it is advised to take on a curious stance when discussing emotional evoking topics about culture (Tadros & Finney, 2018; Tadros & Owens, 2020) . It is vital that the cultural background of the client is known as well as the therapist and the supervisor. At times, therapists can use their own intersecting identities to connect with clients (Chan et al., 2017) . Knowledge of multicultural practices in supervision is a continual process that requires constant work and attention. Supervisors should be confident in their abilities to hold discussions surrounding cultural differences and biases (D'Aniello and Perkins, 2016) . The power and privilege within the supervisory relationship are held by the supervisor, consequently leaving them the duty to begin the conversation on diversity (Hardy & Bobes, 2017) .",

They have their own personal histories and may be from very different worlds from one another, yet can manifest a relationship with one another through use of one's self (Aponte & Ingram, 2018) . Rapport between supervisor and therapist has a significant effect on growth and development in the domains of empathic understanding, openness to change, commitment, communication, genuineness, and respect (Bursky & Cook, 2016) . A recent qualitative study found that experiences of creating a therapeutic alliance comprised developing a sense of trust, relating genuinely, and techniques being system-oriented (Perkins et al., 2019) . Similarly, it is vital for supervisors to foster a strong supervisory alliance (Enlow et al., 2019) . Supervisors would do well to understand that their therapists need their supervisors to offer a supportive and validating environment (Bursky & Cook, 2016) . A study found that therapists whose supervisees perceived more feminist behaviors from their supervisor were more likely to report a stronger supervisory relationship as well as were less likely to report withholding information them (McKibben et al., 2019) . This is especially important in correctional settings where therapists may navigate risks and challenges not traditionally experienced in treatment settings.",

Issues of safety, confidentiality, power, and dual relationships are not unique to incarcerated settings, and these are similar issues within any therapeutic environment. However, providing mental healthcare treatment in carceral settings presents additional challenges, including access to supervision and lack of funding for treatment services, resulting in therapists having to do more with less (Al-Rousan et al., 2017; Carrola et al., 2016) . Conducting therapy in corrections facilities also presents additional risks , such as safety, confidentiality, power issues, and dual relationships, that other settings generally do not experience as frequently nor severely (Storey & Minto, 2000) . Hence, it is imperative that both therapy and supervision models, such as the present supervision model, incorporate tenants of structural family therapy to best attend to boundaries and hierarchy.

The punishment-over-rehabilitation belief often results in barriers to implementing rehabilitative programs and services . If correctional settings offer mental health programs and services, confidentiality is frequently viewed as a privilege and not a right (Mobley, 2008) . Further, the physical environment of carceral settings presents challenges generally not experienced in other treatment settings (Carrola et al., 2016) . Mobley (2008) refers to confidentiality in correctional settings as \"usually an illusion\" (p. 385). For example, corrections officers may be present during therapy sessions, or clients may need to be seen while inside their cell (Carrola et al., 2016; Elliot & Schrink, 2016; Mobley, 2008) . Both examples are likely to breach confidentiality. Further, the nature of working within a corrections system may require a therapist to report confidential client information if the client discloses a rule violation (Mobley, 2008) . The scenarios above require therapists to navigate competing demands and dual relationships, suggesting a critical need for frequent and competent clinical supervision.",

Hierarchical corrections environments inherently place the therapist in a conflictual dual role in which they serve as a trusted, safe clinical provider (i.e., therapist) and a correctional employee (i.e., security staff). A dual relationship of this kind likely results in confusion for the incarcerated and potentially undermines the therapeutic relationship (Carrola et al., 2016; Mobley, 2008) . Further, the competing priorities of therapists and security staff may result in tension in a corrections work environment that can easily impede rehabilitation of the incarcerated (Mobley, 2008 ). Yet, clinical staff must not lose sight of the setting in which they work and remember that security and safety must be of priority (Mobley, 2008) . Therapists in correctional settings face the difficulty of prioritizing both security and rehabilitative efforts. Consequently, clinical supervisors must be available to support therapists in navigating their roles between corrections staff and mental healthcare providers in corrections settings to ensure therapist safety and client well-being (Carrola et al., 2016; Mobley, 2008) .",

Based on the existing literature, it is fair to surmise that this means the USA houses a disproportionately high rate of mentally ill and does not necessarily adequately treat a disproportionately high percentage of people with mental health diagnoses. Further, clinical presentations in correctional centers are likely to be more complex, severe, and pervasive than in the general population (Al-Rousan et al., 2017; Mobley, 2008) . The extreme complexity of cases often found in carceral settings is likely due to inadequate access to treatment in community settings before incarceration, the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill into communities, and the historic \"war on drugs\" that criminalized substance use (Al-Rousan et al., 2017) . Surveyed carceral healthcare providers cite the complexity of cases and clinical diagnoses as the greatest difficulties in working with incarcerated clients (Storey & Minto, 2000) . Not surprisingly, healthcare providers in carceral settings report high rates of burnout (Elliot and Schrink, 2016 ). Yet, supervisors are routinely not available to provide support with complex cases, leaving staff to manage intense situations on their own (Storey & Minto, 2000) , which may, in part, explain the high rates of litigation against correctional facilities psychological providers (Mobley, 2008) . In order to provide high-quality, ethical clinical care in carceral settings, it is imperative for therapists to have available and competent clinical supervisors. Yet, the literature on clinical supervision in carceral settings is sparse.",

Taken together, these models and their elements coalesce into the Tadros theory of change. Specifically, SFT helps attend to a therapist's autonomy, hierarchy, boundaries, and dual relationships. Narrative provides a frame for empowerment and reauthoring, of both the supervisor and therapist's journeys. Further, clients are believed to have the resources and ability to implement change (Tadros, 2019) . Solutionfocused therapy provides a brief, goal-oriented framework that yields concrete interventions in supervision which is critical and practical given the restraints of working in an incarcerated setting. Together, these interventions directly address facets of incarceration ranging from vast power differentials to redemptive narratives, to the need for practical and immediate skill building. An overarching incarcerated lens consisting of supervisors challenging beliefs about mass incarceration and systemic oppression through empathic and supportive means is necessary. Through this integration, the supervisor and therapist work collaboratively to restructure, showcase strengths, identify dysfunctional interactional patterns, negotiate rules and roles, and empower clients (de Shazer, 1985; Minuchin & Fishman, 1981; Suddeath et al. 2017; Tadros, 2019; White & Espton 1990) . This model also entails joining with the family and the system's roles and boundaries; it is critical to be cognizant of the family's safety as well as the therapist's safety during this process of joining (Tadros, 2019) . In this model, \"transformation\" is defined by the family's personal treatment goals, which corresponds to a postmodern and social constructivism therapeutic ideology (Tadros, 2019) .",

This paper also serves as a call to action. We strongly recommend that practitioners, supervisors, and researchers alike begin to turn their attention toward clinical work, and in particular supervision, in correctional settings. Many of society's most vulnerable are in correctional facilities. These facilities are rife with unique clinical challenges from dual relationships to confidentiality. It is imperative that we understand how well traditional therapy and supervision models work in addressing the special characteristics of carceral settings. We believe the The Tadros Theory supervision model is an important first step in providing guidance to those working in jails and prisons.

As previously noted, therapists practicing in correctional centers frequently lack the expertise needed to treat such complex cases due to a lack of training pipelines in carceral settings (Tadros et al., 2021a, b, c) . We encourage counselor training programs to incorporate additional training and internship placement sites that may prime trainees to work effectively with the incarcerated. For example, having only one ethics and only one diversity course during a student's masters training is simply insufficient. Furthermore, there is a need for training and education for the incarcerated individual as well as family members regarding what to expect for reentry into both the family system and society.",
