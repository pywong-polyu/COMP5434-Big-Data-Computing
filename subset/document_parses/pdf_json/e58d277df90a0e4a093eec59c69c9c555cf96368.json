By comparing 86 KD patients with an age-matched group with regard to CMV and EBV VCA IgG measurements (taken before or 9 months after IVIG treatment), the authors found that both CMV and EBV had an almost 2-fold lower seroprevalence in the KD population than in the control group.",

This study shows that miR-223 expression is up-regulated in inflamed aneurysms and dilatations of LCWE-injected mice, and that mice lacking miR-223 have more vessel inflammation and IL-1 beta secretion. Thus, the authors have hypothesized that intense IL-1 beta production during LCWE-induced KD vasculitis induces miR-223 expression as a negative regulatory feedback loop.",

Go et al. suggested that sJIA and KD might belong to the same spectrum of IL-1 mediated cytokine storm syndromes. They evaluated in a large retrospective study of patients with KD (n = 1,765) and sJIA (n = 112) the frequency of patients combining the two diagnoses (KD/sJIA). Seven percent (75% males) fulfilled both criteria; they had a median age of 4.7 years, hence higher than that of KD patients. KD/sJIA had less conjunctival injection and half had incomplete KD features. They also received more than one IVIg infusion and 62.5% had coronary dilatation. In these patients, arthritis appeared between 1 and 4 months after the onset of symptoms.",
