Zidovudine was used as a positive control. Cell survival and viral inhibition rates were measured. The herb that was the closest inactivity to zidovudine was screened. Mass spectrometry identified the active compounds in herbs (mobile phase: 0.05% formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile, gradient elution, detection wavelength: 210 nm). The effect of the compounds on reverse transcriptase (RT) products were evaluated by real-time PCR. Gene enrichment was used to analyse underlying mechanisms. Results: With a dose of 1 mg/mL of Cortex Mori, the cell survival rate (57.94%) and viral inhibition rate (74.95%) were closest to the effect of zidovudine (87.87%, 79.81%, respectively). Neochlorogenic acid, one of the active ingredients, was identified by mass spectrometry in Cortex Mori. PCR discovery total RT products of neochlorogenic acid group (mean relative gene expression: 6.01) significantly inhibited (control: 35.42, p < 0.0001). Enrichment analysis showed that neochlorogenic acid may act on haemopoietic cell kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, sarcoma, etc., thus inhibiting HIV-1 infection.",

Recently, the search for new drug targets has been an important trend in HIV drug developmental studies, and RT inhibitors are a hotspot in the development of anti-HIV drugs . Since HIV RT is not a highfidelity DNA polymerase and lacks proofreading function, it will cause increased mutation rates in HIV during the replication process.

Ten types of Chinese medicine monomers were added into the cells, and then DNA products at different periods were collected. The results showed that five monomeric compounds, such as emodin, ursolic acid, morusin, chlorogenic acid, and astragalin had greater cytotoxicity at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and the cell survival rate was low (data not published), which led to difficulty in extracting DNA to complete the follow-up test. Therefore, we selected the DNA products of the other five compounds, such as lupeol, neochlorogenic acid, b-sitosterol, palmitic acid, and mulberroside A for quantitative analysis, and the changes in RT products at each stage were determined by PCR assays (Figure 6(A-C) ). The results showed that lupeol, neochlorogenic acid, b-sitosterol, palmitic acid, and mulberroside A could inhibit the activity of the RT enzymes to some extent. neochlorogenic acid and AZT had the most similar inhibitory effect (the most inhibited effect in 10 monomer) ( Figure 6 (A-C)).

However, the pharmacological mechanism of Cortex Mori remains unclear (Du et al. 2003; Hou et al. 2018; Yu et al. 2019; Lu et al. 2020) . We found that Cortex Mori significantly inhibited the activity of HIV-1 RT enzyme, thus blocking the replication of the virus. In anti-HIV experiments in vitro, Shi de Luo et al.

Cortex Mori is also one of the components of 'Compound SH' (An anti-HIV compound of TCM) (Cheng et al. 2015) .

            "text": "In our research results, the four genes HCK, EGFR, SRC, and PDPK1 may be potential targets through which neochlorogenic acid inhibits HIV infection in humans. HCK protein is a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which is preferentially expressed in myeloid and B lymphoid haematopoietic cells (Moarefi et al. 1997) . Nef is a multifunctional pathogenic protein of HIV-1, and its interaction with the Src tyrosine kinase Hck, which is highly expressed in macrophages, is related to the development of AIDS (Suzu et al. 2005; Hiyoshi et al. 2008) . We speculate that neochlorogenic acid may competitively bind HCK protein, thereby inhibiting Nef protein function. Few studies have examined EGFP and HIV, and they have mainly focussed on mutations (Crequit et al. 2016; Walline et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019) . Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common malignant tumour in HIV/AIDS. HIV-related exosomes increase the expression of HIV transactivator (TAR) RNA and EGFR in oral mucosal epithelial cells, thereby promoting Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection . Lin et al. (2011) found that the phosphorylation level of PDPK1 is closely associated with the expression of p300 protein, which regulates the function of the HIV-1-encoded RNA-binding protein Tat. The above results all show that our prediction results are fairly reliable. In addition, we found that neochlorogenic acid can bind the RT of HIV-2, thus suggesting that neochlorogenic acid may have a favourable inhibitory effect on HIV-2. This result further shows that neochlorogenic acid is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 virus replication.",

In addition, HCK, EGFR, SRC, and PDPK1 may be protein targets allowing neochlorogenic acid to inhibit HIV infection in the human body. The precise effect of Cortex Mori on RT needs further study. The existing anti-HIV treatment strategies approved by the FDA are very expensive for more than 90% of HIV-infected patients in developing countries. There have been many studies on the treatment of AIDS with Chinese medicine. It is of great significance to explore TCMs and Chinese medicines to develop affordable drugs with significant effects to prevent and treat AIDS.",

Cell experiments indicated that neochlorogenic acid has a good inhibitory effect on the HIV-1 RT enzyme. Neochlorogenic acid may also inhibit HIV through four targets: HCK, EGFR, SRC, and PDPK1. Moreover, neochlorogenic acid may bind HIV-2 RT. Our research can facilitate the development and utilisation of Chinese herbal medicines, and it can serve as a reference for the development of anti-HIV-1 drugs.",
