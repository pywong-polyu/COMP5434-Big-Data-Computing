            "text": "As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, monitoring the disease at different scales is critical to support public health decision making. Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can supplement surveillance based on diagnostic testing. In this paper, we report the results of wastewater-based COVID-19 surveillance on Emory University campus that included routine sampling of sewage from a hospital building, an isolation/quarantine building, and 21 student residence halls between July 13th, 2020 and March 14th, 2021. We examined the sensitivity of wastewater surveillance for detecting COVID-19 cases at building level and the relation between Ct values from RT-qPCR results of wastewater samples and the number of COVID-19 patients residing in the building. Our results show that weekly wastewater surveillance using Moore swab samples was not sensitive enough (6 of 63 times) to reliably detect one or two sporadic cases in a residence building. The Ct values of the wastewater samples over time from the same sampling location reflected the temporal trend in the number of COVID-19 patients in the isolation/quarantine building and hospital (Pearson's r < \u22120.8), but there is too much uncertainty to directly estimate the number of COVID-19 cases using Ct values. After students returned for the spring 2021 semester, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the wastewater samples from most of the student residence hall monitoring sites one to two weeks before COVID-19 cases surged on campus. This finding suggests that wastewater-based surveillance can be used to provide early warning of COVID-19 outbreaks at institutions.",

Currently, COVID-19 surveillance relies mainly on diagnostic testing, such as nucleic acid amplification tests and rapid antigen tests, for individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021) . However, such a surveillance strategy has several limitations. First, it underestimates the disease incidence. Cases with mild or no symptoms are less likely to get a diagnostic test. In addition, the capacity of diagnostic testing can be inadequate, especially during a surge of infections or in areas with limited resources, resulting in even more undetected cases. Second, trends in observed cases, hospitalizations or deaths are delayed with respect to transmission. Delays exist between exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and symptom onset, as well as between symptom onset and confirmation by a diagnostic test. The median incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days) (Lauer et al., 2020) . A study in South Korea reported that the estimated median period between the date of symptom onset and the date of COVID-19 confirmation was 4 days (Kim et al., 2020) . In addition, the costs of populationwide repeated diagnostic testing impose a heavy financial burden on communities. The cost of a typical COVID-19 PCR test for saliva samples is $1.29 to $4.30 per test, and the cost of an antigen test is $5 per test (Greenwood, 2021; .",

Infected subjects may shed SARS-CoV-2 in their feces for a prolonged period, regardless of whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic (C. X. Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) , and fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 may start before the appearance of any symptoms (Wu et al., 2022) . A study in New Haven, Connecticut observed an increased concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage sludge 6-8 days ahead of a rise in reported cases (Peccia et al., 2020) . Wastewater samples can usually be collected and processed within 1-2 days. In addition, testing wastewater requires only a small number of samples to provide population-level data, which enables wastewater surveillance to be sustained with low cost.",

            "text": "When the prevalence of COVID-19 decreases and restrictions like shelter-in-place have been lifted, wastewater surveillance could play a critical role to monitor the disease spread and inform public health interventions. For universities to safely reopen, it is critical to maintain COVID-19 prevalence on campus at a low level. Early warning of outbreaks could help universities respond rapidly and prevent further disease transmission. Emory University transitioned to full remote learning on March 23rd, 2020 and reopened on August 19th, 2020 for online and in-person classes. COVID-19 screening tests using a rapid point of care antigen test (Quidel) were mandatory for all faculty, staff, and students returning to campus. The number of cases was monitored on a daily basis and reported on a publicly-available dashboard (https://www.emory.edu/forward/covid-19/dashboard/index.html). Throughout the semester, weekly routine diagnostic testing using antigen test (Quidel) was conducted for students who lived in residence halls on campus regardless of whether or not they had symptoms. In December 2020, it changed to the Qaunterix (Simo) platform with RT-PCR confirmation for positive antigen tests twice a week. Whenever a COVID-19 case was confirmed, isolation and contact tracing were implemented. Wastewater-based surveillance at residence halls was also conducted, as a part of an effort to monitor and control COVID-19 transmission on campus. When a wastewater sample was positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, students living in the corresponding building were instructed to screen themselves for symptoms using an online COVID-19 symptom checker. Diagnostic testing compliance was reviewed for all the residents of the building. Those students who had not been tested 48 h prior to the time the wastewater sample collected, were instructed to get tested immediately. This study reports the results of wastewater-based surveillance, along with numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, in all residence hall buildings on three campuses of Emory University, one isolation/ quarantine building, and one Emory University Hospital building with wards for confirmed COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Emory University has three campuses: the Atlanta Campus and Clairmont Campus in Atlanta, Georgia and the Oxford Campus in Oxford, Georgia. During the Fall 2019 semester, Emory University had 15,398 students enrolled, and over 13,200 faculty and staff members. 6.4%. of students were in Oxford Campus. There are ten residence halls (Alabama, Complex, Dobbs, Few and Evens, Hamilton, Harris, Longstreet, Raoul, Turman, and Woodruff) at the Emory Atlanta Campus, three residence halls (Clairmont Residential Center, Clairmont Tower Apartments, and Clairmont Undergraduate Residential Center) at the Clairmont Campus, and four residence halls (Elizer and Murdy, Fleming, Haygood, and Jolley Residential Center) at the Oxford Campus. The capacity of residence halls ranges from 91 to 600. About 1600 undergraduate students lived on campus during the Fall 2020 semester. Weekly Moore swab samples (Liu et al., 2021) were collected at 25 manholes located adjacent to the residence halls between August 21st, 2020 to March 14th, 2021 ( Fig. 1 ). Of these 25 manholes, twelve were at the Atlanta Campus, seven were at the Clairmont Campus, and six were at the Oxford Campus. The majority of the manhole sites collected all the wastewater directly from the targeted building. In some cases, the targeted building was served by two manhole sites, and we collected samples from both manholes.",

Initially, a small number of swab samples were concentrated by PEC precipitation which had similar recovery efficiency (results not shown). Because this method was more expensive and complicated than the skimmed milk method, we did not continue using it. For grab samples, 500 mL sample volumes were concentrated using membrane filtration with 0.45-\u03bcm-pore-size, 47-mm diameter nitrocellulose filters (Millipore Sigma, Burlington MA). RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) with Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV) (INFORCE 3, Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) as an extraction control. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected via real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using the N1 primer developed by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Lu et al., 2020) and the TaqPathTM qPCR Master Mixture (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A diluted synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ATCC\u00ae VR-3276SD, Manassas, VA) served as a positive control and was included in each RT-qPCR run. Consistent Ct values from this positive control were observed [mean = 24.10; standard deviation (SD) = 0.51] in a total of 49 RT-qPCR runs throughout the study period. All samples were tested in duplicate. A wastewater sample was considered to be positive when both replicate PCR tests had a quantifiable Ct value (Ct values below 41 and the PCR curve showed amplification) with difference of Ct values between replicates less than 2. The turnaround time from sample collection to final lab results was between 2 and 3 days. Details of sample processing and lab analyses can be found in (Liu et al., 2021) .",

As the number of COVID-19 cases in the building increased, we were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the majority of the wastewater samples. The hospital building was a large building with a large number of patients (500-600) and a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases. In addition, COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital usually had severe symptoms. In such a setting, both the grab sample method and Moore swab method performed equally well with a high number of COVID-19 patients in the building. When the number of COVID-19 patients in the hospital was relatively low (<50), Moore swab samples, as composite samples of wastewater over 24-48 h, were more likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA than grab samples, for which virus detection depends on the presence of virus in the wastewater flow at the time of sample collection.",

Wastewater samples were collected from one of the three manholes serving the sewage system of the isolation/quarantine building. Therefore, the catchment population of the wastewater samples from the isolation/quarantine building was smaller compared to those from the hospital building. And the isolated/ quarantined students included confirmed COVID-19 cases and close contacts identified through tracing, usually had mild or no symptoms (less fecal shedding). Still, Moore swab samples were sufficiently sensitive to detect the virus in the wastewater from this building. We observed lower Ct values with more variance in samples from the isolation/quarantine building compared to samples from the hospital building. The reason could be that normal activities in the hospital building use a large amount of water, leading to diluted wastewater samples, whereas the isolation/quarantine building had less water flow with less diluted human fecal waste. Wastewater surveillance of the residence halls was used to monitor COVID-19 cases on campus along with weekly diagnostic tests. The catchment population of each residential hall sampling site was relatively small (91 to 600), and COVID-19 prevalence within the residence halls was generally low. Unlike the hospital and isolation/quarantine buildings where the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is known and is a relatively high proportion of the building residents, wastewater surveillance of residence halls is attempting to identify a low numbers of student COVID-19 cases possibly before they have symptoms or are aware that they are infected. During the Fall 2020 semester, the incidence of COVID-19 on campus was low, and wastewater surveillance of the residence halls detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in only a few samples when there were confirmed COVID-19 cases in the sampled buildings. This was in agreement with what we found from wastewater surveillance at the hospital building and the isolation/quarantine building: our wastewater surveillance approach was not sensitive enough to capture a single sporadic case at the building level. This changed during the Spring 2021 semester when surges in COVID-19 cases were observed on the Emory Campus, and the majority of the residence hall wastewater samples were RT-PCR positive.",

Although the building size, disease prevalence, sampling method, and lab assay varied, all the studies successfully detected the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater. Some of the studies used the wastewater surveillance results to trigger clinical testing for residents in the building and asserted that the wastewater surveillance at the building level could detect a single asymptomatic COVID-19 case (Gibas et al., 2021) . However, such results do not guarantee that the sensitivity of wastewater surveillance is always adequate to reliably detect a single case. Similar to the study by Karthikeyan et al. (2021) , the current study examined the relationship between buildinglevel case numbers identified by diagnostic testing and the wastewater surveillance RT-PCR results. This enabled us to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of wastewater surveillance at the building level. However, we found a lower sensitivity of wastewater surveillance in our study (45.5%) compared to the study by Karthikeyan et al. (2021) (84.7% ). This could be due to the different collection methods (Moore swab vs. composite sample by an autosampler), sewerage structure, and building and resident population size, etc.",

It is likely the amount of virus shed in feces is higher when the symptoms are more severe (Lin et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2020) . In situations where the building is large and the sampling site only covers part of the building, it may be challenging to detect the virus from wastewater when there are a small number of cases in the building. On the Emory campuses, students may move around between residence halls, which means that they could have used toilets in other buildings. To increase the likelihood of finding cases who are shedding SARS-CoV-2 and thus improve the sensitivity of wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 case detection, it may be necessary to collect wastewater samples from more sites and use a greater sampling frequency.",

This has been attempted for wastewater surveillance systems that collect samples at wastewater treatment plants with large catchment populations (Gonzalez et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020; Saguti et al., 2021) . However, there is no universal model to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 directly from the results of wastewater analyses because the catchment population, dilution factor, and topology of the sewage network vary by sampling site. At the building level, the trend of Ct values from either the grab samples or Moore swab samples of wastewater mirrored the trend of COVID-19 prevalence. Generally, the Ct values, which had considerable variation, decreased as the case number increased in the building but flatten when the case number became large. The Moore swabs were left in the manhole near the hospital for 24 h (sometimes 48 h) and may have become saturated with virus. The correlation between Ct values from wastewater samples and the number of COVID-19 patients in the hospital building and isolation/quarantine building was strong, which is consistent with the results reported by Karthikeyan et al. (2021) . Because there is very limited information about the proportion of COVID-19 cases that shed SARS-CoV-2 in feces, the magnitude and duration of SARS-CoV-2 fecal shedding, and the fecal dilution of the wastewater, it is challenging to try to directly estimate the number of COVID-19 cases using wastewater surveillance results at the building level.",

            "text": "Although wastewater testing may not be sensitive enough to reliably identify sporadic cases in individual buildings, when wastewater data from multiple buildings were combined, the overall wastewater surveillance system was sufficiently sensitive to provide early warning of COVID-19 outbreaks. During the Spring 2021 semester, large proportions of wastewater samples across campus (Clairmont: 6 of 14; Main: 14 of 23; Oxford: 6 of 10) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA 1-2 weeks before the surges of cases detected by diagnostic testing. At the start of an outbreak, when the numbers of infected subjects are increasing, people infected with SARS-CoV-2 could shed SARS-CoV-2 virus in their feces before their infection is identified by diagnostic testing (Jones et al., 2020) . This early detection/warning of COVID-19 cases has also been reported by other campus wastewater surveillance studies (Betancourt et al., 2021; Gibas et al., 2021; Karthikeyan et al., 2021) . For students living on campus and doing weekly diagnostic tests, transmission could be prevented by rapid isolation/quarantine and contact tracing. Any students who were infected but did not comply with weekly testing or who lived off campus, could \"escape\" detection and cause further transmission on campus. COVID-19 cases missed by diagnostic testing may use toilets in the residence halls or other buildings. Our findings suggest that it is more practical to examine the results of campus wastewater surveillance at the institution level rather than by individual buildings. Essentially, a positive signal from wastewater collected at any campus sampling site indicates SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the campus population, including: students who live on campus; students living off campus but taking in-person classes; faculty and staff working on campus. Such transmission could be detected by weekly diagnostic testing at the expense of a large number of tests. Wastewater surveillance is a much more economical approach and could potentially cover a greater proportion of the population on campus as a screening approach to guide the use of diagnostic testing. Moving forward, wastewater sampling at buildings with classes, libraries, student centers, or gyms could further expand the coverage of the surveillance. Therefore, wastewater surveillance has the potential to supplement diagnostic testing and provide early warning of outbreaks at the institutional level.",

At some point, routine diagnostic testing for monitoring COVID-19 incidence/prevalence in large populations may become too expensive. Wastewater surveillance at a building level and institution level could complement surveillance based on diagnostic testing or symptom-based surveillance. Such a surveillance approach could be considerably less expensive to sustain. In addition, wastewater surveillance can be deployed to monitor for multiple pathogens simultaneously. Wastewater surveillance has been used globally for polio and typhoid (Andrews et al., 2020; Asghar et al., 2014; Hovi et al., 2012; Y. Wang et al., 2020) and could serve as a valuable tool at a national level to monitor current and emerging disease threats (Kirby et al., 2021) .",

First, it was not possible to collect weekly samples for all the residence halls, especially in the Fall 2020 semester, due to a shortage of some critical lab supplies caused by the pandemic. Second, some COVID-19 cases may shed virus in their feces for weeks to a month after they had negative conversion of respiratory samples and no symptoms. After students recovered from COVID-19 and were released from quarantine back to their residence hall, they could have continued shedding virus in their feces which would create \"background noise\" in the wastewater RT-PCR signal. Third, the majority of the university campus population was young healthy adults, who could have different fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2, transmission patterns, and behavior compared to the general population.",

Also, in the early phase of this study we explored and compared several different methods for sample collection, virus concentration, and RNA extraction which may have affected our analyses of temporal trends in the first two months of the study. Finally, we did not have enough data to assess measurement error, which is necessary to understand the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in wastewater.",

We used two wastewater sampling methods: grab samples of the wastewater from the hospital building and Moore swab samples of the wastewater from the hospital, the isolation/quarantine building, and 21 student residence halls. We observed that the wastewater surveillance results clearly reflected the trajectory of COVID-19 case numbers in the isolation/quarantine building and in the hospital building. However, this wastewater surveillance method was not sensitive enough to reliably capture sporadic single cases that emerged in individual residence halls. Routine wastewater sampling and analyses at an institution level with multiple sampling sites was a useful surveillance tool and provided an early warning of a surge in COVID-19 infections. Carefully-designed wastewater-based surveillance can be a low-cost strategy to supplement surveillance based on diagnostic testing. ",
