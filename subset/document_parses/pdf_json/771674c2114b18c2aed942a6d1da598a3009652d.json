China's bond and strict containment measures have been proved (in practice) to significantly reduce the spread of the epidemic. This was obtained through the use of emergency control measures in the epidemic areas and the integration of resources from multiple systems, including business, community, technology, education, and transportation, across the country. In order to better understand how China has managed to reduce the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic, this editorial systematically reviews the specific measures for infection prevention and control of the disease. The best practices for COVID-19 eradication in China provide evidence-based strategies that could be replicated in other countries.",

Under the circumstance of the significant public health risk that the international spread of epidemic poses to the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and has escalated it to a global pandemic on 11 March [4] .",

Even though China is temporarily the country with the largest number of cases, the increase of new cases is falling and there is evidence that the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic has passed for China [6] . Since 19 March, Wuhan, the city where the outbreak started, has reported no new confirmed or suspected cases for five consecutive days [7] . The epicenter of the outbreak was originally in China and has now been transferred to other countries such as Italy, the United States, Spain, and Germany. The WHO confirmed that \"Europe has now become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world\" [8] . Figure 1 reports the new and cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 data for China and the rest of the countries, by date of report. The figure shows a significant difference in the timing of case growth trends between the two location categories. The Chinese government has taken a series of aggressive measures in a timely manner, which have proved to be effective in alleviating the epidemic to a large extent. Consequently, the objective of this editorial is to review a selection of measures undertaken in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in China, and to provide potential evidence and guidance to other countries.

Since 2 February, large venues such as stadiums and convention centers were transformed into 14 mobile cabin hospitals, for the medical observation and treatment of more than 14,000 suspected cases, mild patients, and close contacts.

The government has issued a number of targeted policies to support the survival and development of these enterprises during the outbreak. The financing cost of the enterprises has been reduced, reflecting the fact that banks reduced the loan threshold of enterprises, increased loan amounts, and reduced loan interest rates for the period of the epidemic. Enterprises seriously affected by the epidemic could apply for multiple tax relief, and the government also arranged special funds to provide subsidy support for worst-hit industries, such as aviation and transportation industries. The employees of enterprises that returned to work from other areas have also received strong support from the government and were provided with subsidies for chartered airplanes and buses. Fortunately, we have also witnessed many enterprises actively fulfill corporate social responsibility during the outbreak. These enterprises have donate large sums of money and medical equipment to the epidemic areas, some of which, such as the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation, transformed production lines to produce medical protective equipment including masks, protective clothing, and ventilators. As the world's largest manufacturer and exporter of medical protective equipment, China's safeguard measures for enterprises to return to work were related to the progress of global infection prevention and control of epidemic.",

Since 20 January, the public transport places including airports, railway stations, bus stations in all regions started the temperature tests for passengers when entering and leaving the stations. In order to ensure the transportation of emergency supplies and reduce the cost of raw materials for the enterprise resumption, the Ministry of Transport of China announced that vehicle tolls on nationwide expressways were waived during the period of 17 February to the end of the infection prevention and control of epidemic. Due to the reduced demand and residents' quarantine, the inter-provincial bus was suspended, and most of the aircraft flights and rail services were temporarily canceled. Since March, as the peak of the epidemic has passed for China and the epidemic has begun to spread on a large scale in other countries, the new focus of the response measures of the transportation system has shifted to a new stage of strictly preventing the epidemic from being imported from abroad. Since 23 March, all international flights must arrive in 12 designated first-entry cities, and all entry personnel much be forced to perform the COVID-19 detection and quarantine at the local centralized isolation points for 14 days. The transportation system is currently strengthening its epidemic response measures to international travel, to prevent a second outbreak caused by imported cases.",
