Our team is currently working with Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers across the United States to implement STRIDE (assiSTed eaRly mobIlity for hospitalizeD older vEterans), a hospital-based walking program designed to mitigate the risks of immobility during hospitalization. However, the COVID-19 pandemic made in-person, or face-to-face, walking challenging due to social distancing recommendations and infection control concerns. In response, our team applied principles of implementation science, including stakeholder engagement, prototype development and refinement, and rapid dissemination and feedback, to create STRIDE in Your Room (SiYR). Consisting of self-guided exercises, light exercise equipment (e.g., TheraBands, stress ball, foam blocks, pedometer), the SiYR program provided safe alternative activities when face-to-face walking was not available during the pandemic. We describe the methods used in developing the SiYR program; present feedback from participating sites; and share initial implementation experiences, lessons learned, and future directions.",

An initial clinical demonstration evaluation of the program found that older adults participating in STRIDE were more likely to spend fewer days in the hospital and be discharged home rather than a skilled nursing facility [3] . STRIDE is typically implemented on general medicine wards and designed to be flexible in its implementation. For example, sites are encouraged to adapt staffing models, documentation procedures, and marketing tools to maximize \"fit\" with the local setting.",

All sites were invited to participate in the STRIDE Diffusion Network which was launched in 2018 and facilitated by an interdisciplinary research and evaluation team (\"Function QUERI\") comprised of health services researchers, clinicians, and implementation specialists located in Durham, NC.

In the spirit of this adaptation, we recognized the need for flexibility in the SiYR program, both to accommodate the changing course of the pandemic and to respect the natural variation that occurs in working with multiple VA facilities across the country. The program described in this paper applied several principles of implementation science, including stakeholder engagement (e.g., local STRIDE program leaders), systematic adaptation, and rapid cycle development and evaluation. Data were drawn from multiple sources, including established data sources integrated into our larger STRIDE program (e.g., quarterly STRIDE Diffusion Network Calls) and additional data sources designed specifically for this project (e.g., quantitative survey and structured email templates).

One team left a SiYR kit on their medical center's dedicated COVID unit and provided instruction to the unit's providers on how the kit might be used to promote activity among isolated patients. A second site utilized a \"train the trainer\" model, educating other facility physical therapists about how to use the SiYR kit and encouraging each therapist to distribute at least one kit. A third site produced a 10-minute video to be played in patients' rooms that included supine and seated exercises, deep breathing exercises, and information on early mobility during hospitalization. Each of these innovations was presented to the larger STRIDE network as part of quarterly Diffusion Network Calls, further supporting the value of learning collaboratives as an effective implementation strategy, particularly in times of national crises.",

As the pandemic continues to shift, SiYR may be used for other immunocompromised patients who are unable to leave the hospital room and could benefit from a self-guided activity program. SiYR may also be used in times of staffing shortages and/or to supplement existing STRIDE walks. Identifying alternative uses for the SiYR kits may ultimately improve uptake. In addition, providing sites with clear instructions (e.g., written resources, brief training teleconferences) on how to implement SiYR for different uses may also improve uptake and sustainability.",

Inspired by feedback from frontline staff and informed by principles of implementation science, our team launched the STRIDE in Your Room (SiYR) program, an adaption of STRIDE, our existing evidence-based walking program. Although SiYR aimed to address a clinical gap, the challenging and changing circumstances of the pandemic made it difficult for clinical sites to adopt and sustain a new service. We recognize some of the inherent limitations in a rapid cycle assessment project, including implementation within a single healthcare system and prioritization of implementation outcomes over patient-level outcomes. Despite these limitations, lessons learned from this collaborative and iterative process may inform preparedness efforts for future pandemics or other emergency situations. In the meantime, our team will continue efforts to refine the SiYR program and identify how a self-guided exercise kit can serve as a tool to support patient activity both within the hospital setting and upon discharge.",
