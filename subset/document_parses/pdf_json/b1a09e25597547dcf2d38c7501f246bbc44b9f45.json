After the intervention, quadriceps muscle thickness, 1RM, and sEMG improved in all three groups (all p < 0.05), whereas muscle quality improved only in middle-aged and older participants (p \u2264 0.001), and MVIC only in middle-aged and mobility-limited older adults (p < 0.05). With a few exceptions, peak power improved in all groups from 30-90% 1RM (p < 0.05) both when tested relative to pre-training or post-training 1RM workloads (all p < 0.05). Both mobility-limited older adults and older adults improved their short physical performance battery score (p < 0.05). Chair stand, stair climb, maximal gait speed, and timed up-andgo performance, on the other hand, improved in all three groups (p < 0.05), but no change was observed for habitual gait speed and 6-min walk test performance. Overall, our results demonstrate that a HVRT intervention can build a stronger foundation in middle-aged individuals so that they can better deal with age-related impairments at the same time that it can mitigate already present physiological and functional impairments in older adults with and without mobility-limitation.",

Participants were tested before and after a 4-week control period and then assigned to a 12-week HVRT intervention.

As these individuals age, a series of physiological declines are observed, such as reductions in muscle mass, strength, and power [3] . Recent evidence indicates that the annual reduction rates in power (~ 3-6%) are higher when compared to those of muscle mass and strength (~ 1-3%) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . This considerable muscle power loss during the aging process is worrisome because power is associated with and is an important predictor of functional performance in elderly people [9] [10] [11] [12] . It should be noted, however, that the loss of lower limb muscle mass, strength, and power seems to begin as early as the fourth decade and, therefore, it is important that preventive measures be implemented as soon as possible and not just later in life [13, 14] .",

After a 3-year follow-up period and similar reductions in lower limb muscle power, only mobility-limited older individuals presented reductions in muscle mass and strength, whereas only the healthy participants showed a reduction in the rate of neuromuscular activation of the agonist's muscles. The same research group had already demonstrated differences in the associations between lower limb muscle power and its determinants (i.e., force and velocity) between middle-aged adults, healthy older adults, and mobility-limited older adults [37] . That is, whereas only force significantly explained the variation in muscle power in the middle-aged participants, both force and velocity explained muscle power in healthy elderly individuals and only velocity in mobility-limited older adults. Collectively, these results suggest that velocity's importance for muscle power production increases with both age and severity of mobility impairment.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare the neuromuscular, morphological, and functional responses to a HVRT program across three cohorts: middle-aged adults, healthy older adults, and mobility-limited older adults. Our working hypothesis was that the three groups would improve their neuromuscular and morphological measures, whereas functional capacity would only improve in the older adults' groups and to a higher degree on the mobility-limited individuals. In addition, we hypothesized that improvements in muscle power between the groups would result from distinct contributions from force and velocity. These results have the potential to increase our understanding of cohort-specific HVRT adaptations and to improve HVRT prescription strategies according to the specific needs of each group.",

The sample size was calculated based on the effect size of previous intervention studies on older adults with mobility limitations or self-reported limitation [e.g., 42, 43, 44] , as well as on the effect size of a recent meta-analysis that investigated the effect of HVRT on lower limb muscle power in middle-aged and elderly adults [20] . Thus, considering \u03b1 = 0.05, 80% power, and an effect size of 0.22, a total sample of 54 individuals, 18 per group, was estimated. The study was advertised through newspapers and social media. Initial contact with potential participants was made through telephone pre-screens, during which the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1) were reviewed using a standardized form; those deemed eligible and that remained interested were then invited for an in-person interview at the university. Individuals over 60 years of age were also asked about possible mobility limitations [i.e., self-reported difficulty in at least one of the following tasks: walking 400 m, climbing stairs, lifting and carrying groceries, getting out of the bathtub or shopping, 45].",

To minimize the potential impact of differential levels of physical activity, we restricted recruitment to untrained subjects (i.e., no recent training history, as highlighted in Table 1 ). As part of the screening process, we also captured physical activity patterns via questionnaires. There were no notable differences in the weekly levels of selfreported physical activity among middle-aged, older adults, and mobility-limited older adults (p > 0.05). All subjects reported levels of activity well below the Department of Health and Human Services 2018 physical activity guidelines (i.e., were physically inactive).",

During these sessions, they were introduced to the exercises and tests that they would perform with an emphasis on technique and movement velocity. Following familiarization and prior to the intervention, subjects were tested before (baseline) and after (pre-intervention) a 4-week control washin period. In each of these time points, participants completed two days of testing. On the first day, knee extensors ultrasound images were taken followed by knee extension (KE) maximal voluntary isometric contractions, KE 1RM, and power tests, whereas on the second-day leg press (LP) 1RM and power tests were followed by a battery of functional tests. No exercise was scheduled during the control period, and participants were advised to maintain their normal routine throughout it. Participants were then assigned to a 12-week HVRT program twice per week, and all outcomes were reassessed in three separate visits at least 72 h after the last training session (post-intervention). The first two sessions were similar to those at the baseline and pre-intervention time points, whereas, in the third session, participants repeated both KE and LP power tests in a counterbalanced order using the 1RM load corresponding to the baseline time point. All post-intervention tests were completed within two weeks. Throughout the study, both the time (\u00b1 2 h) and order of the tests, as well as outcome assessors were kept constant, and the participants were instructed to avoid the consumption of caffeine/alcohol and the practice of vigorous physical activities in the 24 h preceding them.",

Five images from the rectus femoris (RF), vastus intermedius (VI), vastus lateralis (VL), and vastus medialis (VM) muscles of the right limb were then obtained by B-mode ultrasound (Tosbee/SSA-240a, Toshiba\u00ae, Japan) using a 7.5 MHz linear-array probe positioned perpendicularly to the muscle of interest. RF, VI, and VL images were obtained at 50% of the distance between the lateral condyle and the greater trochanter of the femur, whereas VM images were obtained at 20% of the same distance [49, 50] . Images were analyzed using the ImageJ software v1.52a (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA). RF, VL, and VM muscle thicknesses were defined as the distance between the superficial and deep muscle aponeurosis, whereas VI thickness corresponded to the distance between the superficial aponeurosis and the hyperechoic interface of the femur. Muscle quality, on the other hand, was determined based on the muscles' echo intensity values using a grayscale analysis function on the ImageJ software, and expressed in arbitrary units between 0 (black, higher quality) and 255 (white, lower quality). For this purpose, in each muscle image a region of interest was selected including as much muscle area as possible while avoiding other tissues (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for a representative ultrasound image). Muscle thickness and echo intensity values are presented for RF, VI, VL, and VM individually as the average value between all its five images and also for the quadriceps femoris as the sum (muscle thickness) and average (echo intensity) of the individual muscle values, respectively. Probe positions were carefully mapped to ensure an identical positioning between baseline, pre-intervention, and post-intervention time points [51, 52] .",

The battery is based on three different tasks: static balance, gait speed, and chair stand. For the static balance test, participants were instructed to stand for 10 s in three different positions, feed side-by-side, semi-tandem stance, and tandem stance. Gait speed was measured based on the time required for the participants to walk a 4-m distance at their habitual gait speed, and chair rise performance was measured through the time required for participants to rise from a chair (0.43 m high) and return to the seated position five times as fast as possible. Based on objective criteria, each task receives a score between 0 and 4 points, and the sum of the individual scores determines the final SPPB score ranging from 0 to 12 (lower values indicate worse functional performance).",

Participants were instructed to walk a 10-m distance at their habitual and maximal gait speeds [60, 61] in separated trials. To avoid acceleration and deceleration interference, a 1-m distance both before and after the 10-m track was provided. The time required to cover the distance was measured using a stopwatch, and the corresponding gait speed was determined in m\u00b7s \u22121 . Each participant had two attempts per speed with 1 min interval between them, and the best result was used for analysis.

Although widely employed in healthy elderly individuals, the number of studies investigating HVRT functional adaptations beyond the SPPB battery in mobility-limited older adults is relatively scarce. Added to the differences in training protocols such as intensity, volume, and exercises, a comparison between the previous studies that investigated these groups separately makes it difficult to draw a conclusion related to potential differences in adaptations to individuals of different functional statuses. Here, we demonstrate that based on the same HVRT program, and contrary to what was expected, the three groups were able to comprehensively improve their functional capacity. The fact that no time point by group interaction was observed also suggests that these improvements occurred at the same rate between the groups.",

Recent evidence suggests a reduction of 3 to 6% per year in muscle power output in healthy and mobility-limited older individuals [4, 6, 7] . Here, we showed that 12 weeks of HVRT resulted in ~ 31.6 and 30.5% increase in LP peak power output when assessed based on the post-training 1RM load, and ~ 37.9 and 43.2% when testing was repeated using the same loads as pre-training in the aforementioned groups. Thus, our results demonstrate that 3 months of HVRT were able to improve what would have been lost in 5 to 14 years due to aging and/or disuse. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data also indicate that power output is reduced as early as the fourth or fifth decade of life [e.g., 13, 69] . Middle-aged individuals in the present study increased LP peak power output by ~ 22.5 and 34.2% on average in the same conditions mentioned above for the other groups. Accordingly, in addition to mitigating the detrimental effects of aging, HVRT also seems to provide a robust physiological reserve to middle-aged adults, likely allowing these individuals to better cope with the events related to senescence later in life.",

Previous data suggest that distinct functional tasks may be more related to the power output at different percentages of 1RM. As an example, gait speed appears to be more associated with power output at lower loads, whereas chair rise performance was more associated with power at higher loads [40, 70] , Considering that power output is a key determinant of functional capacity [3] , the improvements in peak power throughout the whole 1RM spectrum analyzed may help explain the beneficial effects observed in the different functional tasks applied. More importantly, these results greatly exceed the estimated minimal clinically important improvement and substantial improvement for LP power output in mobility-limited older adults, approximately 10% and 18%, respectively, at both 40% and 70% 1RM [71] ,which is in agreement with the meaningful functional improvements observed.",

Although no improvements were noted in the velocity component, it is important to consider that in this condition the repetitions were performed using much higher loads. Thus, the fact that all three groups were able to maintain velocities similar to pre-intervention values should be seen as an important adaptation. When post-training power tests were carried out using loads relative to the pre-intervention 1RM test, on the other hand, marked improvements were observed in the velocity component and to a lower extent in force (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). Since during several daily life activities such as walking, rising from a chair, or restoring balance, the external resistance imposed on the individual remains relatively constant, this latter result has an important functional and practical significance [72] .",

Notwithstanding this, muscle strength is a wellknown independent predictor of mortality and disability and is especially important for weight-bearing activities. After the intervention, all training groups improved LP and KE 1RM. The capacity of middleaged and healthy older adults to respond to resistance training containing a power component has already been established for quite some time [73, 74] . However, in these classic studies, only a portion of the training volume was actually performed explosively (~ 25%), whereas the rest was completed using workloads and movement velocities typically employed in traditional resistance training. Here, we demonstrate that even middle-aged individuals are able to improve considerably their maximal dynamic strength while using only low to moderate loads performed as fast as possible, at least in the short term. Substantial improvements were also found in the mobility-limited older group, in line with previous investigations [29, 32, 35, 43, [75] [76] [77] . Of note, although mobility-limited older participants still had lower KE 1RM values compared to middle-aged adults after the intervention, the former was not found to be different from older adults post-training.

Our results partially agree with this notion by showing an impaired VL activation and MVIC force in mobilitylimited individuals compared to middle-aged adults. More importantly, we were able to show a training effect on both VL and RF sEMG amplitude for all the groups investigated, which were accompanied by improvements in MVIC for middle-aged and mobility-limited participants, but not the well-functioning older adults. Considering the significant improvements observed on maximal dynamic strength and power output for all the three groups, testing specificity may at least partially explain the lack of effect for the older adults [78, 79] .",

At first, this result is counterintuitive, as it would be expected to be higher in the former. However, it should be noted that BF results were reported in absolute values, as we were unable to normalize the sEMG amplitude to that of a knee flexion maximal isometric contraction. Although the lack of normalization might hinder comparison between the groups, within-group comparison does not suggest a training effect on antagonist coactivation and, thus, training-related adaptations in muscle strength, power, and function were likely not related to changes in coactivation. This notion is in line with cross-sectional data indicating that changes in coactivation were not responsible for deficits in dynamic force production when comparing middle-aged and older adults with and without limitations [36] .",

In the present study, we showed an increase in quadriceps muscles thickness in the three groups investigated, suggesting that all groups were able to improve muscle size in response to the intervention. Percent changes and effect sizes, however, indicate that the hypertrophic ability of mobility-limited older adults' muscle might be reduced in comparison to the other groups. Notwithstanding this, our results are in line with those of Radaelli et al. [28] and Nogueira et al. [81] , who also showed an increase in quadriceps muscle thickness in response to 12 and 10 weeks of HVRT in healthy older men and women. Muscle quality, on the other hand, only improved in middle-aged and older adults. This might be related to, or be suggestive of, an impaired intramuscular environment or remodeling capacity in mobilitylimited individuals. Higher echo intensity values are believed to be reflective of greater intramuscular adiposity and fibrous tissue content [82, 83] , both of which may hinder muscle function and metabolism [80] . Another possibility is that periods longer than 12 weeks of training may be necessary for improvements to be evident in this population, which is supported by the small, but significant increases in muscle quality noted in some of the individual muscles (Supplemental Fig. 3) .",

Previous longitudinal data evidenced that only mobility-limited older adults, but not healthy older adults, showed reductions in muscle mass after a 3-year followup period and, accordingly, muscle thickness was expected to be reduced in those with mobility limitations [7] . Considering the large differences in functional capacity and power observed previous to the intervention between the groups, our results seem to advocate the notion that altered neuromuscular function is the critical early determinant of muscle power loss with aging, as suggested by Reid et al. [7] . In addition, it has recently been shown that RF and VL cross-sectional area and echo intensity values were not predictive of fast gait speed in older individuals, which led the authors to suggest a potential dissociation between skeletal muscle morphology and gait speed [84] . The absence of an effect on quadriceps echo intensity, coupled with marked functional performance improvements, is suggestive that improvements in skeletal muscle morphology markers may not be a pre-requisite to improve functional capacity in the short term, at least in the mobility-limited older adults. Nevertheless, skeletal muscle has important endocrine, metabolic and signaling functions [e.g., 85, 86] , and the mechanisms behind the fact that mobility-limited older adults were able to improve muscle size, but not quality deserves further attention.",

In addition, the intervention was effective with few adverse events directly related to training reported. Only three of the events definitely or possibly related to training were judged as moderate, whereas the remaining eight events were judged as mild. Furthermore, practically none of the events reported resulted in changes and/or absences to the training program (i.e., 950 of 952 administered sessions were completed). Considering that most HVRT investigations do not fully report on adverse events, our data can assist in understanding aspects related to the safety and implementation of HVRT interventions.",

First, caution is needed when extrapolating our results to severely limited individuals, as our sample included only individuals with mild to moderate limitations in mobility. The isometric testing condition might also have limited our capacity to observe potential training effects in both agonist and antagonist neuromuscular activation, as agonist activation amplitude deficits seem to be more evident at higher movement velocities [36] . In addition, sEMG amplitude data were not corrected to account for the influence of subcutaneous adipose tissue, even though no difference was previously found between original and corrected sEMG values when comparing middle-aged and older adults with and without mobility-limitation [36] . Another possible limitation is the order of the loads used during the power tests, which was not randomized for logistic reasons. Although unlikely, performance on the final loads might have been influenced by the previous ones. Previous data also suggests that nutritional status may influence muscle response to exercise, and the presence of a dietary control may have provided a greater insight into the morphological results observed, especially in the mobility-limited participants [87] . Notwithstanding this, participants were appropriately instructed to maintain their eating habits throughout the duration of the study. Finally, although we were unable to reach the estimated sample size for the mobility-limited older adults' group, the statistical model adopted (i.e., GEE) seemed capable of differentiating this group from the others (e.g., Fig. 8 ), while also highlighting the presence (or lack thereof) of training-related effects when it differed from the other groups (e.g., Fig. 3) . We also provided a comprehensive report of both within-and between-group effect sizes (Suppl . Tables 2 and 3 ), which should allow readers to have a more informed understanding of our findings.",
