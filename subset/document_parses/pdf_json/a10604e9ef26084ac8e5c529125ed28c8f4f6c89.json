The purpose of this paper is to characterise different perspectives on barriers and facilitators to the practise of physical exercise in a sample of the Portuguese elderly. Two groups of enrolled and non-enrolled in a community exercise program were recruited. Each group had 6 participants that were included in the study if they were \u2265 60 years of age. Two focus groups were conducted via Zoom and lasted \u2264 60 min. Participants were asked about five domains regarding physical exercise. Data analysis occurred in three phases by 2 trained and experienced examiners. While the enrolled group highlighted benefits (n = 6) and facilitators (n = 6), and shared strategies to overcome some barriers (n = 2) the non-enrolled group focused on the barriers (n = 6) instead and shared more excuses to justify their non-practice of physical exercise (n = 3). To overcome the barriers considered by the participants in the non-enrolled group, some education strategies focused on physical literacy might be crucial. The high number of barriers felt by the less active older people makes it more complicated for them to adopt and maintain an exercise program. Narratives-based methodologies are interesting methodologies to collect patient-centred perspectives about exercise practise and therefore design adequate programs.",

Physical inactivity is multifactorial and includes factors related to physical, cognitive, and psychological conditions (e.g., frailty, disability, depression, physical limitations, poor sense of meaning in life, social support, and memory loss). Therefore, this population should be encouraged to perform or maintain regular physical activities throughout their ageing process. The overall prevalence of inactivity among individuals aged 55 or older in 16 countries from Europe was 12.5%. This prevalence varied between countries, ranging from 4.9% in Sweden to 29% in Portugal (Gomes et al., 2017) .",

Furthermore, exercise also has benefits like maintaining functional performance with an improvement of muscle mass, strength, and mobility of older people (e.g., decrease chances of development sarcopenia) and improving bone mineral density (e.g., prevention osteoporotic), reducing symptoms of pain and improvements in functional capacity (Galloza et al., 2017; Mora & Valencia, 2018; Taylor, 2014a) . Moreover, a physically active lifestyle promotes feelings of well-being and is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. Improvements in memory, attention, and reaction time can result from a single bout of aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise plus resistance exercise training can also produce improvements in anxiety, depression, overall well-being, and quality of life (Galloza et al., 2017; Taylor, 2014b) . Nevertheless, the benefits of exercise depend on continued participation, however, a change in lifestyle is something difficult for many people of all ages (Picorelli et al., 2014b) .",

Therefore, the objective of this paper is to characterise different perspectives about physical exercise among older adults divided into two groups (enrolled and non-enrolled in a community exercise program), emphasizing facilitators and barriers to the practice of exercise in a sample of Portuguese elderly.",

Identification was coded and numeric and alphabetic codes were used to preserve anonymity. For ensuring the quality of the verbatim transcription, this procedure was routinely reviewed, namely in terms of pausing, overlapping speech or other relevant events. Two authors (PM and RC) independently performed data analysis. However, the entire research team (MR, PM, RA, RC and RF) organized and conducted regular online meetings to examine and discuss topics regarding data analysis to ensure reflexivity. Data analysis occurred in three phases: data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing/ verification (Miles et al., 1994) . In the first phase (i.e., data reduction) significant sections of the answers were coded into themes. All answers were meticulously read in order to obtain a complete picture of the focus group. Furthermore, interpretative notes were made. Subsequently, emerging subthemes were grouped into major themes. The data display permitted drawing conclusions. In order to organise and facilitate data analysis, the map's themes and quotations were created. In \"conclusion drawing/verification\" researchers reviewed the meaning and significance of the data analysed. Emergent conclusions were confirmed as a means of testing the validity of the findings (Miles et al., 1994) . Both themes and subthemes were examined, reviewed and iterated to guarantee that they reflected the data collected. After independent analysis, researchers compared and discussed the findings. Slightly differences were found between the two researchers, however, visions between them were analysed by the entire team that found they are not truly inconsistent, but rather perspectives of the same scenario. According to Sandelowski (1993) , reaching a consensus could not be the most important aspect of qualitative data analysis. What could be really important is to respect different perspectives and submit these different visions to collaborative data analysis. The narrative final classification was then the comprehensive perspective reached by all researchers.",

These perspectives highlighted by the participants may be relevant to adapt strategies, including physical exercise programs, or create new ones according to personal needs. Moreover, these outcomes would be important to understand the adherence to these practices in older adults, and, especially to design person-centred healthy ageing policies. During the interview, participants gave their definitions regarding physical exercise. The group enrolled in the community program appeared to have partial knowledge about the difference between physical exercise and physical activity, while the group of non-enrolled participants showed difficulties defining physical exercise. That is probably a trend to a better literacy surrounding physical exercise in the enrolled group. Although there is evidence supporting a relationship between physical literacy and the practice of physical exercise (Belanger et al., 2018; Cornish et al., 2020) , its direction is unknown. Despite this, we recommend current and future exercise programs to include a first stage focused on the improvement of the participant\u00b4s physical literacy as it would be crucial to understand related potential benefits, and therefore to potentialize older participants' adherence.",

In fact, self-monitoring is a very effective behaviour change technique useful to increase physical activity and exercise (Donnachie et al., 2017) . Moreover, previous literature on this topic confirms that there is a significant relationship between monitoring physical activity (with accelerometers) and lower levels of anxiety and depression (Parker et al., 2008) . These two reasons may explain why the less active group may feel the need to measure and monitor their physical exercise. Regarding the benefits obtained from the practice of physical exercise, although both groups referred to physical benefits, the enrolled group highlighted mental health benefits (e.g., physical exercise helped them when in difficult times such as the current pandemic) while the non-enrolled group focused on the benefits regarding the management of current health conditions (e.g., obesity, diabetes, attenuation, pain, and muscle loss). This may be due to the fact that the participants who exercise regularly in a community program may, in fact, start to feel mental health benefits which is a known effect of physical exercise and physical activity (Penedo & Dahn, 2005; Violant-Holz et al., 2020) . In contrast, the participants who do not regularly exercise may feel or believe that the benefits of physical exercise are mostly physical and condition control.",

However, it is important to note that one person stated that she preferred to do exercise alone and in the afternoon. This highlights the importance of future programs to be person-centred and tailored to the individual's preferences and objectives, which has been supported by previous research of (Lachman et al., 2018) in which they sought to identify motivational and behavioural strategies to increase levels of physical activity in sedentary older adults. Furthermore, rather than a \"one size fits all\" approach to exercise programs, a more personalized approach involving participants' decisions and choices, tailored to subgroups or individuals, and their contexts should be taken (Kaehne, 2018; Lange et al., 2019; Miller, 2016) .",

While the enrolled group tend to focus on pain and other physical restrictions, the non-enrolled group said referred that the lack of time, comorbidities, and characteristics of the exercises (e.g., location, repetitions, scheduling) were the biggest barriers. Accordingly, previous studies confirmed that the lack of time and the comorbidities were the most noted difficulty in the practice of physical activity and exercise in the scientific evidence (Cavill & Foster, 2018; Franco et al., 2015b) however, these authors have not concluded about specific differences between enrolled and non-enrolled elderly in exercise programs. Data collected in the groups included in this study highlighted the importance of performing guiding narratives as a method to provide valuable personal perspectives about physical exercise in elderly people. Collecting the personal perspectives on physical exercise would provide professional teams with strategies to overcome the barriers. In fact, according to previous studies, the adherence to physical exercise in old people can improve when it is encouraged the exercise as leisure-time activity (Kolt et al., 2004) . Furthermore, considering the elderly participants in the present study, it would be important to explain not only the health-related benefits of exercise activity, but especially those related to socializing enjoyment, relaxation, and physical and mental well-being (Kolt et al., 2004) .",

Thus, the way in which communication is carried out by health professionals is crucial to limit or increase these practices. In fact, multiple studies have demonstrated that effective communication between physician-patient is positively related to the adherence to several different regimens being over two times higher (Haskard Zolnierek & Dimatteo, 2009) .",

In fact, the more active group has possibly turned the practice of physical exercise into a habit or regular routine, decreasing the chances of stopping, while the less active individuals, who do not exercise regularly, are less prone to start or maintain the practice of physical exercise, creating and giving excuses to justify it. Interestingly, it seems that habit-formation can promote an effect on behavioural change, as reported by (Gardner & Rebar, 2019) . As for those who are more sedentary, they hold incorrect, negative, and self-defeating views about their ability to exercise making it less likely for them to adhere to physical exercise programs, and their participation is typically not maintained over time (Lachman et al., 2018) .",

These perspectives highlighted by the participants may be relevant in the development of patient-centred strategies for the design of physical exercise programs targeting older adults, to increase their practice and healthy ageing. We encourage future development of exercise programs to include early stages focused on physical literacy and the program designers should also understand the preferences and objectives of the older population to improve adherence of all participants and overall quality of life. We also alert to the need of health and physical education professionals to improve their methods of communication with, and motivation of patients as these are effective and crucial tools capable of changing the individuals' lifestyles. Further research is needed, including more comprehensive methodologies (e.g., personal interviews) to improve the understanding of what criteria need to be addressed in order to design biopsychosocial exercise programs focused on the individual. Also, it would be important to design mixed studies on this topic, by including quantitative and qualitative data, which would contribute to further understanding participant's points of view about physical exercise practice.",
