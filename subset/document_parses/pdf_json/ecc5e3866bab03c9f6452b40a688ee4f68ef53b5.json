In this study, we investigated the advantages of using polymeric microparticles carrying the luciferase reporter gene in increasing transfection efficiency in the readily transfectable HEK293 cell line and the difficult to transfect RAW264.7 cell line. The results indicated that there was a limit to the ratio of nitrogen in polyethylenimine (PEI) to phosphate in DNA (N/P ratio) beyond which further increases in transgene expression no longer, or only marginally, occurred. Microparticles encapsulating PEI:DNA nanoplexes induced cellular toxicity in a dosedependent manner. PEGylation increased transgene expression, likely related to enhanced degradation of particles. Furthermore, intra-tracheal instillation in rats allowed us to investigate the inflammatory response in the lung as a function of PEGylation, porosity, and size. Porosity did not influence cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the absence of PEG, but in particles containing PEG, non-porous particles recruited fewer inflammatory cells than their porous counterparts. Finally, both 1 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm porous PLA-PEG particles recruited more neutrophils than 4 \u03bcm particles. Thus, we have shown that PEGylation and lack of porosity are advantageous for faster release of genetic cargo from microparticles and a reduced inflammatory response, respectively.",

Vaccination has resulted in the eradication of smallpox (1), near eradication of polio (2) , and H1N1 influenza viruses, which caused both the Spanish flu and Swine flu epidemics (3) . Vaccines have also reduced the number of cases of liver cancer caused by hepatitis B (4) , and cervical cancer caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) (5, 6) . Both the hepatitis B vaccine and the HPV vaccine require repeated administration to establish immunity to the viruses. An alternative method of stimulating the immune system to fight infections is gene delivery, such as with plasmid DNA (pDNA). Although this option was proposed in 1990 using DNA encapsulated into liposomes, several challenges remain 30 years later for translating pDNA-based vaccines to clinical settings, and no DNA-based vaccines have yet been approved for human use (3, 7) .",

DNA readily undergoes enzymatic degradation, which can be mitigated by implementing protective mechanisms. One such mechanism is polymeric encapsulation with biocompatible polymers, which is beneficial despite reduced nuclear entry (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . For example, the use of polyethylenimine (PEI) as a complexing agent imparts a positive charge on the DNA, which enhances cellular uptake (8, 13, 14, (17) (18) (19) . Further protections from degradation include using polymeric microparticles, which can also assist in pulmonary delivery due to their size. These polymeric microparticles are often developed from polymers found in FDA-approved devices and formulations, such as poly(lacticco-glycolic-acid) (PLGA), or poly(lactic acid) (PLA) (20) (21) (22) . Delivering these particles directly to the lungs is advantageous for treating conditions specific to the lungs, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, because the lungs are a rich site for antigen-presenting cells and blood exchange. However, since the lungs are also a primary site for airborne pathogens, they also contain a robust defense system to remove xenobiotics from the body.",

Generally, charge repulsion is overcome by complexing DNA or RNA with a positively charged polymer, such as PEI (28) (29) (30) . Once complexed, there is a net positive charge that can facilitate cell binding and uptake and then escape from endosomal compartments through a mechanism known as the proton sponge effect (28, 31, 32) . However, positively charged polymers kill many of the cells that get transfected above a certain N/P ratio (33, 34) . Microparticles may offer a protective barrier to cell death by prolonging the release profile of the positively charged material. Encapsulation into microparticles also protects the DNA from degradation and slows release (23, 35, 36) .",

RAW264.7 murine macrophages are more difficult to transfect and serve as a model for pulmonary uptake and phagocytosis. The overall trends that were observed in the HEK293 cells and the RAW264.7 macrophages were similar. The relative cell viability of cells cultured with blank microparticles was investigated in only the HEK293 cells, because they were expected to have a more sensitive response than the RAW264.7 macrophages. Although there was a decrease in the relative cell viability at the lower time points, viability increased again by 30 h for low concentrations of the microparticles (Fig. 1) . It was assumed that unencapsulated PEI-pDNA would induce stronger cytotoxic responses than the encapsulated microparticle formulations, consistent with prior studies (13, 38) . PEI is a cationic polymer, whereas PLGA is a negatively charged, hydrophilic polymer. Previous investigations have quantified the zeta potential of PLGA with and without cationic conjugation, which confirm that the microparticles alone are negatively charged, but the charge becomes positive once nanoplexes (or dendriplexes) are introduced (13, 15, 38) . When nanoplexes were encapsulated into the microparticles, there was a decrease in relative cell viability that was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2) . Complete monolayer coverage for these particles within the wells was calculated to occur at 12.5 mg/mL, thus suggesting that the observed differences in viability at high concentrations may have been cytotoxicity caused by a physical phenomenon (disruption of the cell membrane) rather than an intracellular cytotoxic response, such as apoptosis. PEI may induce cell death via apoptosis promoted by mitochondrial damage (39) . Microparticles can lower the observed toxicity compared with free PEI-pDNA (15) , which may also be a result of apoptosis (40) . Therefore, it is possible that in these experiments, both apoptosis and necrosis were mechanisms of the observed decrease in cell viability.",

In the present study, transgene expression was observed in both HEK293 and RAW264.7 cell lines after as little as 48 h (Fig. 4) , which may be a result of surface nanoplexes from incomplete encapsulation and enhanced release rates caused by cell enzymes in vitro compared with the benchtop investigation. At the earliest time point of 48 h, this effect was not observable in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4B) , likely because these cells are more difficult to transfect than HEK293 cells. The increased transgene expression at longer time points can be explained by the sustained release of the cargo (Fig. 4) . With the additional knowledge that luminescence, and therefore the luciferase signal, decreases overtime, we would not expect such observations in the absence of continued release over the 6-day (144 h) period for nanoplexes encapsulated into microparticles which is consistent with the concept that nanoplexes were undergoing sustained release.",

In the inflammatory response, neutrophils are often the \"first responders\" to xenobiotics, and therefore their abundance 4 h after administration was expected (48) . At later time points, it is likely that the inflammatory response would shift away from neutrophils towards macrophages. These macrophages release responsive cytokines and digest the foreign microparticles as part of the inflammatory response (49) . Cellular recruitment may be a direct result of the release of PEI, as several groups have reported that PEI itself could elicit an immune response (50) . However, PLGA microparticles have also been demonstrated to recruit immune cells in mice Microparticles were added at a concentration of 3 mg/mL (1 \u03bcg DNA). All reported values are the mean and standard deviation for n = 3 trials. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA with comparisons between PLA and PLA-PEG at each time point. Significant differences are denoted by ****p < 0.00001 or n.s. for no significance (16, 24) , and have been shown to be phagocytosed by antigen presenting cells (14) .",

Porosity influences the aerodynamic diameter of particles, which is the effective diameter for aerosolized particles. Greater porosity results in lower density and corresponds to a smaller aerodynamic diameter, which effectively means that the particles behave as smaller than their true size during delivery (21, 47, 51) . That said, the actual particle size and PEG density are still important for cellular uptake (42) . Given the observed differences in neutrophil recruitment between porous 4 \u03bcm PLA-PEG microparticles and non-porous 4 \u03bcm PLA-PEG microparticles (Fig. 5) , it is possible that fewer porous particles were delivered to the target site as they have a larger potential to reach deeper within than lung than their non-porous counterparts. Alternatively, the interaction of PEG with the lungs may limit the inflammatory response, in this case cellular recruitment (52) . This may also explain why PEGylated particles have longer retention times and reduced clearance (25) .",

At present, four countries have approved the vaccine, including the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (53) , and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (54) , in addition to approval from Bahrain and Canada. This novel vaccine differs from the formulations presented in this study in two key ways: 1) mRNA and pDNA operate with different mechanisms (55) , and 2) the recently approved vaccines use lipid carriers rather than synthetic polymers. Lipid-based particles may be formed from a diverse panel of organic compounds, with the primary component being amphiphilic phospholipids. These particles have been used for both DNA and RNA, with effective complexation via electrostatic interactions, similarly to how PEI-pDNA nanoplexes were formed. Furthermore, these particles protect the genetic material from degradation and increase the likelihood of cellular uptake, again, similar to PEI-pDNA nanoplexes. There was existing evidence that mRNA vaccines were promising, including success in cancers, infectious diseases, and viral diseases (56) (57) (58) . The mRNA vaccines work by entering host cells where their cargo is translated into protein in the cytoplasm that is subsequently processed and presented in a form which can activate the immune system, specifically T cells (59) . For pDNA vaccines, the plasmid DNA needs to enter the nucleus to produce the protein that will then elicit an immune response through antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (60) . There remain no DNA vaccines approved for human use in the USA, but these have had success in veterinary medicine (61, 62) . As such, it is possible that these vaccines will be the next major milestone for human immunizations.",

Additionally, these particles can be carefully designed such that they are suitable for deposition within the pulmonary region, allowing them to release their cargo directly to the target site over time. In this work, we showed that RAW264.7 murine macrophages, which are difficult to transfect, have transgene expression from 48 to 144 h albeit at much lower levels than HEK293 cells. Furthermore, using PEGylated particles in place of PLA particles enhances transfection with one likely cause being the accelerated degradation of the microparticles. Finally, intra-tracheal instillation of microparticles in rats revealed that 4 \u03bcm porous PEGylated microparticles recruited fewer neutrophils and macrophages than 1 \u03bcm or 10 \u03bcm porous PLA-PEG microparticles. For PLGA particles, porosity did not influence cell recruitment in the BAL fluid, but for PLA-PEG microparticles, non-porous microparticles yielded lower cellular recruitment than porous microparticles. These studies have demonstrated that polymeric microparticles encapsulating PEI:pDNA nanoplexes are suitable for transfecting cells in vitro, and that 4 \u03bcm, non-porous PLA-PEG microparticles recruited the lowest number of inflammatory cells in vivo. Further investigations are necessary to determine the ability of these microparticles to be delivered in a patient-compliant model, such as an aerosol inhaler. These results, combined with prior investigations, indicate that deposition in the deep lung is achievable for future delivery applications.",
