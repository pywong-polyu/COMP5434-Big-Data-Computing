            "text": "Background/purpose: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is a primary stromal choroiditis with bilateral granulomatous panuveitis. If initial-onset VKH is treated early and relentlessly the disease can be controlled and even \"cured\" in a substantial number of cases. We are reporting on a patient treated early and in a sustained fashion who was inflammation free for seven years but who presented a reactivation 6 weeks after the second dose of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Case report: A 43-year-old woman presented with severe initial-onset VKH disease which was brought under control using steroidal and non-steroidal Immunosuppression (mycophenolic acid and cyclosporine) with additional infliximab infusions because of the persistence of subclinical choroiditis identified on ICGA. Under infliximab alone disease had been inflammation free with no subclinical disease and absence of sunset glow fundus for 6 years. However, following anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, severe resurgence of the disease occurred with exudative retinal detachments. Disease was rapidly brought again under control with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) therapy and a new loading scheme of infliximab therapy. Conclusion: VKH disease results from an autoimmune process directed against melanocyte associated antigens which can be controlled when early and sustained immunosuppressive treatment is introduced. It seems that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be at the origin of reactivation of long-time controlled disease.",

Except for infliximab, all other treatments were stopped, including oral prednisone within 9 months, cyclosporine within 13 months and mycophenolic acid within 22 months. Infliximab infusions were given every 6 weeks for 30 months and every 10 weeks during the 3 subsequent years, all disease parameters being under control with no disease activity, no occult choroiditis, and no sunset glow fundus (",

There was substantial anterior segment inflammation with laser flare photometry (LFP) values of 34.8 ph/ms OD and 64.2 ph/ms OS and this time, 3-4 small mutton-fat keratic precipitates OD were present (Fig. 5 ). There were retinal folds and subretinal fluid on OCT and choroidal thickness was markedly increased and not measurable on EDI-OCT (Fig. 6 ). There were again numerous HDDs visible on ICGA (Fig. 6) . After 5 days of oral prednisone (1 mg/ kg), LFP anterior segment inflammation quasi normalised to 9.1 ph/ms OD and 7.0 ph/ms OS and choroidal thickness had again diminished substantially and increased thickness could again be measured with a mean of 506 \u00b1 56 \u03bcm OD and 454 \u00b1 28 \u03bcm (Fig. 6 ).

There is probably a tendency, with the massive vaccination campaign similar to no other, to overattribute many adverse events to this vaccination. In our case, the delay of 6 weeks until reactivation of VKH inflammation seems fairly long to be linked to the vaccination. However, the fact that the disease was completely under control for 6 years and recured all of a sudden after the vaccination strongly points towards it being the trigger of this reactivation, taking into account that nothing in the health status, treatment or in the lifestyle of this patient had changed. Moreover, the reactivation of a complex immunological mechanism, probably needs some time to translate into disease resurgence. It is interesting to note that, during the first 9 months after disease onset, when prednisone was tapered and stopped, the combination of cyclosporine and mycophenolic acid was unable to prevent occult reactivation of choroiditis that was detected by ICGA. This latter modality is known to be very sensitive, showing diligently that, for a given patient whether he/she responds to a particular therapy. Indeed, ICGA was shown to be very sensitive to rapidly detect whether a treatment was efficient or not and to fine-tune therapy in primary stromal choroiditis [12] .",
