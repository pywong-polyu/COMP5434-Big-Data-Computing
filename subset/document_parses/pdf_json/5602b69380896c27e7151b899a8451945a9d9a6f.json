The aim of this study is to analyse the variation in hospitalisation and death between indigenous and non-indigenous patients with COVID-19 to guide future policies and clinical practice. Methods We used data from the Mexican Ministry of Health (MoH) to study the hospitalisation and death of adults with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in MoH facilities between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021. Predicted probabilities of hospitalisation and death were adjusted for sociodemographic and presentation to care characteristics as well as municipal social deprivation index and health jurisdiction-level index of human resource and hospital equipment availability. Results Of 465 676 hospitalised adults with COVID-19, 5873 (1.3%) were identified as indigenous. Indigenous patients had higher odds of hospitalisation (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 2.0), death (aOR=1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1. 3) and early mortality (aOR=1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.4), compared with non-indigenous patients. Living in municipalities with high social deprivation was associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation and early death. Living in areas with low healthcare resources was associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation but not death. Being male, aged 51 years or older, having diabetes, hypertension and obesity were associated with an incremental probability of hospitalisation and death among indigenous patients. Conclusions Indigenous patients with COVID-19 in Mexico have a higher risk of hospitalisation and death than non-indigenous individuals. Our findings can guide future efforts to protect this population from SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated outcomes.",

Half of them lived in households where an indigenous language was spoken, and onethird spoke an indigenous language. Eight out of 32 states in Mexico are home to 60%-85% of all indigenous people in the country. Since the large majority of indigenous people live in poor communities and were subject to health vulnerabilities prior to COVID-19, this pandemic has represented a particular hardship for this population. 14 Indigenous population health needs are largely managed in Mexican Ministry of Health (MoH) units, which are tax funded, 15 16 and belong to one of the 243 health jurisdictions responsible for providing health services for the population without social security. They execute, coordinate and monitor health programmes and services at the substate level.",

A recent study showed that adults with COVID-19 who spoke an indigenous language were at a much higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than those who did not speak an indigenous language. 7 However, previous studies did not address the difference in hospitalisation and early mortality, nor account for differences in healthcare resources and characteristics related to presentation to care.

Information on these variables was provided by patients upon receiving care. Contextual: given lack of individual-level data on socioeconomic status, which can influence one's main outcomes, we included two indices with information on the social context and health system capacity according to the municipality of residence of each individual in the data set. The first index was a factor municipality-level social deprivation index, which is considered a reliable measure of an individual's socioeconomic context in Mexico. This index is based on access to basic public services, housing conditions and wage earnings in 2015. 26 The calculation of this index was carried out using data from the 2015 intercensal survey and was limited to the Mexican population without social security. 27 We also included a health jurisdiction-level index of human resource and hospital equipment availability with data available prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. This index was constructed using factor analysis 28 using the last official health resources database available (2018). 29 The index incorporated availability of human resources and hospital equipment prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which corresponded to the state in which SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted, and followed the official guidelines for the organisation and execution of the Hospital Conversion COVID-19 for the Mexican National Health System Institutions. 30",

Next, we calculated the percentage (and their 95% CI) of individuals who were hospitalised, who died and who died within 5 days of hospitalisation (early mortality), according to indigenous ethnicity. Differences between them were also evaluated using \u03c7 2 tests. We then conducted three separate multiple logistic regression analyses, a model for each of the outcomes of interest. Regression models were adjusted for all covariates mentioned above (except for ambulatory/ hospitalised setting for the hospitalisation outcome), including a binary variable for each state (ie, state fixed effect). Adjusted ORs (aORs) with their 95% CIs were estimated. We then estimated the incremental predicted probability of hospitalisation and death (global and early) among indigenous people according to sex, age groups, comorbidities (diabetes, obesity and HTN), lowest and highest healthcare resources at the health jurisdictional level and high and low municipality social deprivation. Incremental predicted probabilities were calculated with respect to the adjusted probability of hospitalisation and death (global and early) among the indigenous population and were expressed in ORs.",

A total of 795 878 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the analysis, of whom 8022 (1.01%) self-identified as indigenous (table 1) . A higher percentage of indigenous patients (compared with nonindigenous) were male (56.1%, p<0.001), aged 51 years or over (27.6%, p<0.001), self-reported diabetes (20.6% vs 12.6%, p<0.001), obesity (18.3% vs 15.9%), HTN (20.3% vs 16.0%, p<0.001) and CKD (1.8% vs 1.0%, p<0.001). Although a lower proportion of indigenous individuals self-reported smoking than non-indigenous individuals, COPD was also the most commonly reported among indigenous patients (2.9% vs 0.9%, p<0.001), compared with non-indigenous patients. A higher proportion of indigenous patients lived in a municipality with high social deprivation (79.5% vs 32.8%, p<0.001), and in a state with 36 and over was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation and death, with the effect size increasing substantially with increasing age group. Medical comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, HTN and CKD, were associated with higher odds of hospitalisation, death and early mortality. COPD was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation and early mortality and cardiovascular disease with higher odds of hospitalisation. Presenting to care in the months of May 2020 to December 2021 was associated with lower odds of hospitalisation, death and early mortality, compared with presenting in March or April. Early mortality increased in January 2021. Presenting to care 4 or more days after symptom onset was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (4-7 days aOR=1.46, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.48, p<0.001; 8 or more days aOR=2.74, 95% CI 2.68 to 2.80, p<0.001) and a small but significant odds of death (8 or more days aOR=1.07, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.10, p<0.001). Hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or mechanical ventilation were associated with higher odds of death (aOR=34.11, 95% CI 32.94 to 35.31, p<0.001) and early mortality (aOR=1.51, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.61, p<0.001). Living in a municipality with high social deprivation was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (aOR=1.54, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.58, p<0.001) and early mortality (aOR=1.33, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.44, p<0.001), compared with living in a municipality with low social deprivation. Residence in a state with high healthcare resources was associated with lower odds of death (aOR=0.92, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.96, p<0.001) and early death (aOR=0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99, p<0.05). Figure 1 presents the characteristics associated with an incremental predicted probability of hospitalisation or death among indigenous compared with non-indigenous patients. Being male, aged 51 years or older, having diabetes, HTN and obesity were associated with an incremental probability of hospitalisation and death among indigenous patients. Living in a municipality with the highest level of social deprivation was associated with a higher probability of hospitalisation (incremental predicted probabilities=1.14, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.15), as was presenting to care 4-7 days (incremental predicted probabilities=1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.04), and 8 or more days after symptom onset (incremental predicted probabilities=1.48, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.50).",

In this large retrospective cross-sectional study of individuals with laboratoryconfirmed SARS-CoV-2, we show that indigenous people with COVID-19 in Mexico, who carry a disproportionate burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), are more likely to be hospitalised and die than non-indigenous individuals with COVID-19. Furthermore, the greater odds of poor COVID-19 outcomes seen among indigenous individuals hold even after adjustment for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, presentation to care characteristics and healthcare resources. These findings underscore the urgent need to implement risk mitigation strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this vulnerable population.",

Given the association between COPD and severe COVID-19, 36 policies and educational programmes that help mitigate the exposure to these risk factors could help lower the risk of COPD in groups already vulnerable to poor COVID-19 outcomes. Second, the burden of cardiometabolic NCDs was significantly higher in the indigenous compared with the non-indigenous group in this study. While cardiometabolic NCDs, particularly obesity and diabetes, have emerged as strong risk factors for heightened illness severity with COVID-19, the increased hospitalisation and mortality risk seen among the indigenous population was observed even after adjustment for these comorbidities. However, given that these comorbidities were self-reported and metabolic disease is highly prevalent among indigenous communities in Mexico, 37 it is possible that the higher risk of hospitalisation and death observed could be partly attributed to either undiagnosed or unaccounted metabolic disease owing to self-report. This may also explain why we observed an incremental risk of hospitalisation when presenting later in the course of illness among indigenous compared with non-indigenous individuals.",

            "text": "Our findings that show indigenous people are subject to poorer health outcomes when compared with non-indigenous individuals are not unique to COVID-19. For instance, disparities in maternal health and child health outcomes between indigenous compared with non-indigenous individuals have been well documented in Mexico. 38 39 Our study adds to the current literature on health disparities seen in the care of indigenous peoples and sheds light to the fact that poor COVID-19 outcomes are associated with higher social deprivation, low healthcare resources and organisational and cultural barriers faced by indigenous individuals in the process of accessing and using healthcare services. Although the Mexican government has increased ICU and hospital capacity, 40 these efforts have not been targeted at regions with a high percentage of indigenous peoples. Previous studies have highlighted the disparities in healthcare resources in states with a large indigenous population. 17 Other explanations for higher death and earlier mortality may be that indigenous people tend to identify alarm signs later in the process of disease due to a lack of information and their different perception of need. Moreover, deprivation effects such as lack of paid sick leave may result in indigenous people postponing seeking care. Additionally, indigenous peoples may hesitate to seek conventional healthcare, in part due to a conflicting relationship with the providers of conventional health services. Finally, indigenous peoples tend to receive lower quality of care, due in part to organisational and cultural barriers, which may help explain some of the disparities that we document in our study. 41 Our study has several limitations. First, this study makes use of a nationwide administrative database that was not designed for clinical research and does not include people who died outside of the hospital setting. Second, all comorbidities included were self-reported. Third, we do not have data on quality of care, which means we do not know whether differences in clinical care or individual factors contributed to the higher predicted probability of death in indigenous people. Fourth, considering that many indigenous peoples live in remote communities where healthcare services are difficult to reach and have limited capacity, our estimates of the prevalence of death, especially in the indigenous population, could be underestimated. Future studies should explore the distance to the nearest hospital and time from symptom onset to hospitalisation, adjusting for mode of transportation. Fifth, we lacked socioeconomic information at the individual level (ie, schooling, work condition, health insurance, etc). To account for this limitation, we (A) limited our analysis to adults who received care in an MoH care unit, thus creating a study sample that is more homogenous in terms of their socioeconomic profile, and (B) we adjusted our estimations by the municipality social deprivation index, which is considered a reliable measure of an individual's socioeconomic context in Mexico. 26 Sixth, we also lacked information on healthcare resources (physical and human) currently available to combat the epidemic, which in our model could be underestimating this effect.",

However, indigenous peoples experience a high degree of marginalisation, which includes lack of access to water, sanitation and other key services, including healthcare services. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a grave health threat to indigenous peoples around the world. Our study suggests that Mexican indigenous people with COVID-19 and users of a public MoH care unit have a higher risk of hospitalisation and death than non-indigenous individuals. Better protecting indigenous people will require a concerted effort, including promoting better access to healthcare and improving quality of existing health services for this population. There is also a need for better information technology and other infrastructure to ensure that indigenous peoples have access to timely and reliable information that could reduce their risk of infection. The improvement of the relationship between these communities and local health authorities is crucial because indigenous populations will seek and use conventional health services only if they trust these authorities and the conventional healthcare providers.

Our findings can guide future efforts to protect this population from SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated outcomes, and similar pandemics.",
