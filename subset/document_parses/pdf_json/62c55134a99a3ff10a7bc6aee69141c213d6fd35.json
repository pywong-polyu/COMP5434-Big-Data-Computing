Thus, the effect of VPS29 KO on 267 rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 was indeed specific. In fact, there was significantly greater association 268 between incoming IAV and 2xFYVE-labeled endosomes in parental HT1080 cells as compared 269 to VPS29 KO cells ( Figure 6C and S5), mirroring the opposing effects of VPS KO on HCoV and 270 IAV infection. 271 272 We hypothesized that such effect might be due to VPS29-dependent trafficking of antiviral 273 proteins with activity against IAV to endosomes, such as IFITM3.

Since these viruses all rely on endocytic pathways for viral entry (Krzyzaniak et 148 al., 2013; Lakadamyali et al., 2004; Meier and Greber, 2004), these data indicate that 149 VPS29/CCC and WDR81/91 are specifically required for coronavirus infection, rather than 150 broadly impairing endocytic function. The magnitude of the effect of CCC complex and 151 WDR81/91 knockout on CoV infection was different in different cell lines. For example, KO of 152 the CCC complex or WDR81/91 had a blunted effect on CoV infection in HT1080-ACE2 cells 153 (Figure 2H-K). Moreover, in 293T-ACE2 cells, KO of the CCC complex inhibited HCoV-OC43 154 but not HCoV-NL63 or rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 infection, while WDR81/91 knockout impaired 155 infection for all three viruses (Figure 2O-Q). 156 157",

These data thus 200 suggest that the enhancement of IAV infection in VPS29 KO cells is due to the absence of an 201 intact Retromer/WASH complex. While KO or KD of VPS29 facilitates IAV infection, KD of 202 some VPS29-interacting proteins impaired IAV infection.

Indeed, infection 351 by HCoVs that use three distinct receptors was inhibited by VPS29/CCC KO, while there was no 352 VPS29/CCC requirement for infection by IAV, adenovirus, or RSV-which should otherwise 353 also be dependent on cell-surface expression of their respective receptors. Indeed, HCoV-354 OC43's purported receptor (9-O-acetylated sialic acid) is nearly identical to IAV's receptor 355 (sialic acid). Yet, while HCoV-OC43 infection is highly dependent on VPS29/CCC, IAV 356 infection is either unaffected by these factors (in A549 cells) or hindered by them (in HT1080 357 and 293T cells). 358 359 A possible mechanism that might account for the enhancing effect VPS29 deficiency on IAV 360 infection could be retromer-dependent trafficking of endosomal cargo that antagonizes IAV 361 infection. While this notion is consistent with our finding that showing incoming IAV 362 accumulated in endosomes to a greater extent in normal than in VPS29 KO cells, the proteins 363 that might be responsible for mediating this effect are unknown. Other possibilities, include 364 direct influence of retromer on IAV containing endosomes, In this regard, retromer dependent 365 movement of human papilloma virus (HPV) to the TGN has been reported to involve direct 366 interaction between retromer and the HPV L2 protein (Popa et al., 2015). While loss of 367 retromer/WASH complex facilitated IAV infection in HT1080 cells, loss of other retromer-368 interacting proteins, such as SNX6 and Rab38, impaired IAV infection. Thus, distinct effector 369 functions of VPS29 may have different infection enhancing and inhibiting properties, with the 370 overall effect depending on viral and/or cell-type specific characteristics. Differences in 371 expression and/or activity of various VPS29 effector proteins may explain why VPS29 KO 372 facilitates IAV infection in HT1080 and 293T cells, but not in A549 cells. 373 374 However, VPS29 KO impaired CoV infection in all cells tested, including primary lung cells. 375 Nevertheless, we did observe some differences. Specifically, loss of both retromer and retriever 376 impaired HCoV-OC43 infection, while loss of retriever did not impair HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-377 229E or rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings suggest that there may be multiple roles 378 for VPS29 in HCoV infection, with some CoVs requiring the effector functions of distinct 379 VPS29-containing complexes. The precise requirement for distinct VPS29 functions could vary 380 with cell type, for example there was a decreased requirement for the CCC complex in HT1080 381 and 293T cells. Our finding that SARS-CoV-2R683G , SARS-CoV, and bat/pangolin CoVs were 382 all heavily impacted by both VPS29 KO and cathepsin inhibition suggests that these viruses are 383 especially sensitive to endocytic function, in line with recent work demonstrating that mutation 384 of the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage site drives virions to enter via the endocytic route 385 (Winstone et al., 2021). 386 387Based on our findings, it appears that a key feature of VPS29/retromer KO cells, is elevation of 388 the pH of endolysosomal compartments. This change should impair activation of cathepsins 389(Jerala et al., 1998), thus impeding endosomal CoV spike as well as EBOV GP processing and 390 egress from endosomes to initiate productive infection, consistent with our observations of",
