Our work contains an exploration of using human respiratory sounds as diagnostic markers for COVID-19 in crowdsourced, uncontrolled data. Specifically, this paper describes our preliminary findings over a subset of our dataset currently being crowdsourced worldwide. The dataset was collected through an app (Android and Web) that asked volunteers for samples of their voice, coughs and breathing as well as their medical history and symptoms. The app also asks if the user has tested positive for COVID-19. To date, we have collected on the order of 10,000 samples from about 7000 unique users. While other efforts exist that collect some similar data, they are often either limited in scope (e.g., collect only coughs [1, 2] ) or in scale (e.g., collect smaller samples in a specific region or hospital). This is, to our knowledge, the largest uncontrolled, crowdsourced data collection of COVID-19 related sounds worldwide. In addition, the mobile app gathers data from single individuals up to every two days, allowing for potential tracking of disease progression. This is also a unique feature of our collected dataset. Section 3 contains a more detailed description of the data. In the paper we analyze a subset of our data as described in Section 3.3 and show some preliminary evidence that cough and breathing sounds could contain diagnostic signals to discriminate COVID-19 users from healthy ones: we further compare COVID-19 positive user coughs with healthy coughs as well as those from users with asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 210, "end": 214, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 311, "end": 315, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 518, "end": 522, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1367, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1370, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "More precisely the contributions of this paper are:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "\u2022 We describe our COVID-19 sound collection framework through apps, and the types of sounds harvested through crowdsourcing. \u2022 We illustrate the large-scale dataset being gathered.
