It has been reported that their global incidence increases with population growth and with age, year by year [1] [2] [3] , especially in China. To date, the most common clinical treatment method for peripheral hip diseases is surgery. However, the surgery is challenging because of the complex deep anatomy of the hip and the narrow safe passage required. Moreover, this approach relies heavily on the operator's clinical experience for the recognition of anatomical sites and lesion sites.",

Acetabular dysplasia is usually characterized by a shallow or vertically oriented acetabulum with inadequate femoral head coverage, thereby contributing to irreversible aggravation as the joint matures, resulting in persistent claudication, pain, osteoarthritis, and affects the patient's daily life [10, 11] . Accordingly, most patients eventually undergo total hip arthroplasty (THA) to provide long-term pain relief while improving hip function. However, anatomical variations in hip dysplasia leads to difficult and risky surgical operations. To date, the surgeon used the imaging results as the basis of the surgical plan, combined with personal experience and intraoperative specifics [12] . However, the application of 3D printing technology has unique advantages, showing a great specifically therapeutic effect in clinical trials for DDH therapy. This concept's anatomical correction and biomechanical stability were tested in a canine model that, like humans, suffers from hip dysplasia, demonstrating that patient-specific shelf implants significantly improved the coverage and stability of dysplastic hips in a canine model with naturally occurring hip dysplasia [13] .",

Zheng et al. [19] compared a 3D-printed navigation template for proximal femoral osteotomy in older children with hip dysplasia to 13 patients who underwent the same procedure but did not have a navigation template. As a result, they found that the operation time, the number of X-ray exposures and the occurrence of femoral epiphysis damage were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) ( Figure 1 ). Ferretti discovered that using laser-guided implantation of patient-specific devices in total hip arthroplasty also improved placement accuracy substantially [21] .",

Similarly, Qiang et al. [24] performed femoral osteotomy and acetabular reconstruction in 12 patients using a 3D printing prosthesis. Follow-up results showed significant improvement in the Harris hip score and affected limb deformity. There is no doubt that the performance of the 3D printed prosthesis is directly related to the success of THA surgery and the patient's quality of life [25]; nevertheless, Hothi [26] found that the 3D printed acetabular cups have structural cavities.

Previously, the standard orthopedic methods for managing malignant bone tumors around the acetabulum were amputation or tumor resection, and prosthesis replacement is widely used in the treatment of the reconstruction of large bone defects around the acetabulum [31] . Other methods, such as allogeneic hemi-socket replacement, proximal femoral eversion implantation, and inactivation of the tumor bone for implantation, have been used to treat primary tumors [32] , Innovative therapies, such as fungalderived materials [33, 34] , calycosin-exerting potential anti-OS actions [35] , have been created in recent years. Nevertheless, there has been a longstanding debate on the best treatment for this condition due to the high rate of postoperative complications.

            "text": "Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is one of the most severe complications of THA. Correct identification of pathogens and timely diagnosis are key to effective PJI treatment [54] . The mortality rate of patients with artificial joint infections is increasing due to older age, poor primary physical conditions, and increased antibiotic resistance to bacteria [55] . When infection occurs, if conventional symptomatic treatment cannot be controlled, surgery should be performed as soon as possible to simultaneously restore the function of the patient's hip joint and reduce the patient's pain, which not only creates a burden on families but also seriously affects their quality of life and mental health.",

The first stage involves removing the implant and using a cement gasket containing antibiotics, compounded by intravenous and oral targeting of antibiotics recommended by the doctor for 6-12 weeks. The second phase involves the reimplantation of a new permanent prosthesis [56] . Kim et al. [57] found that 3D-printed liners made of polylactic acid (PLA) performed better than the current bone cement poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in the treatment of peripheral joint infections, which have superior mechanical properties to PMMA and can elute antibiotics in a controlled manner. This reflects the advantages of RP in prosthetic infections.",

However, the second operation may result in immense harm to patients. Prosthesis with a better antibacterial effect can decrease the time of operation and joint function recovery in patients by reducing the trauma suffered by the patient. Yang et al. [58] recently combined 3D printing with antimicrobial nano-modification technology to obtain zirconia ceramic implant materials with a precise 3D structure and long-term wear resistance. The prepared hip prosthesis precisely matched the affected part with good biocompatibility and sterilization ( Figure 5 ). In addition, Karaji et al. [59] used electrophoretic deposition of a silk fibroin protein solution consisting of calcium phosphate and vancomycin as a coating on a porous titanium surface made of additives, which exhibited good antimicrobial properties and contributed to bone differentiation. It is believed that the combination of 3D printing technology and antibacterial technology will play an essential role in the treatment of prosthetic infections in the future.",

First, 3D printing technology is costly and has low production efficiency and a long-time cycle. Therefore, it could play a minimal role in emergency treatment. Furthermore, materials with non-toxicity and biomechanical properties, especially high-strength mechanical properties, are required to manufacture prostheses. However, research on these materials is still in the laboratory stage. This will become one of the main directions for the future development of 3D printing technology. In addition, the technology is still not available for printing other articular tissues such as muscle ligaments. There were significant differences between real surgery and simulated surgery due to the lack of surrounding tissues during the simulated surgery. It is prone to unexpected problems during surgery, depending on operator skill. Additionally, although the technology has large sample sizes in clinical applications and the short-term follow-up effect is positive, the long-term follow-up sample sizes are small, so a large amount of long-term follow-up data is crucial to the future evaluation and development of 3D printing technology. Also, a systematic analysis of the study can be conducted in the future, based on a large amount of data.",
