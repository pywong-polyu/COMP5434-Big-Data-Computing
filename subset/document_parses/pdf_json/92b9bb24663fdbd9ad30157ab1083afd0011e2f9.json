Predictions of mortality and hospitalization help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we aggregate the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. With only limited information available regarding the historical accuracy of the forecasting teams, we consider aggregation (i.e. combining) methods that do not rely on a record of past accuracy. In this empirical paper, we evaluate the accuracy of aggregation methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods, which enable robust estimation and allow the aggregate forecast to reduce the impact of a tendency for the forecasting teams to be under-or overconfident. We use data that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. While the simple average performed well for the high mortality series, we obtained greater accuracy using the median and certain trimming methods for the low and medium mortality series.

Epidemiological forecasting models have been applied to both vector-borne diseases, including Dengue disease (Shi et al. 2016 ) and the Zika virus (Kobres et al. 2019) , and contagious infectious diseases. These include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Ng et al. 2003) , Ebola (Viboud et al. 2017 ) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Da'ar et al. 2018) . Numerous COVID-19 models have emerged (Adam 2020 , COVID-19 Forecast Hub 2020 . These models are based on different models and make different assumptions and therefore answer different questions (Holmdahl and Buckee 2020) . Due to the lack of data, assumptions have to be made about several factors including the extent of immunity, transmission among people who are asymptomatic and how the public will react to new government restrictions. Paucity of data is a common challenge in forecasting infectious diseases (Lauer et al. 2020) . Policy makers need to be aware of the limitations of the models, and need to be conscious of the uncertainty in predictions from these models (Sridhar and Majumder 2020) . Gneiting and Katzfuss (2014) describe how optimal decision-making relies on the availability of a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast (see, for example, Gianfreda and Bunn 2018; Wang and Yao 2020) . Interval forecasts are also valuable, as they can support real-time decision making and provide situational awareness (see, for example, Chen and Xiao 2012; Grushka-Cockayne and Jose 2020; Bracher et al. 2020) . In this paper, we consider the case where probabilistic forecasts are provided by multiple forecasters for the cumulative total of deaths due to COVID-19. We aggregate the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. The benefit of collective decision making was highlighted by Galton in his seminal paper, as he reported the success of a crowd at a country fair in guessing the weight of an ox (Galton 1907) . Aggregation provides a pragmatic approach to synthesizing the information underlying different forecasting methods. It also enables diversification of the risk inherent in selecting a single forecaster who may turn out to be poor, and it offsets statistical bias associated with individual forecasters who tend to be under-or overconfident.

These data are from the daily reports issued by the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

We described how compartmental models were used by approximately half the teams, and we illustrated this in Figure 4 . We were curious to see how the aggregation methods would perform if they were applied to only the teams using compartmental models. Given their widespread use by epidemiologists, one might surmise that aggregating only these models would be adequate, and that an aggregation using only the other types of models would deliver poor results. We investigate these issues in Table 5 , where we report CRPS results produced by applying the aggregation methods to the following three different sets of the individual forecasting teams: all the teams, the teams using compartmental models, and the teams not using compartmental models.
