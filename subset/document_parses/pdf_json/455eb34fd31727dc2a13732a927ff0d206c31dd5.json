Due to its infection rate and severity, it has emerged as one of the major global threats of the current generation. To support the current combat against the disease, this research aims to propose a machine learning-based pipeline to detect COVID-19 infection using lung computed tomography scan images (CTI). This implemented pipeline consists of a number of sub-procedures ranging from segmenting the COVID-19 infection to classifying the segmented regions. The initial part of the pipeline implements the segmentation of the COVID-19-affected CTI using social group optimization-based Kapur's entropy thresholding, followed by k-means clustering and morphology-based segmentation. The next part of the pipeline implements feature extraction, selection, and fusion to classify the infection. Principle component analysis-based serial fusion technique is used in fusing the features and the fused feature vector is then employed to train, test, and validate four different classifiers namely Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function, and Decision Tree. Experimental results using benchmark datasets show a high accuracy (> 91%) for the morphology-based segmentation task; for the classification task, the KNN offers the highest accuracy among the compared classifiers (> 87%). However, this should be noted that this method still awaits clinical validation, and therefore should not be used to clinically diagnose ongoing COVID-19 infection.",

During the mass disease screening operation, the existing medical data amount will gradually increase and reduce the data burden; it is essential to employ an image segregation system to categorize the existing medical data into two or multi-class, and to assign the priority during the treatment implementation. The recent works in the literature confirm that the feature-fusion-based methods will improve the classification accuracy without employing the complex methodologies [39] [40] [41] . Classification task implemented using the features of the original image and the regionof-interest (ROI) offered superior result on some image classification problems and this procedure is recommended when the similarity between the normal and the disease class images is more [24, 26, 31, 42, 43] . Hence, for the identical images, it is necessary to employ a segmentation technique to extract the ROI from the disease class image with better accuracy [26] . Finally, the fused features of the actual image and the ROI are fused to attain enhanced classification accuracy.",

In this work, SGO-KE-based tri-level threshold is initially applied to enhance the lung section (see \"Social Group Optimization and Kapur's Function\" for details). Then, KMC is employed to segregate the thresholded image into background, artifact, and the lung segment. The unwanted lung sections are then removed using a morphological segmentation procedure and the extracted binary image of the lung is then compared with its related GT provided in the database. Finally, the essential performance measures are computed and based on which the performance of the proposed COVID-19 system is validated. Figure 3 presents the proposed ML scheme to separate the considered lung CTI into normal/COVID-19 class. This system is constructed using two different images, such as (i) the original test image (normal/COVID-19 class) and (ii) the binary form of the COVID-19 section. The ",

In this operation, the role of the SGO is to randomly adjust the threshold value of the chosen image until KE is maximized.

The SGO parameters discussed in Dey et al. [46] are [47] by mimicking the knowledge sharing concepts in humans. This algorithm employs two phases, such as (i) enhancing phase to coordinate the arrangement of people (agents) in a group, and the (ii) knowledge gaining phase: which allows the agents to notice the finest solution based on the task. In this paper, an agent is considered a social population who is generated based on the features/parameters. The mathematical description of the SGO is defined as: let X I denote the original knowledge of agents of a group with dimension I = 1, 2, ..., N. If the number of variables to be optimized is represented as D, then the initial knowledge can be expressed as X I = (x I 1 , x I 2 ,... x I D ).

The extracted COVID-19 is associated with the artifacts; hence, morphological enhancement and segmentation discussed in [49, 50] are implemented to extract the pneumonia infection, with better accuracy. KMC helps split u-observations into K-groups. For a given set of observations with dimension \"d,\" KMC will try to split them into K-groups; Q(Q 1 , Q 2 , ..., Q K ) for (K \u2264 u) to shrink the within-cluster sum of squares as depicted by Eq. 9:",

In this work, the well-known image feature extraction methods, such as Complex-Wavelet-Transform (CWT) and Discrete-Wavelet-Transform (DWT) as well as Empirical-Wavelet-Transform (EWT) are considered in 2-D domain to extract the features of the normal/COVID-19 class grayscale images.

This developed system is executed using a workstation with the configuration: Intel i5 2.GHz processor with 8GB RAM and 2GB VRAM equipped with the MATLAB (www.mathworks. com). Experimental results of this study confirm that this scheme requires a mean time of 173 \u00b1 11 s to process the considered CTI dataset and the processing time can be improved by using a workstation with higher computational capability. The advantage of this scheme is it is a fully automated practice and will not require the operator assistance during the execution. The proposed research initially executes the COVID-19 infection segmentation task using the benchmark dataset of [44] . The results attained using a chosen trial image are depicted in Fig. 6 . Figure 6a depicts the sample image of dimension 256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 1 and Fig. 6b and c depict the actual and the binary forms of the GT image. The result attained with the SGO-KE-based tri-level threshold is depicted in Fig. 6d . Later, the KMC is employed to segregate Fig. 6d into three different sections and the separated images are shown in Fig. 6e- A similar procedure is implemented for other images of this dataset and means performance measure attained for the whole benchmark database (78 images) is depicted in Fig. 7 . From this figure, it is evident that the segmentation accuracy attained for this dataset is higher than 91%, and in the future To improve the detection accuracy, the feature vector size is increased by considering the FFV (1 \u00d7 96 features) and a similar procedure is repeated. The obtained results (as in Table 1 , bottom three rows) with the FFV confirm that the increment of features improves the detection accuracy considerably and the KNN classifier offers an improved accuracy (higher than 87%) compared with the RF, SVM-RBF, and DT. The precision and the F1-score offered by the RF are superior compared with the alternatives. The experimental results attained with the proposed ML scheme revealed that this methodology helps achieve better classification accuracy on the considered lung CTI dataset. The accuracy attained with the chosen classifiers for FV1 and FFV is depicted in Fig. 8 . The future scope of the proposed method includes (i) implementing the proposed ML scheme to test the clinically obtained CTI of COVID-19 patients; (ii) enhancing the performance of implemented ML technique by considering the other feature extraction and classification procedures existing in the literature; and (iii) implementing and validating the performance of the proposed ML with other ML techniques existing in the literature; and (iv) implementing an appropriate DL architecture to attain better detection accuracy on the benchmark as well as the clinical grade COVID-19 infected lung CTI.",

The proposed system executed a sequence of procedures ranging from image pre-processing to the classification to develop a better COVID-19 detection tool. The initial part of the work implements an image segmentation procedure with SGO-KE thresholding, KMCbased separation, morphology-based COVID-19 infection extraction, and a relative study between the extracted COVID-19 sections with the GT. The segmentation assisted to achieve an overall accuracy higher than 91% on a benchmark CTI dataset. Later, an ML scheme with essential procedures such as feature extraction, feature selection, feature fusion, and classification is implemented on the considered data, and the proposed scheme with the KNN classifier achieved an accuracy higher than 87%.",

Initially, the proposed ML scheme is implemented by considering only the grayscale image features (FV1) with a dimension 1 \u00d7 69 and the performance of the considered classifier units, such as RF, KNN, SVM-RBF, and DT, is computed. During this procedure, 70% of the database (140 + 140 = 280 images) are considered for training and 30% (60 + 60 = 120 images) are considered for testing.
