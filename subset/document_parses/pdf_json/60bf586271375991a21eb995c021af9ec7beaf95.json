Regarding AMR, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has been identified as a High Priority Pathogen by the World Health Organization. 6 Antibiotic treatment options for MRSA are more limited and may not always be available throughout LMIC settings. Until recently there has been a paucity of data on MRSA prevalence from LMICs, 7 a situation that is slowly improving due to initiatives such as the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS). 8 Regarding HAIs, S. aureus is the most frequent cause of healthcare-associated bacteraemia in both high-income 9 and LMIC settings. 10 Healthcare-associated SAB (HA-SAB) has been used in surveillance programs as a marker of healthcare quality, 11 in part as there are specific interventions \u2212 such as hand hygiene 12 and lineinsertion bundles 13 \u2212 that are proven to reduce the rates of HA-SAB, including in LMICs. 14, 15 SAB is of particular importance to tropical regions such as the Pacific Islands. This region experiences high rates of skin disease (including impetigo, scabies and dermatophyte infections) 16 and diabetes 17 \u2212 both key risk factors for community-acquired SAB. A previous study of SAB from Fiji over a decade ago demonstrated a very high annual incidence of 50 cases per 100,000 population. 18 Currently, most published data on SAB comes from high-income, temperate countries. There is little available data from low-and middle-income tropical countries, 19, 20 despite the majority of the global population residing in such settings. To address this knowledge gap, we describe the clinical epidemiology, microbiology, management and outcomes of patients with SAB treated at Fiji's largest hospital.",

            "text": "Globally, most estimates of the population incidence of SAB come from high-income countries, ranging from 15 to 40 cases per 100,000 person-years. 30, 31 Estimates from LMICs have been far less frequent, often focus exclusively on paediatric populations, and potentially suffer from under ascertainment due to lower rates of microbiological testing. 32 A Thai study of all age groups reported a SAB incidence of 7.3 per 100,000 person-years in two rural provinces, 33 while two African studies in children reported incidences of 27 and 48 cases per 100 000 person-years in Kenya and Mozambique, respectively. 34, 35 Our observed rate of 68.8 cases per 100 000 person-years is higher than the 50.1 per 100 000 person-years reported by an earlier study of SAB cases in Suva over 2006\u22122007, 18 and reinforces that Fiji has one of the highest global rates of SAB. This is likely driven by Fiji's high rates of both diabetes (almost half of all adults in our study) and concomitant skin diseases. 16 One of the closest reported rates of SAB from the literature comes from Northern Australia, another tropical setting, with an incidence of 65 per 100,000 person-years among a cohort with high rates of diabetes (21.7%) and socioeconomic disadvantage. 36 We determined a healthcare-associated SAB (HA-SAB) rate at CWMH of 2.3 cases per 10,000 patient days. HA-SAB is one of the commonest causes of nosocomial bacteraemia 37 and is associated with high mortality, however there are proven interventions \u2212 such as hand hygiene, or improved management of intravascular catheters \u2212 that can lower the HA-SAB rate. 38 Although a meta-analysis suggested that healthcareassociated infections (HAIs) are 2\u22123 times more common in LMICs compared to high-income countries, 10 a recent point-prevalence survey of HAIs in Fiji found a relatively low overall prevalence of HAIs at CMWH of 8.7%, 21 slightly below estimates from similar studies in both Australia 39 and Singapore. 40 Despite this apparent low overall rate of HAIs, CWMH's HA-SAB rate of 2.3 per 10,000 patients days is higher than that seen in equivalent large hospitals in Australia (0.96 per 10,000 patient days) 41 or in England (1.04 per 10,000 patient days). 42 HA-SABs may represent a prime candidate for proven, targeted, infection prevention and control interventions at CWMH. We observed an all-cause in-hospital mortality rate of 25.3% for all SABs in Fiji, rising to 31.4% among adult patients with SAB. This is slightly higher than rates of around 20% reported by high-income countries, 2, 43 however is similar to most other studies from LMICs which range from 27 to 33%. 5, 44 Interestingly, a case series from Thailand \u2212 which might have been expected to provide the closest comparison to Fiji as another tropical, upper-middle-income country \u2212 reported a far higher proportion of patients (40%) either dying in-hospital or being discharged moribund, and a 12-week allcause mortality rate over 50%. 4 Our finding of a significantly increased risk of death with rising age is consistent with the published literature from both highincome and LMIC settings. 4, 43 While the proportion of MRSA isolates in our study was relatively low at 8.4%, this is higher than the rate of only 2.3% from 128 consecutive SABs at CWMH 15 years ago. 18 Reported rates of MRSA vary widely between Pacific Island countries, from very low rates of 0% and 12% in Vanuatu and Cook Islands, respectively, 45, 46 through to 30\u221242% in Kiribati, Tonga and Samoa. 47\u221249 Patients with MRSA bacteraemia experienced a higher \u2212 but not statistically significant \u2212 crude mortality. This may be due to none of these patients receiving effective empiric antibiotics. Because of low numbers of MRSA cases we could not perform logistic regression to correct for confounders associated with both methicillin-resistance and mortality. We note that other studies from LMICs have found conflicting results regarding the impact of ineffective empiric therapy for S. aureus: in Thailand ineffective initial therapy was significantly associated with increased mortality on logistic regression, 4 whereas such an association was not evident in a large multinational study across South America. 50 Just over half of our assessable cohort underwent an echocardiogram; endocarditis was seen infrequently (7.3%, n = 4) with none of these patients dying. This contrasts with reported rates of endocarditis following SAB of up to 25%, 51 with accompanying in-hospital mortality of 20\u221230%. 52 Our prevalence could be falsely low in part due to the absence of transoesophageal echocardiography at CWMH, which has a higher sensitivity. Additionally, the low observed prevalence and mortality of endocarditis may be related to survivor bias, with healthier patients more likely to survive long enough to undergo an echocardiogram (a median of 5 days after their index culture). Other cohort studies from LMICs have demonstrated similarly low rates of endocarditis following SAB \u2212 between 7 and 14% \u2212 with underascertainment felt to be likely. 4, 5 Although our research was conducted during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, across the entire study period there was no community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Fiji and very few restrictions beyond the closure of the international border. We therefore feel our findings are representative of the outcomes and incidence of SAB during a non-pandemic period.",

First, this single-centre analysis was from Fiji's largest hospital, located in the Central Division, and may not be representative of other hospitals or Divisions in Fiji. We do not have clinical or outcome data on SABs who were not admitted to CWMH within 48 h of their index culture, so cannot assess how this cohort might differ from the inpatient cohort presented above. Second, for pragmatic reasons, chart review occurred at a single time point shortly after index blood culture \u2212 this precluded data collection on antibiotic treatment duration, procedures for source control or presence of metastatic infection. All of these are important factors in determining SAB outcome, which could not subsequently be corrected for in our analyses. Third, our multivariable regression should be interpreted with caution as we were unable to include all variables suggested by the DAG process, due to small sample size and concerns regarding over-parameterisation. Finally, our measurement of SAB incidence may be a slight overestimate if there were further cases of CoNS incorrectly identified as S. aureus among patients with no isolates for confirmatory testing. However, conversely, our measurement could instead be an underestimate if there were further SAB cases that went undiagnosed, were misdiagnosed as CoNS, or were detected by one of the few small microbiology laboratories in Central Division outside of CWMH.",

Despite the limitations outlined above, our research contributes valuable new knowledge about SAB from a tropical, middle-income country. We have shown that central Fiji has one of the highest rates of SAB in the world. Based on the existing literature and our own new research, we believe efforts to reduce SAB in Fiji should focus on the prevention of both diabetes and skin diseases at the community level, and the optimisation of infection prevention activities at the hospital level.",
