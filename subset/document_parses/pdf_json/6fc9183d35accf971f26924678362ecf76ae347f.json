Structural stigma, including bans/restrictions on same-sex relationships and health care disparities among LGB individuals [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , may promote other stigma such as bullying and hate crimes against LGB individuals [7] , and disapprobation of LGB cultures [8] may impact the identities, behaviors, health, and relationships of LGB individuals profoundly. Internalized sex stigma, or internalized homonegativity, refers to the process whereby LGB individuals perceive and internalize societal messages toward gender and sex-often unconsciously, as part of their self-image [9] . Negative feelings toward themselves may threaten their psychological well-being [10] and increase risks of mental health problems [11, 12] among LGB individuals.",

LGB individuals may use alcohol and addictive substance use to cope with the stress-related to internalized sexual stigma [15, 16] . Research has found that internalized sexual stigma was associated with practicing HIV at-risk sexual behaviors, such as condomless sex, multiple sex partners, and unprotected anal sex among gay men [12, 15, 17] . Internalized sexual stigma may also deter the LGB individuals from seeking medical services. For example, a previous study on Chinese men who have sex with men indicated that internalized homophobia was a major barrier to accessing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and care services [18] .",

Several rounds of psychometric testing with different methods (including content validity checking, cognitive interviewing, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis) were applied to the MISS-LG; finally, the MISS-LG was verified to be a three-factor structure (i.e., sexuality, identity, and social discomfort) with 17 items [26] . The feature of the MISS-LG is that this scale has two versions, one for males and another for females with the same three first-order factors, the same number of items, and Likert-type scale with some different item contents [26] . For example, the sexuality factor of the MISS-LG contains the item \"If you are gay, it is better to have an active sexual role\" in the version for gay and bisexual men only and the item \"All lesbian women end up isolated and alone\" in the version for lesbian and bisexual women only. As Szymanski et al. [27] noted, there are significant differences in the ways that internalized sexual stigma is experienced for sexual minority men and women, and it is important to identify manifestations that have some common features and specificities for lesbian women and gay men. Therefore, the MISS-LG will help capture gender-specific characteristics of internalized sex stigma.",

In the manuscript [26] , study participants were Westerns, and therefore, psychometric properties of the MISS-LG should be evaluated in other populations (e.g., Eastern ones like in Taiwan) to evaluate its generalizability beyond WEIRD (White, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) groups [28] .

This announcement encouraged many LGB individuals in Taiwan. However, the results of the vote for the Same-Sex Marriage Referendums in Taiwan released on November 24, 2018, indicated that over 70% of voters opposed same-sex marriage defined in the Civil Code [31] . Although the Taiwanese government legalized same-sex relationships outside the Civil Code in May 2019 [32] , unfavorable attitudes and unfriendly behaviors appear to remain rooted in many Taiwanese people's mindset and difficult to change, especially for those with strong traditional Chinese ethics [33] or Christian faith [30] .

Specifically, the classical test theory in the present study adopts the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to verify whether the three-factor structure of the MISS-LG can be replicated among LGB individuals in Taiwan.

The social discomfort factor (7 items) reflects fear of public identification as a lesbian woman or gay man in the social context and disclosure in private and professional life (e.g., \"When I feel attracted to another lesbian/gay man, I hope no one realizes it\"). The sexuality factor (5 items) indicates the pessimistic attitudes toward the quality and duration of intimate relationships in lesbians and gay men (e.g., \"Lesbians/gay men can only have flings/onenight stands\") and the negative conception of gay or lesbian sexual behaviors (e.g., \"When I have sex with a woman/man, I feel awkward\").

The psychometric testing of the MISS-LG involved three parts. First, CFA with a diagonally weighted least-squares estimator was used to examine the three-factor structure of the MISS-LG. Accordingly, factor loadings derived from the CFA were calculated with a value >0.3 indicating acceptability [44] . In addition, the CFA was examined using several fit indices to determine whether the three-factor structure was supported. The fit indices were the comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.95, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) > 0.95, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.06, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) < 0.08 [45] . Second, Rasch analysis with a partial credit model was used to examine whether the items embedded in the MISS-LGB factors belonged to their constructs. Specifically, infit mean square (MnSq) and outfit MnSq were used to decide whether an item fit with its construct. When both infit and outfit MnSq of an item was between 0.5 and 1.5, this item was considered to be in its embedded construct [46] . Item difficulty was also calculated from the Rasch analysis. Third, concurrent validity of the traditional Chinese version of the MISS-LG was examined using the correlations between MISS-LG factors and other measures (i.e., HHRS-Homosexuality and AAQ).",

Most participants had obtained a college diploma or college degree (87.2% in male participants and 91.0% in female participants). Nearly three-fourths of male participants (73.0%) and slightly less than half of the female participants (41.0%) were homosexual. Other characteristics, including parental educational levels and whether participants' sexual orientation was known by others, are presented in Table 1 . Table 2 reports the item properties and CFA results for the MISS-LG. All items were normally distributed or nearly normally distributed (skewness = \u221202 to 1.97, kurtosis = \u22121.25 to 3.87 for males; skewness = \u22120.11 to 3.13, kurtosis = \u22120.96 to 9.77 for females). Most items had an acceptable factor loading (i.e., >0.3) with the exceptions of items 8 (\"I do not believe in love between homosexual individuals\"; factor loading = 0.270 for males) and 11 (\"If you are gay, it is better to have an \"active\" sexual role\"; factor loading = 0.167 for males and \"Lesbians can only have flings/one-night stands\"; factor loading = 0.299 for females). Regarding the entire factor structure, the MISS-LG demonstrated a good fit with the three-factor structure by the support of excellent fit indices. For males, the fit indices were chi-square (df) = 232.47 (116), p-value < 0.001, CFI = 0.985, TLI = 0.983, RMSEA (90% CI) = 0.045 (0.036, 0.053), and SRMR = 0.062 or females, the fit indices were chi-square (df) = 186.62 (116), p-value < 0.001, CFI = 0.987, TLI = 0.985, RMSEA (90% CI) = 0.035 (0.025, 0.044), and SRMR = 0.056. Results from Rasch analyses (Table 3) indicate that the difficulty range of the MISS-LG sexuality factor was between 0.97 and \u22121.03 for males and between 0.60 and \u22120.66 for females. The difficulty range of the MISS-LG identity factor was between 1.12 and \u22121.01 for males and between \u22121.12 and 0.85 for females. The difficulty range of the MISS-LG social discomfort was between \u22120.45 and 0.36 for males and between \u22121.29 and 0.93 for females. Moreover, almost all the items had good fit statistics in both infit and outfit MnSq with the exceptions of items 3 (\"I'm worried to understand whether I like women\"; outfit MnSq = 1.53) and 17 (\"Effeminate gay men annoy me\"; outfit MnSq = 1.51) for males. Finally, the concurrent validity of the MISS-LG is shown in Table 4 with both HHRS-Homosexuality and AAQ measures. The correlations between the three factors of MISS-LG were in strong magnitude (r = 0.752 to 0.937 for males; = 0.640 to 0.784 for females; all p-values < 0.001). Moreover, the three MISS-LG factors were positively associated with HHRS-Homosexuality scores (r = 0.220 to 0.256 for males; = 0.190 to 0.384 for females; all p-values < 0.001) and AAQ scores (r = 0.323 to 0.427 for males; = 0.135 to 0.424 for females; all p-values < 0.001).

The results derived from CFA and Rasch analysis all suggest that the traditional Chinese version of the MISS-LG had satisfactory construct validity across groups. Specifically, CFA results indicated that the factorial structure of the MISS-LG included three factors in both male and female sexual-minority individuals in Taiwan. Therefore, the sexuality, identity, and social discomfort factors are different constructs in the MISS-LG, which echoes findings from Lingiardi et al. [26] . Rasch analysis additionally suggested that each factor was unidimensional: the items under the same factor of the MISS-LG were grouped together to demonstrate the same constructs. The concurrent validity of the MISS-LG was also supported by the significant correlations of the three MISS-LG factor scores with HHRS-Homosexuality and AAQ scores.",

However, we found that item 11 for males (\"If you are gay, it is better to have an \"active\" sexual role\") had a low factor loading (factor loading = 0.167). Therefore, item 11 might not well adhere to its embedded sexuality factor. The sexuality factor indicates the negative attitudes toward sexual behaviors and intimate relationships in lesbian women, gay men, or bisexual individuals. However, item 11 describes a value judgment on a specific sexual behaviors or positions rather than sexual behaviors or intimate relationships in gay men. This may be a possible reason to explain the low factor loadings for item 11 among males. It is also possible that cultural differences relating to individualism versus collectivism in Western and Eastern cultures may in part underlie apparent differences. Another item for males was found to have slightly low factor loadings; specifically, item 8 for males (\"I do not believe in love between homosexual individuals\"; factor loading = 0.270). Item 8 for males does not explicitly describe attitudes toward sexual behaviors or intimate relationships. For example, whether a person \"believes in love\" could be influenced by past experiences of dating. Therefore, when a person reads this sentence, the focus may not be on the intimate relationship of the individual per se. One more item, item 11 for females, also had a factor loading lower than 0.3 (factor loading = 0.299). However, this item (i.e., \"Lesbians can only have flings/one-night stands\") conceptually fits well in the sexuality factor and its factor loadings is extremely close to 0.3. Nevertheless, future studies are needed to further explore the factor structure of MISS-LG for both the male and female versions.",

LGB individuals who perceive stigmatizing attitudes toward homosexuality may experience long-lasting impacts on their self-identity and internalize perceived stigma. A high AAQ score indicates a low level of psychological flexibility. Individuals with low psychological flexibility lack adaptable perspectives to observe and think without attachment to particular experiences, and therefore they may become trapped by past experiences and find it difficult to move forward [48] . LGB individuals who have low psychological flexibility may lack the effort to challenge social sexual stigma and internalize it as self-stigma.

Second, biases inherent to questionnaires (e.g., relating to social desirability) should be considered. Although we assured participants that all questionnaires were anonymous and individual data would be kept confidential, we cannot guarantee that every participant had no other concerns when they completed the questionnaires. Third, we did not conduct test-retest reliability and responsiveness for the MISS-LG. Therefore, it is unclear whether the traditional Chinese version of the MISS-LG has good reproducibility over time and whether it is sensitive to detecting changes in self-stigma. Fourth, the study included only lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals. How sexual stigma may impact other sexual minority groups (e.g., transsexual, asexual) should be considered in future studies. Fifth, this study inquired participants' gender identities by the binary of male and female but did not include the options of transgender, gender nonbinary, or genderqueer. Research has found that sexual and gender minority identities have intersectional impacts on health [49] and behaviors [50] ; both sexual and gender minority identities should be considered in public health practice [51] .",
