Using the case of a large-scale health service reconfiguration in northwest England, this study began as a narrative investigation into how different data types and sources are prioritised as NHS administrative structures change over time. During the research, one unpopular reconfiguration decision, the downgrading of a hospital, was challenged using judicial review. Suddenly, a key decision was being based not upon 'facts and data' type evidence but upon evidence of adherence to administrative procedure. This transferred focus away from the ever-shifting categories and hierarchies of data 'types' towards an emphasis on process. By comparing two deliberative contexts-committee and judicial review-this article proposes that evidence can be understood as simultaneously entity and process. As health service reconfigurations continue in response to austerity, integration agendas, evolving organisational landscapes, and demographic and political change, it is increasingly important to recognise the different meanings and uses of evidence.",

The background and political context of the case study is described, followed by a detailed analysis. The article concludes with a warning, that in the context of EBP, we must exercise caution in our use of evidence terminology, which carries various reopening both ontological and epistemological debates. 1 Nevertheless, the debate and disagreement around EBP has created a context of perpetual critique; 'the dirty secret [of EBP] is that we don't know whether we're doing the right thing' (Guay 2018) .",

In Greater Manchester, significant reconfiguration decisions were based on a range of evidence types, determined by and exposed to different organisational processes, audiences and forms of deliberation. The Greater Manchester context is described, including health service reconfigurations over the last decade and the present situation, known as 'Devo Health', which led among other things to the downgrading of a hospital, an event that became the subject of a legal challenge that treated evidence in a different way.

This involved reductions in public spending and selective tax increases. 2 Although the government claimed that the NHS had been 'ring fenced' from such cuts, the austerity programme impacted all areas of public spending. For example, personal financial problems caused by welfare cuts led to increased mental health issues, placing further pressures on the NHS (Knapp 2012) . Other complex relationships between health and social issues emerged, showing that the NHS remained vulnerable to the effects of austerity (Stuckler et al. 2017) . The rate of growth for NHS funding almost flattened during austerity. \"Budgets rose by 1.4 per cent each year on average (adjusting for inflation) between 2009/2010 and 2018/2019, compared to the 3.7% average rises since the NHS was established\" (King's Fund 2020). In Greater Manchester, decisions became increasingly based on financial rather than 1 Ontological: is evidence a thing or a process, or both? RCTs and other scientistic approaches assume a mechanistic ontology to reveal the true nature of things. Epistemological: evidence is how we justify the belief in an action, so what is our relationship to it? 'Justification' is itself highly value-laden and the use of evidence is instrumental in our own value systems. In the political realm, ideas like 'facts' and 'truth' have only partial currency. 2 Selective tax increases: for example, the rate of value-added tax, a regressive tax, was increased, while the marginal tax rate on the highest incomes was reduced.",

            "text": "While this article focuses on Greater Manchester's devolved health and social care context, the UK political structure remains highly centralized. Booth (2019) observes, \"Not only is Britain a highly centralised state, it is constitutionally incoherent. In many cases, the government has devolved spending powers to Wales, Scotland and areas such as Manchester. However, it has not properly devolved taxraising powers\". Consequently, devolved authorities such as Greater Manchester remain more accountable to Westminster than to their local populace. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) is therefore heavily reliant on central government funding allocations and so to wider (as well as local) political/financial factors. 3 In 2011, Greater Manchester became a devolved 'city-region', governed by a combined authority. By 2015, the GMCA had been given increased control over its \u00a36bn health and social care budget (then dubbed 'Healthopolis' but now known as 'Devo Health') and became responsible for the overall strategic direction of health and social care in Greater Manchester. This was seen as an opportunity to restructure services more in line with local needs and to pursue the NHS integration agenda as part of the broader narrative of health service reform. The present study began by examining the changing nature of evidence types used in various reconfigurations since 2005. During the research, one controversial decision, the downgrading of a hospital, was challenged using judicial review. This raised a different set of questions about the nature of evidence and its use, and became the new focus of the study.",

The mid-2000s 'Healthy Futures' and 'Making it Better' reconfigurations across Greater Manchester were driven by four main arguments: a clinical case for the merits of concentrating services; a policy case-compliance with the European Working Time Directive; epidemiological evidence based on population projections; and a public consultation. These were approved by a joint committee of Primary Care Trusts (PCTs, NHS administrative bodies responsible for commissioning services). However, the evidence was strongly criticised and challenged by Ruane (2007) , who disputed the quality/volume evidence that underpinned the 'concentration of services' argument; indicated key factors missing from the epidemiological evidence; and suggested that the way this was presented to the public was biased. Ruane's argument was ignored by the Independent Reconfiguration Panel for NHS Service Change and the reconfigurations were implemented. This happened under a Labour government at a time of relative prosperity for public services, so while economic factors informed decision-making, these were less apparent in any rationale.",

GP Clinical Directors were required to run their practices as businesses, so began to take more corporate approaches, giving increased prominence to accounting evidence. A more business-focused NHS emerged into an austerity context; configuration decisions increasingly hinged on 'doing more with less'. This is reflected in the NHS' gradual move away from employing CIPFA (Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy) accountants, who pursue more traditional 'book balancing' approaches, towards CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants) accountants, who pursue more strategic and profitoriented methods. There is also a trust issue; medics are perceived as 'heroic' (in comparison to accountants or politicians), so the idea of CCGs shaping local health economies carries a great deal of intuitive value in convincing members of the public in consultation. However, clinician-originated evidence may also be aimed at an internal audience, who want to be reassured they are making the right decisions (Byrne 2011, p. 109) .",

By claiming that the reconfiguration would improve performance at all GM Hospitals, the CiC had pre-emptively downgraded the value of historic clinical data. Mr Justice Dove therefore rejected the assertion and was 'satisfied that in principle it was rational for the defendant to put to one side existing data on clinical outcomes, on the basis that they are not necessarily a reliable basis for predicting clinical performance in the future\u2026' (2016: par. 108).

Again, ruling in favour of the defendants-and of empirical realism-the Judge noted that adding 'speculative' (2016: par. 114) journey times into the model would have been inconsistent with the methodology of using actual data; '\u2026an understanding of journey times derived from actual infrastructure on the ground, rather than infrastructure in the pipeline, was not irrational. It meant that the data used was transparent and could be checked, rather than being journey times which could only ever be the product of computer modelling' (ibid.: par. 115). The claimant also cited 'Hospital Episode Statistic' data, a historic record of the relationship between travel times and clinical outcomes. The defendants reiterated that historical data provides no basis for future predictions, as it is limited to the 'moment in time' the data was extracted.

However, a 'post-consultation co-dependencies review' (Healthier Together 2015: appendix 45) surveyed a range of literature relating to each area's dependency and, while some of this evidence came from other bodies engaged in reconfiguration and was at best secondary, this satisfied Mr Justice Dove that the consultation had been carried out correctly. It was concluded that: for cardiovascular and Cystic Fibrosis services, although codependencies exist, co-location is not essential (Mr Justice Dove 2016: pars. 38 and 41); that specialist sites would require 'clear and robust pathways' to sites that provided vascular surgery (par. 39); and that specialised burns treatment is co-dependent with general surgery, available at University Hospital of South Manchester (par. 40).",

The key words in these arguments are: 'rational' (in the case of hospital improvement and travel times) and 'carried out correctly' (in the case of co-dependencies). These are verdicts on process, as opposed to specific entity evidence (a clinical opinion, a balanced book, an epidemiological prediction). The judge based his final decision upon how specific pieces of evidence were handled, rather than on a simple hierarchy of evidence types. It is worth noting that several of the plaintiff's key assertions were pre-empted or mitigated in the DMMR, which determined how specific pieces of evidence should be treated and what types of information were admissible into the decision-making process. The judge observed that the assumptions made for the report effectively 'cast a form of invisibility cloak over the question of quality and safety and has the effect of excluding it exerting any form of influence over the final selection of the fourth Specialist Hospital' (Mr Justice Dove 2016, par. 109) .

Theoretical debates around the role of JR in what is deemed the 'democratic ontology' (Lustig and Weiler 2018, p. 316 ) remain open. Recourse to a comparatively objective process can bring some order to the problems of complexity and evidence amalgamation that affect meso-level decisions by committee around health and social care provision.

This is probably true of many apparently clinical deployments but it is necessarily true of any policy formation and implementation process that involves the interaction, or interweaving, of complex health, social care, political, and urban systems within a dynamic fiscal context in which resources are massively constrained. In their critique of an Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) report that purported to present evidence for hospital reconfiguration, Byrne and Ruane (2007) outline much the same argument, concluding that the IPPR evidence failed to acknowledge major contextual factors around interdependency, the volume/outcome relationship and patient empowerment.

On epistemic diversity, a distinction is made between 'teams of experts' (who operate independently) and 'expert teams' (whose combined expertise is greater than the set of individuals), and their relative merits in deliberating complex issues (Burke et al. 2004; Salas et al. 2006; Reyes and Salas 2019) . This is of particular importance in integrated health and social care contexts, where problems such as 'epistemic injustice'-treating people differently because of the type of knowledge they hold (Fricker 2007 )-can emerge. This mainly philosophical concept has special relevance in healthcare and health policy, where it can lead to unequal power relationships between agents as sources of evidence. For example, in healthcare, where multiple professions with different statuses work together (increasingly as services become more integrated), 'clinical knowledge' is often prioritised over other forms of knowledge (Fletcher and Clarke 2020) , whereas in a business context, financial evidence often carries more weight.",

A single decisionmaking agent, the judge, then determines which argument to uphold based on his or her own expertise in law. The judge's report offers some transparency-setting out the evidence from both sides and giving a clear rationale for the decision. This legal realist (as opposed to legal formalist) perspective reflects a view that those making legal decisions should pursue value-free approaches, and that the law does and should serve social ends, so legal decisions consider fairness and public policy-the real world as it is, rather than the more abstract world of rules (Tamanaha 2008) . It has been said that legal realists 'promoted the application of social science to law' (Tamanaha 2016, p. 147) . While committees evaluate the weight and relevance of different forms of entity evidence according to shifting hierarchies, JR treats different forms of entity evidence more equally and focuses instead on how these were processed.

Specifically, evidence does not solely refer to 'facts and data' (which seem condemned to jockey for position within an artificial hierarchy determined by prevailing organisational and political contexts); it can also be understood as the process through which facts and data are put-the basis for judicial reviews. The idea that evidence might exist simultaneously as both entity and process makes a useful contribution to discussions around evidence-based policy. This simultaneity is important; a more dynamic and process-oriented understanding of evidence improves on the somewhat more static concept of categorical and hierarchical evidence 'types', which are 'profoundly unpragmatic' (Byrne 2011, p. 46) . Just as causal mechanisms do not provide complete explanations without some understanding of their context, entity evidence must be considered in tandem with the process it is entered into. In complex mesolevel decisions, such as those concerning health service reconfigurations or integrating health and social care services, we already recognise that context plays a vital role. It should not be too great a leap to consider evidence in similar terms.",

            "text": "The use of JR in health service configuration decisions mobilizes a different set of background understandings around evidence, in which evidence must be considered as both an entity and as a process determining an outcome. While the distinct disciplinary forms of facts/data-type evidence move in and out of alignment with the shifting priorities of different NHS structures, the JR focused solely on the logic and administrative process of the original committee decision. The shift from using 'disciplinary-based' evidence, with fluctuating values linked to a prevailing culture, to being an instrumental tool in the service of a 'higher' decision, reflects this shift in focus from object to process. As judicial reviews become an ever more popular way to contest unpopular administrative decisions, the idea of evidence as a dynamic complex becomes increasingly relevant.",

First, we might consider those deploying evidence in committee-style decision-making contexts as skilled builders, assembling institutional-policy life from different levels and forms of evidence. Accounting for the wider context, the process of admitting and considering different evidence types, might enable decisions that are more resilient to organisational and contextual vagaries. At the very least, knowing that the administrative process itself might become evidence in a final decision should inform strategies at the committee stage. Second, for those studying related topics, such as knowledge aggregation, better recognising the relationship between facts and the process they are entered into might enable new insights in the more abstract debates around EBP. Either way, the core message remains: evidence terminology is slippery and more nuanced understandings of it would significantly benefit complex decision-making, especially in health and broader public policy.",
