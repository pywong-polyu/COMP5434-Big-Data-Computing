The forecasting result will help in making the prevention policies and remedial action in time, and thus, we can reduce the overall social and economic impacts on the country. This article introduces a CNN-LSTM hybrid deep learning prediction model, which can correctly forecast the COVID-19 epidemic across India. The proposed model uses convolutional layers, to extract meaningful information and learn from a given time series dataset. It is also enriched with the LSTM layer's capability, which means it can identify long-term and short-term dependencies. The experimental evaluation has been performed to gauge the performance and suitability of our proposed model among the other well-established time series forecasting models. From the empirical analysis, it is also clear that the use of extra convolutional layers with the LSTM layer may increase the forecasting model's performance. Apart from this, the deep insides of the current situation of medical resource availability across India have been discussed.",

            "text": "Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the year 2020 will be remembered as a devastating year for humanity. The foremost case of COVID-19 had been seen in China's Wuhan city and detected as undefined etiology. This first case came in December 2019, and within a month, it took the whole world into its trap (Cohen 2020; Huang et al. 2020 ). In the second week of March, the WHO (World Health Organization) had announced COVID-19 as a pandemic disease . Available online 2020; World Health Organization 2005; Sohrabi et al. 2020) . Initially, it was acknowledged as the Wuhan virus, but later on, it was named COVID-19 or 2019-nCov or Novel coronavirus (''WHO 2020; World Health Organization 2020). As per the current stats by WHO, 10,764,786 confirm cases, 518,120 deaths, 4,288,454 active cases, and 5,958,212 recovered cases, have been come up to July 1, 2020 (Coronavirus disease 2020a) . The epidemic situation causes severe social and economic impacts on the country. All the nations are taking preventive action, such as travel restraints, event deferrals, quarantines, testing, social distancing, and soft and tough lockdowns, to save their people's lives (Acter et al. 2020 ). Suppose we talk of India's perspective, which is a developing country and the second most populated country after China. So, the chance of COVID-19 is more as compared to other countries. India's government has taken various initiatives (i.e., lockdown 1-4, and unlock 1-2) to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic. As per the WHO's current COVID-19 stats for India, 605,220 confirm cases, 17,848 deaths, 227,476 active cases, and 359,896 recovered cases, have been come up to July 1, 2020 (Coronavirus disease 2020a) .",

Some of them are the fourth (final) phase of their trial, but to date, no antiviral treatments and vaccines are obtainable for COVID-19 (Ketu and Mishra 2020a) . Initially, the new vaccine for any novel disease was taking approximately 5-10 years to be on the market. But due to the latest technologies, the fast traction of the vaccine is possible and can usually take around 18-24 months, to come into the market (Grenfell and Drew 2020) . In the current scenario, any successful trials may take a minimum of 6-8 months to reach into the production line (if we follow parallel production) and may take a further 6-12 months to be in the market across the world. So, we have to follow preventive measures until the vaccine has come into the market.",

            "text": "In the last couple of years, substantial progress has been seen in the deep learning method in various application areas. If we talk about the deep learning techniques and methods to deal with real-life problems such as time series forecasting that have been successfully applied in various application areas (Ai et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2019; Zou and Xia 2019) . These models are capable enough to deal with the chaotic and noisy nature and lead to more reliable and accurate forecasts. The LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) networks are the most prevalent, well-established, proficient, and broadly used deep learning models (Fawaz et al. 2019) . The primary aim of using these models in the problem solving of time series paradigms is that the LSTM models are capable of obtaining the sequence outline more efficiently, whereas the CNN models are capable of filtering the input noise and capturing valuable features. The standard CNNs have been developed to deal with spatial autocorrelation data, but they are less capable of handling the long and complex temporal dependencies (Bengio et al. 2013 ). On the other hand, the LSTM is capable of handling the temporal dependencies and uses the features of the training dataset. Therefore, such a time series model who utilizes these two deep learning models' benefits can improve the overall prediction results. Figure 1 illustrates the current situation of COVID-19 epidemic in India with the bar chart. In Fig. 1 , the y-axis represents the number of infected peoples, and the x-axis represents the aggregate number of recovered cases, the aggregate number of infected cases, the aggregate number of deaths, and the aggregate number of active cases (Coronavirus disease 2020a) .",

So, there is a need for such algorithmic approaches that can minimize the impact of COVID-19 across the globe. The PIBA (Patient Information-Based Algorithm) was introduced by Wang et al. ) to estimate deaths caused by COVID-19 in china. The authors had predicted the overall death rate outside Wuhan and Hubei, which was lies between 0.75 and 3%. The death rate of Wuhan and Hubei was predicted to 13%. They had also quoted that the death rate could vary in different temperatures and climates. Gupta et al. (Gupta et al. 2020) had established a relationship between the COVID-19 cases and temperature. They had forecasted the results for India based on the outbreak analysis of the USA. Based on the analysis result for India, they had quoted that, in summers, the massive reduction would be seen in the number of new cases.

The second component is composed of LSTM and dense layers to exploit the generated features. The pooling and convolutional layers (Rawat and Wang 2017) are preprocessing layers that have been used for filtering and extracting fruitful information from the data. This refined data will be further used as an input in the network layer. We can say that convolutional layers apply the convolution operation among convolution kernels and input data for creating new features. The convolution kernel is nothing but a tiny window (compared to the input window) that carries the values of coefficients in the matrix form. This window applies the convolution operation to each subregion (patch) of the input matrix to determine the specified window input matrix. The outcome of these convolution processes is in the matrix form, which contains the attributes' value. This value of the attributes is derived by the dimension of the specified filter and coefficient values. Different convolution kernels can enhance the performance of the model because the convolved features that have been generated by the convolution operation are more fruitful than the original features.",

Thus, we can say that maxpooling is used to calculate the maximum costs of each patch, whereas average pooling is used to calculate each patch's average values. The pooling layer produces resultant, new matrices, or we can say that these new matrices are nothing but an abstract version of convolved features provided by a convolutional layer.

It is clear from the forecasting results of the COVID-19 epidemic, across the various states of India (29 states), that our proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid deep learning model performed exceptionally well throughout the experiment compared to the other well-grounded time series forecasting models. Our proposed model achieves minimal MAPE, highest R2 Score, and minimal RMSE under several selection settings (state-wise).",

The proposed model uses convolutional layers to extract meaningful information and learn from a given time series dataset. It is also enriched with the capability of the LSTM layer, such as categorizing long-term and short-term dependencies. The trial assessment has been performed by utilizing the three factual measures, like MAPE (ought to be low), R2 Score (ought to be high), and RMSE (ought to be low). The statistical measure-based experimental evaluation has been performed to assess the performance and suitability of the recommended model over the other well-grounded time series forecasting models. It is clear from the prediction outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic, across the various states of India (29 states) that our proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid deep learning model performed exceptionally well throughout the experiment as compared to the other wellgrounded time series forecasting models. Our proposed model achieves minimal MAPE, highest R2 Score, and minimal RMSE under several selection settings (statewise). From the experimental analysis, it is also clear that the use of extra convolutional layers with the LSTM layer may increase the performance of the forecasting model. Apart from this, the deep insides on the current status of medical resource availability across India have been discussed.",
