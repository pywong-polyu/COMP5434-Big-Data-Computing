The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions on public life have additionally caused significant psychological distress for much of the population. It is therefore plausible that breast cancer patients might be particularly susceptible to the additional psychological stress caused by the pandemic, increasing suffering. In this study we therefore aimed to assess the level of psychological distress currently experienced by a defined group of breast cancer patients in our breast cancer centre, compared to distress levels pre-COVID-19 pandemic.",

A current major focus of medical institutions is therefore on the management of those patients presenting with acute disease and infection symptoms [1] . The outbreak of COVID-19 has also caused mental health stress for a large proportion of the population [2] . People suffering from cancer might be particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as they already typically experience a loss of certainty, stress, anxiety and depression as a result of cancer diagnosis and treatment [3, 4] . Moreover, cancer patients are significantly more vulnerable to infection and poor infection outcomes, due to immunosuppression [5] . The COVID-19 pandemic has additionally negatively affected the performance of the medical system, particularly for tumour patients, as medical logistics are currently focused on treating COVID-19 patients [6, 7] . Cancer patients are also usually able to develop coping strategies because of direct contact with other cancer patients undergoing treatment, and regular contact with clinical psychiatrists, psychologists and self-help groups. However, contact with these sources of help has been inhibited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For cancer patients the COVID-19 pandemic therefore presents an extreme additional psychological stress factor that should not be ignored by health services [6, 7] .",

Moreover, depression is associated with poor treatment adherence and reduced cancer survival [7] [8] [9] . Patients with gynaecological tumours and lung cancer are particularly susceptible to depression, possibly due to pain levels, prognosis, and body image disruption associated with different tumour types [8, 10, 11] .",

The number of clinical research studies with a focus on the psychological influence of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer patients is limited [13] [14] [15] . To address this, we conducted a survey on breast cancer patients undergoing different therapy treatments during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, based in our cancer centre in W\u00fcrzburg (Germany). To evaluate the psychological impact of the pandemic on breast cancer patients we used several self-report questionnaires; our self-designed COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire, the Stress and Coping Inventory (SCI), the NCCN Distress Thermometer (DT) of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network \u00ae (NCCN \u00ae ), the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) and the EORTC QLQ-BR23 [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . During treatment, distress levels are routinely monitored for all cancer patients, in order to set up appropriate interventions if necessary. Thus, we were able to retrospectively analyze patient distress levels before the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and approximately 2 months after the government enforced isolation and lockdown sanctions in the same group of patients. This unique situation allowed us to assess the additional psychological stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in breast cancer patients.",

The first 21 items of the SCI detect the total stress level with a seven-point Likert scale from \"not burdened\" to \"very heavily burdened\". The total stress level is divided into three subscales consisting of seven items each; \"stress caused by insecurity\", \"stress caused by being overwhelmed\", and \"stress caused by loss\". Physical stress symptoms are queried in the following 13 items. A four point Likert scale is again used; \"does not apply at all\", \"applies a bit\", \"moderately applies\" and \"applies completely\". The same scale is used to record coping, each with four items. Coping is divided into \"positive coping\", \"active coping\", \"coping by support\", \"coping by believing in God or powers that be\" and \"coping by drinking alcohol and/or smoking\".

We therefore stratified patients based on their concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The minimum value of an answer on the COVID-19 pandemic scale was 1, and the maximum was 5. Questions 1-4 mainly represented concerns about risk of infection with COVID-19. The range of the sum of these four answers was 4 to 20 and allowed stratification into three groups; 27 patients (32.9%) with no concerns/ only thoughts (sum range 4-8), 30 patients (36.6%) with a little concern (sum range 9-12), and 23 patients (28.0%) with concerns often/all the time. This stratification was replicated using the SCI, revealing significant differences between these groups regarding stress caused by insecurity, being overwhelmed, loss, and stress symptoms ( Table 6 ). The current DT further supported these significant differences. Patients with no concerns/only thoughts score had a DT value of 3.00 (2.00-5.00), patients with a little concern a value of 5.50 (3.50-7.00), and patients with concerns often/all the time scored 6.00 (5.00-7.00) (p \u2264 0.0001).

Table 7 shows the results of these three stratified subgroups for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires.

These correlations were all statistically significant, with the exception of PF. Higher concerns were additionally associated with increased scores for FA, PA, DY, SL, CO, FI, BRST and BRAS.

We detected a deterioration in Global health status, Physical functioning, Role functioning, Emotional functioning, Cognitive functioning and Social functioning [34] . In contrast to the distress thermometer where distress is summarised in one numeric value, the differentiated analysis of the EORTC QLQ-C30 showed a significant effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on distress levels in comparison to the reference data. This finding is in contrast to the results published by Bargon et al. They found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a small significant increase in Quality of Life, Physical Functioning, Role functioning and Social functioning, but a significant decrease in Emotional functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to 2 years prepandemic. However, in this study the population consisted of breast cancer patients and survivors, which could potentially explain the different results [29] . As we did not measure life quality with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in our participants prepandemic, we cannot present a direct before/after comparison for this parameter. However, a previous meta-analysis clearly demonstrated that patients affected by breast cancer are particularly vulnerable to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and physical integrity when compared to unaffected controls [27] . Due to social isolation measures and the extent of concern regarding the pandemic, it is highly likely that life quality will have been negatively affected for some tumour patients.",

Patients in the subgroup demonstrating \"concern often / all the time\" had significantly higher scores for psychological stress.
