            "text": "Preclinical results on animals infected with coronavirus suggest that viral infection replication upregulates the MAPK pathway (BRAF/MEK/ERK), which in turn favors viral replication and host cell apoptosis. Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus induces the activation of the MAPK pathway, whereas the inhibition of the same pathway significantly impairs viral replication [14] . Data on porcine delta-coronavirus [15] and avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus [16] suggest that MEK/ERK signaling plays a major role in viral replication. Although these results were obtained with animal coronavirus and not with the new COVID-19 virus, hypotheses can be made of the potential important implications of the data in the frame of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. TT induces an inhibition of the MAPK pathway in metastatic melanoma cells that harbor the BRAF mutation, while also promoting a paradoxical activation of the same pathway in BRAF wild-type cells [17] . This phenomenon, which represents the molecular basis for the development of TT-related adverse events, could potentially favor viral replication in infected, metastatic melanoma patients who have been treated with an anti-BRAF inhibitor. On the other hand, data from clinical trials support the fact that treatment discontinuation leads to the development of disease progression, even in patients with sustained responses [18] . This is different from patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors; the KeyNote-006 study showed that a complete/partial response or stable disease maintaining the response was clearly achieved in 78% of patients who completed 2 years of pembrolizumab [19] and implies a different patient management strategy.",

There were also 23 patients who were in adjuvant treatment for disease-free stage III exclusively with dabrafenib/trametinib. At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, we decided to maintain treatment in all patients due to the available clinical data on the increased relapse risk in patients discontinuing TT. However, because preclinical data suggested a relationship between viral infection and upregulation of the MAPK pathway, the monitoring of the signs and symptoms in both patients and their family members was carefully undertaken to detect early potential COVID-19 infection. High body temperature as a symptom was challenging because of the difficulties in discriminating between viral-and treatment-related illness (i.e., fever represents the most frequent adverse events in patients treated with the dabrafenib/trametinib combination) [3, 4, 17] . In addition, during the observed period, seven patients started a new TT treatment: five dabrafenib/trametinib, one vemurafenib/cobimetinib and one encorafenib/binimetinib).",
