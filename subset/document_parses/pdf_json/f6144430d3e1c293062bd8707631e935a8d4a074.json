We study these questions by considering a dynamic principal-agent model that naturally extends the classical Holmstr\u00f6m-Milgrom setting to include a risk of default whose origin is independent of the inherent agency problem. We obtain an explicit characterization of the optimal wage along with the optimal action provided by the agent. The optimal contract is linear by offering both a fixed share of the output which is similar to the standard shutdown-free Holmstr\u00f6m-Milgrom model and a linear prevention mechanism that is proportional to the random lifetime of the contract. We then tweak the model to add a possibility for risk mitigation through investment and study its optimality.",

            "text": "Without seeking to oppose public health and economic growth, there is no doubt that the management of the Covid crisis had serious consequences on entire sectors of the economy. The first few months of 2020 will go down in world history as a period of time characterized by massive layoffs, forced closures of non-essential companies, disruption of cross-border transportation whilst populations were subject to lockdown and/or social distancing measures and hospitals and the medical world struggled to get a grasp on the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic. Whilst the immediate priority was saving lives, decongesting hospitals and preventing the spread of the disease, many extraordinary economic support measures were taken to help businesses and individuals stay afloat during these unprecedented times and in the hope of tempering the economic crisis that would follow. Although the world has lived through many crises over the past centuries, from several Panics in the 1800s and the Great Depression of the 1930s to the more recent Financial Crisis of 2008, never before has the global economy as a whole come to such a standstill due to an external event. Such large shutdown risks do not only materialize during pandemics but throughout many major other large events. The massive bushfires that affected Australia towards the end of 2019, temporarily halting agriculture, construction activity and tourism in some areas of the country are another recent example. As we begin to see a glimpse of hope for a way out through vaccination, the focus is turning to building the world of tomorrow with the idea that we must learn to live with such risks. This paper tries to make its contribution by focusing on a simple microeconomic issue. In a world subject to moral hazard, how can we agree to an incentive contract whose obligations could be made impossible or at least very difficult because of the occurrence of a risk of the nature of the Covid19 pandemic? Including such a shutdown risk-sharing in contracts seems crucial going forward for at least two reasons. First, it is not certain that public authority will be able to continue to take significant economic support measures to insure the partners of a contract if the frequency of such global risks were to increase. On the other hand, the private insurance market does not offer protection against the risk of a pandemic which makes pooling too difficult. It therefore seems likely that we will have to turn to an organized form of risk sharing between the contractors.",

            "text": "Economic theory has a well-developed set of tools to analyze incentive and risk-sharing problems using expected-utility theory. Most of the now abundant literature related to dynamic contracting through a Principal-Agent model has, so far, mostly been based on continuously governed (eg. Brownian motion) output-processes. This was the case of the foundational work of Holmstr\u00f6m and Milgrom [12] and many of its many extensions such as those of Schattler and Sung in [20] and [21] , and the more recent contributions of Sannikov in [19] , and Cvitanic et al [5] and [6] . However some relatively recent works have introduced jump processes into continuous time contracting. Biais et al. were the first to do so in [3] where they study optimal contracting between an insurance company and a manager whose effort can reduce the occurence of an underlying accident. In a similar vein, work by Capponi and Frei [4] also used a jump-diffusion driven outcome process in order to include the possibility for accidents to negatively affect revenue. Here, we extend the classical Holmstr\u00f6m and Milgrom [12] framework to include a shutdown risk. We do not claim that this model with CARA preferences is general enough to come up with robust economic facts, but it has the remarkable advantage of being explicitly creditworthy, which allows us to find an explicit optimal contract that disentangles the incentives from external risk-sharing and allows us to understand the sensitivity of the optimal contract to the different exogenous parameters of the model. Our work uses a jump-diffusion process too and presents some structural similarities with [4] : both models consider a risk averse principal and agent with exponential utility and reach an explicit characterization of the optimal wage. However, Capponi and Frei combine the continuous part of the diffusion and the accident jump process additively and they are able to allow prevention through intensity control of the jump process. This makes sense as many accidents are preventable through known measures. Our framework uses a different form of jump diffusion to enable the shutdown event to completely stop revenue generation in a continuous-time setting. This is done by building on a standard continuous Brownian-motion based output process. The main novelty is the multiplicative effect of the jump risk : upon the arrival of the risk, the whole of the output process comes to a halt. As an extension, we allow the halt to no longer be a complete fatality : production may continue at a degraded level through an investment by the principal. From a methodological viewpoint, our reasoning uses a now standard method in dynamic contracting based on [19] and [6] which consists in transforming both the first-best and second-best problems into classical Markovian control problems. The solution to these control problems can be characterized through a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Quite remarkably, this equation has, in our context, an explicit solution that is closely linked to a so-called Bernouilli ODE which facilitates many extensions.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to explicitly introduce a default in a dynamic Principal-agent framework, in both a first-best (also called full Risk-Sharing) and second-best (also called Moral Hazard) setting. A key feature of our study is that the shape of the optimal contract is linear. More precisely, the agent's compensation is the sum of two functions: the first is linear with respect to the output and serves to give the incentives, while the second is linear with respect to the effective duration of the contract and serves to share the default risk. While the linear incentive part of the contract is in line with the existing literature on continuous-time Principal-Agent problems without default under exponential utilities, the risk-sharing part deserves some clarification. The contract exposes both agents to a risk of exogenous interruption but it has two different regimes that are determined by an explicit relation between the risk-aversions and the agent's effort cost. Under the first regime, the agent is more sensitive to the risk of default than the principal. In this case, the principal deposits on the date 0 a positive amount onto an escrow account whose balance will then decrease over time at a constant rate. It is crucial to observe that the later the default arrives, the more the amount in the escrow account decreases to a point where it may even become negative. If the default occurs, the principal transfers the remaining balance to the agent. Under the second regime, the principal is more sensitive to the risk of default. In this case, the principal deposits a negative amount into the escrow account, which now grows at a constant rate and symmetrical reasoning applies. This linearity contrasts with the optimum obtained in [4] as the additive contribution of their jump process to revenue generation leads to a sub-linear wage. This result is coherent with the paper by Hoffman and Pfeil [11] which proves that, in line with the empirical studies by Bertrand and Mullainathan [2] , the agent must be rewarded or punished for a risk that is beyond his control. Finally, this paper also explicitly characterizes the optimal contract when a possibility for shutdown risk mitigation exists at a cost. Such a possibility is coherent with agency-free external risk: prevention is not possible, at least on a short-term or medium-term time scale. At best the principal may be able to invest to mitigate its effects. Crucially we find that in many circumstances, investing is not optimal for the principal. When it is, it is only optimal up until some cutoff time related to a balance between the cost of investment, the agent's rents and possible remaining gain.",

We assume that the contract matures at time T > 0 and both principal and agent are risk-averse with CARA preferences. The departure from the classical model is as follows: we assume the project is facing some external risk that could partially or totally interrupt the production at some random time \u03c4 . The probability distribution of \u03c4 is assumed to be independent of the Brownian motion that drives the uncertainty of the output process and also independent of the agent's actions.

It is key to observe that this second term is nonzero even if the shutdown risk does not materialize before the termination of the contract. The characterization of the optimal contracts in Theorem 4.1 sparks an immediate observation: the two parties only need to be committed to the contracting agreement up until T \u2227 \u03c4 . Therefore in this simple model, using an expected-utility related reasoning and without considering mechanisms such as employment law, the occurence of the agency-free external risk, halting production, leads to early contract terminations. This is in line with what actually happened during the Covid pandemic. Indeed in the USA and in eight weeks of the pandemic, 36.5 million people applied for unemployment insurance. In more protective economies, mass redundancies were only prevented through the instauration of furlough type schemes allowing private employees' wages to temporarily be paid by gouvernements.

The value seems to be in many cases very close to 0. As such, the agent earns, on average, a very similar wage to a \"stopped\" Holmstrom-Milgrom wage. However when the principal and the agent are particularly risk-averse, the expected value increases quite notably and the agent gains slightly more on average. This is in line with the papers by Hoffman and Pfeil [11] and Bertrand and Mullainathan [2] which show the agent must be rewarded for a risk that is beyond his control. Note that the simulations show that for fixed levels of risk-aversion the expected value increases as \u03bb increases. For example for \u03b3 P = \u03b3 A = 7, in Figure 13 the expected value is approximately worth 0.075 and in Figure 14 it is approximately equal to 0.15. As such the risk-averse agent is increasingly rewarded for the uncontrollable risk. Finally, we can make a few further comments related to the underlying expected utilities in this new contracting setting. First, the agent's expected utility is the same under both full Risk-Sharing and Moral Hazard. Indeed he walks away with his participation constraint :",

Yet the recent crisis has highlighted the ability of humans and businesses to react and adapt when faced with adversity. We now include such phenomena in the contracting setting by allowing the principal to invest upon a halt in order to continue some form of (possibly disrupted) production. This is quite a natural and realistic variant on our initial model. Indeed when faced with a period of lockdown, companies may for example invest in teleworking infrastructure so that a number of employees whose jobs are doable remotely can continue to work. Similarly, jobs that require some form of presence could continue if companies invest in protective equipment and adapt their organization. We may wonder how such a mechanism may affect optimal contracting.",

By construction, R a T = U A W \u2212 T 0 \u03ba(a s )ds and R a 0 is independent of the Agent's action s \u03b3 Aand therefore R a is a super-martingale for every a in B.

This existence result simply follows from the fact that for each s, (6.1) is now simply a Brownian BSDE that fits into the classical quadratic setting of Briand and Hu. We may then set :which is a G T \u2227\u03c4 measurable random-variable. We set :This fits right into the setting of the recent work [15] on a default BSDE for Principal Agent problems.
