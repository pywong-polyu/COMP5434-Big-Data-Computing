Unfortunately, most studies indicate that children and adolescents in Europe [2] , especially in Central Europe [3] , do not meet the recommendations for PA [4] [5] [6] [7] . Decreasing levels of PA are observed especially in adolescence [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . The habit of regular PA instilled in youth will be effective in the later stages of their life and will reduce the likelihood of diseases, especially noncommunicable diseases [13] . Therefore, Farooq et al. [14] emphasized that interventions aimed at preventing age-related declines in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) should be in place already at the beginning of adolescence.",

In total, the VPA and MVPA recommendations are met by 29.6% of Czech and Polish adolescents actively participating in OPA, but only by 14.9% of non-participating adolescents [16] . The lowest degree of achievement of PA recommendations was reported by Lagestad et al. [17] in 12-13-year-old boys who participated in <3 h per week (or not at all) of organized sport. Adolescents' participation in OPA is associated with a higher level of MVPA and VPA, as well as meeting the MVPA recommendations [18] , among girls [19] and not just boys. Similar positive conclusions were also formulated by Jago et al. [20] in children. Boys' and girls' active participation in OPA in school and community settings is associated with greater PA and reduced sedentary time. Adolescents' participation in OPA is significantly associated with greater health benefits [21, 22] , as well as school performance [23] , compared to engagement in unstructured activities. On the contrary, these activities are associated with greater health risks and risk behavior among adolescents [24] .",

Our procedure for data adjustments according to the IPAQ-LF manual was as follows: Compared with the IPAQ-LF manual, the MET-min of VPA was multiplied by six instead of the recommended multiplication by eight. The permissible average daily sum of PA and transportation was set at 600 min. The maximum MET-min per week was set at 16,000, and the maximum average daily sum of PA, transportation, sitting, and passive commuting was set at 960 min.

In particular, the recommendation for VPA, as well as the combination of at least 5 \u00d7 60 min MVPA and 3 \u00d7 20 min VPA, were significantly associated with participation in OPA in the boys and girls. This finding is consistent with the previous results in the Central European Region, as well as other countries [40] . Participation in OPA of 7-12-year-old children three or more times a week has been shown to increase the odds of meeting PA recommendations [47] . Children that participated in organized PA also have higher odds of meeting the combination of PA and sleep recommendations [48] .",

Therefore, it is essential to increase the involvement of Polish youths in OPA after the pandemic. According to the previous findings, the participation of Polish youth in OPA does not match the level of participation of young people in the Czech Republic, Sweden, or other European countries [8] . Therefore, it is necessary to verify the objective possibilities of comparing the participation of adolescents in OPA in European countries, as the methodology of Global Matrix 3.0 initiative was not wholly accepted [51] . Special emphasis should be placed on greater involvement of girls in OPA because, according to this study, they achieve a statistically significantly lower amount of vigorous and total PA than boys. This may be partly related to the lower involvement of girls in three or more lessons of OPA (30.9%) compared to boys (41.1%).",
