            "text": "Osteosarcoma is one of the most common malignant bone tumors mostly found in children and teenagers. Manual detection of osteosarcoma requires expertise and it is a labour-intensive process. If detected on time, the mortality rate can be reduced. With the advent of new technologies, automatic detection systems are used to analyse and classify medical images, which reduces the dependency on experts and leads to faster processing. In this paper, an automatic detection system: Integrated Features-Feature Selection Model for Classification (IF-FSM-C) to detect osteosarcoma from the high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs) is proposed. The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of integrated features obtained by fusion of features extracted using traditional handcrafted (HC) feature extraction techniques and deep learning models (DLMs) namely EfficientNet-B0 and Xception. To further improve the performance of the proposed system, feature selection (FS) is performed. Here, two binary variants of recently proposed Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) known as BAOA-S and BAOA-V are proposed to perform FS. The selected features are given to a classifier that classifies the WSIs into Viable tumor (VT), Non-viable tumor (NVT) and nontumor (NT). Experiments are performed to compare the performance of proposed IF-FSM-C to the classifiers which use HC or deep learning features alone as well as state-of-the-art methods for osteosarcoma detection. The best overall accuracy of 96.08% is obtained when integrated features extracted using HC techniques and Xception are used. The overall accuracy is enhanced to 99.54% after applying BAOA-S for FS. Further, the application of BAOA-S for FS reduces the number of features with the best model having only 188 features compared to 2118 features if no FS is applied.",

            "text": "Osteogenic Sarcoma or Osteosarcoma is a form of bone cancer that typically starts growth in long bones of legs and arms [39] . However, it can grow in any bone in the bone cells and in rare cases can affect the soft tissues around the bones. It mainly affects people in their teens or young adults, but may infect other age groups as well. Osteosarcoma is the most usual form of malignant tumour occurring in youth and average age of diagnosis for the disease is 15 years. Till late adolescence i.e., [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] years, the boys and girls are prone to get infected almost equally and beyond 15 years of age boys are more generally affected and susceptible to be attacked in the bone cells. The cause of osteosarcoma is unknown and it typically do not run-in families, but much like many other forms of cancers it occurs due to a fault in the gene which can cause this disease. Also, it has been linked to cases wherein there is a family history of familial retinoblastoma, a childhood cancer of the eye [34] . Children with familial retinoblastoma have a high risk for osteosarcoma in adolescence. Classic symptoms of the disease include pain in the affected bone, with initially a lower degree of pain and becoming excruciating with time. One of the other symptoms is bone fracture, as the affected bone weakens due to infection and losing its strength.",

With the advent of new technology and faster processing systems, medical field has switched to automated detection systems which have the capability to predict the possibility of cancer being benign or malignant with some certainty. These systems have a general architecture of feature extractor followed by a classifier which takes the features as input. Some of the systems may also include a pre-processing stage before the feature extractor, which is required to improve the quality of the images by cleaning the data being fed into the model. This pre-processing may have techniques such as: Noise Removal Filters, Contrast Enhancement, etc. All these techniques benefit in cases when the dataset is of poor quality and has blurred images as well. Sometimes, segmentation is also performed before feature extraction to remove the background information. Recently, a number of Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems [6, 17, 30, 31, 44, 61] have been developed by researchers to segment and diagnose osteosarcoma from medical images especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. However, these systems are bounded by the limitations of MRI and CT scan.",

The cancerous bone cells exhibit darker shades of blue and purple and differences are also observed in texture properties. This mandates the extraction of these microscopic features to improve the accuracy of osteosarcoma detection. However, the macroscopic information from MRI and CT scan do not provide sufficient differential analysis of the lesion. To overcome the limitations of MRI and CT scans, Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are being used by researchers nowadays to improve the accuracy of osteosarcoma detection. These cells are normally identified using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining of the tissue taken from the affected areas [25] . After staining, the specimens are put under a microscope for analysis by pathologists, by mounting them on glass slides. In the work presented in this paper, the dataset used has sufficiently high-quality Whole Slide Images (WSIs) [36] , which are the digital form of conventional glass slides, and doesn't require any pre-processing. Here, WSIs are classified into Viable Tumor (VT), Non-Viable Tumor (NVT) and Non-Tumor (NT) as shown in Fig. 1 .",

Some basic techniques are: edge-based [58] , clustering-based [47] , thresholding techniques [46] , watershed [14] and region-based [3] . Edge-based segmentation involves the application of an edge filter, followed by categorization of the pixels to edge and non-edge by the use of differential operators -Prewitt Operator, Sobel Operator etc. Clustering-based techniques such as K-means is a famous algorithm used for the purpose of segmentation that clusters the image into K clusters, with each cluster having similar characteristics and attributes. Thresholding such as Otsu thresholding, converts the image into discrete levels with each level indicating a different class of pixels. Watershed is another category of segmentation which makes use of topological interpretation of image, with the intensity levels of pixels treated as topology or elevation. These algorithms start by flooding the basins or areas having minima, and continue this process till each basin is full, and finally each basin is a separate region. It is quite similar to flood fill algorithms. Finally, region-based segmentation techniques can be seed-based and non-seed based. This categorization is done on the basis of the initial points taken as regions to start the process of segmentation. The next step in automatic detection systems is feature extraction which can be handcrafted (HC) or deep learning (DL) features. Feature extraction is the process of reducing the dimensionality of the input data to represent the data in a more interpretable format which can be easily analysed [20, 50] . These techniques are typically used for extraction of HC features which are specific properties of the image decided manually based on the attributes of the target space. HC features have been widely used by researchers due to their simplicity of extraction especially in those cases where the data sets are small. These features can be decided by consultation from experts in the field under consideration. HC features do not require any form of training set for their derivation and can be more easily visualized as compared to other features. At the same time, with the use of HC features, different weights can be assigned to each feature based on the role they play in carrying out the targeted task.",

DLMs have gained much importance in the last decade due to the recent developments seen in the field of computational power with the introduction of faster and compact computers, enabling the professionals to train deeper networks with ease and in lesser time. Typically, in this case Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed as the DLM for the task of feature extraction. These models have the ability to automatically learn the features from the input image, but require a large training set with high variation for sufficient quality of attribute derivation. They have the ability to obtain higher number of low-level features which can describe the image in greater detail, thus helping in further analysis. DLM provides the benefit of no significant pre-processing requirement as they have the ability to carry out the same task automatically. But the downside of such models are their high computational and data requirements. Thus, it can be seen that the features extracted from both techniques HC and DLM have their pros and cons. Therefore, to take the advantage of the strength of both the methods, IF-FSM-C model is proposed that uses integrated features obtained by fusion of HC and DL features for classification.",

However, not all features extracted from HC and DLM are important and contribute equally towards the classification process. The presence of irrelevant and redundant features may unnecessarily degrade the performance of the classifier. Hence, it creates the need for feature selection (FS) which involves further reducing the dimensionality of the solution space by taking the features which may conversely affect the decision-making ability of the model. This problem of selecting an optimal set of features can be converted into an optimization problem where the objective function is to minimize the loss on the training dataset. Formally, it can be framed as: Find an optimal subset of features from the entire set of features which can minimize the loss on the training dataset and in turn maximize the testing accuracy.",

Typically, if there are n features, then the number of possible solutions is: \u00f02 n \u00c0 1\u00de . The number of solutions increase exponentially in powers of 2. Therefore, brute force methods of FS will require a lot of time and computational power in order to reach a sufficiently optimal solution. Metaheuristic algorithms are a class of algorithms which have the ability to explore the solution space in smaller time and give nearly optimal solution in much lesser time than brute force approaches. Recently, metaheuristic algorithms have been applied by researchers in many applications and obtained optimal solutions to the real-world problems which were difficult to solve or required a lot of processing time using conventional algorithms. They have the ability to come out of locally optimal solutions due to the randomness in the algorithm. This motivates us to use metaheuristic algorithm for FS. Here, Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) [2] , a recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm, is used for the task of FS. AOA has been proved to be superior as compared to other metaheuristic algorithms in benchmark tests but it is aimed for continuous-valued problems. To tap into the strength of AOA, here a binary variant of the original AOA known as Binary Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (BAOA) is proposed, so that it can be applied in binary optimization problems like FS problem. Two transfer functions namely S-shaped [32] and V-shaped [49] are used to make the continuous form of AAO applicable on binary search space. The respective binary variants are known as BAOA-S and BAOA-V. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:",

Nasor and Obaid [44] , proposed a technique to segment osteosarcoma in MRI images using a combination of image processing techniques which include K-means clustering, Chan-Vese segmentation, iterative Gaussian filtering, and Canny edge detection. Altameem [6] detected bone cancers using X-rays by applying the intuitionistic fuzzy rank correlation-based segmentation. After segmentation, different statistical features are extracted and are processed by applying the deep neural networks layers that successfully examines each features using Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm. The limitation of MRI and CT scan in capturing cellular information hinder the performance of CAD systems in detecting osteosarcoma. Unlike MRI and CT scans, WSIs provide better cell differentiation and microscopic information such as nuclei density, shape etc. can be easily extracted from them.",

[43] propose a CNN architecture to classify the dataset images into VT, NVT and NT. Furthermore, Mishra et al. [42] improved the CNN architecture by fine-tuning and augmenting the CNN to classify osteosarcoma WSIs dataset and then compared the results with AlexNet, VGGNet and LeNet. The image size was reduced to 128 \u00d7 128 patches, by cropping the original 1024 \u00d7 1024 image due to training limitations. An overall accuracy of 92.4% is obtained which outperformed AlexNet, VGGNet and LeNet. Arunachalam et al. [9] combined machine learning and deep learning models to classify osteosarcoma WSIs. In the machine learning model, the segmentation was performed using K-means clustering followed by Otsu's multi-level thresholding to extract region of interests (ROIs) from the histological WSIs. Flood-fill algorithm is used to cluster the pixels and data analysis is performed to classify the WSIs into VT, NVT and NT. The segmented images are classified using a total of 13 machine learning models and the best accuracy was obtained on support vector machine (SVM). In deep learning, they built a custom CNN model based on AlexNet [35] and LeNet [37] . The number of samples in the dataset are increased using various data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping etc. Two sets of experiments are performed, one with patch size of 128 \u00d7 128 and other with tiles of size 1024 \u00d7 1024. Overall accuracy achieved on SVM was 89.9% whereas in deep learning models, patches yielded 93.3% and tiles yielded 91.2%. Anisuzzaman et al. [7] proposed a deep learning framework based on VGG19 and InceptionV3, trained using transfer learning. The input fed to these models were WSIs with no patches, in order to improve the classification accuracy. However, they images have to be resized to 375 \u00d7 375 due to memory limitation. The overall accuracy was 93.91% and 78.26% on VGG19 and InceptionV3 models respectively on multiclass classification.",

Thus, they are a progressive set of architectures, with increasing complexity. In simplest architecture EfficientNet-B0, the feature extraction model is made up of a convolution layer followed by 16 MobileNet [28] inverted bottleneck MBConv layers of size 3 \u00d7 3 or 5 \u00d7 5, followed by convolution, pooling and fully connected layers.

In order to remove this form of information from the images, segmentation as a pre-processing stage is applied. The output of segmentation is the segmented image with all the unwanted information removed. The various forms of background information to be removed are: muscles, ink-markings, folded or severed tissues or blurred regions. The approach used in this paper for the segmentation is similar to that proposed by Arunachalam et al. [10] . Hue normalization is applied to the image by converting the RGB image into HSV, followed by multi-level thresholding in the hue channel. This image is then converted back into the RGB form. The RGB image is subjected to K-means clustering segmentation for K=3 (pink, blue and white clusters). The pink and blue clusters are normal and are required for further feature extraction, while the white cluster is the background information and needs to be removed from the image. For the removal of the white cluster, the pixels closest to the white centre are identified and are converted to white colour. The final output of this step is a modified image which has all the background information removed from it. Segmentation is important when HC feature extraction techniques are used for feature extraction. In case of DLM, segmentation is not mandatory as DLMs have the ability to segment and identify the region of interest in the image automatically.",

[9] proposed the use of various feature extraction techniques to obtain HC features such as: Nuclei Count, along with their shape and size, textural features using Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and red-blue pixel count and percentage. In this paper, local textural features of WSIs are proposed to be extracted using rotation-invariant Local Binary Patterns (LBP) [45] . Rotation-Invariant LBP allows us to analyse the local textural properties of an image. This is considered to be significant with respect to the typical characteristics of texture in images belonging to different categories. In case of VT, research have shown a higher density of nuclei, which can be detected by a higher value of the LBP operator. On the other hand, the density of the nuclei in cases of NVT and NT are lower with former having a relatively higher density. In the segmented image, the local textures are negligible in the white regions obtained by removing bones in the original image and all LBP values for the pixels would be similar and have slight to no variation at all. Thus, the use of textural properties derived from rotation-invariant LBP allows us to distinguish the images on the core feature of density of nuclei. A total of 10 features are extracted using (8,1) neighbourhood. Global texture features are extracted using GLCM for four different orientations 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0and 135\u00b0, each giving a total of 13 features. Thus, the number of global texture features are 52. Red-blue pixel count feature is used to represent the number of red and blue pixels in the image. In case of VT, the number of red and blue pixels are very high with a significant difference in their numbers. Here, there are more darker regions and less lighter regions. In case of NT, the pixels count is low and the difference between the count of red and blue pixels is also less. On the other hand, the pixel count is moderate in NVT but the difference between the counts is significant. Unlike VT, the high difference here signifies the presence of a greater number of lighter regions and less darker regions.",

The basic principle of the DLM is to break down the image into low-level features in initial layers and then combine those features to determine complex and high-level properties of an image. The classification from these features is carried out by using a dense layer to make predictions. The ability of the DLMs to learn automatically from the training data acts as an added advantage over manual methods. This capability of these models to convert the image into a set of features can be exploited to use them as feature extractors. In addition to the HC features, the extraction of features using DLM also is proposed. For the purpose of extracting features using a DLM, the first step is to train the neural network. In this paper, EfficientNet-B0 and Xception are used as feature extractors. Each of these models are initialized with pre-trained ImageNet [19] weights. To train these deep learning models, the dataset is divided into 3 subsetstraining (60%), validation (20%) and testing (20%) set. After the model, a global max pooling layer is appended which finds the maximum value in the spatial dimension of the image at the last layer of the DLM. The output of the pooling layer is then flattened and fed into a dense layer of size same as the number of classes. The dense layer has SoftMax activation function due to multi-class classification problem.",

The images fed into the network are original WSIs without segmentation. This is because the DLM being an automatic feature extractor has the ability to itself segment and identify areas of interests. Thus, these networks can work on original images without the need for pre-processing of any form. In case of EfficientNet-B0, the output is of dimension 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 1280 which is then subjected to global max pooling, converting the output to size 1280. Thus, a total of 1280 features are obtained when EfficientNet-B0 is used as feature extractor as shown in Fig. 4 . On the other hand, the output of Xception is of dimensions 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 2048, which results in 2048 features after the application of global pooling as shown in Fig. 5 .",

There is an improvement of 5.02% and 5.93% in the overall accuracy when EfficientNet-B0 and Xception are used respectively as feature extractor as compared to HC features. Also, the specificity, sensitivity and precision are very low when HC features are used as compared to DLM features. The classifier doesn't perform well on HC features because the deep learning models, being automatic feature extractors, have the ability to identify low-level features which sometimes are skipped when HC features are used. This may lead to better performance on DLM features as compared to HC features only. When DLMs are compared, the features extracted using Xception leads to better classification of WSIs with an overall accuracy of 94.97% as compared to the accuracy of 94.06% achieved using EfficientNet-B0 features because Xception is a combination of ResNet and Inception networks, combining the strengths of both the networks, which leads to better identification of low-level features and consequently better results. On the other hand, EfficientNet majorly focuses on the efficient learning of the data and with this aim the accuracy may be compromised. Also, Xception as a feature extractor shows highest sensitivity in case of VT and NVT. However, when integrated HC and DLM features are used for classification, the classifier exhibits higher performance than when these features are used alone. It has been observed that without FS, the best performance is exhibited by integrated Xception and HC features with an overall accuracy of 96.08% which indicates that integrated features help in better classification of WSIs. The In the second set of experiments, FS is applied on the features extracted using different combinations of feature extraction techniques before giving it to RBF-SVM for classification. BAOA-S and BAOA-V are randomized algorithms, so these algorithms are run 30 times on each combination of features and report the best and average results obtained over 30 runs. The confusion matrix of RBF-SVM generated using the features obtained after applying BAOA-S for FS in the best case is shown in Fig. 8 . The corresponding performance metrics and ROC-AUC curves are shown in Table 2 ; Fig. 9 respectively. The confusion matrix of RBF-SVM generated using the features obtained after applying BAOA-V in the best case is shown in Fig. 10 .

This is attributed to the fact that FS will keep only those features which are important and have a role in the classification process. The curse of redundant features may lead to decrease in the accuracy of a model and by the application of FS, the redundant or dependent features are removed, which leads to better results. It is also evident from Tables 2 and 3 that BAOA-S results in selection of better features as compared to BAOA-V. The best overall accuracy of 99.54% and above 99% specificity, sensitivity and precision, and highest AUC (VT-0.9997, NVT-1.00, NT-0.9984) is observed when integrated features (Xception+HC) with BAOA-S FS are used by the classifier as compared to other feature combinations. The performance of Xception with BAOA-S is comparable to that of integrated features (Xception+HC) with BAOA-S in case of VT images. However, integrated features (Xception+HC) with BAOA-S outperforms Xception with BAOA-S in case of NVT and NT. The number of average features selected by BAOA-S is less as compared to BAOA-V as evident from Tables 4 and 5, which indicates usage of lower computational resources and faster processing. These models can therefore, be applied in real time systems, where the results are expected in a fraction of time.

It is clear from Table 4 that the proposed IF-FSM-C outperforms the existing state-of-theart approaches in osteosarcoma detection. Arunachalam et al. [9] used expert-guided and CellProfiler features which are not sufficient enough to classify the WSIs as they don't extract low-level details. This leads to lower accuracy (89.9%) of classification. Many researchers [7, 9, 42] used DLMs for feature extraction and classification. Unlike HC feature extraction techniques, they result in the extraction of low-level features which can describe the image in greater detail but their capability is limited by the size of the dataset. The highest accuracy achieved using deep leaning models in the existing state-of-art-techniques is 93.91% [7] . In the work presented in this paper, more complex CNN models are used as feature extractor and a maximum overall accuracy of 94.97% is achieved with Xception as feature extractor without FS on RBF-SVM as classifier. This is further increased by 4.11-99.08% when FS is performed using BAOA-S. However, the highest overall accuracy of 99.54% is attained by the proposed IF-FSM-C (Xception + HC) model which is attributed to the fact that it uses integrated features thereby masking the limitation of deep learning models. The class accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and precision are highest in the case of the NVT class, which is marginally higher than VT and NT classes. This is due to the extremities of the two classes, and the NVT class being intermediate between VT and NT class, gets better trained than them. The proposed IF-FSM-C model (Xception+ HC) also has higher specificity and sensitivity as compared to existing state of the art algorithms. In case of VT, the sensitivity is 100% which reflects the capabilities of the proposed model in detecting osteosarcoma patients correctly, without manual intervention, which is a very important feature of an automatic detection system. The main limitation of the proposed model is the requirement of colored input images as the intensity of RGB channels are used during segmentation as well as during isolation of nuclei. The proposed method cannot be applied on MRI or CT scans as they do not contain microscopic information like nuclei density, nuclei shape etc. which are important in the detection of osteosarcoma. Another limitation is the requirement of large dataset for training the deep leaning models properly.",

Here, a fusion of features extracted using HC techniques and DLMs namely EfficientNet-B0 and Xception are used for classification by RBF-SVM. A FS step is applied before giving the integrated features to the classifier in order to remove redundant and irrelevant features. Two binary variant BAOA-S and BAOA-V of recently proposed AOA are proposed and applied for FS. The results indicates that integrated features along with FS by BAOA-S results in significant improvement in the performance of the classifier as compared to when HC (89.04%) are used alone or deep learning features are used alone with or without FS. In case of classifiers using integrated features, the performance of classifier on integrated Xception and HC features (99.54%) with BAOA-S is better than that of integrated EfficientNet-B0 and HC features (96.8%) with BAOA-S. When BAOA-S and BAOA-V are compared, it is observed that BAOA-S leads to better and a smaller number of features as compared to BAOA-V. As compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, IF-FSM-C achieves 5.63% higher overall accuracy in osteosarcoma detection.",
