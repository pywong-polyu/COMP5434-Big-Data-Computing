However, individual research groups are often not in the position to teach students about the most up-to-date methodology in the field. To fill this gap, extended bioinformatics courses have been developed by various institutions and provide intense training over the course of two or more weeks. Here, we describe our experience with the organization of a course in one of the longest-running extended bioinformatics series of workshops, the Evomics Workshop on Population and Speciation Genomics that takes place biennially in the UNESCO world heritage town of\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov, Czech Republic. We list the key ingredients that make this workshop successful in our view, and describe the routine for workshop organization that we have optimized over the years. We report the results of a survey conducted among past workshop participants that quantifies measures of effective teaching and provide examples of how the workshop setting has led to the cross-fertilisation of ideas and ultimately scientific progress.",

The ever-increasing availability of sequencing data has ushered in a wealth of insights into evolution, but it has also brought tremendous challenges to the research community. The analysis of large genomic datasets is becoming increasingly unfeasible on personal computers and with a graphical user interface, and instead requires more and more often the use of computer servers and command-line tools [1, 2] . The rapid development of genomic technologies is accompanied by a variety of new methodological approaches, leading to a fast turnover of computer programs for evolutionary genomics. Keeping track with the latest methodological developments is therefore often a time-consuming task that can be beyond the capacity of individual research groups, especially those for whom genomics is not central to their research. In addition, the methods that group leaders learned during their PhD or postdoctoral years can be outdated by the time new students arrive and would like to be trained.",

In these courses, students from different research groups and countries typically come together for two or more weeks of intense learning, free from the distractions of the regular work day. The courses comprise lectures and computer activities taught by internationally-renowned faculty that often includes the scientists who developed the methodologies that are being taught. In contrast to the teaching within research groups, this compact setting allows a large number of participants to simultaneously receive first-hand advice on the use of a collection of the latest computational tools, by some of the field's most knowledgeable instructors. Conveniently, all participants in such a course can practice the use of bioinformatics tools with programs and example datasets that are usually preinstalled on a server infrastructure, thus avoiding potential difficulties with program installations on their own computers. Furthermore, by bringing together international participants and faculty, extended bioinformatics courses are an important opportunity for networking, among participants and between participants and faculty members.",

Over the past editions of the WPSG, but also building upon experience from the earlier workshop series, we identified what we consider the key ingredients of a successful workshop and established an efficient organization routine covering the year preceding the workshop.

Around the mid-2000s, it became clear that the demand for this type of training environment far exceeded the capacities available at the MBL.

There is something special that occurs when a group of people are isolated from their day-to-day business and are able to speak and work in new surroundings. The MBL at Woods Hole offered these qualities by being relatively isolated from any major city and by being a delightful venue to spend a week or two with fellow scientists. A primary task of setting up a workshop at a new location would be to adhere to the core framework, but also to identify a setting suitable of offering up the less tangible qualities that were so natural to Woods Hole.",

Both of these research communities had already been transformed by modern sequencing technologies, and since the mid-2000s had seen the rapid development of new tools and techniques to analyze immense datasets. Therefore, the Workshop on Molecular Evolution was retired from the\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov curriculum to refocus on how to handle large datasets in a population genomic and phylogenomic context. The WPSG was developed as a new initiative designed to leverage the workshop framework established in\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov for the Workshop on Genomics and apply it to the rapidly evolving field of population genomics. Soon after, the Workshop on Phylogenomics was added to the set of workshops offered by Evomics i\u0148 Cesk\u00fd Krumlov. The establishment of these three high-level scientific training workshops has since solidified\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov as a key location for obtaining up-to-date, intensive training on a variety of topics.",

Yet, most hotels and restaurants remain open year-round and the prices are modest in winter. The workshop duration is a full two weeks, thus a wide selection and availability of accommodation and boarding from low-cost options, such as youth hostels and pensions, to a more up-end type of hotels is important to allow both the students on tight budgets as well as more senior participants to select lodging according to their needs. The town has plenty of choices for dining. This is preferable over catering as it provides a diverse cuisine, variation in ambience, and flexibility in group size, , and because it reduces food waste as each participant can order according to their appetite. Restaurants, cafeterias, and bars within a few minutes' walk from the workshop venues provide access to meals and refreshments around the whole day and allow for impromptu meetings in smaller groups or \"over the lunch\" discussions between participants and faculty.",

The WPSG is dedicated to this type of teaching, based on lectures and computer activities by internationally renowned faculty members. As evidenced by the result of our survey among past workshop participants, the WPSG has proven effective, with a positive influence on the careers of those who attended it. However, the WPSG is not able to satisfy the educational needs of all students in evolutionary biology, due to its limited capacity. We would therefore welcome the initiation of additional extended bioinformatics courses, and aimed in this article to provide guidance by describing what we consider the most important ingredients of such a course. We regularly have participants who travel long distances to attend the WPSG (e.g., from Chile or Australia -only six nations have been more represented than Australia; Fig. 3 ), which implies a lack of educational opportunities closer to the home places of these participants. The spawning of new and globally distributed extended bioinformatics courses would therefore not only render bioinformatics education cheaper and more easily accessible for world-wide researchers, but would also reduce the strain on the environment caused by long-distance traveling. We hope that this article may serve to facilitate such developments.",
