This is also suggested by the fact that before the week of November 8-15, in which 61 Omicron genomes were collected worldwide, no Omicron genomes were found. The estimated date of divergence between October 28 and November 5, 2021, in conjunction with the lack of detected Omicron genomes before November 8, implies that circulation of Omicron in October or September 2021 (which could potentially explain the abrupt outbreak) is unlikely.",

            "text": "Before the Omicron outbreak, the Delta variant was the dominant strain in Gauteng, and between July and October the COVID-19 epidemic was receding without significant mobility reduction, suggesting that the population of Gauteng has reached herd immunity to the Delta variant. The population-level immunity has been apparently overcome by the Omicron variant. Omicron accumulated more than 30 mutations in its spike protein, with 15 substitutions in the receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 319-541) alone 9 . Many of these RBD mutations are thought to decrease potency of neutralizing antibodies 10 . This is in line with the recent study which demonstrated that the spread of the Omicron variant increased substantially the hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection 11 . The Omicron doubling time found here to be in range 3.18-3.61 days for the Gauteng province is larger but comparable to the doubling times during the first COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks in spring 2020 that were found in range between 1.86 and 2.88 for China, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, UK, Switzerland and New York State. Such short Omicron doubling time implies that it will likely outcompete the Delta variant, become (temporarily) the dominant strain and cause epidemic outbreaks across the world.
