Seeing the EHEA as a static area would ignore two essential facts: it continues to develop, and the implementation of policies adopted and defined through successive Ministerial communiqu\u00e9s is imperfect and remains so even a decade after the formal launch (European Commission//EACEA/Eurydice 2018). 4 As part of the development of the EHEA, its terminology has also evolved. Luckily, what was originally referred to as the \"external dimension\", making a clear distinction between \"them\" and \"us\", is now generally referred to as the \"global dimension\" or \"the EHEA in a global setting\" (Bologna Process 2007) . Nevertheless, we would argue that the Policy Forum, as a tool to promote this external dimension, has not found a form that makes it an attractive platform for cooperation between the EHEA and other regions of the world. A suggested change of name to the Global (rather than \"Bologna\") Policy Forum for the 2020 edition is unlikely to change this perception.",

There was good reason to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Bologna Declaration, as was duly done in June 2019, and appropriately at the University of Bologna. 5 There was much to celebrate; the Bologna Process has changed higher education in Europe in ways those who signed the Bologna Declaration could probably not quite have imagined (as confirmed by at least three of them 6 who were present at the celebration). As ministers responsible for higher education in all 48 EHEA countries prepare to gather in Rome a year later, in 2020, 7 the focus will nevertheless be more on the challenges ahead, on the future of the EHEA, than the achievements of the past. These challenges are also the focus of the session on \"The future of the EHEA-principles, challenges and ways forward\" at the 2020 edition of the Bologna Process Researchers' Conference, which we had the honor to coordinate. The chapters in this section of the current volume are based on papers presented in this session about \"the future\". They offer a variety of research-informed perspectives on the future of the EHEA, trying to make a contribution to this topic that goes beyond either the desolate or the enthusiastic talk about any fata morgana.",

            "text": "The Bologna Declaration and its emphasis on structural reforms to improve completion rates as well as international mobility responded to urgent issues with which most European countries were faced at the turn of the millennium. These were issues that could be addressed through fairly loosely organized cooperation in a policy area in which national authorities are jealous of their prerogatives, as shown for the EU member states, at least, through the Maastricht Treaty (Council of the European Communities/Commission of the European Communities 1992). Education is one of the areas in which the EU does not have exclusive competence and where it was considered preferable to apply the principle of subsidiary contained in the EU Treaty. 8 Two decades later, European societies have evolved, and new issues have moved to the forefront of the professional, policy and political debates in higher education. Implementation of structural reforms-a major motivation for starting the Bologna Process in the first place-remains important, both because these reforms are essential and because putting them into practice takes longer than originally foreseen. Issues around the main approach to implementation gave rise to what was probably the most heated discussions ever in the BFUG in 2015-2018. In essence, the argument was between those who favored recourse to peer learning alone to promote the EHEA objectives and those who, while accepting the importance of peer learning, wished to see it complemented by more explicit follow-up of EHEA member countries that were far from implementing specific commitments, as shown by the Bologna Implementation Reports. The discussion resulted in a \"[s]tructured peer support approach for the implementation of the three Bologna key commitments\" (Bologna Process 2018: 5) and the setting up of a Bologna Implementation Coordination Group in the 2018-2020 work program. 9 More broadly, the contentious debate on implementation reflects divergent views of the character of the EHEA itself. What does it mean that the EHEA is a voluntary cooperation? Is it voluntary to join, but once a country joined, it is required to implement its commitments, or are EHEA members free to consider commitments rather as optional guidelines and policy aspirations (Bergan 2015; Bergan and Deca 2018; Harmsen 2015; Vidjarsd\u00f3ttir 2018) ? Even if the focus on peer support in the 2018-2020 work program was considered a reasonable compromise by most of those engaged in this difficult debate, the underlying different approaches to the EHEA remain and must be expected to color, at least in part, the further debate on the \"future of Bologna\". One of the key points of discussion in the section on \"the Future of the EHEA\" at the 2020 Bologna Process Researchers' Forum was whether peer support and peer learning are by themselves sufficient measures to ensure that the fundamental values of the EHEA are respected. While we would not claim there was consensus among participants, those who spoke on this issue tended to believe that stronger instruments will be required for the future. At the risk of upsetting a compromise that was reached at great expense of energy and adrenalin in the BFUG, this discussion is likely to continue into the next decade of the EHEA, as it will be at the core of a continuing debate not only about what it means to be an Area but also what it means to be European.",

The financing of higher education is undoubtedly an important issue in all countries, and countries can learn from each other's experience (Matei 2012 ), but it is less clear that developing common guidelines or commitments in the framework of the EHEA would be the best course of action, beyond the affirmation of higher education as a public good and public responsibility (Bologna Process 2001 , 2003 and a commitment to \"securing the highest possible level of public funding for higher education and drawing on other appropriate sources\" (Bologna Process 2010: 1).",

Learning and teaching are, of course, one of the prime tasks of higher education, but the main actors are students, faculty, and institutions-not the public authorities. As far as public authorities are concerned, the main question is whether they can help at all, and then how to help develop good practice in learning and teaching in the EHEA through incentives and through reform of the education systems. A particular issue concerns the use of Artificial Intelligence and, more broadly, information technology, which is no longer labeled a \"new technology\". Many higher education institutions are of course well advanced both in research in these areas and in using the technologies in learning and teaching. We would also argue that quality education will in the future depend largely on the extent to which programs and institutions have recourse to a variety of pedagogies and modes of delivery: the question is less whether learning and teaching should be online or face to face than how programs and institutions make use of both. Again, the challenge for the EHEA in the immediate future is to define how public authorities can, through a relatively loosely organized European cooperation, best further policies and practice in an area in which students, faculty, and institutions are the main actors.",

It may be painful for a minister to recognize that his or her country lags behind in developing its qualifications framework or quality assurance arrangements, and the discussions in the BFUG on implementation and non-implementation between 2015 and 2018 underscored the point. Nevertheless, for a minister to admit that his or her country is deficient in academic freedom, institutional autonomy, or student and staff participation in higher education governance-as judged against clear European standards and common references-is infinitely more difficult, as it amounts to admitting openly that the country is less than democratic. It is perhaps a sign of health that making this admission is difficult, but it is not a sign of societal health that some governments try to make a virtue of being less than democratic, sometimes by attempting to redefine democracy by combining it with alien concepts like \"illiberal\".",

One of them is that while discussions of new priorities have often faced on which specific issues should be addressed, the EHEA now needs to develop (finally!) a convincing vision. Focusing on the ongoing discussion within the BFUG, the author considers how this group-and by extension the ministers meeting in Rome in June 2020could develop such a vision for the EHEA for the next decade. She also explores whether this vision could be furthered by reference to a European higher education community or system.",

At the same time, it faces serious challenges, not least as concerns identification with and respect for its fundamental values. In this area, the situation is even more challenging now than when the Bologna Process was launched or the EHEA formally established. A shift in focus from the structural and technical progress made to underlying political tensions and conflicts would coincide with a declining political interest in the EHEA in most member states, in spite of the fact that the 2018 Ministerial Conference in Paris had stronger political representation than the conferences immediately preceding it.",

The authors also explore the role of the EHEA as a policy forum and a community of values. The discussion about the nature of the EHEA also links to the broader debate about \"Europe\"-often meaning the EU-and cannot remain untouched by current trends toward Euroscepticism.

Drawing on the EUA's work on institutional autonomy and the University Autonomy Scorecard as well as the higher education efficiency framework developed by the EUA, the authors explore the impact of regulatory frameworks on efficiency in institutional management, how autonomy can be used to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, and how efficiency can support autonomy. They consider all issues in relation to the various dimensions of autonomy developed by the EUA Scorecard: organizational, financial, staffing and academic autonomy. They suggest the capacity of institutions to manage funds internally, select and promote their staff, and design their academic offer to match the needs as institutions identify them are key success factors.",

His paper also looks at actual and potential efforts to overcome this crisis, in its two dimensions: intellectual (academic freedom has been severely neglected in EHEA intellectual and policy debates, there is no common conceptual reference for academic freedom in the EHEA) and empiric (academic freedom is challenged, threatened or directly under attack in almost all regions of the EHEA). Designing a way out of the crisis requires a coordinated effort of charting a new course for academic freedom. A comparative analysis of who is doing this, who is charting the shape or course for academic freedom in Europe and the United States, reveals surprising differences. The most striking of all is the complete absence of higher education institutions themselves in Europe from these discussions and efforts aiming at charting a course for academic freedom.",

To meet these challenges, higher education institutionsas well as public authorities as custodians of education systems-should reassess the way generic and subject specific competences are combined and balanced. Even more, however, systems and institutions will need to broaden opportunities for life-long learning by enabling learners to design their own learning pathways based on three key components: (1) a core focused on a particular field of studies (thematic or disciplinary); (2) a fully integrated set of transferable skills; and (3) a large set of learning units of various sizes covering a flexible curriculum. They suggest developing a broad offer of micro-credits should be an important part of this effort. Sjur Bergan and Irina Geant\u0203 discuss the feasibility of setting up a permanent Bologna Secretariat, in the light of the broader challenges to the EHEA over the next decade. While this issue has been considered by the BFUG as well as by a previous Bologna Process Researchers' Conference (Bergan 2015) , this discussion has so far not moved much beyond listing potential obstacles. The authors explore challenges related to the tasks of a permanent Secretariat as well as a set of issues related to its status, location, financing, and staff. They consider relations to the authorities of both the country hosting the Secretariat and those hosting successive Ministerial Conferences. Without arguing that a permanent Secretariat is a necessary condition for the EHEA to develop further, the authors identify a set of conditions they argue must and could be fulfilled if the BFUG-and more broadly the EHEA-is to be served by a more stable Secretariat than one provided by and linked to the hosts of the forthcoming Ministerial conference.",

In the case of structural reforms, part of the rationale has in fact been articulated: reducing drop-out rates and providing both students and employers with competences and qualifications at different levels. Except for doctoral qualifications, which are at the top of the qualifications framework and therefore do not lead to further formal qualifications even if they often lead to a lifetime of learning and research, every qualification in the higher education system has two objectives: qualifying for further study, i.e. access to a study program at a higher level, and qualifying for appropriate and meaningful employment. As important as these purposes are, however, they have not been articulated in relation to a higher purpose: how education contributes to developing the kind of society in which we would want to live.",

Firstly, we need to improve our knowledge and understanding of this particular virus through research. At the time of writing, there are simply too many things we do not know about this virus to take fully effective measures, even if research seems to be progressing relatively fast, building, of course on basic research that has been developed over generations. Secondly, we need to disseminate the knowledge and understanding we do have about the virus, and also an understanding of the limits of that knowledge, among non-specialists. Higher education must play a key role here. Thirdly, public authorities must develop policies to meet the threat posed by the virus in reasonable and efficient ways, but without overreacting. Again, this cannot be done without the contribution of higher education and research. And, fourthly, we must meet the kind of populist reactions that seem to believe the disease is carried through a specific nationality or passport with arguments that are easy to understand but nevertheless based on facts that can be complex and that withstand the test of democratic debate.",
