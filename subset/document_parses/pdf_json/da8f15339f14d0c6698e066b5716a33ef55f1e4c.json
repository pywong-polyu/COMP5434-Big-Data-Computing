            "text": "Since the beginning of the outbreak, health systems in developed countries have faced many challenges in fighting COVID-19. Numerous assumptions have been made about the true magnitude and evolution of the epidemic around the world. It has been commonly assumed that officially reported data are underestimated [4, 5] , especially in Africa. The insufficient diagnostic capacity of countries and the high proportion of asymptomatic cases may explain such an underestimation [6] . Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a mass screening strategy for all countries burdened by the epidemic with the hypothesis that [7] more tests performed would result in an easier tracking of the spread of the virus and thus a decrease in transmission [8] . However, there is insufficient testing capacity in many countries due to a high global demand for antibody test kits [8] and GeneXpert which has recently been validated by the US Food and Drug Administration [9] . To date, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) remains the gold standard test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Antibodies are the best biomarkers to estimate the number of people previously infected and could help estimate the prevalence and inform testing strategies in populations at higher risk of COVID- 19. In Togo, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 5, 2020, and as of April 26, 2020, 98 cases were confirmed, including 6 deaths [10] . Only suspected cases, contacts, and travelers were screened for SARS-CoV-2. The value of population mass screening was debated considering the country's relatively limited diagnostic capabilities. Few studies so far have been conducted to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 based on rRT-PCR tests or antibody tests including studies in Iceland [11] , Santa-Clara County in the USA [12] and Switzerland [13] . To our knowledge, there are no data available on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on the low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in the general population, the Swiss National Covid-19 Science Task Force recommends focusing research at the population level on subpopulations at higher risk of infection [14] . Therefore, we conducted a pilot survey in high risk populations to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 using the rRT-PCR test to refine screening strategies in the fight against the pandemic in Togo.",

In a study conducted in Wuhan, China, of the 56 enrolled symptomatic patients, 40 (71%) showed negative nucleic acid tests and 16 (29%) were positive. Among the 40 negative patients, 34 (85%) tested positive for the presence of IgM antibodies. Among the 16 patients who tested positive with nucleic acid tests, one patient showed a negative IgM level. The IgG antibody test was positive in all 56 patients [33] . In the present study, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 increased to 1.6% when serology results were included in the analysis. Based on the validation of the test in Togo and elsewhere, the data reported on serological samples seem reliable. Since serology is rapid and inexpensive it could constitute an attractive screening alternative for countries with limited resources in the context of easing of restrictive measures.",

For this participant, IgM should have been positive. In addition, \"Participant 15\" was negative for rRT-PCR and IgG but positive for IgM. The latter should have been IgG positive. This could be explained by the intrinsic performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the serological test. In addition, possible cross-reactions with antibodies of other pathogens (plasmodium, other coronaviruses) cannot be excluded. Further studies are needed for a better description of the sensitivity or serological tests.",

First, the included population was not representative of the general Togolese population, and we actively chose this selection criterion to have a high probability of identifying cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, we cannot exclude selection bias in our sample due to the recruitment methods. We recruited more participants from the health sector. This could be explained by the diversity of the professions (physicians, pharmacists, administrators) included in this sector. Furthermore, recruitment in the informal sector was difficult due to the lack of a sampling frame and the poor organization of this sector. Future studies should better target these populations and use other recruitment methods, such as quota recruitment. The difference in sector sample size could have affected the overall prevalence which should be interpreted with caution. Based on the low prevalence, we did not study the association between the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 according to the different sectors. Finally, this study was conducted only in Lom\u00e9, the capital city of Togo, where 55% of COVID-19 cases were identified at the time of the survey.",

The low circulation of the virus in high-risk populations could be explained by the various measures taken by the Togolese government. Based on this result, generalized screening of SARS-CoV-2 would be timeconsuming, not cost effective and at a high risk of consuming reagent. Therefore, we recommend a targeted approach for screening. Targeted screening could include health professionals, airport staff; teachers could also be considered in the event of the reopening of schools. Repeated prevalence surveys are needed to refine the strategies to fight against COVID-19 in Togo.",

Controls included a control during extraction (EAV extraction control, ref. 40-0776-96, TIB MOL BIOL, Germany) to detect possible inhibition of PCR, a positive control for each gene to be detected (positive control of the E gene, ref. 40-0776-96, TIB MOL BIOL, Germany and positive control of the RdRp gene; ref. 53-0777-96, TIB MOL BIOL, Germany) to ensure optimal performance of PCR reaction and a negative control (no control model, NTC) to verify the absence of contamination of the reagents. The validity of the test was only accepted if the cycle threshold (Ct) value of the E positive gene control was <30, the positive control of RdRp gene was <30, and control of the extraction of the EAV was <33 and if the NTC did not generate an amplification curve.",
