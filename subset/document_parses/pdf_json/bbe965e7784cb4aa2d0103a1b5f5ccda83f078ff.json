Following internal standards (ISs) acenaphthylene-D10 (Ace-D10), phenanthrene-D10 (Phe-D10), and chrysene-D12 (Chr-D12) were used for the quantitative analysis. Analytical standards with >99% purity were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (PA), USA). All stock solutions for the analytical standards were prepared in iso-octane, and toluene of different concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 10 \u00b5g/mL. For all internal standards, 5 \u00b5g/mL were prepared in iso-octane. Silica BondElut (500 mg, 3 mL) cartridges, acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), n-hexane (n-Hex), and iso-octane were of analytical grade obtained from Sigma Aldrich. All glassware used in the sample preparation were baked at 400 \u2022 C overnight and kept at 100 \u2022 C until use.",

Movement was strictly controlled and without work-related official permission, one could not travel outside the residential area where one lived. At the same time, people were not comfortable with meeting others due to the pandemic situation. Therefore, it was not easy to conduct a large-scale sampling campaign for the study sample. A sampling method and a questionnaire were prepared with various information such as social-economic status, area, number, and age of people sharing the household, cooking methods, dusting habits from the participating homes for the volunteers who participated in the study. In this study, families with a minimum of three people were selected, preferably with kids, and those who participated in these numbers varied from three to eight. We contacted some people with a scientific background such as our university colleagues and research students from different residential areas of Jeddah to collect household dust samples from their homes and some of their relative households for the study. Household dust was obtained from the vacuum cleaners of the respective households. Participants were asked to collect the dust from the top of their vacuum cleaner bag to have a fresh dust sample. The dust samples were wrapped in aluminum foil and sealed in individually marked zipped bags. The samples were kept in the freezer and later transferred to the lab for analysis. Each dust sample was sieved using a 200 \u00b5m mesh and samples were stored at 20 \u2022 C until analysis.",

After spiking with ISs, a solvent mixture (hexane/acetone (4/1, v/v)) was added and kept overnight to achieve equilibrium. The next day, samples were extracted using ultrasonication (20 min) followed by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 10 min). The supernatant was collected in a clean tube; the same extraction procedure was repeated twice with the leftover sediments. The extracts were pooled and brought to incipient dryness using a gentle stream of nitrogen. After drying, samples were resolubilized again in 1 mL solvent mixture (hexane and acetone) and cleaned further using BondElut silica (500 mg, 3 mL) and 10 mL solvent mixture (hexane/dichloromethane 2:1 v/v) for quantitative analysis. After elution, the obtained fraction was concentrated to incipient dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen. It then was resolubilized in 100 \u00b5L of iso-octane for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis. A detailed description of the instrument used for the analysis is provided elsewhere [7] . Briefly, a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 system was used in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode for quantitative analysis of PAHs. A fused silica capillary column (TR5 30 M \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m) used for the separation with the injector and ion source temperature were set at 230 \u2022 C and 280 \u2022 C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1.5 mL/min. The oven temperature was raised from 100 \u2022 C to 300 \u2022 C using a ramp of 8 \u2022 C/min and held for 10 min. For quantitative analysis, m/z 152, 162, 178, 188, 202, 228, 240, 252, 276, and 278 were used. A ten-point calibration (ranged 0.001 to 10 \u00b5g/mL) was used for the quantification with a regression coefficient greater than 0.995 for all compounds.",

Standard reference material (SRM) 2585 from the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST), procedural blanks (one for every eight samples), washed Na 2 SO 4 (dust replica) spiked with a known concentration of standards were used to evaluate the procedure accuracy. The analytes' levels found in procedural blanks corrected from the concentrations of the analysts in the samples. The values of PAHs in SRM 2585 were similar (RSD < 25%) with other reported values [22] and other studies mentioned in Table S1 . Recovery of PAHs in spiked Na 2 SO 4 ranged between 70-125%. Recoveries were slightly higher than 110% for few PAHs, suggesting a poor connection between them and used internal standards since we used only three labelled internal standards for 13 PAHs. Simultaneously, matrices effects could also influence their recoveries, Na 2 SO 4 was used as a surrogate for the dust in the spiked samples.",

The levels of individual PAHs are presented in Table 2 . Phe was the major compound with a median value (ng/g) of 950, while Pyr (600), BkF (435), Chr (380), and Flu (255) were the other major compounds found in these samples. Among other PAHs, Ace was found in >50% samples with an average concentration of 80 ng/g, and this is understandable because of the volatile nature of Ace. The PAHs profile was dominated by low molecular weight (LMW, 2-4 ring) PAHs, as shown in the Figure 1A . Based on average concentration, Phe contributed 1/4th of total PAHs load in the dust samples while Ace contributed the least by 1% in the PAHs profile. Pyr (14%) and Chr (11%) were the other major contributors. Overall LMW (2-4 ring) PAHs contributed an overwhelming 68% in the PAHs load by average concentrations while high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs contributed the remaining 32%. The contribution of HMW PAHs was more evenly distributed with BkF (9%) dominated followed by BbF (8%), BaP (4%), IcdP (4%), BghiP (4%), and DahA (3%) ( Figure 1A ). This showed HMW PAHs were evenly present in the dust samples. Our present findings on PAHs profile in these dust samples were similar to those reported in literature where 3-4 aromatic ring PAHs were the major contributors in the dust [6, 7, 27] . Usually, LMW PAHs, due to their greater volatility, are reported in high concentrations in air samples. Contrarily, HMW PAHs are reported to be more toxic and persistent and mostly reported in settled dust [7] . Consequently, settled dust is an important source of both HMW and LMW PAHs via dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact [6, 7, 27] . were the other major contributors.

Consequently, settled dust is an important source of both HMW and LMW PAHs via dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact [6, 7, 27] . BaPeq as TEQ Many studies have reported the occurrence of PAHs in household dust. Average levels from the present study were lower than those found in Canada (Ottawa) [29] , USA (Texas) [30] and China [31] , but similar to those of Hong Kong [32] and Italy (Palermo) [33] ( Figure 2) . The difference in PAHs levels might be due to the difference in the automobile traffic densities, the use of coal tar in road and car parking surfaces, geographical location, ambient metrological parameters, heating sources, and regulations regarding social restrictions and indoor smoking. A number of these reasons were hinted as a proxy index for PAHs presence in the ambient environment [34] . The present study average PAH levels were higher than those reported previously from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait [6, 7] . Many of the household dust samples in the present and a previous study [9, 10] were collected from the same residential districts, indicating the impact of indoor activities during lockdown on PAHs from home dust. Even though the traffic was reduced on the roads due to lockdown, there was still heavy traffic during the flexible hours due to goods transportation and work-related traffic. During the lockdown, most households reported increased incense use and cooking activities (two or more-fold higher) that might increase PAHs indoors during the lockdown period (Table S1 ). [6, 7] .

The Flu/(Flu + Pyr) ratio ranged between 0.06-0.68 with an average value of 0.33. Younker et al. [35] suggested that a value between 0.4 and 0.5 of Flu/(Flu + Pyr) indicates emissions from gasoline and fuel oil combustion while >0.50 signals coal and wood combustion. These 3-4 ring PAHs' diagnostic ratios point out their carbon emissions from pyrogenic and petrogenic sources. Although we collected information on the questionnaire such as indoor smoking, cooking style, cross ventilation with outdoors, etc. to understand the PAHs' sources in the present study. However, no clear answers were elucidated from the collected information since most of the sampled household cooking styles were similar (2-3 times, frying, boiling, baking etc.). Also, except for a couple of households, the others did not report indoor smoking. These preliminary results are based on a small set of samples. Other factors that might have affected these ratios are not studied in the present study. It was not possible to correlate the emission sources in the present study with available information from the households. Therefore, multiple emission sources such as increased incense burning increased in cooking during the lockdown, tracked in the dust during cross-ventilation, etc. all contribute significantly to PAHs indoors. To understand these PAHs sources, large scale studies are warranted with more precise details attached to the samples.",

This equation helps understanding the potential risk posed by specific PAHs. Table 2 and Figure 1B present the values and contribution in the profile of BaPeq as TEQ for individual PAHs. Although BaP and DahA were not among the significant PAHs with a cumulative contribution of only 7% in the PAHs profile ( Figure 1A ), these two crucial PAHs contributed up to 69% BaPeq as TEQ ( Figure 1B ). Unlike the simple PAHs profile ( Figure 1A) , HMW PAHs contributed an overwhelming 95% to BaPeq as TEQ profile, signifying the importance of these chemicals in the settled dust. Different exposure parameters were calculated for various exposure routes and using the other Equations (1)-(10) as reported above in the methodology section to investigate the health risks associated with the long term and daily exposure to PAHs via dust.

A value of >1 for HI indicates a non-carcinogenic risk to the population [7, 41] . However, the HI for PAHs with known reference dose (RfD) values was <1, which suggested low non-carcinogenic risk for the exposed public from these specific PAHs. The ILRC was calculated using Equations (6)- (9) . The probabilistic ILCR assessment was highest via dust ingestion followed by inhalation and dermal route ( Table 3 ). The USEPA recommended that the safe limit for long term cancer risk is <1.00 \u00d7 10 \u22124 [7, 41] . However, for total PAHs, the estimated ILCR was above the USEPA recommendation for both adults and young children, which indicates a risk to the exposed Saudi population from PAHs via dust exposure to them from indoors in current scenarios. However, we need to caution here since ILCR is calculated for long-term exposure. These samples were collected during unprecedented times, and as previous studies [6, 7] indicated that the levels of PAHs in the present study are two-fold higher. However, these calculations are still significant as a primary source of PAHs i.e., industrial activities and road traffic were low. Therefore, large-scale temporal monitoring of these chemicals in our indoor and outdoor ambient environment is warranted to understand PAHs' health risk.",

LMW PAHs dominated the total PAHs profile while HMW PAHs overwhelmingly contributed to the BaPeq as TEQ profile. However, long term non-carcinogenic risk was minimal for both the young and adult population, although the estimated probabilistic ILCR was > 1.00E-4, highlighting the exposed population's risk through dust exposure. The EDI and ILCR calculations showed a cause of concern for the susceptible population from exposure to PAHs via household dust. Dust ingestion was the primary exposure route for both adults and young children for PAH loads. Many studies have focused on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the outdoor environment, but little focus is given on indoor pollution. Therefore, this study highlights another aspect of COVID-19 lockdown impact on people, which has not been studied yet. This study also extends the body of vital evidence that indoor pollution from another chemical might have increased during this period. Therefore, more studies on indoor pollution are needed to understand indoor chemical pollution dynamics during the lockdown periods and public health.
