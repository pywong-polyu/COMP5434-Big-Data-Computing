We focused on individual-level transmission between a primary case and their contacts, rather than considering higher degree network effects.

We also assumed that contacts made within the home are the same people daily, but contacts outside home are made independently each day. Repeated contacts would also reduce the number that need to be traced. However, our estimates are consistent with the upper bound of numbers traced in empirical studies (Table 1) , as well as analysis of UK social interactions that accounts for higher degree contacts (14) . Because our data was not stratified beyond the four contact settings we considered (home, work, school, other), we could not consider further specific settings, e.g. mass gatherings.

We also assumed that routine self-isolation would not increase household transmission. However, our conclusions about onwards transmission in the different control tracing scenarios would not be affected if some limited household transmission did occur, because in these scenarios we assumed that household quarantine would be in place too. We also simulate contact patterns at random for each individual in our population, whereas in an outbreak, there is likely to be a correlation between degree and infection risk; individuals with multiple contacts may be more likely to acquire infection as well as transmit to others (29) .
