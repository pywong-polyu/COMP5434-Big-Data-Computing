            "text": "People with mental illness (PWMI) are experiencing a double burden; both from the illness and the stigma. Stigmatization is an assignment of negative insights to an individual because of apparent differences from the population at large [5] . Different literatures have used different means to define and classify the concept of stigma. Erving Goffman interpreted Stigma as \"a means of spoiling identity\". By this, he referred to the stigmatized trait's ability to \"spoil\" recognition of the individual's adherence to social norms in other facets of self\" [6] . He also identified three main types of stigma; (i.e., stigma associated with mental illness; physical deformation; and stigma attached to identification with a particular race, ethnicity, religion, ideology, etc.) [6] . Stigma can also be represented by its empirical nature; (i.e. \"stigma is perceived, endorsed, anticipated, received, or enacted\") and reflects an action-oriented perspective (i.e., \"who gives or receives the stigma\"). From this concept, classifications of stigma can be; public stigma, structural stigma, courtesy stigma, provider based stigma, and internalized stigma [7] . This last concept of stigma (i.e. internalized stigma) is the focus of the current study.",

Also, internalized stigma is an ongoing process of psychological assimilation of the community labels towards mental illness that is said to occur when PWMI gradually lose their current positive belief and confidence in themselves and their future wishes [9] . Also, it is an unreasonable feeling, sentiment, behaviour towards one's own [10, 11] and believes they are undervalued members of society [12] . Currently, there are different explanations given for stigmatizing people with mental illness [5] . Lack of awareness about treatment, apparent fear of injury, cultural misunderstandings about the cause of mental illness, and trying to relate the mental illness with a supernatural explanation are additional contributing factors to stigma [13, 14] .",

This difference might be because of the variation in socio-cultural and environmental factors. The difference in the data collection method and the assessment tool used to investigate internalized stigma could be an additional reason for the observed discrepancy across studies. The higher prevalence of internalized stigma in this study might be because health professionals are more focused on prescription rather than providing strong psycho-education, counselling and psychotherapy sessions to combat internalized stigma among follow up patients.

Besides, integrating mental health services into primary health care can help narrow the current mental health treatment gap [34] . Also, increasing the number of mental health care workers and providing capacity building training [32, 35] and establishing anti-stigma initiatives can play a crucial role in reducing stigma among PWMI [32] . Considering the current global covid-19 pandemic, interventions that can be applied given social distancing are vital.

Study participants who report poor social support were two times more likely to experience internalized stigma compared to those who have good social support (AOR \u00bc 1.97; 95% CI \u00bc 1.189, 3.27) . Social support can benefit people with mental illness, mainly by helping them gain insight and get ideas for action to address their internalized stigma. Also, it assists them to consider new and more effective ways of confronting stigma by sharing their experiences and supporting each other to handle their stigma [37] . Providing Social support helps people with mental illness by improving their coping ability and reducing the negative effect of stress. Also, people with mental illness getting poor social support had poor prognosis and poor treatment outcomes. People with a more severe illness may have worse social relationships (and thus receive less social support) and higher levels of internalized stigma [30, 31] . The finding in the current study is consistent with a study conducted at Dilla University referral hospital, Ethiopia [23] .",

The possible explanation might be due to the fact that when the patients are jobless, they feel inferior to others and withdraw from society. Also, they feel embarrassed about having a mental disorder, which incorporates self-stigma [38] . A study evidenced that individuals with no regular employment have economic scarcity and have been presented for social exclusion, social network withdrawal, and marital dissolution [39] . Because of the shortage of financial resources, social exclusion and self-isolation from the community could lead to the feeling of loneliness and other mental health problems that might lead them to experience high internalized stigma [40] . It is also possible that the severity of the mental illness is acting as a covariate in the linkage between internalized stigma and occupational status, as people with more severe illnesses probably have a harder time finding and keeping stable jobs.",
