The ability to prepare an alcohol-free hand sanitizer (AFHS) with antimicrobial properties is crucial, especially during pandemics, when there are high demands and a low supply chain for ethanol and isopropanol. The objective of this study was to prepare AFHS gels based on natural materials that contain essential oils (EOs) that would be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens. The results showed that the organoleptic characteristics of all prepared hand sanitizer gels were considered acceptable. The pH of the formulations was slightly acidic (circa 3.9) owing to the presence of aloe vera in large proportions (90% v/v), which is known for its acidity. The spreadability for all tested formulations was in the acceptable range. The antimicrobial effectiveness test demonstrated that the prepared hand sanitizer gels had antimicrobial activities against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans yeast. The highest antibacterial effect was observed with tea tree oil hand sanitizers, which lack activity against the yeast, while clove oil hand sanitizers showed effectiveness against all microorganisms, including Candida albicans. The lavender hand sanitizer exhibited the least antimicrobial efficiency. The acceptability study on 20 human volunteers showed that the hand sanitizer gel containing 1.25% (v/v) clove oil did not produce any signs of skin irritation. This study suggested that the prepared natural hand sanitizer gel with 1.25% (v/v) clove oil can be a potential alternative to commonly used alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS).",

            "text": "New infections, bacterial or viral, have often raised significant threats to public health across the globe. One of these hazardous pathogens is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is renowned to cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19 ) that was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) at the beginning of 2020 [1] . After its discovery in Wuhan in December 2019, more than 150 million confirmed cases have occurred worldwide by April 2021. The preventive protocols to cope with COVID-19 are just supportive in order to minimize the spread of this disease as the best approach. Frequent and reliable handwashing is one of the many approaches adopted to prevent the transmission of the virus. Secondary bacterial or fungal infection can be considered as one of the most common and serious complications related to viral infections, especially in the elderly. Secondary infections could lead to the escalation of the clinical complications, increase the need for intensive care, and raise the rate of mortality [2] . A recent report on COVID-19 related co-infections showed that the mortality rate of 15.2% was observed for patients with pneumonia caused by antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) [3] . Moreover, a study by Plantef\u00e8vere et al. reported that 28% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are co-infected with bacteria [4] . The use of an effective hand sanitizer is considered as an essential alternative to handwashing, and is one of the current protocols to prevent the spread of viral infections and related secondary infections, hence decreasing the need for intensive care administration and antibiotics use.",

            "text": "Following the outbreak of COVID-19, alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) have become a common alternative to conventional handwashing in healthcare and neighborhood settings as a preventative tool, causing an increased alcohol demand [5] . Several hand sanitizers with different variations are available. It is essential to consider the types of hand sanitizers that function effectively against pathogens. ABHS recommended by the WHO are mostly composed of ethanol, isopropyl alcohols, or hydrogen peroxides in varying combinations, in which the ethanol or isopropyl alcohol concentration is mainly at a range of 60-95% [6] . This concentration range can be considered as the active bactericidal concentration range for most ABHS [7] . The demand for alcohol has increased due to the manufacturing of ABHS, which reduced the global alcohol supply chain massively. The WHO proposed two formulations for lower volume production of ABHS due to the COVID-19 pandemic demands for alcohol. The first formulation consists of 80% (v/v) ethanol, 0.125% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide, and 1.45% (v/v) glycerol, while the second formulation contains 75% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 0.125% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide, and 1.45% (v/v) glycerol [8] . This urged the need to find an alternative alcohol-free hand sanitizer (AFHS) with a comparable antimicrobial activity to overcome the risk in the alcohol supply chain.",

These ingredients are also widely available in the market, which make them easily accessible. The use of aloe vera gel as the hand sanitizer vehicle was due to its natural moisturizing and germ-retarding abilities, as well as the competence of inhibiting some bacterial strains [9] . Vitamin E and glycerin were used for their ability to slow down rancidity (i.e., oxidation or hydrolysis of fats and oils) and to moisturize the skin, respectively [10] . The primary active compounds of the AFHS gels are EOs, which have a wide range of antimicrobial activities [11] . The antimicrobial activity of EOs is reported to be due to their hydrophobic nature that facilitates the partition of active components in the lipid of the bacterial cell membrane and mitochondria, hence reducing cytoplasmic membrane integrity [12] . For instance, it was demonstrated that a mixture of clove oil and cinnamon is effective against several fungal, yeast, and bacterial species, such as Aspergillus flavus, Debaryomyces hanseni, and S. aureus [12] . The natural compounds used to prepare the AFHS are commonly used ingredients in cosmetic applications owing to the variety of their properties [13, 14] . However, an optimized concentration of these compounds should be used in the preparation of AFHS, as the increased proportion could lead to dermal sensitivity and skin irritation, according to previously reported studies [15, 16] .",

In contrast, normal flora is more likely to be settled in the skin if the pH condition is slightly acidic [23] . It should be noted that the acidic pH environment (4.0-4.5) can enhance the attachment of the normal flora to the skin [22] . Moreover, it was demonstrated that the average pH value of the skin surface's natural condition is below 5.0, which is also an optimum condition for several necessary dermal biological processes, such as the homeostasis of the stratum corneum formation of the lipid barrier [24, 25] . The acidic condition can also enhance the activity of the antimicrobial compounds against pathogenic microorganisms. For instance, the antimicrobial peptide Dermcidin found in the sweat showed higher antimicrobial activity against S. aureus at a pH of 5.5 compared to a pH of 6.5 [26] . Furthermore, it was reported from a long-term clinical trial study that the growth of Propionibacteria after washing the forehead and forearm with neutral synthetic formulation was higher than that observed when a slightly acidic formulation was applied [27] .

One of the main parameters that can affect the gel spreadability is the viscosity of the formulation, in which a lower viscous gel has higher spreadability. Table 4 shows the spreadability values of all prepared gels, which are found in the range of 558 to 638%. Maximum spreadability was observed for gels containing 1.25% (v/v) clove oil (F2), followed by 2.5% (v/v) lavender oil (F3) and 2.5% (v/v) tea tree oil (F4), whereas lower spreadability was measured for 2.5% (v/v) clove oil (F1).

This indicated that the EO could enhance the antimicrobial effect of the prepared hand sanitizers. However, in this study, the aloe vera gel was used for its natural moisturizing ability through the humectant mechanism, as reported in [32] , and to counteract the burning sensation of EOs through its wound healing ability, as reported in [13] . The variability of the antimicrobial activity of each EO should be considered, as not all EOs have similar individual compliance. For instance, the rate of acceptance of clove oil (2.5% v/v) was low due to its strong smell and skin burning sensation, as will be described in the next section (3.3) . Therefore, half of the initially used concentration (i.e., 2.5% v/v) of clove oil, equivalent to 1.25% v/v (F2), was used.

Instead, 1.25% (v/v) clove oil hand sanitizer (F2) was incorporated in the gel to prepare a superior antimicrobial product with slight or no adverse effects and higher acceptability for human skin. However, more research should be directed in future prospects to assess the efficacy against more bacterial species, yeast, and fungus. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of clove oil hand sanitizer should also be assessed to confirm its antiviral effectiveness, in order to be used as a potential and more effective alternative to ABHS during pandemics. Finally, the stability test for the hand sanitizer formulations should also be evaluated to ensure the shelf-life of this EO-based hand sanitizer. Institutional Review Board Statement: The Institute Review Board in King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (HAP-01-R-086) reviewed the research referred to below and approved the ethical aspects. The study was carried out on 20 volunteers. The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Institutional Review Board of King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (IRB#20007, 5 November 2020).",
