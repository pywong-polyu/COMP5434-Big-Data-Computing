The first case of COVID-19 in Italy was confirmed on February 21, in Pavia.

Moreover, some of us voluntarily helped other physicians to take care of adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department. Besides, starting from the first day of the outbreak in Lombardy, the outpatient services (neurology, cardiology, allergy and immunology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, nephrology, infectious disease) of our Hospital were reorganized and never closed, ensuring urgent examinations and unpostponable procedures.

Despite the loneliness and distance from families, the increased healthcare efforts, and the working practice, entirely revolutionized by the pandemic, none of us developed mood issues, and no significant differences in depressive symptoms were reported in \"COVID-dedicated\" and \"clean\" team (Table 1) .
