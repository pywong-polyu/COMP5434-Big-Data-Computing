Liquid resuscitation can increase tissue perfusion by increasing cardiac output; improving the microcirculation disturbance caused by pathogenic microorganisms, their toxins, and inflammatory mediators in the host body; and then reducing mortality [14, 15] . Therefore, early fluid resuscitation and active and effective fluid volume management are very important for the rescue and treatment of patients with sepsis. However, there is increasing evidence that positive fluid balance during treatment in patients with sepsis is associated with increased mortality. For example, in a large cohort of patients with sepsis, a high cumulative fluid balance on day 3 after admission to the ICU is independently associated with an elevated risk of death [16] . Another retrospective study showed that a positive fluid balance within 24 h is associated with an increased risk of death [17] . The SOAP study, a large multicenter study on sepsis, demonstrated that positive fluid balance is one of the strongest prognostic factors for death in patients with sepsis [18] . Our study, which included 19,557 patients in a multicenter database, revealed that positive fluid balance on days 1, 2, and 3 after sepsis diagnosis was associated with poor prognosis, and the RCSs showed an overall trend of increasing the risk of in-hospital mortality with increasing fluid balance. We grouped patients with fluid balance records for the previous three consecutive days Fig. 1 The median fluid balance volumes on days 1 to 5",

            "text": "Relationship between fluid balance on days 1 to 5 and in-hospital mortality. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (error bars) were calculated from the COX regression, and the adjustment factors are age, gender, weight, height, unit type, dialysis, ventilator, vasopressor; comorbidities: stroke, CHF, hypertension, COPD, renal failure, liver disease, diabetes, and cancer; APACHE IV and SOFA scores; infection source in accordance with daily fluid balance given that fluid administration is continuous and dynamic to further study the influence of fluid balance on patient mortality in the hospital. Compared with those in the \"+/+/+\" group, patients in the \"+/ \u2212/\u2212\", \"\u2212/ \u2212/\u2212\", \"\u2212/ \u2212/+\", \"\u2212/+/+\", and \"\u2212/+/\u2212\" groups were less likely to die in the hospital. The possible mechanism is that the vascular endothelial permeability of patients with sepsis is increased, and the overloaded fluid extravasates to cause tissue and organ edema, which is not conducive to the recovery of organ function and ultimately affects prognosis [19] . Hypervolume may exacerbate capillary leakage in patients with septic shock, leading to pulmonary edema [20] . Positive fluid balance is closely related to the occurrence of acute kidney injury in patients with sepsis [21] . Our secondary outcomes showed that the ventilator use time of the PB group from days 2 to 5 but not on day 1 was longer than that of the NB group. Compared with the \"+/+/+\" group, the \"+/+/\u2212\", \"+/ \u2212/\u2212\", \"\u2212/ \u2212/\u2212\", \"\u2212/ \u2212/+\", and \"\u2212/+/\u2212\" groups had fewer actual ventilator days for the first three days. This result suggested that positive fluid balance may affect lung function. Thus, although patients with sepsis need prompt fluid resuscitation, adequate perfusion, rather than aggressive, prolonged, and uncontrolled fluid infusion, should be provided on the basis of hemodynamic responsiveness. Even in patients who respond to fluid shock therapy and have a considerable increase in cardiac output, subsequent fluid infusion does not appear to improve microcirculation. Moreover, rapid fluid supplementation in patients with sepsis has only transient hemodynamic effects partly due to sepsis-induced vascular dysfunction and paralysis, which should be corrected by the use of vasoactive drugs rather than repeated rapid fluid supplementation [22] . Patients receive excess fluid, resulting in fluid overload. In the middle and late stages of sepsis, the pathogenesis and course of sepsis in patients are complex, and fluid management may be affected by numerous factors, such as the patients' basic physical conditions and complications, fluid types, and the target endpoint of fluid resuscitation. At the same time, a clear demarcation between the stages of shock does not exist. Therefore, in clinical practice, grasping the two aspects of adequate fluid resuscitation in the early stage and restricted fluid management in the late stage of fluid therapy remains difficult [23] . Fluid therapy is an important measure for improving the perfusion of tissues and organs, maintaining the circulation state of the body, and correcting the metabolic disorders of the body and remains an indispensable part of the treatment of patients with sepsis. Although early and adequate fluid resuscitation is still recommended especially for patients with septic shock who may require additional fluid to maintain circulation stability, it is not the same as simple massive fluid replacement.",
