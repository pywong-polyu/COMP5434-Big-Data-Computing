The results showed that perceived social support was significantly and positively associated with life satisfaction and positive affect and was significantly and negatively related to negative affect among college students learning online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological capital (PsyCap) significantly mediated the relationships between perceived social support and three subjective well-being variables. The present study provides some implications to protect college students' subjective well-being in the context of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "At the beginning of the year 2020, the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread quickly across China (The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team 2020). To curb the spread of coronavirus disease and reduce cross-infection, the central government in China decided to postpone the opening of universities, colleges, and schools (The State Council Information Office of the P. R. China, 2020). The Ministry of Education then launched the ''School's Out, But Class' On'' campaign requiring administrators and teachers from primary to tertiary education to shift to online teaching plan . As a result, universities and colleges across China in a short period of time embarked on online education with faculty members delivering lessons in front of computer screens and students taking online courses via the internet (Bao 2020) . Although the online learning modality holds promise for maintaining the course delivery and minimizing the disruption of learning routines, it poses additional challenges to college students struggling to survive pandemic-induced uncertainties and fears and adapt to the new way of learning (Dhawan 2020; Hung et al., 2020) . For instance, Grubic et al. (2020) pointed out that the unexpected exposure to unfamiliar online instruction would cause more stress for college students who have already suffered heightened levels of mental health problems and undermined subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Beyond mental health difficulties, research also found that the sudden implementation of online learning had serious consequences on the subjective well-being of college students (Hung et al. 2020; Lyons et al. 2020) . In the wake of growing concerns regarding college students' mental wellbeing during the ''fully online learning'' period, it has become imperative for researchers and practitioners to take actions in ways of helping college students survive the unconventional learning experiences and maintain subjective well-being (American Campus Communities 2020; Chen et al. 2020; Hasan & Bao 2020) . Although emerging research into the subjective well-being of people living through the COVID-19 pandemic has suggested that social support and psychological capital (PsyCap) can be potentially useful resources for humans to cope with stress and maintain mental well-being (Aluh & Onu 2020; Saltzman et al. 2020) , little research has been done to examine the role of such social and personal resources in supporting college students' subjective well-being. To address this noticeable research gap, we in this study examined the relationship between perceived social support and subjective well-being among college students learning online during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular interest in the mediating role of PsyCap regarding this relationship.",

            "text": "Subjective Well-Being among College Students Learning Online during the COVID-19 Pandemic Subjective well-being, defined as ''a person's cognitive and affective evaluations of his or her life'' (Diener et al. 2002, p. 63) , is an indispensable contributing component to mental health beyond the absence of mental illness and disorders (de Cates et al. 2015) . It is generally accepted that subjective well-being comprises two conceptually distinct but related types of components, namely, the cognitive component denoting evaluations of one's overall life satisfaction and the affective type of components indicating positive and negative emotional responses to life (Busseri & Sadava 2011; Diener 1994; Kieny et al. 2020 ). Based on this conceptualization, subjective well-being is measured and assessed as a tripartite construct indexed by (high levels of) life satisfaction and positive affect as well as (low levels of) negative affect (Busseri & Sadava 2011; Diener 1984) . The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social distancing have caused disruption to daily routines and chipped away at subjective well-being (Ettman et al. 2020) , highlighting an urgent need for researchers and professionals to develop individualized interventions and protect the mental well-being of target populations (Grubic et al. 2020) . College students are such a specific group of population whose mental well-being deserves sophisticated attention (Cao et al. 2020; Lyons et al. 2020) , especially when the sudden transition to online learning has caused more stress undermining life satisfaction and positive emotions and intensifying negative mood states (American Campus Communities 2020; Hung et al. 2020) .",

It has been widely reported that, in the context of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, college students usually find themselves affected by disrupted learning routines, exposed to unfamiliar and disorientating online instructional methods, confronted with technological obstacles to online learning, and frustrated by deprived inperson interactions (Chen 2020; Cowley 2020; Gasevic 2020; Wong 2020) . The pandemic-induced uncertainties and fears together with the stressful online learning experiences have exacerbated college students' psychosocial maladjustment, which may further undermine their subjective well-being (Griffiths et al., 2005; Grubic et al. 2020; Zhang & Zheng, 2017) . To combat the adverse effects of online learning implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic, more research is needed to explore how college students can be supported to maintain subjective wellbeing.",

This is especially true for college students who are at a critical stage of exploring and adjusting to the emerging adulthood life and developing personal identity (Arnett 2000) . This line of social support research is predicated on the premise that an understanding of available social support from family, friends, and significant others and its psychosocial benefits could inform effective approaches to mental wellbeing among college students (Hefner & Eisenberg 2009 ). Social support can be measured as perceived available assistance or actual received ones, and the former can have greater influence on mental well-being than the later (Fan & Lu 2019) . Evidence has shown that perceived social support is strongly associated with high college life satisfaction, decreased academic stress and emotional exhaustion, and increased positive feelings (Wang et al. 2018) . In contrast, college students lacking social assistance are found incapable of coping with life challenges and academic stress and demonstrating low levels of subjective well-being (Wang, et al. 2014) .",

Under such stressful situations, college students may highly rely on the supportive resources and information embedded within their social connections with significant others to relieve stress and anxiety, overcome online learning obstacles, and maintain psychosocial functioning (Saltzman et al. 2020) . Although scant research, to our best knowledge, has explored the relationship between perceived social support and subjective well-being among college students learning online during the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging research on the overall population has revealed the particularly important role of supportive social connections with significant others in keeping mental well-being during the period of great threat (Aluh & Onu 2020) . It has been reported that, under the circumstances of school closure and physical distancing, college students have adapted themselves by turning to technology, so as to stay connected with family, friends, and teachers as sources of social support when in need (American Campus Communities 2020). In this study, social support conceptualized as a second-order construct representing college students' perceptions of overall sources of social assistance is hypothesized to be positively related to subjective wellbeing in the context of online learning.",

            "text": "According to Luthans et al. (2015) , PsyCap refers to an individual's positive psychological development state characterized by four positive psychological resources: efficacy, hope, resilience, and optimism. Efficacy refers to the confidence or beliefs in one's capability to organize or execute certain courses of actions required to produce desired outcomes (Luthans & Youssef-Morgan 2017) . Hope refers to the agentic determination and contingency planning to generate solutions to problems. Resilience refers to the capacity to sustain or bounce back in face of adversity to retain progress. Optimism refers to the positive outlook or expectancy toward events. The positive nature of the constituent resources renders PsyCap as a high-order core construct directly related to positive affective states. As indicated by Youssef-Morgan and Luthans (2015), PsyCap can trigger positive mental well-being through such mechanisms as generating positive cognitive and affective appraisals, facilitating retentions of positive memories, exerting broadening effect when faced with setbacks, and reducing negativity bias. Of note is that PsyCap can be nurtured and enhanced through social mechanisms including social support, constructive relationships, and close contact (Youssef-Morgan & Luthans 2015).",

Especially in times of adversity, people who have access to social support would be able to take advantage of their high PsyCap to cope with stress and adjust into the turbulent environment (Rabenu et al. 2016) . For college students learning online during the COVID-19 pandemic, those who were socially supported may be equipped with high PsyCap, thus enabling their coping with stress and anxiety regarding the uncertainties and fears of the pandemic as well as demanding online learning requirements and tasks (Hefner & Eisenberg 2009; Luthans et al. 2007 ). Although no study to date has explored the ways in which social support and PsyCap as a composite coping resource or asset coalesce to support the subjective well-being of college students learning online during the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be hypothesized that college students with more access to social support would have enhanced PsyCap for them to overcome the online learning shock and maintain subjective well-being.",

China, the first country that implemented social distancing and massive school closure to contain the virus, has seen a large-scale adoption of the online teaching initiative called ''School's Out, But Class' On'' in nearly all of the universities and colleges . While online teaching can be a promising alternative to classroom instruction in times of crisis, it also poses numerous challenges and adds more layers of stress to the life of college students in China (Wong 2020; Ye et al. 2020 ). In fact, several studies (e.g., Ao et al. 2020 , Chang et al. 2020 ) on college students in China mentioned that the pandemic-induced uncertainties and fears together with the online learning shock exacerbated psychosocial maladjustment and undermined subjective well-being. Emerging research also found that supportive relationships with significant others (i.e., family, friends, and teachers) could be tapped for college students to enhance internalized psychosocial capabilities to combat problematic functioning and stay mental well-being and focused on learning .",

As for the measurement of positive and negative affect, college students were asked to indicate the extent to which they had experienced eight positive (e.g., 'interested', 'excited', and 'enthusiastic') and seven negative (e.g., 'upset', 'distressed', and 'scared') mood states during the fully online learning period through rating on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (always). Regarding the measurement of overall life satisfaction, college students were asked to report their satisfaction with life as a whole during those days of online learning through rating on a 0-10, single-item scale, with 0 indicating the lowest life satisfaction and 10 the highest. Confirmative factor analysis (CFA) results indicated that the adapted PANAS had good construct validity (v 2 = 345.412, df = 89, RMSEA = 0.075, TLI = 0.923, CFI = 0.935). The calculated Cronbach's a for the Positive Affect subscale (0.907) and the Negative Affect subscale (0.878) showed good reliability, respectively.

College students were asked to rate themselves in terms of their navigating the fully online learning on a six-item Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree).

This is in line with findings in previous studies denoting that perceived social support fosters PsyCap, which in turn fuels positive cognitive appraisals and emotional states (Rabenu et al. 2016; . This indicates the importance of PsyCap in internalizing the external social resources and maintaining positive psychosocial functioning (Karademas 2006; Ozbay et al. 2007 ). On the one hand, when faced with overwhelming online learning challenges during the COVID-19 outbreak, college students with sufficient assistance from family, friends, and teachers tend to hold positive attitudes toward difficulties (optimism), stick to their learning plan and overcome obstacles (hope), build confidence in performing tasks (efficacy), and sustain their efforts to retain progress in face of setbacks (resilience). On the other hand, college students who are equipped with high PsyCap would be able to act flexibly and adaptively to meet the online learning demands and maintain subjective well-being (Hefner & Eisenberg 2009; Rabenu et al. 2016) . The research findings contribute to the mechanisms through which perceived social support from significant others contributes to college students' subjective well-being in the context of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic (Grubic et al. 2020) . That is, effective external support embedded within college students' social networks may be characterized by its sufficient capabilities to stimulate a set of positive personal resources (i.e., efficacy, hope, resilience, and optimism), which enables college students to successfully cope with the stressful online learning experiences during the period of crisis (Saltzman et al. 2020) .",

This may be due to two reasons. One is that both constructs of perceived social support and PsyCap are positive in nature, thus being more likely to trigger positive states and generate positive appraisals toward life quality . The other is that college students as an already-stressed population group have suffered heightened levels of negative mood states during the COVID-19 pandemic (Grubic et al. 2020) . This may limit the roles of social support and PsyCap as positive coping strategies in buffering against negative affect.",

First, the study suggests that having access to various sources of social support, including teachers, parents, and friends can be beneficial for college students to counteract the pandemic-induced uncertainties and fears, overcome the online learning shock, and maintain subjective wellbeing (Rabenu et al. 2016 ). On college students' side, although the campus closure and physical distancing has significantly reduced face-to-face interactions and communications, college students can still benefit from utilizing the technology (e.g., phone calls and messages, social media and chat apps, and virtual meeting) to stay socially connected. For instance, they may take advantage of video chat apps to share feelings and emotions with teachers, family members, and friends and proactively seek out for help when in need during the period of online learning (WHO, 2020).",

Unlike traditional classes that provide sufficient opportunities of face-to-face interactions and in-time feedback and praise, online classes face challenges in promoting effective teacher-students interactions and communications (Gasevic 2020; Wong 2020) . This necessitates teachers' proactive learning support that helps close student-teacher psychological distance and promote engaging and meaningful online learning experiences (Turley & Graham 2019) . For instance, instead of delivering courses through a direct approach in front of the computer screen, teachers may take advantage of scaffolding feedback (e.g., successive hints and partial solutions) and positive praise to boost self-regulated learning skills, stimulate student interest in contents, and facilitate understanding (Guo et al. 2019) . Apart from adoption of synchronous teaching model through video conferencing or live lectures, teachers may also utilize asynchronous forms of teaching (e.g., discussion forums and email) to promote online interactions and communications, improve online tutorial and coaching quality, and help students regain positive feelings toward performing online tasks (Turley & Graham 2019) .",

Empirical evidence has shown that parenting practices exert significant influences on parent-child relationships, which contribute to the immediate home environment shaping students' subjective well-being (Hwang & Jung 2021) . Research also suggests that while appropriate parental involvement is beneficial for children to keep academically engaged and stay mentally healthy, intensively intervening in the lives of children as helicopter parents would inversely undermine college students' autonomy and willingness to exercise control over psychosocial functioning (Kouros et al., 2017) . Hence, parenting practices that entail autonomy support are essential. It is therefore suggested that parents with children learning at home during the pandemic build a supportive relationship with children through showing respect for their decision, providing appropriate autonomy support, and encouraging them to develop problem-solving skills, to help college students maintain positively engaged with their lives (Chen et al. 2018) . For those with children already suffering heightened levels of stress, parents may keep an eye out for signs of mental problems and seek for external mental health services and professional support when in need. Parents may also engage college students in offline physical activities on a regular basis to help them relieve stress, anxiety, and negative mood state and regain positive feelings (UNICEF 2020).",

In practice, university should monitor college students' PsyCap levels with online instruments and deliver tailored resources and services for students learning online during the pandemic, especially for those who have suffered psychological deficiency (Grubic et al. 2020) . Since PsyCap and its components are open to development (Luthans & Youssef-Morgan 2017) , it is feasible for universities and colleges to implement psychological interventions and integrate training tasks or activities designed to develop psychological resources of efficacy, hope, resilience, and optimism into online lectures or counseling services, to help students foster PsyCap, curb negative mood and stress, and keep mental well-being (Baticulon et al. 2021; Luthans & Youssef-Morgan 2017) . The well-established PsyCap Intervention model (PCI) has suggested a range of development strategies (Luthans et al. 2006) , such as task-related role-play for hope-building, opportunity-seeking activities for optimism training, group interactions and communications for efficacy training, and reflective exercises for resilience improvement (Salanova & Ortega-Maldonado 2019) . In addition to the universal interventions, university mental health professionals may adopt selective online micro-interventions to at-risk groups or students identified through the online instruments to help them enhance PsyCap in areas of deficiency and retain subjective well-being (Allen-Meares et al. 2013).",

Future studies may employ longitudinal research design to conclude causality. Finally, although efficacy, hope, resilience, and optimism were all captured as constituents of the high-order PsyCap construct, they also demonstrated differences in their roles and functions (Luthans et al. 2017 ).
