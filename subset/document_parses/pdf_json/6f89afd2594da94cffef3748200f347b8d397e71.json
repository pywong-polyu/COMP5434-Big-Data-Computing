To increase our understanding of hvKP at the genome level, genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis were performed on 6 hvKPs. The whole genome DNA from 6 hvKPs with different capsular serotypes isolated in China was extracted. The genome sequencing and assembly results showed the genome size of the six hvKPs and GC content. Comparative analyses of the genomes revealed the gene homology and genome rearrangement in the 6 hvKPs compared with Klebsiella pneumonia NTUH-K2044. The phylogenetic tree based on full-genome SNPs of the 7 hvKPs showed that NTUH-K2044 formed a single clade, showing distant evolutionary distances with the other six strains, and the non-K1 hvKP strains had a relatively closer phylogenetic relationship. BLAST comparison analysis found that some selected virulence genes had different degrees of deletion in the non-K1 hvKPs. SNP-based virulence gene mutation analysis showed that some virulence genes had different degrees of SNP mutations. The whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis of six hvKP strains with NTUH-K2044 provide us with a basic understanding of the genome composition, genetic polymorphism, evolution and virulence genes of hvKP and a basis for further research on these genes and the pathogenesis of hvKP.",

These strains belong to different capsular serotypes and were isolated from different specimens, mainly from patients in hospitals located in three geographical regions of China. The hypermucoviscosity (HV) phenotype was semi-quantitatively defined by a positive \"string test\". The string test is positive when a bacteriology inoculation loop or needle is able to generate a viscous string > 5 mm in length by stretching bacterial colonies on an agar plate (Shon et al. 2013) . Strains were grown at 37 \u00b0C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium for at least 24 h. Genomic DNA of each strain was isolated using a traditional DNA extraction method (Xiao et al. 2011) . Briefly, the bacteria culture was collected and washed using SE solution (0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M EDTA, pH8.0). Then, SDS dry powder (final concentration 2%) was added to the tube with 65 \u00b0C water bath to lyse bacteria. Protein was removed from lysate solution with Tris-saturated phenol and chloroform. The nucleic acids were subjected to RNA digestion with 100ug/ml RNase. DNA was precipitated using absolute ethanol. Finally, the DNA was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH8.0). The quality and quantity of genomic DNA were evaluated by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis.",

The paired-end fragment libraries were sequenced according to the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system protocol. Raw reads of low quality from paired-end sequencing (those with consecutive bases covered by fewer than five reads) were discarded. After filtering, the sequenced reads were assembled using SOAPdenovo software (Version 2.04) (Li et al. 2008) . Gene prediction from the assembled results was performed using Glimmer software (Version: 3.02) (Delcher et al. 2007) with Hidden Markov models. The N50 statistic was calculated by sorting the contigs in decreasing order and taking the contig length for which all contigs of that length or longer contained at least 50% of the summed length of all contigs.

The detailed information of the BLAST result is shown in Table S5 , and the detailed information of the virulence gene SNP analysis is shown in Table S6 . In this study, the virulence gene BLAST analysis with the full-genome sequence of the six strains revealed that K406, the K1 strain, carried all the selected virulence genes; however, some virulence genes, which are mainly related to iron uptake and allantoin metabolism, had different degrees of deletion in the other five different capsular serotypes strains. In addition, we found some non-synonymous mutations in the virulence genes in the SNP analysis results. For example, compared with the reference strain, the five non-K1 strains K038(K2), K090(K20), K095(K57), K323(K5), K396(K54) showed a single nucleotide non-synonymous substitution in mrkD, a gene encoding the type 3 fimbriae adhesion protein related to biofilm formation (Jagnow and Clegg 2003) . This nucleotide substitution resulted in an amino acid change from glutamic acid in strain NTUH-K2044 to glutamine in strains K090, K095, and K396 and from threonine in strain NTUH-K2044 to serine in strain K323.",

More studies on K1 and K2 serotypes are needed since they are common clinical serotypes among the hvKPrelated capsular serotypes (K1, K2, K5, K16, K20, K54, K57 and KN1) . To understand the characteristics of hvKP at the whole-genome level more comprehensively, the 6 hvKPs belonging to the K1, K2, K5, K20, K54, and K57 serotypes were screened from 310 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates, which were isolated and identified from Chongqing, Shenzhen and Beijing. The genomes of the 6 hvKP Fig. 1 Global alignment of 7 hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae genomes. The same colour modules connected by the lines represent the collinear portions between the genomes, and there was no genome rearrangement inside. Areas outside the same colour region indicate that no homology was detected between the input genomes. The completely white area inside the fragment indicates that there was no alignment between the genomes, which may contain specific components or mutations strains were sequenced and used in a comparative genome analysis. The NTUH-K2044 genome was selected as a reference sequence for comparative genomics because NTUH-K2044 is a clinical isolate of type K1 hvKP, and the genome sequencing of NTUH-K2044 was completed. However, the phylogenetic analysis shows that the 6 hvKPs and NTUH-K2044 are in two phylogenetic branches. This may be due to the different areas of separation. NTUH-K2044 was isolated in Taiwan, and the 6 hvKPs in this experiment were isolated from mainland Chinese. Due to the lack of communication between these two areas for many years, the hvKP of Taiwan and the mainland evolved in different directions. Of course, the number of hvKP strains used to construct the phylogenetic tree in this study was small, and follow-up work can analyse the phylogenetic relationship with additional hvKP genome sequence based on hvKP genome sequences in NCBI. Furthermore, the isolation background of the strains can be combined to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of hvKP.",

SNPs in porA were found to be responsible for the hypervirulence in Campylobacter jejuni by using a \"directed genome evolution\" strategy, which was developed to identify SNPs (Wu et al. 2016 ). Astrid's work found that a SNP upstream of the orf2 promoter could change orf2 expression and then affect the virulence of Streptococcus suis (de Greeff et al. 2014 ). Bailey's study also suggested that SNPs identified in four regulatory genes were associated with enhancing virulence in Vibrio cholerae clinical isolates (Carignan et al. 2016) . In this study, through the comparison of sequence loci, we identified meaningful mutation sites and then performed a functional verification of mutant loci at the cell and animal level, which can help analyse the pathogenicity of bacteria. To assess the genetic diversity of the 6 isolates, the genome sequences were subjected to a variation analysis with NTUH-K2044. SNP/InDel analysis revealed a large number of variations between the six strains and NTUH-K2044; this may be because these strains were isolated from different geographical origins, and there was a lower homology between the bacteria and the reference. SNP and InDel analysis showed that the K1 strain K406 had fewer SNPs and InDels compared with the other five non-K1 strain, possibly because it has the same capsular serotypes as NTUH-K2044.",

The kfu gene encoding iron transport system was only detected in K406 and K323, suggesting the difference of iron uptake capacity in 6 hvKP strains. The rmpA gene is responsible for the hypermucoviscous phenotype, and we found rmpA present in five strains (K038, K090, K095, K323, K406), but not in K54 strain (K396). Although rmpA is present in the vast majority of isolates with a hypermucoviscosity (HV) phenotype, a small proportion of HV isolates do not possess this gene (Lee et al. 2010 ). The hypermucoviscous phenotype was due to the overproduction of capsular polysaccharides and may be regulated by many factors (Hsu et al. 2011) .",
