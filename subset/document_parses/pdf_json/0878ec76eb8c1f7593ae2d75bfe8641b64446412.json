In fact, reports of plans to obtain the vaccine range from 53% to 80%, 6 which suggests that a significant portion of HCWs will remain at risk for COVID-19 despite available vaccines. Therefore, predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among unvaccinated HCWs with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important as clinicians and public health officials develop strategies to contain COVID-19 while maintaining a sufficient healthcare work force.",

Participants completed a self-report survey at baseline that assessed demographic characteristics, occupational group, participation in specific occupational tasks, symptoms, and community exposure to COVID-19. After the baseline survey, participants were sent monthly surveys to ascertain new diagnoses, symptoms, or COVID-19 test results. Participant outcomes were also followed in the electronic health record (EHR), which allowed for identification of diagnoses and PCR results for COVID-19 and COVID-19-related outcomes. PCR test frequency was determined by EHR review and survey response including reasons for each test (as reported by the participant). Possible reinfection cases in participants who were seropositive at baseline were adjudicated by EHR review (J.T.W., L.H., and B.T.).",

Concordance across the two analyzers was verified following the College of American Pathologist (CAP) guidelines and by the study team using 20 positive and 20 banked negative serum samples from baseline with 100% concordance. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG ARCHITECT and Alinity assays are semiquantitative, chemiluminescent, microparticle immunoassays that identify whether human serum or plasma have IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen. Samples tested were determined to be seropositive or seronegative based on these assays. Performance characteristics for this assay are reported to be 100% positive agreement at \u226514 days after symptom onset in those with confirmed COVID-19 and 99.6% negative agreement in those without COVID-19. 7 The risks for incident COVID-19 by IgG as determined using this assay were roughly equivalent when compared to a noncommercially available anti-spike assay in a cohort from Oxford, England. 1",

Loss of detectable antibody was common during the 6 months follow-up but was not associated with significantly higher rates of possible reinfection than those who were persistently seropositive. Similar to other reports of reinfection in HCWs, all cases of possible reinfection that we observed in seropositive HCWs were not severe. 1 Rates of COVID-19 infection in HCWs are strongly driven by community exposure to SARS-CoV-2. 4 Unsurprisingly, we observed an increased rate of incident COVID-19 within the cohort during months in which COVID-19 rates were surging in the Chicago metropolitan area. 12 The rates for detected PCR positivity across antibody groups in seropositive and seronegative participants in our study were higher than those reported for HCWs in the United Kingdom. 1, 13 However, the case-rate ratios (indicating the relative effect of antibody positive status) do not appear to be significantly different between our study and those reported in the UK study, but the power to detect differences in case-rate ratios between studies is limited due to the low overall event rate for possible reinfection reported in both studies (2 in the United Kingdom and 8 in our study). 1 Differences observed in absolute PCR-positive rates between our study and others may be due to differences in the background rate of HCW exposure occurring in the community and while delivering care (due to local COVID-19 case rates, population density, and behavioral characteristics) and the uptake of PCR testing. Our study represents, to our knowledge, the only report of infection rates, relative rates, and outcomes by serologic status of HCWs in the United States. The only other population-level estimates of reinfection risk in the United States come from an analysis of pooled data from central laboratory testing centers and claims data which reported very low occurrence of PCR positivity >90 days after a preceding positive PCR test (rates of positive tests to negative after 90 days = 0.1). 14 However, unlike our study, the methodology employed in this study did not provide infection rates, nor as the authors point out, was it appropriate to infer relative risks from that analysis. Our study highlights data from a large midwestern metropolitan area, which was underrepresented in the previous study. 14 Our analysis also included data through the second surge of COVID-19 (September through late December 2020) and information on clinical outcomes associated with reinfection. 14 The only significant predictor of seroreversion was the semiquantitative antibody titer at baseline, suggesting that the baseline titer predicts the rate at which IgG levels are attenuated. However, we observed similar risks for infection in the seroreversion group as was seen in the persistently seropositive group. Further study of this relationship between antibody level and resistance to infection is needed as maintaining immunity in HCWs, ensuring high vaccination rates, and maintaining effective infection prevention activities in the workplace will be important for potential surges due to variants of SARS-CoV-2 and preservation of the healthcare workforce.",

            "text": "This study included the largest closed cohort of HCWs in the midwestern United States with >6 months of follow-up, allowing for estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence as well as the ability to assess the demographic, occupational, environmental, and behavioral factors associated with rates of infection. However, this study had some important limitations. First, PCR testing was not performed systematically on cohort participants. All PCR results included in this study are from passive surveillance of the electronic health record, which could result in a detection bias. Nonetheless, the estimates reported provide a real-world estimate of observed SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in a US-based healthcare system. Only 32.7% of those tested reported getting tested for COVID-19-related symptoms. Thus, a substantial degree of surveillance in asymptomatic cohort participants was present. The rates of testing were different across serology groups, with subsequent testing in seropositive participants lower than observed in seronegative participants at baseline. This factor could have resulted in a bias toward underdetection of SARS-CoV-2 in seropositive participants. Nevertheless, we report substantially higher rates than have been reported elsewhere, so this bias, if present, does not invalidate the central inference of this analysis that HCWs with serologic evidence of natural infection may have ongoing risks for infection within 6 months of the baseline serology. Second, not all COVID-19 serology assays have been vigorously evaluated in population-based samples, so suboptimal sensitivity or specificity could affect accuracy of results in determining serostatus at baseline and follow-up. However, in previous work, the case rate by serostatus was the same whether Abbott or an anti-spike assay was used. 1 Third, we defined possible reinfection as a PCR test that occurred >90 days after a positive serology result. Some of the cases we report as a possible reinfection could be due to prolonged viral shedding. However, the mean follow-up time between serology test and PCR positive result was 116 days, much longer than has been reported in the literature as the expected duration for prolonged viral shedding. 9,15-18 Furthermore, 5 of the 8 individuals who were positive had an intercurrent negative PCR test, suggesting that viral clearance had occurred. In summary, in this cohort of HCWs in and around a major metropolitan center with substantial burden of COVID-19, serologic evidence of previous infection was associated with \u223c74% lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection (new or possible reinfection) over 6 months of follow-up. Further study is needed to determine whether new infection with SARS-CoV-2 in seropositive individuals leads to severe disease, contagion, or long-term sequalae. Meanwhile, the risks for possible reinfection that we observed in seropositive participants support growing evidence against inferring that all individuals who are seropositive following infection have protective immunity. Policy makers and clinicians should expect continued infection risks in HCWs with a history of COVID-19, and these risks should be communicated to those who are unsure whether they want to proceed with vaccination.
