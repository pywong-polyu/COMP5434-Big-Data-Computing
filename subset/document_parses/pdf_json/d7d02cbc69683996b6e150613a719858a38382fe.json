            "text": "Developments in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) result in an exponential increase in the amount of data generated by sequencing experiments, an increase in the complexity of bioinformatics analysis reporting and an increase in the types of data generated. These increases in volume, diversity and complexity of the data generated and their analysis expose the necessity of a structured and standardized reporting template. Bio-Compute Objects (BCOs) provide the requisite support for communication of HTS data analysis that includes support for workflow, as well as data, curation, accessibility and reproducibility of communication. BCOs standardize how researchers report provenance and the established verification and validation protocols used in workflows while also being robust enough to convey content integration or curation in knowledge bases. BCOs that encapsulate tools, platforms, datasets and workflows are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) compliant. Providing operational workflow and data information facilitates interoperability between platforms and incorporation of future dataset within an HTS analysis for use within industrial, academic and regulatory settings. Cloudbased platforms, including High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) and Galaxy, support BCO generation for users. Given the 100K+ userbase between these platforms, BioCompute can be leveraged for workflow documentation. In this paper, we report the availability of platform-dependent and platform-independent BCO tools: HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App, Galaxy BCO API Extension and BCO Portal. Community engagement was utilized to evaluate tool efficacy. We demonstrate that these tools further advance BCO creation from text editing approaches used in earlier releases of the standard. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating BCO generation within existing analysis platforms greatly streamlines BCO creation while capturing granular workflow details. We also demonstrate that the BCO tools described in the paper provide an approach to solve the long-standing challenge of standardizing workflow descriptions that are both human and machine readable while accommodating manual and automated curation with evidence tagging.",

            "text": "The availability of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data, also referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, is growing at exponential rates due to decreasing costs to generate, store and analyze NGS data. Similarly, bioinformatics in support of NGS analysis are evolving rapidly: every day novel algorithms are published, researchers generate new interpretations and applications for existing workflows and regulatory sponsors submit data and analysis as regulatory evidence for maintenance and review to regulatory bodies. Platforms such as the High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) (1, 2) , Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) (3) and Galaxy (4) contain robust infrastructure to support this research-from the start of an analysis to summarizing results and to validation checks that ensure workflow reproducibility. Many community efforts and standards have surfaced in attempts to harmonize the genomics field, including data standards (5, 6) , standards for transmitting the data (7) , standards for workflows (8) (9) (10) (11) and standards for packaging resources (12) . Despite these efforts, methods for describing bioinformatics pipelines frequently omit important data, making comprehension of various steps or an entire pipeline difficult or impossible. It is clear that there is a strong need for a descriptive standard that includes pipeline metadata, details for appropriate pipeline execution, parameters chosen and background information not otherwise described (13) . The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 2791-2020 standard, also known as BioCompute, aims to address the growing need to communicate and exchange bioinformatics workflows, especially NGS analysis (14) .",

Here, we offer an initial evaluation of the first generation of publicly available tools developed to produce BCOs, including the HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App (19, 20) , Galaxy BCO API extension and the BCO Portal. The HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App and Galaxy BCO API extension are platformspecific tools that facilitate quick and easy pipeline export as IEEE 2791-2020 BCOs. The BCO Portal consists of an interface for building and viewing BCOs and a database of existing BCOs. The BCO Portal demonstrates the ease with which a BCO can be built with little knowledge of the standard. This paper reports the availability of platformindependent and platform-dependent BCO creation tools and the evaluation of these tools through a novel research initiative with novice bioinformaticians as the initial audience for the platform-independent (BCO Portal) and platform-dependent (HIVE BCO App and CGC BCO App) Once the (1) HIVE BCO App was developed in the development branch, (2) the code was then pushed from development branch to testing environment. ( 3) The code was tested in the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Daily environment, and (4) once approved, code was pushed out to production environments (FDA-SCI-HIVE, FDA-HIVE and Public-HIVE which are different HIVE installations at FDA and GW). (5) New code was tested and verified on each environment, with the tester submitting a report to the developer, who (6) addresses bugs in the development branch. tools. We then report on the efficacy on which novice bioinformaticians can generate BCOs after conducting platformspecific trainings (HIVE and CGC). BCO Tool users applied these trainings to create BCOs from available RNA-Seq workflows using the CGC BCO App and BCO Portal. Users submitted BCOs to the beginner track of the precisionFDA (pFDA) BCO App-a-thon (21) , allowing for systematic BCO evaluation. In addition, we present User Stories on how BCOs generated by these new tools are advancing FAIR principles (22) in existing applications. Lastly, we report on recommended standard and tool revisions aimed to address user questions and challenges identified by the user.",

This realtime and actionable feedback system was invaluable as participants were able to provide feedback on a variety of topics/concerns as they were encountering them. For example, a GitHub issue created by a participant who, while creating and modifying her BCO, felt there was a need for more thorough documentation regarding the software prerequisites in the Execution Domain. Her feedback was in response to her group's discussion regarding inconsistencies found in the review process. Despite adapting the same publication for their BCOs, group members had different software prerequisites recorded and they had been encouraged to discuss the differences and reasons behind them as a group. For clarification, the group consulted the resources available to them, including the BioCompute Specification Document, the BCO Portal tooltips and the Example BCO but were unable to find the information they needed. As a result, the user created a GitHub issue (https://github.com/biocomputeobjects/GW-SMHS-BIOC6223/issues/173) with the labels 'BCO Portal,' 'documentation' and 'feedback'. The pipeline described in the referenced publication used Trim Galore (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/ projects/trim_galore/) for simultaneous adapter trimming and quality check. One group member had included module details for Cutadapt (27) in pipeline step, as part of the Description domain. In this version, Trim Galore was listed as a software and Cutadapt as the prerequisite. In comparison, another participant referenced Cutadapt in the Execution domain's Software Prerequisites. The inability to distinguish a particular prerequisite as a pipeline step or platform prerequisite was described in the GitHub issue by the participant as a 'lack of consistency' and counterproductive to standardization. Insight from feedback like this is planned to be addressed in a Best Practices document that will offer guidance on practical implementations of BioCompute.",

These platform-specific tools generate a formatted BCO JSON object by extracting pipeline steps, platform information, data locations and parameters, while allowing a user to manually enter provenance and metadata information if not already extracted. As a key feature of BioCompute is interoperability (34) , these four BioCompute tools were developed with the capability to ingest and store the same BCO.

We further posit that detailed NGS documentation requires a clear communication of NGS analysis (workflows and data usage) that is both human and machine readable. The BioCompute standard, IEEE 2791-2020, aims to fill this need to clearly communicate NGS analysis workflows and has the potential for accelerating research (34) .

Beyond local storage, BCOs are generally stored on the platform on which the workflow was executed (i.e. CGC, HIVE, etc.) and/or GitHub. In a web application environment, the BioCompute Portal creates BCOs based on the Bio-Compute schema outlined in the BioCompute Specification Document. The BioCompute Portal Web application (BCO Portal; https://portal.aws.biochemistry.gwu.edu/) allows non-computational biologists to create, store and share their BCOs in a secure, user friendly manner. This is especially useful for users creating knowledge bases where there are several manual review steps. Users register for an account at the website; once approved, users can create and store BCOs and browse and download all open-access BCOs. Researchers can search for existing workflows, upload, create, modify, store and share novel BCOs. The BCO Portal User tutorial is available at: https:// github.com/biocompute-objects/bco_editor/blob/main/doc s/user_tutorial.md.",
