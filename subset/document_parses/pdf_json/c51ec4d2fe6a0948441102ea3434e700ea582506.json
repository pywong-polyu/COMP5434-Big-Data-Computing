As many studies have pointed out, there is a significant discrepancy between the officially confirmed data and recently published estimates (see, e.g., [1, 2] ). However, what do these data reflect, beyond the true nature of the virus? Of the few articles dealing with this question, authors [3] examined the protective effect of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine on COVID-19 infections and the death toll while using indicators such as the Human Development Index (HDI), per-capita GDP, and urban population percentage as additional control variables. Moreover, in line with [4] , they applied the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) as a proxy for the reliability of reported COVID-19 data. Other authors [5] found that measures of globalization, related to the migrant stock and air travel, were positively associated with both total cases and deaths. Results [6] suggest that more equitable access to healthcare does indeed increase testing rates and lower the death rate. Authors in [7] showed that more democratic political institutions experienced deaths on a larger per-capita scale and sooner than did less democratic countries, and based on [8] , the population size and government health expenditure are strongly related to COVID-19 cases.",

The results not only draw attention to the importance of factors such as air traffic, tourism, and corruption in report formation but also support decision makers and discipline-specific research by providing a source code written in R language (in R Notebook) that allows for the customization of the analysis and provides up-to-date results.",

Former indicators were obtained from the GovData360 and TCdata360 platforms using the data360r (version: 1.0.8) R package [11] . From these platforms, only annual indicators from 2015 and later were collected, and their missing values were replaced with previous annual values in descending order by year until 2015. During pre-processing, indicators (columns) where the ratio of missing values exceeded 50% were filtered out. Then, the same filtration was applied above 25% in the case of countries (rows). Finally, highly correlated variables and variables with near-zero variances were removed, and the standardized form of the retained 1159 indicators was connected with 8 COVID-19 variables, generated on the basis of the official reports of 138 countries [12] . Note that auxiliary indicators measuring the number of data sources and standard error were also filtered out, and variables with nearzero variances were eliminated using the default settings of nearZeroVar function contained by the caret (version: 6.0-85) R package [13] . The presented data were compiled on 22 July 2020. Table 1 shows the description of the variables in the structure of the final dataset. 5% * c",

The contribution of the database also confirms this finding since most indicators of this community are part of the World Travel & Tourism Council (27%), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Statistics (19%), and World Integrated Trade Solution (15%) datasets. The second community describes the infrastructure, especially in the field of digitalization, including variables such as ICT access, public services, and secure internet servers/million pop. Most of these variables are derived from the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (34%), Global Innovation Index (24%), and World Development Indicators (17%) databases. The third community, so-called business and ICT, is adjacent to infrastructure and digitalization. As its name suggests, it is in connection with information and communication technology (ICT); however, this community focuses more on business aspects such as innovation, efficiency, and competitiveness. The group regulation and corruption includes variables such as regulatory quality, political environment, and corruption. The sources of most of these variables are the World Justice Project-Rule of Law (31%), Global Innovation Index (25%), and Global State of Democracy (19%).
