To alleviate these social problems, the Korean government recently announced the implementation of mega-projects to solve low employment, population aging, low birth rate and social safety net problems by utilizing AI and ICBM (IoT, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Mobile) technologies. In this letter, we will present the views on how AI and ICT technologies can be applied to ease or solve social problems by sharing examples of research results from studies of social anxiety, environmental noise, mobility of the disabled, and problems in social safety. We will also describe how all these technologies, big data, methodologies and knowledge can be combined onto an open social informatics platform.",

The study focused on individuals with physical impairments as the initial test group as a means to eventually gain insight into the mobility of the wider disabled population. Conventional studies on mobility measurement obtained data from travel diaries, interviews, and questionnaire surveys. A few studies used geo-location tracking GPS data. GPS data is collected via mobile device and used to analyze the mobility patterns (distance, speed, frequency of outings) by using regression analysis, and to search for methods to extend mobility. A new metrics for mobility with a new indicator (travel range) was developed, and the way mobility impacts the quality of life of the disabled has been verified [4] .",

Until now, policies on the auditory environment have remained passive countermeasures to simply quantified acoustic qualities (e.g., volume in dB) in specific places such as construction sites, railroads, highways, and residential areas.

It was determined that the psychological state and the personal environment of the subject are important indicators of the perception of the auditory environment. In order to take into account both the psychological state of the subject and the physical properties of the external sound stimulus, an omnidirectional microphone is used to record the entire acoustic environment. 118 subjects with smartphones with the built-in application walked for an hour in downtown Seoul for data collection. On the app, after entering the prerequisite information, subjects pressed 'Good' or 'Bad' whenever they heard a sound that caught their attention. Pressing the button would record the sound for 15 s, and subjects were additionally asked to answer a series of questions about the physical characteristics of the specific location and the characteristics of the auditory environment. During the one-hour experiment, about 600 sound environment reports were accumulated, with one subject reporting the sound characteristics from an average of 5 different places.",

It was found that the CDC and Central Disaster Response Headquarters, the official government organizations that deal with infectious diseases, as well as the Central MERS Management Countermeasures & Support Headquarters, a temporarily established organization, were not playing an important role in response to the MERS outbreak. On the other hand, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, medical institutions, and local governments all have played a central role in responding to MERS. This means that the structure and characteristics of the Command & Control and communication in the official response system seems to have a decisive influence on the cooperative response in a real crisis response.
