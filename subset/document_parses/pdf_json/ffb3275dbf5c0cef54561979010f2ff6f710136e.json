Among these, 5-HT is a major neurotransmitter that is naturally present in animals and plants [5] . Similar to the catecholamines, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, 5-HT modulates the activity of the nervous system and plays a significant role in the coordination of movement and the regulation of mood. As well as scavenging harmful free radicals, 5-HT also plays roles in behaviour management, sleep cycles, appetite and liver regeneration [6] .",

With the rapid development of biotechnology, biological approaches show great potential for synthesizing natural and nonnatural molecules. Previous studies have shown that 5-HT can be produced from l-Trp in the nervous system of human and animals via two enzymatic steps: l-Trp is hydroxylated to 5-HTP by pterin-dependent tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), then converted to 5-HT by tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), which is one of the Aromatic amino acid decarboxylase [8] . However, the protocol has several issues, including the problems that TPH possesses poor stability and the expensive cofactor, pterin, is required [5, 9] . Aromatic amino acid decarboxylases (AAADs) play important roles in the key step of 5-HTP conversion to 5-HT. Previously, tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) was regarded as an enzyme that catalyses non-specific reactions in l-Trp or 5-HTP (prefer to l-Trp), with the result that a one-pot cascade reaction cannot be performed and has therefore never been reported [10, 11] (All the methods are shown in Table 1 ).",

However, SmTPH is a cofactor-dependent enzyme and requires the expensive cofactor biopterin [9, 17] . To solve this issue, synthesis and regeneration cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ) and tetrahydromonapterin (MH 4 ) modules were constructed in the chassis cell containing SmTPH [1, 18] . As shown in Fig. 1 , the 5-HTP concentrations in the cells containing BH 4 and MH 4 increased until 60 h of fermentation, then decreased with the further increase of time. The observed decrease in 5-HTP concentration may have been due to the oxidation and degradation of 5-HTP as the fermentation time increased [5] . The highest concentrations of 5-HTP were 0.93 g/L and 0.34 g/L at 60 h with BH 4 and MH 4 , respectively. Zhang et al. reported that the production of 5-HTP from SmTPH using BH 4 as a cofactor was higher than that when using MH 4 as a cofactor in S. cerevisiae, which correlated with the findings of our study [18] . Therefore, the chassis cell containing the synthesis and regeneration cofactor BH 4 and SmTPH was used in the next experiment.",

The highest concentration of 5-HT was 352.4 mg/L, with a yield of 17.62%, at 48 h, which was similar to the two steps to produce 5-HT [6] . Fig. 4b , the l-Trp concentration decreased continuously from 2.00 to 0.899 g/L within 96 h. Meanwhile, the 5-HT concentration increased as time increased and reached the highest concentration (0.3136 g/L) at 84 h, which was 2.04-fold higher than that obtained from the two-stage fermentation process by CtAAAH and TDC [6] . However, the concentration of 5-HT decreased after 84 h and the fermentation broth turned dark, which was similar to the results reported previously [22] . It may because 5-HT was unstable. During the reaction process, oxidation reaction occurred and degradation products generated, resulting in the decrease of 5-HT and colour changed.",

The production of 5-HT was obtained in the former but not in the latter (data not shown). To explore the reasons, SDS-PAGE was used to analyse the protein expression of E. coli BL21(DE3)\u25b3tnaA/BH 4 /HaDDC-SmTPH and E. coli BL21(DE3)\u25b3tnaA/BH 4 /SmTPH-HaDDC.

This phenomenon may be attributed to the insert position of the HaDDC gene, which affects the expression of both enzymes.
