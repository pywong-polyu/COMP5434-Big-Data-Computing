In India, the translation of this global action plan at a national level has occurred through the National Health Policy (NHP) (NHP 2017), and the policy vision is being implemented across states through multiple approaches by the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS). 6 7 Additionally, India's flagship programme on universal health coverage, Ayushman Bharat, comprises the conversion of 150 000 primary health centres into health and wellness centres. This measure aims to strengthen primary care services that can prevent and treat NCDs including IHD. 8 To support the cause, the NHP 2017 planned to raise the general government health expenditure (GGHE) to 2.5% of the GDP from the usual government allocation of 1.2% of the GDP in previous years. Moreover, NHP 2017 has suggested NPCDCS to strengthen secondary and tertiary care services, along with primary care NCD interventions, such as 'best buys'. 9 However, while the plans and commitments have been put in place, the challenges of the existing disease burden of IHD,have overwhelmed public healthcare systems. Additionally, the scarcity of health workers and the poor co-operation between states and the central government in India's decentralised health administrative structure appears to be detrimental towards tackling the disease burden of IHD. [10] [11] [12] Therefore, it becomes necessary to explore the factors influencing readiness of the public health system of India in order to tackle IHD based on the commitments made through the NHP 2017 and other relevant national programmes. Readiness here is defined as the cumulative availability of components required to provide services. 13 In a nutshell, this is an attempt to explore whether the existing public health system is capable of delivering the government commitments on NHP and national NCD programme to the people of India, through the existing public health system infrastructure, in order to tackle the mortality and morbidity due to IHD.",

[14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Moreover, data from such studies considered LMIC context in a totality which made it difficult to find any specific data for India. The COVID-19 pandemic in India has already witnessed a scarcity of oxygen supply and overwhelmed tertiary care sector. 19 Further, health system issues like dual practice, poor skill mix and inadequate number of healthcare staff in the public sector have further constrained the existing care system. 20 In this scenario, people with IHD or at risk of IHD might overstrain the existing care system especially with cases requiring tertiary care services.",

Data analysis through the proposed conceptual framework rather serves as a conceptual lens for this study. Therefore, we will be deductive in our approach, assuming all health system readiness issues are inclusive within this conceptual framework. The conceptual framework was chosen through mediation with all reviewers, and moreover, straightforward demarcation of health system components allow for clear interpretation. 31 We also considered other conceptual frameworks; however, they were either overly complex for the purposes of this study or considered factors beyond the health system that were not relevant for the present study.
