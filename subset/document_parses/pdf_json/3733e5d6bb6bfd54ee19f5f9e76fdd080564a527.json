The most common setting for patient-nephrologist interactions is during the HD treatment, which is a time pressured setting that lacks privacy. Objective: To facilitate effective communication in the hemodialysis (HD) unit, we evaluated the usability of a web application (web app) from both the patient and physician perspective. The main aim of the web app was to support patients in prioritizing their dialysis concerns outside of the clinical HD encounter. Design: Mixed method, parallel arm, multi-site, pilot randomized controlled trial. Setting: Two outpatient Canadian HD centers. Participants: Adult patients receiving in-center HD and their attending nephrologists. Methods: Patients were randomized to either a web application or an active control (paper form) for logging concerns to be addressed at weekly encounters with the nephrologist over 8 weeks. Topics included: HD treatment, symptoms, modality, and medications. The primary outcome was usability, defined as effectiveness (engagement with the tool, frequency of submitted concerns, whether the concern was satisfactorily addressed) and satisfaction with the tool using a priori thresholds and explored in interviews with patients and nephrologists. Results: 77 patients (30 women, median age 61, interquartile range [53,67], median 2 years [1,4] on dialysis) and 19 nephrologists (4 women, median age 46 [36,65]) were enrolled. Patient use of a digital device at baseline was low (20%). Engagement with the tool was 70% (web app) and 100% (paper) with a lower proportion of patients in the web app group submitting at least one concern over 8 weeks compared to the paper form group: 56.7% vs 87.9%. Weekly concerns were satisfactorily addressed in both groups and \u226570% of patients would continue to use the tools. For patients, both tools promoted preparation and participation in the encounter; however, only the web app facilitated greater privacy in relaying concerns. For most nephrologists, the tools were disruptive to their workflow and were perceived as unnecessary given existing processes and familiarity with patients. For future versions of the app, patients suggested more features to facilitate self-management and nephrologists suggested integration with health databases and multidisciplinary teams. Limitations: Tertiary setting may limit generalizability. Conclusions: Both tools promoted fundamental components of self-management; however, patients in the paper form group submitted concerns more often and this tool was easier to remember to use. Although modifications would likely enhance web app usability, successful future adoption is limited by physician acceptance.

For the web app, patients desired additional features to support patients et les n\u00e9phrologues ont plus souvent lieu pendant l'h\u00e9modialyse, mais ce contexte manque d'intimit\u00e9 et les parties sont souvent press\u00e9es par le temps. Objectifs: Pour aider \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une communication plus efficace dans l'unit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9modialyse (HD), nous avons \u00e9valu\u00e9 la convivialit\u00e9 d'une application Web du point de vue du patient et du m\u00e9decin. Cette application Web devait aider les patients \u00e0 faire part de leurs pr\u00e9occupations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la dialyze en dehors des s\u00e9ances d'HD. Type d'\u00e9tude: Essai multicentrique randomis\u00e9 contr\u00f4l\u00e9 avec groupes parall\u00e8les, r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par m\u00e9thodes mixtes. Cadre: Deux centers d'h\u00e9modialyse canadiens en consultation externe. Sujets: Des adultes recevant des traitements d'HD en center hospitalier et leurs n\u00e9phrologues traitants. M\u00e9thodologie: Les patients ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9partis al\u00e9atoirement pour utiliser l'application Web ou un t\u00e9moin actif (formulaire papier) pour consigner, sur une p\u00e9riode de huit semaines, les pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 aborder lors des rencontres hebdomadaires avec leur n\u00e9phrologue. Les sujets abord\u00e9s concernaient le traitement d'HD, les sympt\u00f4mes, la modalit\u00e9 et les m\u00e9dicaments. Le principal crit\u00e8re d'\u00e9valuation \u00e9tait la facilit\u00e9 d'utilization, d\u00e9finie par l'efficacit\u00e9 (engagement avec l'outil, fr\u00e9quence des soumissions, si le probl\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante). La satisfaction \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'outil a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e avec des seuils pr\u00e9\u00e9tablis et explor\u00e9e lors d'entrevues avec les patients et les n\u00e9phrologues. R\u00e9sultats: Ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus 77 patients (30 femmes) sous dialyze depuis 2 ans (dur\u00e9e m\u00e9diane; intervalle interquartile [1,4]) et dont l'\u00e2ge m\u00e9dian s'\u00e9tablissait \u00e0 61 ans [53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67]. Ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus 19 n\u00e9phrologues (4 femmes; \u00e2ge m\u00e9dian : 46 ans ). Au d\u00e9but de l'\u00e9tude, l'utilization d'un dispositif num\u00e9rique par les patients \u00e9tait faible (20 %). L'engagement avec l'outil \u00e9tait de 70 % (application Web) et de 100 % (formulaire). Les patients du groupe \u00ab application Web \u00bb sont moins nombreux \u00e0 avoir soumis au moins une pr\u00e9occupation au cours des huit semaines comparativement au groupe utilisant les formulaires papier (56,7 % c. 87,9 %). Les pr\u00e9occupations hebdomadaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante dans les deux groupes et plus de 70 % des patients continueraient d'utiliser ces outils. Pour les patients, les deux outils ont favoris\u00e9 la pr\u00e9paration et la participation \u00e0 la rencontre, mais seule l'application Web a permis d'accro\u00eetre la confidentialit\u00e9 dans la transmission des pr\u00e9occupations. La plupart des n\u00e9phrologues ont trouv\u00e9 que ces outils perturbaient leur flux de travail et les ont per\u00e7us comme inutiles puisqu'ils jugent qu'un processus et une familiarit\u00e9 avec les patients existent d\u00e9j\u00e0. Les patients ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que les futures versions de l'application aient plus de caract\u00e9ristiques pour faciliter l'autogestion; les n\u00e9phrologues ont quant \u00e0 eux sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'elle soit int\u00e9gr\u00e9e aux bases de donn\u00e9es sur la sant\u00e9 et aux \u00e9quipes multidisciplinaires. Limites: \u00c9tude men\u00e9e dans des centers de soins tertiaires, ceci pourrait limiter la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisabilit\u00e9 des r\u00e9sultats. Conclusion: Les deux outils ont facilit\u00e9 des composantes fondamentales de l'autogestion. Cependant, les patients qui utilisaient des formulaires papier ont plus souvent fait part de leurs pr\u00e9occupations. Il s'est \u00e9galement av\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'on pensait davantage \u00e0 utiliser cet outil que l'application. Bien que des modifications puissent accro\u00eetre la convivialit\u00e9 de l'application Web, son adoption demeure limit\u00e9e par l'acceptation des m\u00e9decins.",

Effective communication between physicians and patients has also been associated with higher patient satisfaction with care and improved health outcomes. 3 People receiving in-center hemodialysis (HD) desire better communication with their physicians. Areas of particular concern include the amount of information nephrologists share with patients and how this information is delivered. 4, 5 In Canada and the United States, it is common for interactions between the patient and his or her nephrologist to occur during HD treatment. This prevailing model of HD care delivery (\"walk rounds\") 6 is a potential barrier to quality patient-physician interactions for several reasons. First, interactions are often time-pressured, limiting the discussion to immediate concerns. Second, patients may minimize their concerns if symptoms occur outside of HD or forget to raise them when the physicians arrive and presents their agenda. Finally, lack of privacy is a potential barrier to present the discussion of sensitive issues.",

The process for collecting patient concerns for the rounding nephrologist was similar at all sites with the charge nurse documenting concerns at the start of the shift on the doctor's board. Physicians typically reviewed concerns at the start of the shift and rounded independently.",

Web app participants and nephrologists received an orientation session and written instructions on how to navigate the web app. The web app was used weekly over the 8-week study period on a designated rounding day and patients were limited to submitting 2 concerns per week. Patients could use the web app at any time but were encouraged to log concerns outside of dialysis time and to bring their device to HD on the designated day. The day prior to the encounter, patients were emailed a system-generated reminder to log their concern. For patients without access, a tablet was provided in the waiting room prior to initiation of HD. To evaluate willingness to engage with the tool independent of having specific concerns, patients were instructed to select \"no concerns\" if they had none. Once a concern was submitted, the nephrologist could view it in the web app immediately or on the designated rounding day.",

Second, web app participants were more likely to value the tool if the rounding nephrologist viewed their concerns prior to the encounter, indicating that variable uptake by physicians influenced patient use and/or perceptions of the web app's utility. Third, web app use was associated with a lower frequency of being able to talk without interruptions, which may have negatively influenced its use. 13 Finally, patients may have simply preferred direct communication. In another study in kidney transplant recipients, preference for direct communication was one reason people did not use technology to communicate with providers. 14 Although this preference is reasonable, low self-efficacy, perceived low proficiency, and lower socioeconomic status are also associated with lower health technology use. 14, 15 It is therefore important for health providers to identify patients' reasons for not engaging with technology so that barriers to accessibility do not exacerbate existing health disparities.",

This knowledge gap is surprising given the median time on dialysis was 2 years but is potentially an unintended consequence of having other health team members screen and triage concerns. The main barrier to the patient and nephrologist jointly defining the agenda and expectations for the encounter was the perception of limited time. The tension between delivering care that is patient-centered vs care that is convenient for the system and providers has been described elsewhere in the literature. 16, 17 Although mechanisms to prioritize patients concerns is one proposed solution, 16 our interpretation of the qualitative data suggests that the success of such mechanisms depends on perceived influence on physicians' efficiency and workflow.",

            "text": "Data describing how technology influences the patientdoctor interaction in HD are limited. Studies from other settings report the use of health technology tools as both barriers and facilitators to provider's \"relational practice\" which in part was influenced by provider culture. 18, 19 As clinician participation or endorsement is a known driver of patients' health technology use, 20 we posit that physician culture negatively influenced higher adoption of the web app in our study. For example, for some nephrologists, knowing the patient was conflated with knowing the patients' concerns or \"what is important.\" This paternalistic approach to communication is consistent with previous studies across variable HD settings. In one study of elderly HD patients, the healthcare team was perceived as owners of the knowledge, deciding what the patients needed to know. 21 In another study of in-center HD patients, although patients viewed their relationships with the care team as good, they did not feel involved in decisions regarding their care or consider it to be individualized. 17 Our study has strengths and limitations. This study was directly informed by the priorities of patients and to our knowledge, is the first trial to examine the role of technology in HD care delivery. We used a priori criteria and applied a comprehensive approach to understanding usability. To understand the advantages of a health technology tool over less resource-intensive methods and to equalize co-interventions, we used paper as a comparator. As nephrologists delivered care to participants in both groups, there is potential for contamination, which could have resulted in more frequent elicitation of concerns in the control group and could have potentially been mitigated with cluster randomization at the level of the provider. We recognize that the intervention was mainly directed at the patient, thus focusing on 1 side of a 2-sided relationship. However, similar interventions that included the training of physicians were no more effective than those that only involved patients. 22 We did not include multidisciplinary team members in this pilot as the aim was to facilitate communication with the provider that patients commonly consider as their main source of information. As the frequency of internet-based technology use was relatively low, 8 weeks may have been too short to adequately evaluate use. Finally, patients and physicians were primarily male and White and the setting was tertiary care, which may limit generalizability of our findings.",

            "text": "We found that overall, patient participants appreciated tools (web app or paper) to help prepare them for and set the agenda for the encounter with the nephrologist. In contrast, most nephrologists viewed the tools as either cumbersome to use, unnecessary given their knowledge of the patient, or disruptive to the process of having staff screen concerns. However, many patients described limitations to the existing system of relaying concerns through unit staff, suggesting that to deliver care that is respectful and responsive to individual patient preferences, additional mechanisms whereby patients can clearly identify and communicate their concerns to providers should be evaluated. Consistent with the recommendations from nephrologists and patients' desire for more opportunities to manage their own dialysis, the ability for the patient to direct their concern to the appropriate dialysis team member would be an important feature to include in these tools. In terms of future iterations of digital tools, bi-directional communication with providers and social interaction were other desired features that may increase adoption. For tools designed to include the nephrologist, efficiency of workflow was highly valued and therefore the integration of these tools into existing processes (ie, the electronic medical record) may increase uptake. Furthermore, given the complexity of the HD setting, piloting the tool in the unit during the development phase could enhance usability. Given the higher usability of paper, one conclusion from our study may be that development of digital tools is not patient-centric. However, the need for technology to facilitate HD care delivery is borne not only out of demand for greater individualization of care, but also and as demonstrated the recent coronavirus pandemic, out of the need to support digital literacy as more resources are being provided virtually. Future studies and initiatives should consider how to integrate the patient voice and preference into the design of these tools. Ultimately, however, the use of technology to facilitate patient participation depends as much on the adoption of values that are consistent with patient-centered care by healthcare providers as it does on the attributes of the tool.",

And you might do so and you -it allowed me to think about things before actually talking to the patient and some were a miscommunication issue. Which might -I mean, it might have gone the same way, but I just found it useful to know the question ahead of time. And sometimes you could address the -so sometimes if you went to the patient and asked them what their problem was and it would take them a while to come up with the answer. And then you'd get the question but then you'd need to do further background work to figure out what the answer would be or what the next step should be. This way, you had it ahead of time and you could check something on the computer or do whatever and then you could resolve it right then and there. So yeah.\" \u2022 \"Useless. Useless as you can get. It [the web app] makes uh takes a lot of time and patients don't get it at all. They just don't know how to use it . . . They did -they don't do it. Period . . . One of the patient's phone fell through. The other was extremely frustrated because each time she had problems to log in . . . and the other one was fine but he never voiced a concern on the web app and when I was rounding, there was tons of concerns.\" \u2022 \"So, the ones that were on the web app, they are not web app people. They are not computer people. If I had maybe younger patients who have higher education level and more money to use these devices, maybe that would be easier. Right? But the population that I have, they are people -they are simple people and I don't think they have enough knowledge or resources to be proficient in the web app. At least -I can give you an example. One of them had a phone and the phone was broken the majority of times so he couldn't even log in, right?\" The thought behind it was that the patients would enter this data before they came. Some of them did it literally a few minutes before they were hooked on or something like that. I thought, because their concerns were -an hour ago I was not feeling well, or something like that. Or \"I was not feeling well this morning\" or \"I don't want to do dialysis today\" so . . . It's -I don't understand if that is what the aim of the web app is. Because the aim of the web app was to facilitate concerns which are ongoing to not be addressed. These are too -these are too small or too current . . . For the web app to change anything.\" Umm, I think it just speeds up the uh, like speeds up the interaction, umm, you know, knowing when the doctor comes to see you he already knows your concern.\" \u2022 \"He was -it's quicker for him to respond to my questions because he already knows what they are. So he's given time to read over and either diagnose or switch medications. Whatever is necessary. And it probably takes a lot of stress off of the doctor, as well. You know, like when it comes to questions and stuff like that, he doesn't have to remember so much because if he reads it, then he troubleshoots it then and then when he comes in here, we talk about it, then we troubleshoot it further, if needed. So, I found that it was very useful in those ways.\" \u2022 \"Definitely. In a huge way. As soon as um as soon as the doctor came in, he knew immediately why he was stopping in to see me, which I really, really liked, and we dealt with it and it was a done deal. Life was great. I loved it. I thought it was fantastic. Yes.\" \u2022 \"As I said to you before, I wish this was set in stone right across the board for all medical staff. I thought it was wonderful. I would love nothing more than to see this with the my G.P., with my cardiologist, with every other doctor. I find it saves a lot of time . . . \" \u2022 \"It was easy to use. It was fine. It was redundant because the charge nurse still asks if I have anything for the doctor and I never really knew if the doctor read my concerns and actually many times, I saw the doctor pull up the app and read my concerns standing next to me. So I think it's redundant and didn't really make communicating any easier. I liked the idea of it, that they would already know what the issue was coming in that day, and being prepared for it in some way.\" Nephrologists Now, the downside to that [directing concerns to the physician] is, there are lots of issues that are triaged by nurses that are appropriately triaged by nurses that as a Nephrologist you don't ever have to hear about. But the nurses tell people, you know, \"Look. You really need to go see your family doctor about that.\" Or, \"Your toothache? I'm sorry, that's not something your Nephrologist can help you with.\" Or, you know, this x, y, or z. You know. I don't know. This falls under the category of unintended consequences then, too. There is a value to having an experienced charge nurse appropriately triage issues that are or are not relevant. And an experienced charge nurse can do that very well.\"\u2022 \"Actually, I think um I think the paper form was a real hindrance because sometimes the patients would feel that they write it on the paper and then so they don't have to tell the charge nurse that they want to talk to me. And that actually makes things twice as hard. I think the paper is not very useful and in terms of to help change the way I interact with the patient no, because usually, either way, I know ahead of time, either from the charge nurse or from the app what the patient wanted. The paper actually made it more work because then I had to go and seek it out.\"\u2022 \"I just had to go more often to the patient, just because they were in the study . . . And every time you go to a patient, they would bring up concerns which were not recorded.\"",
