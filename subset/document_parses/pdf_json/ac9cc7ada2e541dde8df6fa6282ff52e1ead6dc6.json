In this study, 80 female cancer survivors participated in a running-based group intervention (2 sessions/week; 1.5 h), while 51 acted as controls. The intervention lasted approximately 5 months. Unfortunately, the length of the intervention was reduced and sport activities were altered by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown mid-intervention, while the shared therapy sessions continued online. This possibly altered the results, as anxiety, depression, and physical aspects did not show significant differences between the experimental and control groups after the intervention. Participants reported positive comments on the experience as a whole, especially regarding the positive influence of the newly developed social connections. This was corroborated by significant correlations between group perceived cohesion and anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and positive experience with the group psychological support. Overall, it is possible to suggest that in the program an important role was played by social connections and support, peer influence and the group experience, preserving positive experiential qualities of the intervention even if it was altered by external circumstances.",

Furthermore, sports help patients to improve psychological functioning and cognitive skills (such as attention, memory, and decision-making processes; Pesce et al., 2013; Zimmer et al., 2016) , and strengthen the overall sense of identity and self-esteem. Identity can also be enhanced thanks to an educational approach through (and not only of ) the physical on both individual and group support levels (Liao and Masters, 2016) . Firstly, cancer patients develop notable introspection processes through the discovery of their own abilities and strengths and weaknesses, a knowledge particularly important to build a new sense of Self after the illness experience (Hodge and Lonsdale, 2011) . Such abilities can be adapted and transferred in other life domains to increase personal skills, for example in cancer management (Pierce et al., 2018; Sebri et al., 2020) . According to reviews and meta-analyses in the field, sport-based interventions generally have positive effects on breast cancer survivors' quality of life and health management (Craft et al., 2012; Bluethmann et al., 2015; Neil-Sztramko et al., 2019) , although some specific physical activities appear less effective than others (e.g., TaiChi; Yan et al., 2014) . Physical activity and sports were reported in the literature as associated with passion and positive emotions in breast cancer survivor (Burke et al., 2012) ; qualitative studies on the experience of breast cancer survivors within quality of life interventions focused on sports help to understand the meaningful psychological outcomes of these activities, ranging from feeling positively challenged, sense of closure, growth and personal strength, and also improving one's own body image and finding new social support resources (Burke and Sabiston, 2010; Brunet et al., 2013) .",

Recent studies highlighted that motivation can change over time and peer/group support is relevant to dedicate time and enjoy activities by having other people involved in the same physical activities with similar efforts and emotional difficulties (Elmagd et al., 2018; Durosini et al., 2021a; Savioni et al., 2021) . Indeed, social support promotes patients' commitment and engagement in activities that demand lifestyle changes, such as sport (Richardson et al., 2017; Savioni et al., 2021) . The perception of being part of a group fosters individual motivation thanks to the creation of new social bonds (Cho et al., 2020; Durosini et al., 2021a) that promote deeper reflection on one's own motivation by impacting the general experience of a group as well as one's own personal objectives (Novick et al., 2011) . In the context of sports-based interventions for improving health and quality of life in chronic patients, participants could develop meaningful social relationships that affect their well-being as much as intervention activities.",

It was expected that the sport-based program would lead to significant improvements in psychological and physical well-being compared to the participants included in the control group. However, the intervention was partially altered by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, which made it impossible for the participants to complete all the running activities that had been originally planned, as the beginning of the project was delayed according to lockdown national regulations (Durosini et al., 2021b) . Secondarily, the running activities were not performed within closed spaces in the end but in the open and abiding by safety rules (the participants wore masks and respected social distancing). Thirdly, while the main running activities were completed, a marathon that was originally set as the final \"goal\" for the participants, and held important motivational value, was canceled. The participants had been still able to attend all the focused formation and therapy sessions online.",

Despite the limitations, the participants were able to interact and share their experiences with cancer, survivorship and everyday life, and often they reported (as brief comments on the intervention experience) the social and friendship opportunities as the main factor among their take-home benefits.

Yet, this study represented the opportunity to explore which factors within a psychological intervention may be positive and useful for cancer survivors when an intervention is altered by external circumstances. Relevant indexes of participants' quality of life (depression and anxiety) or participants' commitment to healthcare management and the intervention itself (self-efficacy and satisfaction with group therapy) appeared related to the perceived quality of the peer group, created by the participants and enriched during the intervention months. It is possible that both sport activities and group cohesion would obtain significant effects within an intervention more extended in time, similar to how \"Pink is Good\" was originally conceived before the COVID-19 related alterations, as previous research reports that peer relationships and the building of novel social support resources can promote participants' motivation and health outcomes (Queen et al., 2017; Chen and Zhao, 2020; Durosini et al., 2021a) . This is consistent with research showing that support groups may be more welcomed and beneficial to breast cancer patients if proposed and described in innovative ways (Green et al., 2018) , for example as sport groups that will share self-empowering activities. As a limitation of the present study, participants' motivation was not analyzed as a possible influence on final outcomes.
