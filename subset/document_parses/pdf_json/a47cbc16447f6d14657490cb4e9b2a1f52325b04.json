There are three major concerns to balance: life, liberty, and economy. Here, we create a multi-attribute utility function including those three attributes and provide reasonable bounds on the weights of each. No one set of weights on the utility function can be considered \"correct.\" Furthermore, the outcomes of each mitigation strategy are deeply uncertain. Not only do we need to take into account the characteristics of the disease, but we also need to take into account the efficacy of the mitigation strategies and how each outcome would be evaluated. To handle this, we use Robust Decision Making methods to simulate plausible outcomes for various strategies and evaluate those outcomes using different weights on the multi-attribute utility function. The simulation is done with a compartmental epidemiological model combined with a simple economic model and a model of liberty costs. Rather than trying to optimize likely outcomes for a particular version of the utility function, we find which strategies are robust across a wide range of plausible scenarios even when there is disagreement about how to weigh the competing values of life, liberty, and economy.",

(Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty Society, 2015) COVID-19 meets all of those criteria. There are many epidemiological models which can be used to predict pandemics, including mathematical models and agent-based models, and they don't necessarily give the same results. (Connell et al., 2009) The parameters of those models are almost completely unknown at the very start of the pandemic, which is when Fig. 1 The RDM process (Lempert, 2019) some policy decisions need to be made.

Multi-attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) (Keeney et al., 1979) holds that one can create a utility function in which each criterion is listed and weighted in order of importance. The result is a composite measure of different criteria that can be used to measure each alternative. This is useful when the criteria being evaluated are not all on the same scale. For instance, comparing the tradeoff between economic outcomes, hedonic value of liberty, and health outcomes, as we're doing here. Public policy alternatives often lie on a Pareto frontier in which one option is best on one criterion and another option is best in a different criterion. This method can be used to help differentiate between options on the Pareto frontier by selecting the alternative with the highest utility value.",

While utility is to be maximized, regret is to be minimized. One common way to use regret is to minimize the maximum regret, also known as \"minimax regret\". Minimax regret is useful when facing large \"tail risk\", (Anthoff & Tol, 2014) which is common when facing deep uncertainty.

The SEIR model is often used for diseases for which there is a time gap between being exposed to a virus and being infected by it, as well as a group who are removed (either through recovery and immunity or through death) at the end. Both of these appear to apply to COVID-19 (Lauer et al., 2020) . There are models which are even more detailed than the basic SEIR model used here. RAND Corp, for example, has several extensions to the basic SEIR model in their COVID-19 decision support tool. (Vardavas et al., 2021) . These extended models can provide better predictions in suitable situations, where needed data are available. But in a decision context, such refinements must be balanced against the require richer connections to alternatives and utility they require, and they may be of secondary importance for questions about where stakeholder values are likely to be in conflict or in harmony.",

To achieve this aim, we combine several commonly-used OR methods into a novel modeling framework. One such method is quantitative modeling. Here, we use the aforementioned SEIR model. Another method is Monte Carlo sampling of a quantitative model of a system with large parametric uncertainty. A good example of an application of this method is Anthoff and Tol (2014) . In that paper, the authors use an existing climate model and perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the parameters. They convert all of the outcomes (a statistical life lost, a square kilometer of wetland lost, and so on) to a dollar value, and analyze the results. We diverge in this paper in that we don't use a single value to convert the outcomes to dollars, which leads to another OR method: multi-criteria decision making. We explicitly build a utility function to interpret the output of the simulation. Rather than giving the terms of the utility function a single value, we look at different plausible values for those terms. This adds a second layer to the interpretation of the results. Not only do we look at a large range of possible scenarios and try to pick a strategy that is robust against a large range of them, but we also view the results through the lens of differing worldviews to pick a strategy that is robust against those worldview differences. Ideally, this will lead to a strategy that is not only good for society in the face of deep uncertainty but will also be easier to implement because it is robust against differences in personal values.",

Here, we instead start with strategies and consider how each worldview would interpret the results.

The top portion represents the quantitative model developed in Sect. 5. The Policy Decision Variables directly impact both the SEIR parameters and the societal outcomes. For example, the policy decision variable related to mandatory mask-wearing will influence the relevant parameter in the model as well as have the societal outcome of people being required to wear masks. Other assumptions also impact those two concepts, for instance, the number of hospital beds available. The SEIR parameters are then used to run the model, and the outputs from that model describe the portion of societal outcomes related to the disease spread.",

However, when a disease like COVID-19 has a nonuniform impact on different segments of the population, VSL is not necessarily the best measure. Keeney (1990 Keeney ( , 1994 turns the VSL around. Instead of putting a dollar value on lives, he asks how lives would a reduction of wealth cause? Poverty leads to increased mortality, he argues, so therefore increasing taxes to pay for a government program to save lives will increase poverty which can cost lives. In this way, instead of comparing dollars to dollars, we can compare lives to lives. This avoids some of the controversy of putting a value on lives. In the 1990 study, he estimates that a fatality might be induced by an economic cost of $3 m to $7.5 m in 1980 dollars. In the 1994 study, Keeney estimates that the number is in the range of $5 m to $50 m in 1990 dollars (Keeney, 1990 (Keeney, , 1994 . Updating the values from Keeney (1990) to 2020 dollars gives us a range of $9.4 m to $23.5 m. The wider range from Keeney (1994) in 2020 dollars is $9.9 m to $99 m. As with the VSL approach, this counts all lives the same, regardless of age, disability, or any other factor. Another way to calculate this value is to look at the years lost. After all, everybody dies. What is actually lost are the years of life between when someone died from a particular cause, and when they otherwise would have died in the absence of that cause. This is common in medical literature, where they use the concept of the QALY, or Quality-Adjusted Life-year (Zeckhauser & Shepard, 1976) . This measure looks at how many years of life are gained by a particular medical intervention adjusted for the quality of those years. For instance, a year of life on a ventilator will be adjusted downwards when compared to a year of perfectly healthy life. This sort of calculation is used when determining how to allocate limited medical resources.",

When maximizing the value of life and minimizing the hedonic value of liberty, the distinction largely didn't matter. The ordering of the strategies didn't change in any way. However, when using the Minimum Economy worldview, in which both life value and hedonic value of liberty are maximized, there was a difference. When maximizing the value of each life, and limiting the value of each life-year, we're also limiting the maximum hedonic value of liberty. In this case, the value of life dominates, and the preferences look more like the Maximum Life worldview than the Maximum Liberty worldview. mask mandate alone wasn't enough. The Central Quarantine strategy also had a lot of support across most worldviews in many scenarios, and in every case had the lowest maximum regret. This is because the majority of the utility loss comes from the lockdown itself, regardless of the parameters of the disease. The worst-case scenario when implementing the Central Quarantine strategy is far better than the worst-case scenario when using the mask mandate only strategy. No worldview preferred the Light Lockdown strategy in much of the parameter space. There seemed to be a thin slice of parameter space for which all four worldviews preferred the Light Lockdown strategy, but that particular slice was different for each worldview. On the other hand, no worldview routinely had Light Lockdown as the worst strategy; it was usually on the lower end of the regret measure. There are some counterintuitive results here. For example, we find that the Liberty Maximizing worldview would often prefer a light lockdown or a mask mandate over doing nothing. This is because there is a minimum value they can assign to lives and life-years. Under many sets of parameters, the life cost of doing nothing is much higher than the liberty cost of masks or a light lockdown, even if they minimize the life cost and maximize the liberty cost. This is an interesting result because there has been a widespread backlash against mask mandates. (McKelvey, 2020) However, many of the people who oppose mask mandates also believe that COVID-19 is not particularly deadly or as infectious, or that mask effectiveness is very low, or even 0. In those cases, if you limit the parameters to where COVID-19 is less dangerous than the seasonal flu and mask effectiveness is very low, the Maximum Liberty worldview prefers the strategy of doing nothing in almost every case.",

So, some of the professed support for the \"do nothing\" strategy can be attributed to people seeing the observed rate of spread in the face of countermeasures and mistake that for the rate of spread in absence of those countermeasures. Additionally, this initial decision is being made at the very beginning of the pandemic when there is deep uncertainty about the parameters of the disease. In the real world, we're only reacting to one realization of the course of the pandemic out of the countless possible futures which could have occurred which needed to be accounted for in the decision-making process.",

Ideally, this would lead to an outcome that dominates a mask mandate alone across all worldviews. We might also consider whether or not a \"very light lockdown\" might be better. If we could identify the \"low-hanging fruit\" so to speak, that would have very little impact on the economy or liberty but might help with mitigating the virus. Part of the success of the mask mandate strategy was that it had an impact on the spread of the virus with little associated cost. If other countermeasures with a similar impact-to-cost ratio could be identified, they should be incorporated. Or perhaps neither of those ideas will perform as expected, and that information can be used to generate further new scenarios.",

The robust approach incorporates a SEIR epidemiological model containing variables for policy levers of interest; random simulation is used to generate a range of policy results, and these are evaluated through a linear multi-attribute utility function structured in terms that reflect the discourse about pandemic policy. Simulation model input values are varied to reflect uncertainty, while utility function parameter values are varied to reflect different worldviews. This approach provides a framework to incorporate robustness against worldview differences into quantitative modeling. Rather than relying on the personal worldview of the modeler or the decision-maker, this framework allows the decision-maker to see how robust the results are in the face of differing worldviews. This has applications outside of pandemic modeling. For example, in climate modeling (e.g., Anthoff and Tol (2014) , the value of life and the value of a square kilometer of wetlands are used in the analysis, and these values may differ from person to person.

However, they may prefer to wear a mask if they were aware of the potential downsides of doing nothing, especially in the early days of the pandemic when the disease characteristics were unknown. Furthermore, as the pandemic evolves, variants of the model here may address different policy questions that arise such as those involving vaccines, as well as adding more subtle attributes of utility that are emerge in public dialogue as, for example, duration of impacts becomes salient. Thus, not only can modeling for robustness against futures and worldviews aid in decision-making but it can also aid in political communication and consensus-building.
