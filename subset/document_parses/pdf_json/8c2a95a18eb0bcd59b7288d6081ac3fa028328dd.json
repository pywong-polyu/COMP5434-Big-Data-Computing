Children who received a KD diagnosis and were treated at our hospital between December 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020 were included. KD was diagnosed using the Japanese diagnostic criteria. Patients who were treated for KD elsewhere before being transferred to our hospital were excluded. To compare the clinical presentations before and during the local COVID-19 epidemic, the patients were divided into two groups, period 1 and period 2, based on whether the diagnosis was made before or after March 1, 2020. The patients' data were extracted from their medical records. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in the sera were measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay using the iFlash 3000 chemiluminescent immune analyzer (YHLO Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) with a cutoff value of 10 AU/mL for IgM and IgG. Cryopreserved sera obtained before and one week after the initial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment",

First, patients with COVID-19 have thus far been much fewer in Asia than in Europe, leading to fewer children having the disease. Second, PIMS-TS apparently shows a predilection for individuals of black or Hispanic descent, 1,2 suggesting that genetic factors may contribute to its uneven distribution. The same trend was observed in Kawasaki shock syndrome, a severe form of KD characterized by clinical presentations very similar to those of PIMS-TS. 4 These ethnic groups may have some genetic factors that make them more susceptible to hyperinflammatory states. Our study incidentally revealed a higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level in IVIG preparations than in the patients' serum, indicating potential cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses, as previously demonstrated in a study analyzing human sera collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 5 According to recent reports from Europe and the United States, more than half of patients with PIMS-TS are known to present without Kawasaki-like symptoms. 1,2 Because the current study focused only on patients with KD, the exact epidemiology of PIMS-TS was not analyzed. Furthermore, the present report was based on a small, retrospective study at a single institution; nationwide studies are needed to clarify the actual state of PIMS-TS in Japan.",
