            "text": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a UV-sensitive syndrome [1] , is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease with severe hypersensitivity to sunlight and neurological symptoms; no effective therapy is yet available. Neurological symptoms appear in 55% of all patients with XP before adolescence in Japan [2] and in 25% of patients with XP in Western countries [3] . XP occurs in 1 in about 22,000 people in Japan, 1 in about 1 million people in the United States, and 1 in about 435,000 people in Western Europe [4] . XP complementation group D (XPD) is the second most common complementation group in the United States and Europe and is the third most common group in Japan [3, 5, 6] . The XPD R683W mutant causes severe abnormalities of the central nervous system such as progressive intellectual impairment, hearing impairment, and loss of the ability to walk [7] . Because patients with the XPD R683W protein demonstrate reduced levels of nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity, we may be able to improve clinical symptoms if we could identify candidate agents to aid recovery of NER activity. XPD protein is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase in the transcription factor II human complex that causes a damaged DNA strand to unwind, which would facilitate DNA repair [8] . Our previous in silico study showed that clinical symptoms caused by an impaired NER function in each XPD type were determined by the ATP-binding ability in the XPD mutants [9] . This finding indicated that ATP-binding affinity may be used as a key indicator of drug discovery in silico.",

The target molecule in this research was XPD R683W, which completely lacks the DNA repair function of XPD.

We minimized the energy by using the steepest descent method until the maximum force on any atom was less than 1000 kJ/(mol\u00b7\u00c5 ), which was followed by a 250 ps heating process to reach a 310 K starting temperature. After the heating process, we used a 5000 ps production run with the NPT ensemble (a constant number of particles (N), pressure (P), and temperature (T)).

On the basis of our previous report [9] , we selected the candidate agents 4E1RCat and aprepitant because of the recovery of ATPbinding ability in silico. Their characteristics are as follows: 4E1RCat inhibits interactions between the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF) 4E and G and reverses chemoresistance in anticancer therapy [23] ; aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin-1 receptors as the inhibitor of substance P [24, 25] . During our in vitro evaluation of NER recovery via the EdU-based UDS assay, 4E1RCat demonstrated a recovery of UDS in the primary cultured cells harboring the XPD R683W mutation, which indicated that the drug-induced recovery of NER in the cells ( Figure 5 ). This recovery of NER may benefit therapeutic drug use in clinical settings because NER deficiency causes XPD pathogenesis. The mechanism for the recovery of NER in the cells by use of 4E1RCat may be explained by improved ATP binding (Table 1) , which resulted because of the shift in charge from positive ( Figure 4b ) to negative (Figure 4c ) in the ATP-binding region of the XPD R683W protein after 4E1RCat binding. However, only a slight difference occurred in the electrostatic surface potentials at the DNA-binding regions. With regard to aprepitant, no NER recovery was observed. This finding may be explained by the lack of effect on the charge status in the ATP-binding region in XPD R683W after binding with aprepitant ( Figure 4d) .",

In vitro investigations showed that 4E1RCat also halted the decrease in interleukin-1\u03b2 production, myeloperoxidase levels, and neutrophil recruitment in murine Aspergillus fumigatus keratitis by means of inhibiting eIF4E/4E-BP1 binding, as well as stopping the increase in fungal load and apoptosis [30] . Another report suggested that 4E1RCat lowered interferon-\u03b1 and interferon\u03bb levels in plasmacytoid dendritic cells by suppressing interferon regulatory factor 7 protein expression [31] . 4E1RCat can inhibit virus replication in cultured cells infected with coronavirus or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus as a result of the inhibition of protein translation [32, 33] . In animal research, 4E1RCat prevented upregulation of fibronectin and Nr4a and delayed cartilage degeneration in a rat osteoarthritis model after an intra-articular injection [34] ; it also regulated obesity via inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity (US Patent No. 2006/070135 A1). With regard to toxicity, 4E1RCat demonstrated no acute toxicity in mice given 15 mg/kg/day for 5 days by intraperitoneal injection [23] . Additional pharmacokinetic analyses and preclinical studies of animal models of XPD R683W are needed before human clinical trials can begin.",
