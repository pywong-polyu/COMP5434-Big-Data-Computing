Comparing COVID-19 to non-COVID-19 pneumonia, Bai et al. found that vascular thickening was significantly associated with COVID-19 (59% vs. 22%, p<0.001) (3), indicating that vascular enlargement carries specificity for COVID-19. Consequently, this sign should be taken into account to distinguish COVID-19 from viral pneumonia, one of the principal differential diagnoses from the imaging point of view.Interestingly, the authors present cases of unenhanced and contrast-enhanced chest CT, suggesting that selected patients may benefit from intravenous iodinated contrast injection for effective diagnosis and management. Depending on disease severity, patients having COVID-19 may have coagulation disorders leading to elevated D-dimer levels and increased risk of venous thromboembolism (4).Abrupt deterioration of the patient's medical condition should raise suspicion of cardiovascular complications and prompt CT angiography if deemed appropriate, since associated diagnoses such as pulmonary embolism may impact therapeutic decisions(5).",

Typical COVID-19-related pulmonary findings can be detected on non-enhanced chest CT, including the vascular thickening sign that may help discriminate COVID-19 from other diseases. CT angiography should be considered in particular clinical scenarios such as unexplained respiratory worsening or new-onset chest pain.",
