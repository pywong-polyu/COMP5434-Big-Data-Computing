We sought to understand how each county fared compared to what would be expected based on a reference population and what factors contributed to negative outcomes from the pandemic in South Dakota (SD). The Standardized Incidence Ratios of all counties, using age-adjusted hospitalization and death rates were computed. In addition, a penalized generalized linear regression model was used to identify factors that are associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates. The results identified counties that had more or less severe outcomes than what would be expected based on the rate in SD. Additionally, race, education, and testing rate were some of the significant factors associated with the outcome.",

The age distribution for SD and two counties is shown in Figure 1 . It is well known that severe illness from COVID-19, in the time frame this report covers (before the delta variant), disproportionately impacts older individuals. In college towns such as Brookings, the age distribution based on the 2019 census [? ] is different than many of the other counties in SD (see Figure 1 ). The Brookings County has a younger population than both Brown County and SD overall. Thus, crude rates of hospitalization or deaths per 100,000 may be less in Brookings County compared to counties with an older population simply due to age differences. To account for this difference, the age-adjusted rate per 100,000 is standardized to the values across counties with respect to their age distribution. The daily age-adjusted rate per 100, 000, R, was calculated as",

Therefore, cumulative counts at a specific date were considered. Similar to daily counts, the cumulative age-adjusted rate per 100,000 was also calculated for deaths and hospitalizations as follows.

In GLM we assume that Y i follows an exponential family distribution such as the Gaussian, Binomial, Poisson, etc [28] . The \u03b2 0 , \u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 , ..., \u03b2 p are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation approach. For this method, the coefficients that maximize the likelihood function are obtained. In our data, however, since there were a large number of potential predictors and several of them exhibited co-linearity, we chose to use the penalized GLM for feature selection. Specifically, the Lasso GLM incorporates \u03bb p j=1 |\u03b2 j | as a penalty in the likelihood function [12, 28] . Lasso regression will force some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly zero as \u03bb increases, effectively dropping the variables from the model. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

To better understand the data, several techniques were used to complete exploratory data analysis. All our analysis henceforth will use the age-adjusted rates per 100,000 for cases, hospitalization, and deaths and crude rates for testing data. We first explored the trends in the COVID-19 data. The daily ageadjusted cases of the counties in SD are shown in Figure 2 . In this plot we can see the major outbreak (peak) at around Nov-Dec 2020. We also note the initial surge in Minnehaha County, where an outbreak at a pork processing plant (Smithfield Foods Incorporation) occurred [23] . The two highest daily rates corresponded to the mass testing at the facility in ... County []. The map of South Dakota with age-adjusted cumulative hospitalizations and deaths are shown in Figure 3 . As expected, we see a strong association between hospitalization and death rate among the counties. Also note that the west-central part of the state has higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Figure 4 shows the cumulative age-adjusted hospitalizations and deaths SD counties. For hospitalization, there seems to be two groups with light gray and darker gray shades in the plot. For deaths, we can see three groups of counties with those separated at the top with like grey shade, those in the middle with darker grey, and another group with close to zero deaths at the bottom with light grey shades. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The numerical summaries of the demographic and socioeconomic explanatory variables are given in Table 1 .A more detailed graphical summary of the socioeconomic explanatory variables are given in Appendix 6.

After creating the linear model, there was a positive association between the cumulative rate of hospitalizations and the nonwhite percentage. Conversely, there was a negative association between the cumulative rate of hospitalization and educational attainment. That is, a county with a higher number of college-educated residents saw fewer hospitalizations. For cumulative deaths, lasso regression selected nonwhite percentage. The linear model revealed that there was a positive association between cumulative deaths and the nonwhite percentage. After fitting the penalized GLM models to the data we computed the expected cumulative hospitalization and death rate for each county. This then was used to compute new predicted SIR values after controlling for race and educational attainment in case of hospitalization and race in case of deaths. The results of both SIR's with just age adjustment and with both age and other factor adjustment are presented in Figures 6 and 7 . For ease of presentation and interpretation of the results we present 1 \u2212 SIR values. Hence, the values below zero indicate that the observed values are less than the expected and counties that had more than expected will be above zero. For age-adjusted rates of hospitalization, from the top ten counties in SD, Lawrence, Clay, Beadle, and Brookings had the lowest significant SIR values with Lawrence County experiencing about 60 percent fewer hospitalizations and Brookings experiencing about 36 percent fewer hospitalizations than expected. Minnehaha had 17 percent more and Brown had 10 percent more cases than expected. For deaths, from the top ten counties in SD, Yankton, Brookings, Clay, and Lawrence had the lowest SIR values with Yankton experiencing about 43 percent fewer deaths and the others about 35 percent fewer deaths.

We noted that in the top 11 counties, most counties had lower values than expected when compared to South Dakota as a baseline. Consistently, Lawrence, Brookings, and Clay had significantly lower rates of severe outcomes than expected. In contrast, Minnehaha and Davison experienced significantly higher rates of severe outcomes than expected. Looking at specific states at the worse end of the map, Dewey, Todd, Olgala Lakota, and Buffalo had twice to four times more hospitalizations and deaths that what might be expected. We note that these counties are where some of the American Indian reservations are located in SD. Throughout all the models, the nonwhite percentage was repeatedly selected as positively associated with hospitalizations and deaths. Based on the available literature, this is not surprising. Historical treatment and continuing racial differences have contributed to large disparities between minority and white populations in the United States. In South Dakota, American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) is the largest minority at 9 percent followed by two or more Races (2.5 percent) and Black or African American (2.3 percent) [24] . According to the CDC, the ratio of AI/AN to white non-Hispanic persons was 3.4 for hospitalizations and 2.0 for deaths. For Black or African Americans, it was 2.8 for hospitalization and 2.0 for deaths. That is, for all measures, both AI/AN and Black persons experienced higher rates that their white counterparts. In addition, AI/AN had the highest ratios among all minorities for hospitalizations and deaths [10] . One study that confirmed the disproportionate burden of cases on AI/AN and cited reliance on shared transportation and household size may have been a few of several factors that increased community transmission and which may have incurred higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths [14] . In addition, Indian Health Services reports that AI/AN have consistently experienced a decreased health status compared to other Americans [16] . AI/AN disproportionately suffer from high blood pressure, chronic liver disease, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lower respiratory disease among others [16] . These all contribute to an increased likelihood of hospitalization or death from a COVID-19 infection.",

Low educational attainment (such as a high school degree or less) has been associated with adverse health effects such as coronary artery disease[]. Scientists are now understanding the overall relationship between education and health, finding that more schooling is linked to better health and longer life [29] . Adults with more years of education have access to higher paying, more stable jobs where they can accumulate wealth to invest in their health. In addition, individuals with fewer years of education tend to have more chronic health conditions, smoke, have a less healthy diet, and lack adequate exercise [29] . All of these factors can culminate in someone who is more likely to require hospitalization due to COVID-19 based on known risk factors [9] . In addition, research has shown that the pandemic has disproportionately impacted those with lower educational levels [11] .",

The poverty threshold is adjusted based on family size and composition. It is not adjust geographically, but the thresholds are updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index. If a family's combined pretax income does not meet the threshold, then the whole family is considered in poverty [6] . Median income represented the median income of households in the last 12 month to 2019 inflation-adjusted dollars [4] . [7] . For an individual to be insured, they must have been currently covered by insurance from a current or former employer or union, had insurance purchased directly from an insurance company, had Medicare, been on any kind of government-assistance plan for those with low-income or disability, military health care, VA health care, and/or Indian Health Services (IHS). However, those only covered with IHS were considered uninsured because IHS was not comprehensive coverage [7] . This study specifically looked at the percentage of uninsured individuals living in each county. (5) The rate of cardiovascular hospitalizations was from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention. These values represented the age-adjusted rate per 1,000 from 2016-2018 of county residents aged 65+ for whom a cardiovascular disease was the principle (or first-listed) diagnosis upon admission to the hospital [8] . (6) The United States Diabetes Surveillance System under the guidance of the Division of Diabetes Translation, CDC asked adults if \"a doctor has ever told you that you have diabetes\" to calculate the percentage of adults who had diabetes per county. They also determined the percentage of adult that were obese, or whose body mass index (BMI) was over 30 from self-reported height and weight. The percentage of physically inactive was calculated from the number of adults who answered that they had not participated in physical activity in the last month [25].

Due to South Dakota's predominately white population (with the largest minority being Native American or Alaska Native at 9 percent), the percentage of nonwhite individuals overall was calculated instead of being broken down by racial groups. The age group demographics were necessary to compute age adjusted rates of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths [24].

For this study, education attainment was measured as the percentage of a county's residents, aged 25 and older, who had completed a bachelor's degree, master's degree, doctoral degree, or professional degree [5] .
