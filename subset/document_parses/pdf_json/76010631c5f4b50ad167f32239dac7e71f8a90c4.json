            "text": "Introduction: Undocumented immigrants (UIs) in the United States are less likely to be able to afford health insurance. As a result, UIs often lack family doctors and are rarely involved in annual screening programs, which makes estimating their health status remarkably challenging. This is especially true if the laboratory results from limited screening programs fail to provide sufficient clinical information. Methods: To address this issue, we have developed a machine learning model based on the non-negative matrix factorization technique. The data set we used for model training and testing was obtained from the 2004 cost-free hepatitis B screening program at the Omni Health Center located in Plano, Texas. Total 300 people were involved, with 199 identified as UIs. Results: People in the UIs group have higher cholesterol (219.6 mg/dL, p = 0.038) and triglycerides (173.2 mg/dL, p = 0.03) level. They also have a lower hepatitis B vaccination rate (38%, p = 0.0247). No significant difference in hepatitis B ( + ) was found ( p = 0.8823). Using 16 individual clinical measurements as training features, our newly developed model has a 67.56% accuracy in predicting the ratio of cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein; in addition, this newly developed model performs 9.1% better than a comparable multiclass logistic regression model. Conclusions: Elderly UIs have poorer health status compared with permanent residents and citizens in the United States. Our newly developed machine learning model demonstrates a powerful support tool for designing health intervention programs that target UIs in the United States.",

The specific demographic distribution varies greatly from state to state, with California, Texas, and Florida having the largest number of UIs. 3 Furthermore, there is a great amount of variation in the inclusivity of state-specific immigrant policies, especially as it relates to UIs, which results in large differences in terms of the medical burden that individual state-based health care systems face. 4 In Texas, a state with roughly 1.7 million UIs, it is estimated that 32% of UIs live below the poverty line and 64% of UIs are uninsured. 5 Comparatively, of the > 2.6 million UIs in California, a state with one of the highest UI insurance rates, an estimated 40% are uninsured. 6 These socioeconomic challenges are further compounded by numerous other barriers to care, including discrimination, linguistic barriers, and fears of deportation. In addition, these barriers often have an especially high impact on elderly UIs' access to health care, who are already at greater medical risk in regard to most chronic conditions. 7 All of these factors, and the frequent local administration of accessible health care, make the collection of personalized data for population-based monitoring and control of both acute and chronic diseases in UI populations extremely difficult.",

Ultimately, it currently falls to state and local governments to attempt to enact measures that extend health care services to UIs, and they often must do so while facing explicit federal restrictions on funding. 9 Nevertheless, even in major metropolitan areas that have implemented strategies and interventions to extend health care services to UIs, such as New York City, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Chicago, federal policy and rhetoric have continued to limit the utilization of these services by UIs. 10 In summary, this combination of various socioeconomic and political factors represents a huge challenge in providing quality health care to UIs, and in implementing health-related medical research relating to UI health in the United States.",

Based on the ratio of CHOL to HDL, we assigned the personal-level health statuses of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in response to below-average risk, average risk, above-average risk (moderate), and above-average risk (high), respectively 16 (Table 1) . When e was equal to 1e \u00c05 , we applied the soft-assignment method to cluster the ratio of CHOL to HDL and obtained the scaled plot for all patient samples with different risk levels (Fig. 1A) . Since the original CHOL/HDL ratio is recoded by the categorical numbers 1-4, the width of each colored band in every column represents how closely the original data were to the cutoff value of each risk category. After iteration, OGNMF produces more distributed bands that represent the patient's data at different risk levels (Fig. 1B) . The step error generated during each iteration decreases dramatically at the beginning then reaches a plateau after 10 steps (Fig. 1C) . Simultaneously, the prediction accuracy reaches 67.59% when the step error reaches a steady state (Fig. 1D) . Numerical data associated with other epsilons (e) are given in the Supplementary Data. As cross-validation, we randomly selected patients from the same data set and calculated the CHOL/HDL ratio by using a multiclass logistic regression (MLR) method. The average prediction efficiency of this MLR was equal to 61.59%, which is 9.7% less accurate than our newly developed OGNMF-based model.",

This new model has a fast convergence rate and better computational accuracy when using a data set that contains the medical screening information from UIs compared with models developed using other techniques. In addition, concerning other machine-learning models, 15 this is the first machine learning model designed for assisting in the analysis of the health statuses of UIs.",
