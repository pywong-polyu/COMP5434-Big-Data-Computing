This paper draws attention to the triple burden on the women during this time when certain roles are supposed to be performed by the women regardless she is employed or homemaker. The paper highlights the challenges faced by women educationists in making themselves comfortable with the work-life balance with emerging challenges such as new technologybased innovative teaching methods and various learning software's, apps, platforms, etc.. The paper employs in-depth interviews of teachers belonging to three categories i.e. primary, secondary, and higher education. The findings reported that female teachers agreed that pandemic had affected their daily life schedule. This leaves a deep effect on their mental and psychological health due to multiple attentions they pay towards home management, child & elders extra care, challenges due to work from home pattern of organizations, increased attention to students due to online teaching, etc. The paper presents the implications for the society and government to understand the women's pressure so that a happy and satisfied life is there for all with no gender discrimination.",

The author selected Uttar Pradesh, India for the data collection because development indicators reported the low status of females in the state (Priya et al., 2015) . The National Family Health Survey-3 reported that 42% of women face sexual violence, 59% of women were married before 18 years, and women participation in the workflow is very low (17%). The gender inequalities constitute a patriarchal society possessing triple bottom effects as one moves to the utteristic layers functional on the name of culture and tradition exacerbated specifically to one's gender, marital status, social and economic conditions. The geographical surroundings affect the strictness of its impact and its intensity gets deeper as one's moves from the urban to interior, remote and rural areas. Thus, examination of the triple bottom effects on women becomes more crucial in such a geographical location, where women's development is less.",

The study analyzed the female teacher's burden from three perspectives that need to be taken care of for the well-being of female teachers during pandemic times, so that satisfaction, prosperity, and happiness can be enhanced in their professional future. The first domain includes social and personal life that is affected due to increased household tasks due to multiple reasons including lockdown, house helper's suspension of services, increased expectations of family members, more focus on hygiene and sanitation conditions, and many more. The second domain includes the effect on professional life i.e. the employer expectation, increased work pressure due to online classes, challenges involved in the adoption of ICT techniques, etc. Further the effect on the financial component that is affected due to salary deduction, job layoffs, delay in salary payment, etc. The last perspective is the psychological and emotional effects on mental wellbeing due to critical time and the heartbreaking news due to the coronavirus and increased engagement with the organization and family affairs.",

            "text": "COVID-19 virus makes the world to adopt remote work or WFH concept to get saved themselves from the infectious risk of a mutated virus which is making its presence worldwide (Prasad et al., 2020) . Various software and innovative tools such as \"viewer, Splashtop, Microsoft remote desktop, zoom, Microsoft teams, and owlare\" make this phenomenon easy and possible (Pinola, 2020) . Several challenges such as technical literacy, the comfort of using these tools, overworking, bad health habits, distraction at home, etc. affect employee satisfaction (Wheatley, 2017) . Apart from these challenges, social and family expectations from women are endless. Across the sphere including many countries and having various cultures and traditions, it is \"SHE\" who consistently carries the heaviest burden of expectation and responsibilities (McLaren et al. 2020 Nawaz and McLaren 2016) . Social stigma can't alleviate the women to be free from the existing responsibilities (Moreno and Shaw 2018) . The impact of additional and intensifying burdens on women can be long-lasting, which they may endure well beyond the resolution of the disaster itself. Moser (2012) in his gender analysis purposed that women's vulnerabilities at the time of the disaster, such as war, pandemic, natural calamities, and malnutrition are intensified (Bradshaw 2015) . This is because increased responsibilities affect women completely where gender discrimination adds more complexity (McLaren et al. 2020) . In India, women are bound to perform various roles and duties that include the children's care, their education, and household chores, etc. (Aryee et al., 2005; Ravindran and Baral, 2014) . If there remains some incompleteness then blame is passed to the women. Gender egalitarianism is followed in western countries and male spouses help their wives by doing housework (House et al., 1999) . Whereas in India, males doing domestic work perceived to be weak (Aycan, 2004) , and females who fail to do motherly and wifely duties are often realized to feel guilty for this (Jost & Banaji, 1994) .",

Apart from these challenges, the responsibility of housework and child care has been defined as women's work which generates the need for work-life balance (Yun et al. 2019). Organizations had a lot of expectations from the working professional including women who work hard to prove themselves competent so as they can fit in the social sphere. If the woman fails to maintain the balance, Men oriented world makes women realize that she does not fit in the organizational structure (Stivers, 2002) . Working mothers have more responsibility towards their childcare as compared to men (Fox et al., 2011) . This increased burden affects the work outcomes and efficiency related to higher education particularly related to teaching, research, publications, and project grant (Jung, 2020) . Therefore, lockdown caused by the pandemic produces negative effects on the females related to higher education including scientists, researchers, teachers, and academicians.",

The spread of Pandemic diseases such as the COVID-19 crisis made the people confined to their homes with uncertain effects and tension related to the financial, health, and economic insecurity resulting in the scare and grief period for everyone. This crisis scenario leads to domestic violence, women's reproductive health care, maternal and child health (Bahn et al., 2020) . Biroli et al. (2020) found that couples who quarrel over the household distribution and childcare responsibilities have a strong effect on their mental wellbeing. Life satisfaction is negatively related to the changes in the childcare division. Women take more tensions as compared to men in the context of managing household activities such as grocery duties, riskseeking behavior, and cooperation.",

This stress leads to unfavorable effects on the learning and psychological health of the students and teachers (Sahu, 2020) . A female teacher who has various other responsibilities and higher expectations from the employer regarding the effectiveness of the online teaching patterns develops a sense of dissatisfaction among themselves. Online classes that involve various ICT tools and new portals or apps are not so easy to learn and so handy that everyone feels comfortable while using these tools. This brings anxiety, consciousness, and depression among female teachers. Henceforth, in such a male dominating society, it becomes crucial for the females either to create a work-life balance or they are required to leave the job.",

To examine the problem in-depth, participants selected for the study consist of a total of 17 teachers including 5 primary teachers and 4 Secondary teachers employed with schools. Also, 8 assistant professors working with private universities and colleges were included for structured interviews. All the participants have a minimum of 10 years of teaching experience.

Females set up their daily routine by incorporating environmental and social changes. They were not allowed to go out, maids were not coming, all family members were staying at home, and virtual learning had already started. Thus, this period is appropriate for understanding the experience of the working females how they maintain work-life balance along with personal and professional challenges. The respondents included in the study were contacted on telephone or zoom app meeting where they were asked questions for approximately 25-30 min. Face-to-face or personal interviews are not possible at this period due to lockdown. Further, permission was also to record the conversations but some participants did not permit to record, so information was written in those cases.",

This pandemic brought a significant change in society, environment, economy, political that is affecting the daily routines and work-life balance (Petrakova et al., 2021) . The present paper explores the triple burden effect on the female teachers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is an extension of the previous studies undergoing the investigation of pandemic and epidemic effects on women's mental, psychological, health, and stress levels. Dos Santos et al. (2016) reported that in cases of previous epidemic and chronic diseases such as Zika, pregnant women in Brazil and Puerto Rico expressed high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression whether they are infected with Zika or not. Hanson et al. (2016) found that Liberian women may be at high infection risk of Ebola due to traditional gender roles such as taking care of sick people, washing and cleaning household items like clothing and dishes, which may be contaminated by the virus. Brooks et al. (2015) found that a high workload and long working hours when resources are limited due to disaster leaves a negative psychological impact. The findings of the study identified the prominent reasons for psychological and mental stress for female teachers. The study found that increased family obligations and responsibilities brought important changes in social and environmental setup. In a country such as India, where household tasks are meant to be associated with the \"females only\" has increased due to the absence of home-maids and family members staying at home. It has become a social stigma and gender roles are defined by \"stereotypes\" that portray women as weak contenders. This means men meant to stay away from the kitchen and do not helping in raising their children. Biroli et al. (2020) reported that the absence of childcare facilities imposes more pressure on working mothers when responsibility is not shared by fathers. Besides, domestic violence has reached new heights, and data obtained worldwide clearly explained that women are meant to be a soft target (Beland et al., 2020) . This means that changes should be brought in home culture and work culture, focusing on creating a balance between work done by women (Folbre, 2017; Grossbard-Schectman and Grossbard-Shechtman, 2019) .",

Countries worldwide are adopting innovative online platforms for online teaching methods and knowledge sharing has brought various concerns such as increased stress and anxiety among the teaching community (UNESCO, March 2020). The study highlighted that female teacher agreed that new teaching platforms are challenging and learning about these new platforms is difficult in such a negative atmosphere. COVID-19 impacted the daily schedule and difficulty increases when learning of ICT blended techniques for virtual teaching becomes necessitate. This finding is similar to previous studies. Teachers felt a lot of challenges to become adaptable to new methods of teaching which involves technological complexity, literacy, and competency (Rahman & Abdullah, 2018) .

All the teachers reported negative and unpleasant experiences such as nervousness, confusion, anger, irritation, resulting in the mismanagement of various things. The main reasons might be due to social distancing (Ammerman et al., 2020); overwork pressure, management of extra home-related tasks (Power 2020) ; use of new technology (Rasheed et al., 2020) , household, and job-related tensions (Biroli et al. 2020). Further, Goswami and Narah (2021) found that a positive correlation between \"perceived stress and depression\" predicting the women are inclined towards depression during these difficult times of pandemic. Despite negative results, a pessimistic view focuses that due to lockdown and staying at home; female teachers agreed that they can spend valuable time with their family members.
