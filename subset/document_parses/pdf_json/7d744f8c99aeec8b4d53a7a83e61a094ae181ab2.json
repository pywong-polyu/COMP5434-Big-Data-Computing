The first part of this paper overviews the theoretical innovations of the last decades regarding the interpretation of cause-specific mortality dynamics, often referred to as epidemiological transitions theories, and their relevance for the analysis of mortality inequalities. The paper then analyses the cause-specific trends of mortality for two educational classes between 1971 and 2008. The trends were corrected for changes in the coding system and divided into linear (stagnating, increasing or decreasing) periods. Causes of death were grouped according to the relationship between the sequences of these periods for the two educational classes. The 57 causes of death were finally clustered into six groups. One group, which is dominated by nutrition-related and cardiovascular diseases, is largely responsible for the onset of mortality inequalities in 1980. The results imply that the quality of nutrition has diverged for the educational classes since 1980, and this fact has left its footprint on the pattern of mortality. The history of food production and availability seems to be in line with nutrition-related mortality, and it is argued that nutrition transition theory provides a very plausible explanatory framework for the growth of mortality inequalities.",

So far the explanation for these developments has only been provided within a larger context that applies to the whole of the Eastern European region, including not only CEE and Baltic countries but also countries like Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. One of main conclusions has been that they have not so far undergone the healthier life style changes that have occurred in Western Europe, and this has resulted in a \"reversed epidemiological transition\", in which an elevated burden of cardiovascular diseases dominates the pattern of mortality (Vallin and Mesl\u00e9 2004) . Is this framework applicable to Central and Eastern Europe and does it explain the evolution of their cause of death pattern and high level of inequalities? If so, what role did income play in these processes and what are the specific social processes that triggered these developments?",

The next one and a half decades brought a further, dramatic, increase in inequalities, which appear to have stabilised at this very high level for the past half a decade ( Fig. 4.1) . As regards broad groups of causes of death, the data suggest that the apparent similarities in all-cause mortality during the 1970s might be attributable to causes other than the lack of inequalities in living conditions between people with different education. This period was characterized by the overmortality of the less educated from cardiovascular diseases and the over-mortality of the more educated from malignant tumours (Fig. 4.2 and 4.3 ). An explanation is called for which will look at the historical development of cause-specific mortality within the framework of the epidemiological transition. In this paper I shall review recent developments in epidemiological transition theory, and test the applicability of some of these theories to the evolution of cause-and education-specific mortality inequalities in Hungary between 1971 and 2008. 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 SMR, 1/100 000 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 SMR, 1/100 000 ",

The original statements of the theory on mortality, fertility and population growth have already been tested, analysed, criticised and modified. By now, epidemiological transition theory and demographic transition theory have split: the first one has gradually shifted towards a focus on cause-and age-specific mortality patterns, while the second is now far more concerned with patterns of fertility and family formation. The original postulates of Omran are, without doubt, of a heuristic nature: based on limited empirical basis (in its original form it was based on the long-term causespecific mortality trends of just six countries), it provided a comprehensive picture of the evolution of cause-of-death patterns throughout the history of mankind. In a rather vague division of human history, three transitional phases were distinguished: the 'age of pestilence and famine', the 'age of receding pandemics', and the age of 'degenerative and man-made diseases' (Omran 1971) . Stages were differentiated on the basis of average life expectancy, and age-and cause-specific mortality. During the first phase, which encompassed most of human history (the \"pre-industrial period\", Omran 1998), mortality due to chronic malnutrition, endemic infectious diseases, and high prenatal and maternal mortality shaped the overall high level of mortality, which was further increased by epidemics, famine and wars in the \"peak years\".",

The cause-of-death pattern was less and less characterized by diseases caused by pandemics but communicable diseases-tuberculosis in particular-were still dominant. The third stage is characterised by the dominance of non-communicable diseases, such as diseases of the circulatory system and different types of cancer. From the perspective of the future development of the theory, the additional characteristics of the stages are less important, though Omran's approach, which has been modified several times by himself and others over the past 30 years, remained complex and aimed at explaining the whole of population dynamics.",

This evidence was incorporated into the original model as three models, the Classic, the Delayed and the Accelerated models (Omran 1983) . Later on this was expanded to six models, the Classical Western Model, the Semi Western Model and four Non-Western Models: the Rapid, the Upper Intermediate, the Lower Intermediate and the Slow (Omran 1998) . Other authors suggested a different classification of countries (Frenk et al. 1991) in order to incorporate new evidence that did not fit into the original sorting in the first form of the epidemiological theory. From the perspective of countries in Latin America, the concept of an epidemiological transition was in sharp contrast to the mortality experience of many countries of the region, which were characterized by a sharp divide between the mortality patterns of different population groups within one country. This experience questioned the choice of countries as the units of analysis, and even raised doubts about the usefulness of the whole concept of an epidemiological transition. Apart from total refutation, the experience of Latin American countries are best summarized as a \"patchwork pattern\" in which different social groups are often segregated geographically, and display diverse mortality patterns corresponding to different stages of the epidemiological transition. In other words, \"different epidemiological worlds\" live next to each other. For industrialised countries, on the other hand, a large collaborative study of WHO did confirm the previously proposed trend of age-specific death rates for two broad groups of causes of diseases in the last half of the twentieth century (Salomon and Murray 2002) .",

Despite the very complex, and somewhat apocalyptic, view of the future presented by Omran in his last article (1998), epidemiological transition theory presents a linear view of changes in mortality patterns, according to which more developed stages follow less developed ones, alongside with the course of 'modernisation'. This process may take place slowly or quickly, and with some variations, but it also follows a linear route. In this respect, epidemiological transition theory does not differ from theories of modernisation propounded in the 1970's (Carolina and Gustavo 2003) and is very similar to the dominant view of demographic transition theories (Melegh and\u0150ri 2003) .",

            "text": "The theory of an epidemiological transition was attractive not only for public health researchers, it can also be viewed as a major contribution to the on-going debate of historians and historical demographers centred around the nature of mortality changes in the last centuries. In countries with a long history of collecting detailed mortality data, the distinctive phases of receding epidemics and the death toll of infectious diseases in general could be identified. Due to the great variability within the regions of one single country (for Sweden: Rogers and Nelson 1997) , this further classification, unlike the contribution coming from the discipline of gerontology, has not become a commonly accepted modification of the original epidemiological transition theory. Olshansky and Ault (1986) carried out a detailed examination of the age-specific death rates of the US and pointed to the onset of an epidemiological phase that differs from the one specified as the third stage of the epidemiological transition in the original form of the theory. This fourth stage, they suggested, is characterized by the dominance of the same major causes of death as the third stage but with a continuing delay in mortality from some of these causes, leading to a further significant improvement in life expectancy. The new stage, called the 'age of delayed degenerative and man-made diseases' has become a standard part of the most commonly accepted form of the epidemiological transition theory.",

These well-known risk factors are now more and more closely linked to societal transformation processes, mostly of a global nature. From among these theoretical frameworks we note in particular the theory of a nutritional transition (Popkin 2006, Popkin and Mendez 2007) . In this framework, major features of food production, distribution and several other characteristics of living conditions are connected to mortality patterns. Nutritional transition theory, just like epidemiological transition theory, divides human history into five distinctive patterns, out of which the fourth corresponds to the living conditions of contemporary CEE countries. The fifth profile describes the living conditions and dietary habits of the most health-conscious members of the most affluent countries. Labelling the phases not as stages but as profiles obscures the fact that these patterns are arranged in historical order so that they also represent some \"developmental route\". The patterns, however, are connected with a large number of dimensions of actual living conditions. As regards the transition to the fourth (\"obesity characterized\") profile, several processes, such as \"supermarketisation\", are connected to several social processes like the demand for safer food, the changing opportunity cost of females' time, technological changes, and changes in logistics and production systems. Altogether this transition is technically characterized by the growing importance of edible oil and animal products in human diet. Additionally sugar consumption is on the rise, often in the form of consuming sweetened beverages. The shift from high fibre intake to refined grains and additionally declining fruit and vegetable intake is also documented in many countries (Popkin 2006) . Transition theories regarding other risk factors are less developed at the moment, but the term \"smoking epidemic\" is also in use and the influence of strong economic forces has already been recognised (Yach et al. 2007) .",

            "text": "Regarding the other dominant groups of diseases, cardiovascular mortality has always been regarded as being strongly related to the epidemiological transition. Ischemic heart disease in particular often serves as a \"marker disease\" that indicates a country's position in the phases of the epidemiological transition (Heuveline et al. 2002) . Based on the observations of the contemporary occurrence and frequency of different cardiovascular diseases in different regions of the world, a complete framework for \"cardiovascular transition\" has gained popularity in the past few years. This framework provides a correspondence between particular cardiovascular diseases and stages of the epidemiological transition (Califf et al. 2010) . The linearity of the occurrence of the stages is not stated but it is inherent in the logic of this scheme. The 'pestilence and famine' stage, with life expectancy around 35 years, is characterized by a modest share of CVDs in total mortality (5-10 %) and the dominant forms of cardiovascular mortality are rheumatic heart disease and other infection-related diseases of the circulatory system, cardiomyopathy in particular. The latter disease may also be connected to malnutrition. In the second stage the proportion of deaths caused by CVD grows to 15-35 % and cardiovascular mortality is dominated by rheumatic valve disease, ischemic heart disease and haemorrhagic stroke. In this stage life expectancy reaches about 50 years. In the third stage, in which life expectancy reaches 60 years, the proportion of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases is greater than 50 %. The dominant causes of death within CVDs are ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke. In the stage of 'delayed degenerative diseases' the proportion of CVDs among all deaths falls below 50 % and life expectancy exceeds 70 years. Major cardiovascular causes of death are the same as in the previous stage, with the addition of congestive heart failure. Another important observation not exactly linked to stages is a major shift between stroke types: haemorrhagic stroke declines while ischemic stroke emerges (Lawlor et al. 2002) .",

In other cases propositions are well-formulated and corroborated by some empirical evidence. Omran, starting from his very first publication, continuously mentioned social disparities in mortality as well as the driving forces listed above but he did not provide a theoretical framework for the application of these in connection with particular mortality or disease patterns specific for single countries or population sub-groups. McKeown (1976a McKeown ( , b, 2009 McKeown and Record 1962) studied the disappearance of infectious diseases in industrialising England and formulated his famous nutrition hypothesis. Detecting a time-lag between the almost complete disappearance of numerous infectious diseases, and a very notable drop in tuberculosis mortality, before the discovery of the appropriate treatment methods (mostly antibiotic drugs), he concluded that the major cause of decreasing mortality was the improvement in the living conditions and, in particular, the nutritional status of the population during the nineteenth century.

Other infections, by contrast, are \"quick\" enough not to allow time for the host (the human body) to develop resistance and they kill in a short time; consequently, they can be considered \"nondiscriminative\". Several infectious diseases, such as smallpox and mumps, have been observed to change over the centuries, as their originally \"non-discriminative\" nature turned into \"discriminative\". It is still unclear if the changing nature of some formerly fatal diseases is due to increased community-level resistance to those diseases or merely to the changing nature of the disease-scape.

According to historical demographers, excess deaths were indeed connected to the availability of food, though this relationship was largely influenced by the effectiveness of supportive networks (Bengtsson et al. 2004) , which helped to mitigate the effect of economic hardships (e.g. famine). Regarding the plague outbreaks in London, it was observed that the locus of epidemics moved from the central, relatively wealthy parishes to the poorer suburban ones during the seventeenth century. Overall, it is likely that social disparities existed in the era of infectious diseases, though their importance might have changed over time, partly due to factors that operated independently of social organisation and human activity and partly due to greater awareness and ability to cope among the wealthy (Slack 1989; Hall 2008) .",

These experiences led to the formulation of the social \"following pattern\" of diseases. Based on the concept of the diffusion of innovation, Pearson (2003) suggested an \"adoption theory\": population groups with higher education and/or better income adopt new ideas, products and behavioural patterns more readily. Once a risk factor is recognised, it first becomes public knowledge among those with higher social status, mediated by health education or mass media.

Resources include money, knowledge, power, prestige and interpersonal relationships. Fundamental causes act, according to the proponents of this idea, when new diseases, new risk factors or new knowledge on risk factors emerge or new medical technologies are introduced (Link and Phelan 1995) . In these cases living conditions and access to resources act directly to grant or restrict different groups' access to, and application of, the new technology.

Mortality developments have diverged significantly since then. The latest additions to the concept of epidemiological transition provide no direct guidance for understanding overall mortality trends and educational inequalities in mortality. Detailed knowledge has accumulated on the changes in mortality profiles in developed high-income countries. Mortality trends, especially the burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases, are widely discussed with regard to low income countries. Industrialized middle-income countries seem to be neglected in the discussion of the epidemiological transition. In order to fill this gap, first we examine the applicability of one of the previously outlined theories that focus primarily on other regions of the world: the plausible \"following\" hypothesis. The higher overall level of mortality as well as the cause of death patterns in Hungary (and other CEE counties), often referred to as \"lagging behind\" those of Western Europe, might be interpreted as the mortality pattern of a society in which large population segments who are \"lagging behind\" produce an overall \"delayed\" cause-of-death pattern and large mortality inequalities at the same time. If this proposal were true and meaningful, one would observe the same mortality dynamics for the more and the less advantaged segments of the population but with some time lag regarding the latter group. Existing data allow us to examine these processes by education only: I shall therefore compare the mortality development of the less and the more educated Hungarian adults. As a contrast I also examine the applicability of another popular branch of theories known as risk behavioural factor approaches, in particular, the possible role of nutrition in shaping cause-of-death pattern differences.",

Group 2 encompassed all other diseases, except the external causes: injuries, homicide and suicide. Looking at a large number of countries over shorter or longer observational periods (from 1950 to 2000) and taking into account total mortality and wealth (as measured by GDP), Salomon and Murray (2002) found no consistent relationship between external causes and total mortality or wealth, and we decided therefore to leave them out of the present analysis.",

For Group 1 causes, the identification of nutrition-related, pulmonary or maternal causes of death is not problematic. The large group of 'infectious and parasitic diseases', as the International Classification of Diseases calls it, was much more difficult to break down into smaller and meaningful causes of death, because if anything is clear from the literature, it is that infectious diseases are generally declining but they still vary significantly by country. Therefore we decided to select all those causes for which more than 100 cases were found for each year during the period between 1971 and 2008. This procedure resulted in a list of one disease: tuberculosis. We also added the \"new diseases\" such as HIV/AIDS and newly recognised and antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases. These categories turned out to be almost empty. In practice, the study also includes a number of infectious diseases which are traditionally classified under pulmonary diseases (such as influenza, pneumonia) or other major disease groups (peptic ulcer, appendicitis), or whose coding in some periods overlaps other broad cause-of-death groups (meningitis, enteritis).",

A further distinction was made by major risk factors, including not only smoking, excessive drinking and obesity, but also environmental and occupational exposures (for a short summary see Table 4 .1).

            "text": "There are three known methods to deal with the changes of ICD coding system. The first one, the \"double or bridge coding\" would require coding death in a certain period according to both the outgoing and the new coding systems. This task was carried out only in 2005 for the Hungarian mortality data. The second method follows the exact matching of the disease categories by four-digit coding (Mesl\u00e9 and Vallin 1996) . This method was partly used in this study but only for some specific causes of death. After establishing the coding we followed a third method of fitting the curves (Janssen and Kunst 2004) but applying a simpler method than they did. 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 Fitting coefficients were calculated by causes of death, but always for the entire population. The same coefficients were used to fit curves for those with lower and higher educational background. The values of the coefficients, listed in the Appendix, provide an overview about the reliability of the estimated time series : the closer the coefficients are to 1, the higher the reliability. No fitting was applied in the case of those causes which were too small to calculate standardized rates or for those which showed outliers \"too often\", such as influenza. Overall mortality trends were similarly not fitted ( Fig. 4.1) . We now turn to consider the relation between the two estimated mortality time series for groups with lower and higher education. For certain causes of death, almost exclusively in those years when the annual number of deaths is very low, it was not possible to determine definitive relations since the low number of deaths did not allow for standardisation, so fitting was also not applied. Therefore the general trends of overall mortality due to these causes are difficult to establish. This fact is well illustrated in the case of obesity. From this cause less than 20 deaths were reported annually between 1979 and 2004, but about 200 in the following 4 years. As for inequalities, a clearer picture emerges from the distribution of the number of deaths: most of them appeared among the less educated. Deaths due to nutritional anaemia, malnutrition and obesity, as well as maternal death almost exclusively happened among those with lower education.",

The classification of the relations rested on a simplified view of the time series. Given that we worked with estimated values in the classification, the dynamics represented by the time series were the focus. The time series were broken down to linear (growing, stagnating or declining) phases and the classification was based on the relationship between the sequences of these phases by causes of death, presented by the two mortality time series. Time series were broken down into phases using join-point regression analysis, with software provided by the National Cancer Institute of the United States. 1 This regression is for analysing trends and the software fits data in the simplest possible sequence of linear trends which are connected by the join-points. First a linear trend for the overall period is fitted, then trends with a growing number of joint-points are also fitted and their significances are tested against the Null-hypothesis (e.g. having 0 join-points). The tests of significance are based on a Monte Carlo permutation test. The breakdown of the time series was successful in most of the cases, though the method applied involves some uncertainties. The location of the join-points is provided together with confidence intervals, which were often very wide, covering even 8-10 years. In the following classification only those periodicities were considered when confidence intervals for the joint points were shorter than 8 years. Uncertainties were taken into account in all those cases when confidence intervals were wider than 3-4 years. The sequences of linear trends and the corresponding set of join-points by cause of death are not given here but are available from the author.",

This classification allows us to investigate the possibility of providing a proper definition of follow-up. In the case of diseases with strongly declining mortality (Type I) the definition of follow-up is not obvious at all. The dynamics of decline did not provide any meaningful definition of follow-up, since for the major diseases of this category (pulmonary tuberculosis, haemorrhagic stroke and cancer of the stomach) the timing of strongly declining and the less strongly declining periods, represented by the mortality of the less and more educated, mostly coincide ( Fig. 4.6) . The existence of sequences of declines with a different pace also means 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 that a definition based simply on when mortality of the less educated reached the mortality level of the better educated also gives no clear-cut answer: for instance, the value of tuberculosis mortality of the more educated in 1983 was reached 2 years later by the less educated, but the values for the more educated in 1988 or in 1996 were reached, by the less educated, only 12 or 9 years later, respectively. In the case of influenza, the level of fluctuation highly exceeds the level of inequalities. For rarer diseases that also belong to this class of causes of death, temporal but irregular high peaks of mortality among the better educated would make it difficult to define a follow-up pattern (Table 4 .2).",

Though it is impressive that the estimated follow-up time is the same for ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke, it is important to mention that these \"scenarios\" are also \"played out\" at different mortality levels. At their maximum values, breast cancer and ischemic stroke mortality of the better educated is 20 % higher and that of acute ischemic heart disease is 40 % higher than those of the less educated, suggesting that follow-up type explanations need to be supplemented for a full understanding. 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 Type V causes of death are characterized by different trends for the two educational groups for the whole of the period (see Fig. 4 .11).

The possibility that these diseases start to decline or strongly decline among the less educated can certainly be hoped for, but the follow-up time would be longer in these cases than our observation period. There is thus no point in laying down a definition for the purpose of this study. Some diseases, typically rare causes of death, could not be classified into the previous types and they are placed into Type VI, represented by Fig. 4 .12. Though a clear follow-up pattern was identified for only three causes of death, there is evidence of some kind of follow-up for a large number of diseases but it is not easily identified. Time lags are usually long, exceeding more than one or two decades, so that while follow-up may provide a vague and partial explanation for mortality developments and the development of inequalities for the chosen relatively short time period, it certainly does not a provide a full picture. Taking a closer look at the onsets of trend changes, it is quite obvious that they cluster in time. Most of the changes occurred in the very first years of the 1980s and around 1990. Both these periods were important turning points, and the two clusters can thus be interpreted as indicators of two diverging trends in living conditions, in the widest possible sense of the term.",

Trends of mortality by education diverge from about the same point of time for a number of causes of death related to the circulatory system: chronic ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, atherosclerosis, other diseases of the veins and arteries and pulmonary heart disease. Causes of death which are possibly nutrition-related, such as cancer of the rectum, acute ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke, also show signs of changing mortality relations by education between 1980 and 1983. Some other causes of death, which are clearly not nutrition-related, such as meningitis, cancer of the liver, cancer of the brain, melanoma, other skin cancer and leukaemia, join this cluster. The most likely interpretation of the existence of this cluster is that these changes reflect the widening inequalities in the quality of diet for the two social groups distinguished by educational level. Alternatively, within the risk-factor oriented explanatory framework, one can argue that all these changes are attributable to diverging trends of excessive alcohol consumption, noting that cirrhosis of the liver, the only cause of death which is clearly related to alcohol consumption, started to emerge a couple of years earlier. Alcohol-related changes are known to have an immediate mortality impact but some possible effects of the divergence in alcohol consumption cannot be ruled out. Altogether, divergence in nutrition seems to provide a more suitable explanatory framework.",

Smoking-related causes, such as cancer of the larynx and cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung, clearly dominate this cluster, joined by some other diseases such as colon, pancreas, kidney and bladder cancer and valve diseases with other than rheumatic origin. Attributing the evolution of this cluster to the appearance of the divergence in smoking habits in the two educational classes, it is to be noted that this divergence point seems to be more diffused in time than the one related to the divergence in nutrition: trends of important smoking-related causes of death (cancer of the oesophagus) started to diverge a year earlier than 1989, though this cancer type is also influenced by nutrition.",

During the 1980s the maturation of the \"second economy\" partly confused this relationship. In this period the state made some form of economic activities free from its direct control; therefore, in this sector (especially in agriculture) a limited market economy developed. Social status was distributed along two axes: in the formal economy, in which income and education were correlated, creating very mild income inequalities, and in the informal economy, in which education and income did not correlate strongly (Kolosi 1987) . Since the emergence of the free market economy following 1990, the correlation of income and education has become stronger and stronger, just as in most European countries (T\u00f3th 2005) . This, coupled with the lack of a significant improvement in GDP, led to widening social inequalities and the extension of poverty.",

Limited exchange with other state socialist countries existed but imports were mainly limited to a small amount of tropical fruits. Domestic products, however, were satisfactory for domestic demand. Agriculture had developed into one of the leading ones in Europe and from the 1960's there was no food shortage in Hungary. The distribution of food was rather even and quality differences by education hardly existed. During the 1980s, with the growth of the \"second economy\", food provision varied and prices were already partly market-driven. The better-off could use their resources to purchase better quality food and these provisions were available to a large share of the population, but obviously not for everyone. Low food prices, together with energy prices which were still subsidized, made it possible for a larger proportion of the population to buy food of satisfactory quality. In the countryside, \"around-the-house\" agricultural activity was widespread, producing mostly for the household (occasionally producing for the market, too). During the 1980's the proportion of food grown \"around-the-house\" was estimated at 40 % of the overall food consumed (KSH 2009) .",

Open trade relations provided a great variety of available food, while domestic production, including around-the house output, started to decline. Food prices relative to income represented a greater and greater share of household expenditure and competed with rising energy costs. Around-the-house agricultural production, which had been characteristic for many households for decades, halved in less than a decade: its share in overall food consumption of 20 % in 2000 had shrunk to 10 % by 2008 (KSH 2009). As a result of these processes, the availability of quality food has been shrinking for an ever growing proportion of the population. Domestic agricultural production, however, started to recover in the last years of our observation period, as the states that joined the European Union in 2004 came to benefit from the unified European Agricultural Policy.",

Major changes in human nutrition have also been described, characterized by a growth in sugar and animal source food intake (Popkin 2006) . In the context of wealthier countries, the poorer nutritional habits of the less educated is usually understood in the context of lack of knowledge, forced habits by tradition or lack of awareness due to putative or real economic interests. In the case of poor countries the phenomena is understood in the context of absolute deprivation and poverty. Several facts indicate that none of these scenarios are appropriate for middle income countries. Hungarian household surveys, for instance, indicate that the amount of sugar and sweetened beverages consumed is much lower in low income households than in households with higher income. The difference in this respect between the lowest and the highest income quintile households was fivefold in 2008 2 . Some features of the differences in food consumption, however, run parallel with the pattern of the Western countries, such as the similar levels of pork consumption of households with different income and the large gaps in poultry, fruit and vegetable consumption. Relatively high pork intake is the only fact which would suggest that tradition also plays some role in forming nutrition patterns. Differences in fruit and vegetable consumption fluctuate and depend on yearly prices (Polg\u00e1r 2005; KSH 2009 ) so there is good reason to attribute these differences to the decline of around the house production and the lack of financial resources. Food intake differences by education can largely be explained by rising poverty among the less educated and the changes in the system of food production and pricing.",

These data refer to the years around 1990. Publicly available raw data of the second European Quality of Life Survey 3 (2007) indicate that the question of food quality is still relevant in CEE and Baltic countries. For the only directly foodrelated question (\"Can you afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day if you want it?\") no more than 10 % of the population gave a negative answer in West European countries, whereas this proportion was around 25 % in most CEE and Baltic countries and in Greece, and even higher in some countries such as Slovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary (31, 38 and 42 %, respectively) 4 . The same question was included in the same year in the European Statistics on Income and Living Condition survey and released results (Ward et al. 2009 ) suggest that that survey yielded a similar picture: no more than 12 % of the population in Western Europe was affected and 15 %-37 % in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Baltic countries (except for Estonia, Romania and Bulgaria).",

Rising income inequalities and the application of a global pricing system, however, seem to lead to similar levels of mortality inequalities in these countries, though the composition of over-mortality by cause differs (Leinsalu et al. 2009 ). CEE and Baltic countries, therefore, probably share more common features than differences in this respect. The generalization of the findings for the whole region of \"Eastern Europe\", however, seems less fruitful, allowing for the fact that the CEE and Baltic countries have had consistently lower income inequalities than countries of the Former Soviet Union other than the Baltic countries.

The ratio of these two values provided a coefficient with which we fitted the values for the period between 1996 and 2004 in order to have a continuous time trend. This procedure was repeated twice to fit the values taken in the period between 1971 and 1978 and between 1979 and 1995.
