Among those efforts, cleaning and disinfecting public areas have become important tasks and they should be automated in future smart cities. To contribute in this direction, this paper proposes a coverage path planning algorithm for a spraying drone, an unmanned aerial vehicle that has mounted a sprayer/sprinkler system, to disinfect areas. State-ofthe-art planners consider a camera instead of a sprinkler, in consequence, the expected coverage will differ at running time because the liquid dispersion is different from a camera's projection model. In addition, current planners assume that the vehicles can fly outside the target region; this assumption can not be satisfied in our problem, because disinfections are performed at low altitudes. Our method presents i) a new sprayer/sprinkler model that fits a more realistic coverage volume to the drop dispersion and ii) a planning * algorithm that efficiently restricts the flight to the region of interest avoiding potential collisions in bounded scenes. The algorithm has been tested in several simulation scenes, showing that it is effective and covers more areas with respect to other two approaches in the literature. Note that the proposal is not limited to disinfection applications, but can be applied to other ones, such as painting or precision agriculture.",

First of all, the UAV has a camera mounted. Then, it captures images from the ROI. Later, to perform the polygon coverage, the algorithm generates a back-and-forth movement or zigzag motion, the algorithm computes the distances between two straight movements using the overlap and the camera footprint. Finally, it returns a path that minimizes the number of UAV turns. Keller et al. [13] planned G 2 feasible paths for a UAV provided with a camera by concatenating G 2 curves in order to achieve persistent surveillance missions. An augmented A* algorithm was used to find a cycle sequence for the surveillance ROI This sequence was used in a B-spline curve generation algorithm to develop smooth paths that satisfy curvature constraints. For the same task, Xiao et al. [14] proposed a path planning algorithm based on the continuous updating of the virtual regional field and its local gradients. This virtual field incorporated a Boolean function which contains the information of the target regions and the obstacle information that forms a logical map. When a nonzero gradient at each point is in the regional field, the UAV finds the following target regions. Also, Stefas et al. [15] introduced an autonomous aerial system on a multi-rotor UAV navigating on an orchard for crop inspection. With a stereo camera yield data was collected from the ROI. For this, components for the UAV navigation, obstacle detection and avoidance based on vision, and CPP were developed. The autonomous aerial system used a global planner to enter, exit, and navigate to the next tree, also integrates a local planner to navigate on the tree rows. By their part, Freitas et al. [16] combined area coverage planning with path planning for biological pest control by releasing capsules with a UAV. The locations to release the capsules in the infected areas were calculated using the hexagon as base geometry. The capsule was placed only if its center was within the infected areas. Then, a capsule was placed in the center of mass of each remaining sub-polygon of the previous step, whereas the path planning was achieved with ant colony optimization, guided local search, and Lin-Kernighan algorithms.

[12] proposed a rotating calipers path planner that computes the full path to cover a convex ROI from a 2D perspective for disaster management or precision agriculture. The drone carried a pinhole camera during the mission and took photos of the ROI. The algorithm iteratively adds waypoints by intersecting a line with the ROI's polygon. The algorithm requires parameters such as the polygon, an initial vertex, an adjacent vertex, an antipodal vertex, and the distance between flight lines. Furthermore, Skorobogatov et al. [18] presented an algorithm open-source to divide any convex and non-convex polygon area into multiple parts, including any number of no-fly zones. Later, trajectories for the UAV were assigned. For the task, the UAV took pictures that were joined to obtain a complete map after a flight. The algorithm had as input a polygon defining the ROI, the initial positions of the UAV, the mission parameters, and a convex divisor function based on Hert and Lumelsky algorithm.

Each UAV needed to maintain connectivity with at least another UAV to avoid being isolated in the network. Then, a framework based on reinforcement learning was introduced to control each UAV. The UAVs were trained using environment state information, with the objective being to maximize the coverage for each vehicle, maximize the geographical fairness of all considered POIs or service points, and minimize total power consumption without leaving the edge of the area using a reward function.",

Avoiding potential collisions is one of the main features of the planner, since its application is oriented to low altitude missions.

With respect to traveling distance, our method computes a larger path since it performs a final tour around the polygon to cover missed areas.",

            "text": "mission assignment scheme for the farmland spraying problem by using multi-quadcopters. To solve the problem a mathematical model for the mission assignment and a sequential quadratic programming method to obtain the optimal solution were used. Thus, quadcopters can spray pesticides covering the farmland, but spraying is prohibited over areas covered bydifferent quadcopters. Phung et al. [20] formulated the inspection path planning problem as an extended Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a UAV. They introduced a discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm using deterministic initialization, random mutation, and edge exchange to resolve the problem. The UAV has a CCD camera to detect potential defects or damages in the inspected area and, then, find the shortest path for the inspection of the planar surface. They used parallel computing for the velocity, position, and aptitude of the particles. The parallel program was implemented on a Jetson board mounted on the UAV using the MAVLink protocol. Also, Vasquez et al. [11] introduced a CPP method addressing disjoint areas based on the rural postman problem. The problem was resolved by optimizing the order of visits and computing the back-and-forth pattern. They converted the convex polygon into a reduced graph, and they treated the problem as the TSP, solving it by implementing a genetic algorithm. Finally, to compute the back-and-forth pattern, they found the visiting order, sorted the polygons and the set of vertices through their planner proposed. Muliawan et al. [9] proposed a path planning approach for a UAV to carry out the spraying process in a plantation. A Modified Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for the spraying task. The spraying process is carried out depending on the severity of disease of the plantation, which ranges from moderate to low. Recently, Gonzalez et al.",

First, the method establishes the distance between flight lines, \u03b4, as two times the foot print radius. By setting \u03b4 = 2r, we guarantee that there is no gaps between flight of lines. Unlike previous literature [10], we do not require overlap between flight lines since we assume that a single exposition to the spray is enough for disinfecting the area. Second, the ROI's polygon is eroded by a circular kernel of diameter equal to r.Fig. 5a shows an example of the original polygon and the result of the erosion. The new polygon is called M and it facilitates the planning given that its frontiers can be reached by the UAV without collision. In addition, the erosion diameter is equal to r because when the drone reaches the frontier of M , the footprint is touching the frontier of M . Then, we use a modified version of the rotating calipers path planner (RCPP) [12] for computing a path, \u03c1, that covers M . Fig. 5b shows the path computed with the RCPP for the eroded polygon. RCPP optimizes the flight of lines direction so that it gets the optimal path in linear time w.r.t. the number of vertices in the polygon. In our implementation, we connect flight lines over the frontier of M , unlike the original method where the flight lines are connected by perpendicular sections, such perpendicularity might lead the UAV outside M , in consequence the drone could collide with the environment. Finally, we modify the computed path by adding a tour of the M vertices before e, this tour covers some areas left in the path \u03c1 which is an implicit defect",

The first of the compared methods is the proposed by Choset el at.[51], where vertical back-and-forth paths are computed to cover the regions. The second compared method is the oneproposed by Torres et al. [10]; in that method, the flight lines are oriented perpendicularly to the minimum polygon width. For the comparison, we have performed a statistical analysis where several polygons of different shapes are tested with each method. In detail, we randomly create five polygons for each shape from a set of eight shapes. The set of shapes includes polygons from three vertices to ten vertices. In consequence, 120 tests were carried out in real-time simulations. The polygons used in the experiments have random shapes but the num-Examples of the polygons that were tested and their corresponding paths with the proposed method. The polygons are drawn in dotted blue lines and the paths are drawn in solid black lines. Each polygon is one of five random polygons that where created for a given shape. The shapes include polygons from three vertices to ten vertices.ber of vertices is set by the user. Their shapes are random variations of regular polygons. Let us define a regular n-sided polygon as a polygon with n vertices and n sides that is equiangular and equilateral; in addition, the radius is the distance between each vertex and the center. The variation consists of drawing the vertices of the polygon counter-clockwise but adding a random amount to the angle w.r.t. the previous vertex (this eliminates the equiangular property) and to the radius. The random variables are drawn from a uniform distribution between zero and a maximum amount. In par-ticular, these experiments have a target radius of 20 meters with a maximum radius variation of 1 meter and a maximum angle variation of 1 radian. InFig. 6, we display some examples of the polygons that were tested.",

Later, the coordinates define the ROI. Next, the coordinates are converted from geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude, and height) to NED coordinates (North, East, and Down). The erosion function in the algorithm is in charge of reducing the border of the area that will depend on the radius of the sensor, and once it has the area, it continues to the creation of the flight lines. However, it is required to visit all the areas so that as much as possible is covered. The algorithm adds the nodes of all the polygon vertices to cover areas without visiting. Then a conversion from NED coordinates to geodetic coordinates is performed again to add these coordinates to a waypoints file. The Gazebo simulator uses the waypoints file to carry out the path over the court.Subsequently, for this simulation, SITL was used in collaboration with the Gazebo 9 simulator to see the area in 3D. In this simulation, the Quadcopter3DR Iris was used. The height set during the simulation was 10 meters. The speed of the drone is 2m/s. The starting point is set with the coordinates 19.467468, -99.193345. Additionally, a basketball court model made for Gazebo allows to evaluate the behavior of the UAV in a virtual environment. It was observed in the experiment that the vehicle covered most of the basketball court area without going out of the contour, thus avoiding some collision. In total, it covered an area of 59.4966 meters in a time of 3:46 minutes. The reader can see the execution of this experiment in the following video: https://youtu.be/2ERkEagnCEM.",
