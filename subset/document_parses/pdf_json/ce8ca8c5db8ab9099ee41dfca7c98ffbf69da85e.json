            "text": "Recent anthropogenic climate warming makes understanding species vulnerability to changing climates one of the most pressing issues in modern biology. A cornerstone for understanding the distribution and associated ecological impacts of climate change on organismal fitness is the concept of the ecological niche, which describes a hyperspace with permissive conditions and requisite resources under which an organism, population, or species has positive fitness (Hutchinson 1957 2016), it has been developed largely independently from niche-based studies. Yet, characterizing the TPC is essentially a way to mechanistically quantify a species' thermal niche. Since the TPC describes the detailed relationship between temperature and fitness, the concept may actually be more informative than that of the thermal niche, which is typically defined as the range of temperatures over which organisms occur in nature (i.e. thermal niche width) (Huey & Stevenson 1979; Hillaert et al. 2015 Burying beetles (Silphidae, Nicrophorus) are ideal for investigating how social interactions influence both fundamental and realized TPCs because the potentially antagonistic effects of interspecific competition and intraspecific cooperation on the realized TPC can be studied simultaneously. Burying beetles rely on vertebrate carcasses for reproduction and often face intense intra-and interspecific competition for using these limiting resources (Pukowski 1933; Scott 1998; Rozen et al. 2008 Here, we extend classic ecological niche theory by introducing the concepts of fundamental and realized TPCs. We first construct a theoretical model by using a hypothetical TPC to predict how interspecific competition influences the width and optimal temperature of realized TPCs in order to provide a general understanding of the relationship between fundamental and realized TPCs. We then describe a series of laboratory and field experiments designed to test the predicted relationship between fundamental and realized TPCs in the Asian burying beetle Nicrophorus nepalensis ( Fig. 1) . We began our empirical work by measuring locomotor and breeding performance without interspecific competitors in the laboratory and field to determine N. nepalensis's fundamental TPC. We then quantified beetle breeding performance in the presence of interspecific competitors, mainly blowflies (Putman 1978; Putman 1983; Scott 1994; Sun et al. 2014) , to determine the beetle's realized TPC. Finally, we used a group size manipulation in the presence of interspecific competitors in the field to explicitly examine the role of intraspecific cooperation and interspecific competition on the beetle's realized TPC. Experimentally distinguishing between fundamental and realized TPCs will not only serve as a starting point for better understanding the relationships between direct and indirect drivers of organismal performance and fitness, but also for better predicting responses to climate change as the earth continues to warm.",

We checked traps and collected beetles on the fourth day after traps were set. A maximum of two males and two females from each trap were brought back to the lab to reduce any influence of capture on the population structure in the field. In every generation, we established at least 20 families, approximately 600 individuals in total, to maintain population structure within the lab. To ensure that beetles in the lab strains were unrelated to each other, we used beetles collected from different traps. We then put one female and one male in a 20 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 13 cm box with 10 cm of soil and a rat carcass (75 \u00b1 7.5 g).",

We then placed the pair with a mouse carcass (75 \u00b1 7.5 g) under each temperature condition in a transparent plastic container (21 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 13 cm with 10 cm of soil depth) for two weeks.

We found that N. nepalensis in cooperative groups had an optimal breeding temperature (i.e. realized TPC) of 15.6\u2103, which is identical to their optimal temperature from the fundamental TPC in the lab. In contrast, the optimal breeding temperature of solitary pairs was 14.1\u2103, similar to that of the realized TPC in the field (Fig. 5 , group size \u00d7 temperature interaction, \u03c7 2 2 = 6.78, p= 0.033, n = 328; for large groups, \u03c7 2 2 = 9.49, p=0.009, n = 162; for small groups, \u03c7 2 2 = 18.41, p<0.001, n = 166).

We show that the realized TPC provides a way to quantify how temperature mediates species interactions, which also influence organismal fitness. Thus, the realized TPC extends the realized thermal niche concept, which only considers the temperature ranges in which a species can likely occur in N. nepalensis in warmer environments. Therefore, conserving high population densities, especially at lower elevations, will be crucial for N. nepalensis to compete against blowflies under increased climate warming. By examining the relationship between cooperative behavior and interspecific competition, our study thus helps understand the pressing issue of how habitat destruction affects the vulnerability of social organisms to climate change (Travis 2003) . When population density influences the likelihood of intraspecific cooperation in social species, habitat destruction will not only decrease habitat availability but also weaken a species' competitive ability against interspecific competitors, which in turn will lower the realized thermal performance of social organisms.",

Our study shows that employing the concepts of fundamental and realized TPCs can help us predict the ecological impacts of climate change, especially because environmental change will likely reshuffle ecological communities and alter the strength of species interaction (Alexander et al. 2016 ). The importance of biotic interactions in shaping species distributions and community composition is intuitively obvious, yet historically has been difficult to quantify. We believe that the concept of realized TPCs can help fill this important knowledge gap and, ultimately, deepen our understanding of the ecological impact of climate change.",

            "text": "Colwell & Rangel 2009). More than a half century ago, Hutchinson(Hutchinson 1957) distinguished the fundamental niche-characterized by abiotic environmental measures like temperature and precipitation-from the realized niche-characterized by biological interactions like competition and predation. Although numerous studies since then have used the relationship between a species' distribution and the climate in which it occurs to estimate a species' fundamental niche (Kearney & Porter 2009; Quintero & Wiens 2013; Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re et al. 2015), a growing number of studies have also employed theoretical, observational, or experimental approaches to evaluate the detailed mechanisms (e.g. physiological limits), demographic factors, and species interactions that shape a species' fundamental and realized niches (Nilsson-\u00d6rtman et al. 2013; Estay et al. 2014). In general, differentiating direct (abiotic factors) from indirect effects (biotic interactions) on niche width is critical to understanding species-specific responses to climate change. Ultimately, generating a complete understanding of a species' ecological niche not only requires understanding how abiotic and biotic factors interact to affect organismal performance and fitness, but also identifying the detailed mechanisms that shape differences in the fundamental and realized niches. The concept of the thermal performance curve (TPC) was first developed to study how body temperature affects ectotherms' physiological responses and behaviors (Kearney & Porter 2009; Quintero & Wiens 2013; Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re et al. 2015). Although the TPC concept has received increasing attention in studies of how warming temperatures influence organismal fitness (Clusella-Trullas et al. 2011; Sinclair et al.",

There were several holes on the small container's side wall that allowed beetles to move freely between the two containers. A 2 x 2 cm iron mesh was placed around the top of the large container's wall to let flies access the carcass but to keep out larger animals that might scavenge the carcass. Small, non-cooperative groups contained one male and one female, whereas large, cooperative groups contained three males and three females (Liu et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020). We captured the local beetles using the same hanging pitfall traps described above, and then conducted two group size treatments at each site. Based on our previous work exploring the natural pattern of arrival times, we released the marked beetles into the experimental device 1, 2 and 3 days after the trials began at elevations of 1700-2000 m (low), 2000-2400 m (intermediate) and 2400-2800 m (high), respectively (for details, see (Sun et al. 2014).",

The physical characteristics of the parents (age, pronotum width, and mass) were treated as covariates. The outcome (1 = success, 0 = failure) was fitted as a binomial response term to test the difference in the probabilities of interest (burial or non-burial) under different temperatures. For locomotor performance, the outcome (1 = flying, 0 = not flying) was fitted as a binomial response term to test for a difference in the probability of interest (flying or not) under different temperatures conditions. The relationship of temperature difference (body temperature minus ambient temperature) was fitted as a Gaussian response to different temperature conditions. Finally, the optimum temperature of the TPC was calculated by taking the derivative of the regression line that described the relationship between temperature and the likelihood of breeding successfully. To estimate TPC breadth, we calculated the 95% confidence interval of the regression line. All statistical analyses were performed in the R 3.0.2 statistical software package (Team. 2018).Theoretical modelWe employed the following commonly-used thermal performance curve (TPC) function(Deutsch et al. 2008;Vasseur et al. 2014) to describe the fundamental TPCs of two competing species with strategies similar to our empirical system.

Thus, to identify fundamental TPCs, it is crucial to perform both lab and field experiments to understand the exact relationship between body and ambient temperature, as well as how realistic environmental conditions (e.g. temperature variation, humidity, or precipitation) influence the fundamental TPC. For example, TPCs are often considered to be left-skewed for physiological reasons (e.g. the response of thermoregulation proceeds faster at higher temperatures) (Woodin et al. 2013; Huey & Pianka 2018), but our results and those of many other studies have shown that TPCs can be diverse in their shape (Dell et al. 2011; Monaco et al. 2017). Although we show that variation in the shape of TPCs can be due to interspecific competition, other types of biotic interactions, including mutualistic and host-parasites interactions (Cohen et al. 2017), should also be carefully considered and compared when quantifying fundamental TPCs. Ultimately, separating and experimentally quantifying fundamental and realized thermal performance in the field and lab will be critical for understanding how both biotic and abiotic factors interact to influence organismal fitness, particularly in an era of rapid climate change.",

            "text": "). In other words, the TPC concept not only describes thermal niche width, it also quantifies an organism's optimal temperature and how fitness varies with changes intemperature. In contrast, most TPC studies focus largely on what amounts to the fundamental TPC and do not explicitly consider biotic interactions (Dillon et al. 2010; Gunderson et al. 2016; Swaddle & Ingrassia 2017). The few TPC studies that have considered biotic interactions have almost all focused on predator-prey interactions (Ockendon et al. 2014; Gibert et al. 2016). To the best of our knowledge, no study has differentiated between fundamental and realized TPCs, nor experimentally quantified a species' realized TPC in the context of interspecific competition, despite the fact that ecologists have long acknowledged that interspecific competition is a key driving force shaping a species' realized niche (Schoener 1983; Eurich et al. 2018; Freeman et al. 2019).",

Blowfly maggots also grow faster and digest carcasses more quickly at higher temperatures (Donovan et al. 2006; Kotz\u00e9 et al. 2016). In addition to interspecific competition, intraspecific cooperative behavior among beetles may also modulate their realized TPC. Previous studies have shown that cooperative carcass preparation and burial enables beetles to outcompete blowflies and expand their thermal niche to warmer environments (Sun et al. 2014; Chan et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020).",
