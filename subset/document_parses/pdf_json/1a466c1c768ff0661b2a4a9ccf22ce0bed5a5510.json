On the other hand, it can contain specific antibodies that could modulate a possible newborn infection by SARS-CoV-2. Main issue: A 32-year-old pregnant woman, gestational age 37 and 3/7 weeks, was admitted with a flu-like syndrome caused by COVID-19. The female newborn was appropriate for gestational age, with a birth weight of 2,890 g, length 48 cm, and head circumference 34 cm. Management: The mother-infant dyad remained in the rooming-in unit during hospitalization, exclusively breastfeeding and following World Health Organization recommendations for contact and airway precautions. On the 3rd day after delivery, two mother's milk samples (3 and 5 mL) were collected by hand expression. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min twice consecutively to separate fat, which was removed, and the remaining material was transferred to another tube to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A and Immunoglobulin G (ELISA, Kit EUROIMMUN AG, Luebeck, Germany). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin A was detected in the two samples evaluated, whose values were 2.5 and 1.9, respectively. No anti-SARSCoV-2 immunoglobulin G was detected. The exclusively-breastfed infant remained well through 45 days of age.",

Descri\u00e7\u00e3o do caso cl\u00ednico: Uma gestante de 32 anos, idade gestacional 37 3/7 semanas, foi admitida para realiza\u00e7\u00e3o do parto, com s\u00edndrome gripal causada por COVID-19. O seu rec\u00e9m-nascido, do sexo feminino, foi adequado para idade gestacional, pesou 2.890 gramas, comprimento 48 cm e circunfer\u00eancia craniana de 34 cm. Tratamento: A m\u00e3e e seu rec\u00e9m-nascido permaneceram em alojamento conjunto durante a hospitaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, realizando aleitamento materno exclusivo, conforme as recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es da Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Mundial da Sa\u00fade em rela\u00e7\u00e3o as precau\u00e7\u00f5es de contato e prote\u00e7\u00e3o de vias a\u00e9reas para nutrizes infectadas pelo COVID-19. No terceiro dia ap\u00f3s o nascimento, coletou-se, por express\u00e3o manual, duas amostras de leite materno (2 e 5 mL) que foram centrifugadas por 10 min por duas vezes, para remo\u00e7\u00e3o da gordura e separa\u00e7\u00e3o do material remanescente, que foi transferido para outro tudo para dosagem de anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG (ELISA, Kit EUROIMMUN AG, Luebeck, Germany). Como resultado, foi detectado nas duas amostras de leite materno, a presen\u00e7a de IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2, cujos valores foram 2,5 e 1,9; respectivamente.

Conclusion: A presen\u00e7a de IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 no leite materno de mulher infectada pela COVID-19 pode se relacionar a prote\u00e7\u00e3o contra a transmiss\u00e3o e gravidade da doen\u00e7a nos rec\u00e9m-nascidos.

IgA produced by the maternal mammary glands undergoes proteolytic cleavage to release secretory IgA, permitting transport into human milk (Brandtzaeg, 2010) . While secretory IgA is responsible for 80%-90% of the total immunoglobulins in human milk, only about 10% is absorbed in the intestines and transferred to the bloodstream. Its action is fundamentally within the gastrointestinal tract (Brandtzaeg, 2010) .",

Breastfed infants show a 47%, 63%, and 57% reduction in the risk of death from infectious diseases, acute diarrheal disease, and hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases, respectively (Victora et al., 2016) . This can be explained by the complex immunology of human milk, including carbohydrates, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, cells, and immunoglobulins. In this case study, the infant remained exclusively breastfeeding and had no symptoms related to COVID-9 infection, despite the participant's symptomatic infection. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the participant's milk may have been protective for the infant.",
