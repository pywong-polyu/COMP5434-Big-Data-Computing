Innovative technologies might facilitate the training of healthcare providers and students without direct bedside attendance. 4 There are currently numerous available options for maintaining procedural proficiency, such as webinars, virtual simulation and videoconferences. 5 6 Besides supporting procedural proficiency, recording and reviewing neonatal stabilisation provides numerous educational advantages. 7 8 However, allowing medical students and trainees to benefit from this opportunity during the COVID-19 pandemic can be challenging. Furthermore, providers attending video-based observations on neonatal stabilisation anticipated that reviewing other procedures at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), most importantly, neonatal intubations, would also be beneficial for improving the quality of neonatal care. 7 The use of modern eye-tracking glasses with the option of real-time recording and streaming has recently emerged as a revolutionary method in procedural education.

There were two groups of participants: (A) proceduralists, who wore eye-tracking glasses during procedures, and (B) observers who later watched the procedures as part of a video-based reflection. The procedures included endotracheal intubation, minimally invasive surfactant therapy (MIST), and umbilical catheter insertion. Proceduralists and healthcare professionals present in the room gave their consent for the recording, and parental consent was obtained to use the footage during observations. After providing consent, proceduralists were equipped with mobile eye-tracking glasses (VPS 19, Viewpointsystem, Vienna, Austria). The recording started after glasses calibration according to the manufacturer's recommendations. On the conclusion of the neonatal procedure, each proceduralist filled in a questionnaire to assess eye-tracking glasses' usability throughout said procedure. The neonatal procedures were carried out using the local medical equipment and following the standard operating practices.",

Former studies regarding the feasibility of wearing eye-tracking glasses in real neonatal resuscitation scenarios 17 and simulated neonatal airway management scenarios 14 yielded similar results. Most participants reported that wearing eye-tracking glasses was not disturbing or uncomfortable, in line with previous findings in simulation-based trainings. 14 In another study concerning eyetracking in a paediatric trauma simulation, participants declared tolerating the glasses after a few minutes without being subjectively affected. 13 ",

Eye-tracking technology has been a tool for laparoscopic surgery and the learning process of square knot tying. The firstperson perspective gives trainees the possibility to identify critical areas, memorise the visual attention and adopt the experts' gaze patterns. 18 A study by Brunye et al determined the eye fixation behaviour of experts and novices. 10 Analysing the experts' procedures helped novices and students learn better strategies for successful interventions. Moreover, experts underlined the importance and need for innovative technology in order to offer trainees valuable education 19 in times of COVID-19.",

However, the online group consisted of only eight participants. Increasing this group could be an interesting next step to improve virtual bedside training. During the procedure, the supervisor could guide the trainee while maintaining distance thanks to the first-person view. Observers mentioned many key learning points, such as the overall logistics. In the first videobased reflection, as the proceduralist had to look over his/her shoulder to see the monitor, the staff discussed changing the proceduralist positioning to see the baby and the monitor from the same perspective. Adopting the new positioning in the six following recordings turned out to be more comfortable for the proceduralist and had an immediate effect on the video-based discussion. Furthermore, this technology could have a substantial educational benefit for nursing procedures, especially in single-room NICUs, where it might be more challenging to learn from other colleagues than open bay wards.",

The local NICU team was familiar with regular video-based reflections and was very supportive in creating a safe learning environment, even when conducting remote video-based reflections. However, this may be more challenging in NICUs where it is not common to hold team video-based reflections. Additional (multicentre) studies are needed to show the transfer to other NICUs. Observers also mentioned that the head of the patient was not always visible during intubations. Therefore, we reported the issue to the manufacturer, and the problem was solved within a month. While we did not include audio in our recordings, many observers recommended it for future video reflections. It was also mentioned that recording the vital signs monitor would also be helpful. At the moment, it is not possible to record the first-person view, the videolaryngoscope monitor, as well as the vital monitor with one device. However, the glasses might serve as an alternative view of what the participant is seeing in situations where another technology such as a videolaryngoscope is not available (ie, mouth and pharynx of the patient). A limitation for this at the moment is the fact that the video recording unit is over the eye level, which might make it difficult to see every detail of the pharynx. Therefore, new technology is necessary to improve this aspect and to review point-of-view neonatal procedures. Furthermore, eye-tracking glasses are still very expensive with one-time costs of about \u20ac10.000, depending on the company researchers choose.",
