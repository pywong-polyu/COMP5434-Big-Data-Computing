Earlier identification of covid-19 symptoms can avoid the over illness or death. However, there are several researchers are introduced different methodology to identification of diseases symptoms. But, identification and classification of covid-19 diseases is the difficult task for every researchers and doctors. In this modern world, machine learning techniques is useful for several medical applications. This study is more focused in applying machine learning classifier model as SVM for classification of diseases. By improve the classification accuracy of the classifier by using hyper parameter optimization technique as modified cuckoo search algorithm. High dimensional data have unrelated, misleading features, which maximize the search space size subsequent in struggle to process data further thus not contributing to the learning practise, So we used a hybrid feature selection technique as mRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) algorithm. The experiment is conducted by using UCI machine learning repository dataset. The classifier is conducted to classify the two set of classes such as COVID-19, and normal cases. The proposed model performance is analysed by using different parametric metrics, which are explained in result section.",

These birds do not tend to build their own nest ad lays their eggs in host bird. The bird is more of a parasite of the best known aspect, the cuckoo tend to involve with the host birds, in case if the host finds that these are not their, they might throw it away and delete the home and create a new one. So, each aspect of the egg in the nest tend to state he overall solution. [16] The overall results which are mainly received through these aspects on the current ones and there exist alteration of the same functionalities. Each of the nest tend to contain different eggs and hence CS enable in addressing the various issues and can be applied in structural engineering for effective optimisation. It also enable in application of the reorganisation of expression, task aspects and global optimisation. [17] 1. Each of the bird lays one egg at a given time and also places them in the nest on a random basis. 2. The next generation best nest will be made available with good egg quality. [18] 3. The number and likelihood of pa = [0, 1] are determined by the sum of host nests accessible, and if a hostbird identifies the cuckoo egg, it can either toss it away or leave and create a new nest.
