Here, we study the emergence of the individuals' protective behaviours in response to the spread of a disease by considering two different social attitudes within the same population: concerned and risky. Generally speaking, concerned individuals have a larger risk aversion than risky individuals. To study the emergence of protective behaviours, we couple, to the epidemic evolution of a susceptibleinfected-susceptible model, a decision game based on the perceived risk of infection. Using this framework, we find the effect of the protection strategy on the epidemic threshold for each of the two subpopulations (concerned and risky), and study under which conditions risky individuals are persuaded to protect themselves or, on the contrary, can take advantage of a herd immunity by remaining healthy without protecting themselves, thanks to the shield provided by concerned individuals.",

            "text": "The prevention and control of the spread of communicable diseases have always constituted a fundamental challenge in human societies [1] [2] [3] [4] . Nowadays, the Covid-19 pandemic has spread all over the world and, as of October 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 244 million people, causing around 5 million deaths. Typically, vaccination is one of the most important preventive measures to prevent or reduce virus propagation and, when its availability is limited, one of the most important issues to study is the effectiveness of different kinds of vaccination strategies aimed at cutting off potential chains of transmission and avoiding as many potential deaths as possible [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, when vaccines are unavailable or scarce, it is social behavior attaching to preventive measures, the most effective way to reduce and control the spread of the disease [15] [16] [17] . Such preventive strategies include quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, and the use of prophylactic tools such as face masks. However, most of these behavioral changes and protective measures have associated social and economic costs. Therefore, when their use or application is not subject to law enforcement, regulatory policies or economic support, their application highly depends on an individual decision process. In this scenario, the dynamics of disease spread and the dynamics of individual decision making must be considered as two processes coevolving simultaneously.",

Several studies have applied game theoretical frameworks coupled to epidemic spreading on populations wherein each rational individual tries to maximize his own payoff according to a self evaluation of the cost-benefit ratio associated to protective measures [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Although the first studies on this line constitute a combination of epidemic dynamics with a static game theory [24] , the evolutionary game benchmark provides a better description, since it allows agents to update their strategies by evaluating the most successful one according to the current epidemiological state [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . This framework appears to be the most appropriate when individual decisions evolve in parallel with the development of an epidemic, allowing each individual to adopt the protection strategy that provides the greatest reward based on the perceived health risk [32, 33] .",

For example, some individuals are more concerned about the evolution of the incidence of cases, trying to be as up to date as possible to take action in an appropriate and responsible manner. On the contrary, others behave in a careless and unconcerned manner or, in the worst case, are critical and suspicious of the alarm messages issued by the health authorities.

Thus, faced with the same level of alarm, the first group perceives a much greater risk than the second and is therefore much more likely to take protective measures. To perform our study in a controlled manner, we assume that the partition between subpopulations is constant over time and introduce a parameter that controls the degree of diversity between the two attitudes to the same epidemiological situation. In this way, we show that risky agents start to be protected if the cost of contracting the disease, and the degree of diversity between the two attitudes, exceed certain threshold values. We also show how the fraction of concerned agents can affect the protective and epidemic thresholds of each subpopulation. Finally, we show that herd immunity of risky agents is provided if the number of concerned agents is above a threshold.",

The infectious pathogen spreads from individual to individual following the connections defined by the social graph and according to the dynamical rules of the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) epidemic model, in which agents can be susceptible (S) or infected (I). Thus, a susceptible individual at time t becomes infectious from an infectious neighbor with probability \u03bb while an infectious agent becomes susceptible with probability \u00b5. The classical SIS epidemic model is modified to incorporate the possibility that some agents decide to adopt a prophylactic measure. In particular, we are interested in intermediate measures, such as the use of a mask, that offer partial protection against infection. To this aim, we consider a parameter, \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1], that determines the decrease in the probability of contagion, which is transformed into \u03b3\u03bb when in the encounter between an infectious agent and a susceptible one of the two adopts the prophylactic strategy. Thus, \u03b3 = 0 would imply that the preventive measure is perfect while \u03b3 = 1 means that the measure is completely useless. Similar to [33] , we assume that the preventive mechanism is not increased by the bilateral use of protective measures, and thus the reduction in infectivity is linear, \u03b3\u03bb, rather than quadratic, \u03b3 2 \u03bb, in the case where both individuals (infectious and susceptible) are protected.",

To address the dynamics associated to this individual choice we couple, as in [33] , the SIS epidemic model to a two-strategy Protected-Unprotected (P -N P ) decision game in which agents decide whether or not to adopt a prophylactic measure based on the associated costs and the disease incidence for each strategy. In particular, the choice of whether or not to take the prophylactic measure carries an associated cost and individuals must therefore assess the appropriateness of its use based on their perception of the risk of contagion. To account for the decision process, agents evaluate the strategic choice (P or N P ) based on: (i) the cost of contracting the disease (T ), (ii) the cost of the prophylactic measure (c), and (iii) the risk of contracting the disease, measured through its incidence (i.e. the fraction of infectious individuals I). The evaluation of the contagion risk at each time step is used to compute the expected benefit of each strategy, the so-called payoffs, P p and P np , that in their turn are used to construct the probabilities that drive strategic changes \u0393 p\u2192np and \u0393 np\u2192p . These probabilities change in time according to the epidemic incidence and thus govern the evolution of the strategic partition of the population. The strategic partition strongly influences the epidemic evolution, being the spreading of the pathogen favored when N P strategy dominates or being its propagation mitigated when prophylaxis is FIG. 2.

These groups have a different perception of risk and, therefore, under the same epidemic scenario show different behavioral responses. For example, concerned agents have a higher perception of the cost of contracting the disease than risky individuals (T C > T R ) while the cost associated with protection is perceived as lower by the former than by the latter (c R > c C ). Thus, on one hand, concerned individuals perceive a higher risk associated with the disease and a lower cost of protection so, consequently, they are inclined to adopt prophylactic measures. On the other hand, risk-takers are more relaxed in the face of epidemic alarm and are more likely to take risky decisions. In this paper we assume that the populations of concerned and risky agents remain constant during the dynamics, i.e. neglecting possible changes in risk perception during the course of the epidemic dynamics. In particular we fix a parameter f , the fraction of concerned individuals in the population so that the number of concerned and risky agents are",

The question thus is to what extent the protection provided by concerned agents extends to the risky population. This question is answered by the phase diagram for the fraction of risky agents that are infected (I R np ) as a function of f and \u03bb, shown in Fig. 9 . Apart from the usual epidemic threshold \u03bb c for small values of f the diagram shows a clear transition from healthy to endemic phase when f is varied.
