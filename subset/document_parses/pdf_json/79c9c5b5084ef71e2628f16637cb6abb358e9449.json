During the past decade, there has been an increasing recognition that cardiac surgery patients have different resuscitative needs than other medical and surgical patients who experience inhospital cardiac arrest. The special resuscitative needs of cardiac surgery patients were addressed in the 2021 European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Guidelines for Resuscitation in the section reviewing cardiac arrest in special circumstances and the 2020 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care in special situations [5, 6] . However, it is unknown how widely the guidelines are practiced, or a training protocol is followed in different units in Egypt.

Survey dissemination was targeted to staffing of cardiothoracic departments in various institutes through social media platforms such as mobile messaging applications and emails during the time period between November 2020 and January 2021; this was our preference due to COVID-19 pandemic to allow better reach and in line with social distancing national guidance.
