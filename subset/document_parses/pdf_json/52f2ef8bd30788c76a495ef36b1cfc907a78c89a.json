Although airplane-or bus-related COVID-19 outbreaks were reported in several countries, the evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission in vehicles is limited. 1-3 Here, we report the findings from an investigation of a COVID-19 outbreak occurring following a 4day tour on four buses visited 11 tourist sites around Hokkaido, Japan, in October 2020. The total number of people on the bus tour was 158 (146 participants and 12 staff members): 41 for Bus 1, 39 for Bus 2, 40 for Bus 3 and 38 for Bus 4.",

Those who used Buses 2-4, the staff of the hotels in which the participants stayed, and family members and close friends of the confirmed case were also asked to check their health status after the last exposure. Tests were conducted once and again thereafter if they developed symptoms. We collected information on the health status of all tour participants and close contacts, details of the tour from the local governments and the travel agency and the results of whole genome sequence of some isolates that we could analyze. Relative risk (RR) according to seating positions on the bus was calculated along with the 95% confidence interval (CI). This study was exempt from the requirement for institutional ethics review as it was part of a public health control measures under the Infectious Diseases Control Law in Japan.",

The participants did not get involved in group activities in the hotels but ate breakfast and dinner with group members in the restaurants. They spent most of the time on the bus while wearing masks except when they ate or drank. Bus seats were assigned to each group daily. Body temperature was measured only at the start of the tour and at hotel check-in, but no record was kept. Seating of the cases showed clustering around the primary case on Days 2 and 3 and was grouped in a front-to-back direction ( Figure 1 ). Closeness of seating to the primary case showed that six cases were separated by 3 or 4 rows, and 10 non-infected cases were in the same or a 1-row different position. RRs increased according to the closeness to the primary case ( Table 1 ). The RRs were significantly high on the same side from two rows to six rows on Days 2 and 3 (Table 1) . However, the 2-row rule (within two rows and on both [right/left] sides of the primary case) 4 or the distance from the primary case cannot fully explain many cases.",

This is likely due to the nature of the bus tour, which has a high density of passengers, 6 narrow space, long-duration, poor ventilation and difficulty in wearing proper masks and hand hygiene under these conditions. The bus tour is not just a means of transportation, but it is part of a leisure and passengers enjoyed the scenery, sightseeing spots and food while eating and drinking during tour. High population density is considered to affect reproductive numbers. 6 On the other hand, in circumstances such as high population densities, 6 longduration contact and poor ventilation, airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could occur. 7 Possible airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a vehicle has also been reported. 1,2 ,8 Infection in a front-to-back direction following the airflow in the bus in this study supported this hypothesis. Based on this outbreak and other experience, 9,10 the travel agency introduced a system to check the health status of participants and staff on-site and at their headquarters, restrict ill persons from participation, shorten continuous driving times, keep the air conditioning on continuously at all times during the tour, clean and disinfect the environment inside at each stop and prohibit eating and allow only drinking during the bus tour.",
