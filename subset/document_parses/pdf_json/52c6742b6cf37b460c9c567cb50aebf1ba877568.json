Like others, our gastroenterology (GI) fellowship program at the University of Pennsylvania, as part of an academic medical center, aimed for a rapid response that minimized viral exposure while maintaining clinical coverage and trainee education. We earlier described our program's response and early lessons learned when adapting to the novel virus [1] . Subsequently, the \"new normal\" became a system in which we downsized the inpatient consultation services, embraced virtual forums for educational activities, and minimized fellows participating in endoscopy.",

We also asked fellows on service to document the number of consultations/day at each service, so as to track the trend in volume, and used the huddles to discuss any perceived trends. Another goal with the huddles was to provide a space for qualitative assessment of readiness for change and to maintain a sense of community and dialogue among the fellows. Table 2 summarizes the periods of resurgence. During period 0, Stage 3 Pandemic Emergency Status was declared for all of our ACGME-accredited residency and fellowship programs. All research operations were stopped with the exception of life-sustaining activities at the start of the pandemic. We reduced fellows on the inpatient consultation services and deepened a pool of fellows to be on backup call (jeopardy) for both the GI services and other medicine services, as requested by the department and hospital. To reduce exposure, we divided nightly on-call services so that one fellow was on \"tele-call\" to answer calls from all three hospitals from home without hospital exposure, and the fellow on service was on \"travel-call,\" to be called into the hospital only for urgent procedures. The services were designed with 1-week blocks in order to minimize any impact on scheduling from exposure-related quarantine.",
