The aim of this study was the synthesis and evaluation of in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity for phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin 3-5 as well as an in silico study of new compounds as potential ligands of the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid-spacer peptide 1 (CA-CTD-SP1) as a molecular target of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that 28-diethoxyphosphoryl-3-O-(3 ,3 -dimethylsuccinyl)betulin (compound 3), the phosphate analog of bevirimat (betulinic acid derivative, HIV-1 maturation inhibitor), has IC 50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) equal to 0.02 \u00b5M. Compound 3 inhibits viral replication at a level comparable to bevirimat and is also more selective (selectivity indices = 1250 and 967, respectively). Molecular docking was used to examine the probable interaction between the phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin and C-terminal domain (CTD) of the HIV-1 capsid (CA)-spacer peptide 1 (SP1) fragment of Gag protein, designated as CTD-SP1. Compared with interactions between bevirimat (BVM) and the protein, an increased number of strong interactions between ligand 3 and the protein, generated by the phosphate group, were observed. These compounds might have the potential to also inhibit SARS-CoV2 proteins, in as far as the intrinsically imprecise docking scores suggest.",

Chemical shifts values were reported in parts per million (ppm). Multiplicity was designated as singlet (s), doublet (d), doublet of doublets (dd) and multiplet (m). Infrared spectra (pellets, KBr, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were obtained using an IRAffnity-1 FTIR spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The measurement was recorded in the range of 4000-1000 cm -1 at 295K. High-resolution mass spectra have been measured with Bruker Impact II (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA).

Target macromolecules for molecular docking studies were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/; Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, USA). We used crystal structure of the CA-CTD-SP1 fragment of HIV-1 Gag, SARS-CoV-2 main protein, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (PDB IDs: 5I4T, 5R7Z, 6M71, and 6VYB respectively). Incomplete or missing side chains of CA-CTD-SP1 protein were restored with the SWISS-MODEL Workspace (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Basel, Switzerland) [24] . Geometry optimization of the model was achieved by the optimization protocol in YASARA Energy Minimization Server (http://www.yasara. org/-minimizationserver.htm; YASARA Biosciences GmbH, Vienna, Austria). The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) structure was obtained from PDB (PDB ID: 5R7Z). The native ligand for 5R7Z is N-[2-(5-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]ethanamide (PDB ID: HWH). The region of interest used for Vina docking was defined as all M pro residues within 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 40 \u00c5 of the reference ligand. The homology model of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein catalytic domain was also generated in the SWISS-MODEL workspace [24] . Based on maximum sequence identity (95%), structure with PDB ID 5X29 is detected as the best homologous structure of human SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Geometry optimization of model was done by the optimization protocol in YASARA.

Periodic boundary conditions with an explicit solvent were employed. Parameterization of ligands was conducted using a CGenFF server [31, 32] . All protein and protein-ligand systems have been solvated with TIP3P cubic water box at 15 \u00c5 thickness. To neutralize the system, 0.15 mol/L of NaCl salt was added. Simulation protocol consists of 2000 steps of minimization, 144,000 steps of annealing, 500,000 steps of equilibration and 5,000,000 steps (10ns) of production MD simulation. The system was heated to 300 K at rate of one Kelvin degree per 1 ps. Langevin dynamics were used to control the temperature. Minimization, annealing and equilibration were restrained to backbone atoms of the protein, while the production run was unrestrained. Timestep was set to 2 fs, all runs were performed in NPT ensemble. VMD was used to analyze the results.",

The obtained compounds have a carboxyacyl group in position C3, whose presence is important for action against HIV-1, and a diethyl phosphate group in position C28 (Scheme 1). This work attempts to answer the question of how the introduction of a phosphate substituent affects the activity of synthesized compounds, compared to substances with known potential-in this case, BVM. Betulin 1 obtained from birch bark harvested in southern Poland by extraction with dichloromethane was used as the starting substrate. After concentrating the extracts, the produced substance was purified by crystallization from ethanol. In the first stage, a phosphorylation reaction of a hydroxyl group at the C28 position was carried out using diethyl chlorophosphate. After purification, 28-diethoxyphosphorylbetulin 2 was obtained at a yield of 86%. Compound 2 was then reacted with 3\u2032,3\u2032-dimethylsuccinic, 4\u2032,4\u2032-dimethylglutaric, and 3\u2032,3\u2032-dimethylglutaric anhydride according to the Betulin 1 obtained from birch bark harvested in southern Poland by extraction with dichloromethane was used as the starting substrate.

A chart of changes in HIV-1 inhibition of 3-carboxyacylbetulin phosphate and BVM in the tested concentration range is attached to the Supplementary Materials ( Figure S1 ). However, compound 3 has a higher selectivity for action (therapeutic index (TI) = 1250 and 967, respectively). Among the tested phosphate derivatives, compound 3 showed the lowest cytotoxicity, but it was at a level comparable to BVM. Other phosphate derivatives were more toxic and also less active against HIV. As results from the data presented in the Table 1 , compounds with a longer carbon chain in the carboxyacylic substituent are more cytotoxic. Dimethylglutaric derivatives have an IC 50 Figure S2 ).",

During maturation process, viral protease cleaves Gag precursor protein to individual matrix (MA), spacer peptide (SP1), capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) peptides. This step is essential to produce mature and infectious virions. Recent studies report that the immature CA-CTD-SP1 assembles to create a hexameric structure which forms a cone-shaped core built up with multiple hexameric proteins. Protease can access the cleavage site only after the six-helix bundle unfolds [40] . Based on atomic coordinates of the CTD of CA and SP1 of HIV-1 Gag deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PBD ID 5I4T), one active site cavity was predicted [41] . This cavity was located inside the pore formed by the six-helix SP1 bundle (Figure 1 ). We would like to point out that we used AutoDock ver.4.2.6 in our previous research on the antiviral activity of betulinic acid derivatives [12] . In the present study, we decided to use the program AutoDock Vina (referred to as Vina) for in silico research. Vina uses a sophisticated gradient optimization method in its local optimization procedure. The calculation of the gradient effectively gives the optimization algorithm a \"sense of direction\" from a single evaluation. Evaluation of the speed and accuracy of Vina during flexible docking showed an improvement in speed of approximately two orders of magnitude, and a significantly higher accuracy of the binding mode prediction compared to AutoDock [25] . We also decided to redock the BVM molecule to HIV-1 CA-CTD-SP1 with the use of Vina software.",

According to the results of docking for the target proteins, all tested compounds showed a lower degree of fit to tested proteins compared to BVM. These results may indicate that modification of the bevirimat molecule by substitution of the carboxyl group by a phosphate substituent probably does not increase toxicity of phosphate derivatives compared to BVM. Due to 2020's COVID-19 pandemic, another group of RNA viruses-coronaviruses-have become interesting to scientists. The majority of its large genome is transcribed and translated into polypeptide encoding proteins. These proteins are important for gene expression. The main protease (M pro ), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are key enzymes for coronavirus replication [50] . The M pro mediates the maturation of non-structural proteins (Nsps), essential in the life cycle of the virus [51] . In research on various coronaviruses inhibitors, Nsps and its RdRp domains have been used as a promising target for new drug candidates [52] .",

For BVM, a known maturation inhibitor, the IC50 value determined in this study was comparable and equal to 0.03 \u03bcM. Derivative 3 was characterized by slightly higher selectivity (TI values of 1250 and 967 for 3 and BVM, respectively). Considering the literature reports on various potential mechanisms of anti-HIV activity of triterpenes, molecular modeling with CA-CTD-SP1 has been carried out. The optimal fit was demonstrated by compound 3. This effect suggests a potential molecular target that determines anti-HIV activity of the studied compounds.",

Derivative 3, which has a 3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl moiety at the C3 position, exhibits the highest anti-HIV-1 activity (IC 50 = 0.02 \u00b5M). For BVM, a known maturation inhibitor, the IC 50 value determined in this study was comparable and equal to 0.03 \u00b5M. Derivative 3 was characterized by slightly higher selectivity (TI values of 1250 and 967 for 3 and BVM, respectively). Considering the literature reports on various potential mechanisms of anti-HIV activity of triterpenes, molecular modeling with CA-CTD-SP1 has been carried out. The optimal fit was demonstrated by compound 3. This effect suggests a potential molecular target that determines anti-HIV activity of the studied compounds.",
