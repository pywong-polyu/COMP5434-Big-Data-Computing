However, very little is known about how students make sense of the algorithms typically used in network analysis. In this study, I used the Hungarian algorithm to explore how students make sense of a network algorithm and how it can be used to solve assignment problems. I report the results of a design-based research project in which eight Year 12 students participated in a teaching experiment that spanned four 60-min lessons. A hypothetical learning trajectory was developed in which students were introduced to the steps of the Hungarian algorithm incrementally. The results suggest that students made sense of the intermediate steps of the algorithm, the results of those steps, and how the algorithm works to solve assignment problems. The difficulties that students encountered are also discussed.",

Assignment problems are one such class of problems that can be solved using network analysis techniques, which students might encounter in occupations involving operations and project management. For example, the problem of assigning workers to a set of tasks, so that the total time taken to complete the tasks is minimized, can be modelled using bipartite graphs and solved using the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) . Researchers argue that discrete mathematics topics such as network analysis provide opportunities for students to develop algorithmic thinking, which is a foundational aspect of computer science (Gaio & Di Paola, 2018; Gibson, 2012; Goldin, 2010) . Indeed, learning to develop and use algorithms is a key practice in computational thinking, which offers students opportunities to connect mathematics with other STEM disciplines (P\u00e9rez, 2018) .",

However, very little is known about how students make sense of these algorithms and their competence in using them to solve network problems (Ferrarello & Mammana, 2018; Hart & Martin, 2018) . Moreover, the prerequisite knowledge required to understand how the algorithms were developed, or their proofs, is beyond the scope of the General Mathematics course. This presents a significant instructional dilemma in that students are required to execute the algorithms without necessarily understanding how or why they work. The purpose of this study is to confront this dilemma by exploring an instructional intervention designed to enhance students' understanding of network algorithms. The Hungarian algorithm is the focus of this study; however, I envisaged that the features of the instructional intervention would be applicable to the teaching and learning of other network algorithms.",

If a cost (expressed as a positive, rational number) is assigned to each agent for each task, then an optimum assignment is achieved when one agent is assigned to each task such that the total cost of the assignment is minimized (Kuhn, 1955; Munkres, 1957) . For any assignment problem, there are n! possible combinations, several of which may be optimal (Munkres, 1957) . Problems involving a 2 \u00d7 2 or 3 \u00d7 3 matrix typically can be solved by inspection, since they contain only 2 and 6 combinations, respectively. However, problems involving larger matrices contain many more combinations, which demand a more efficient method of determining the optimum allocation.",

In the context of an undergraduate computer science course, Dagdilelis and Satratzemi (1998) identified two broad categories that characterize students' difficulties in understanding graph algorithms, such as the Hungarian algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, and Kruskal's algorithm. First, students have difficulty making sense of the details of an algorithm, even when they understand how the algorithm works in general. For example, a student might understand that the Hungarian algorithm narrows the options available for an optimum assignment but have difficulty making sense of the specific steps, such as the reason for covering each row and/or column that contains a zero at the end of each step. Second, students experience difficulty in making sense of the intermediate steps of an algorithm and the results of these intermediate steps. For example, a student may be able to complete the row reduction step but not make sense of the residuals resulting from the reduction procedure.",

            "text": "In response to these difficulties, Dagdilelis and Satratzemi (1998) suggest that educational software can be used to help students visualize the steps of Dijkstra's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm. More recently, Makohon, Cetin, Nguyen, and Ng (2016) used a similar approach in developing a Java computer animation for the Hungarian algorithm, which displays each step of the algorithm on the screen with a voice commentary. A similar tool is available online at hungarianalgorithm.com. Research into how students use such tools and make sense of the explanations provided at each step appears to be limited. Moreover, these instructional approaches are intended to be used by undergraduate STEM students. More research into instructional approaches suitable for senior mathematics students is needed. Hart and Martin (2018) argue that discrete mathematics problems offer students an opportunity to model real-world problems and engage in algorithmic problem-solving to develop solutions to those problems. Hart (1998) has previously proposed an instructional pattern that can be used to develop students' algorithmic problemsolving competence. First, the teacher poses a problem, and the students develop a model of that problem. These models might involve constructing of a vertex-edge graph for problems that involve the relationships between a number of elements, such as Eulerian circuits, minimum spanning trees, and conflict relationships (Hart, 1998 (Hart, , 2008 Hart & Martin, 2018) . Second, students analyse the model and attempt to devise an algorithm to solve the problem. At this point, students may devise algorithms similar to standard algorithms used to solve the problem such as Hierholzer's algorithm (Eulerian circuits), Kruskal's algorithm (minimum spanning tree), and the Welsh-Powell algorithm (conflict relationships). Finally, the teacher provides the standard algorithm, and the students compare their algorithms with the standard algorithms. Hart hypothesizes that students' competence in algorithmic problem-solving develops through this instructional pattern and provides some anecdotal evidence that students' competence in using the graph colouring algorithm is developed through this approach (Hart, 2008; Hart & Martin, 2018) . Indeed, Wetzel, Milicic, and Ludwig (2020) found that three high-achieving 17-year-olds were able to model a shortest path problem and develop an algorithm similar to Dijkstra's algorithm through a comparable instructional pattern.",

In this study, I developed a hypothetical learning trajectory (HLT) as the basis for investigating how students make sense of each step of the Hungarian algorithm. An HLT is a theoretical construct that refers to a \"teacher's prediction as to the path by which learning might proceed\" (Simon, 1995, p. 135) . According to Simon's model, an HLT has three key components: a learning goal, learning activities, and hypothetical learning processes. In developing the hypothetical learning processes for this HLT, I adopted two existing perspectives on the teaching and learning of discrete mathematics. The first perspective is that discrete mathematics requires students to develop the heuristic process model the general on the particular. Goldin (2010) asserts that:",

This proposition is similar to Hart's (1998) aforementioned conjecture that students' competence in algorithmic problem-solving is developed through their exploration of a problem and attempts to devise an algorithm to solve that problem. Assignment problems are a form of combinatorics in which solutions to problems involving a small number of elements can be found through exploratory methods.

In mathematics education, sense making involves \"developing understanding of a situation, context, or concept by connecting it with existing knowledge\" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2009, p. 4) . Sense making might be viewed as a way of thinking about mathematical procedures and concepts, as well as problem situations and their solutions (Kilpatrick, Swafford, & Findell, 2001) . Mathematical reasoning is a closely related process that refers to the logical conclusions that students make based on the relationships between concepts and situations, given the assumptions underpinning those relationships (Kilpatrick et al., 2001; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2009 ). Reasoning, therefore, might be considered an instantiation of the way that students make sense of assignment problems and the steps of the Hungarian algorithm.",

Thus, I hypothesized that students might be able to solve simple assignments by inspection using their existing mathematical reasoning at the start of the teaching experiment. The introduction of the procedures in the Hungarian algorithm could then be introduced incrementally from this instructional starting point. In developing the learning activities for each stage of the HLT, I devised three design heuristics. First, assignment problems for each step of the Hungarian algorithm can be solved after executing that step. That is, problems for the row reduction stage can be solved after the row reduction step is executed, and so on. I hypothesized that this incremental approach would offer students an opportunity to make sense of how each step of the algorithm works to narrow the potential options for an optimum assignment. Second, the problems for each step comprised smaller matrices (2 \u00d7 2, 3 \u00d7 3) before problems with larger matrices (4 \u00d7 4). Solutions to problems involving smaller matrices can be found by inspection or by assessing all the possible combinations. Hence, this design feature might offer students an opportunity to examine how the algorithm yields a solution using only a few data points before examining how it works on larger sets of data. The third heuristic was to use contexts that students might readily understand. For instance, the time taken to complete tasks or distances travelled might allow students to interpret the data as they make sense of assignment problem solutions and the steps in the algorithm.",

I was the teacher-researcher for each session and conducted the sessions over Zoom. During the teaching sessions, I posed the problems by sharing the screen in Zoom.

Second, students made reasonable assumptions, typically about how they would measure the distances (using the internet), point of departure for each student, and mode of transport. Third, the students collected data from the internet and constructed a matrix of the distances between each student and each shopping centre.

Their understanding of assignment problems emerged from a small-scale modelling task at the start of the HLT, and they appeared to carry this understanding forward into the subsequent problems. In particular, the students made sense of the data contained in each of the matrices and the condition that only one agent can be assigned to one task. Furthermore, the students appeared to be aware that they were working towards finding the smallest combination of the agent-task data points. The results suggest that students' competence in mathematizing a problem was a critical factor in making sense of assignment problems and developing rudimentary algorithmic approaches to search for a solution to the problem.",

            "text": "The results showed that students developed rudimentary algorithmic approaches to solve the initial assignment problems and assignment problems that contained small matrices (2 \u00d7 2, 3 \u00d7 3). Specifically, the students searched through columns and/or rows to find the lowest values that they used to determine the optimum assignment. The students also identified the need to make trade-offs between potential assignments when an agent was more efficient at two tasks than another agent. The students then Fig. 12 Gilda's row and column reduction for garment factory problem 3 applied their rudimentary search algorithm to solve problems represented by a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix. This finding is consistent with Goldin's (2010) theoretical perspective that students may solve combinatoric and vertex-edge graph problems that have a small number of elements through exploration and then begin to generalize their algorithmic approaches to solve larger problems. Similarly, researchers hypothesize that students' algorithmic competence is supported by opportunities to devise their own algorithms prior to the introduction of standard algorithms (Gaio & Di Paola, 2018; Hart, 1998; Hart & Martin, 2018) . In the present study, the problems in the first stages of the HTL were designed to be solved by searching through the rows and assigning agents to tasks based on the lowest values. This design feature appears to have elicited students' rudimentary search algorithms that formed the basis for introducing the Hungarian algorithm in subsequent stages of the HLT.",

Additionally, students were able to examine the zeros and coordinate optimum assignments from these options.

Second, each step of the algorithm was introduced using smaller matrices. By using smaller matrices, students could compare the results of the algorithm with all possible combinations.

The students in this study lacked the prerequisite knowledge to understand the proof of the Hungarian algorithm and hence the possibility of making conjectures about how their initial search algorithms could be applied to larger problems was limited.

However, as predicted by Dagdilelis and Satratzemi (1998) , the details of the steps in the Hungarian algorithm are complicated and thus present several challenges for students. First, students questioned if they should perform the column and/or further reduction procedures on the values in the original matrix or on the values resulting from the row and/or column reduction procedure. Second, the students struggled to understand how to highlight the minimum number of rows and/or columns containing zeros, and that the number of highlighted rows/columns should equal the number of required assignments. In response to these difficulties, I demonstrated the procedure where necessary and sometimes revised the wording of the steps in the algorithm in collaboration with the students. This finding suggests that teachers might need to take a flexible approach to the wording of the details of an algorithm in response to the way that their students make sense of those details. Dagdilelis and Satratzemi (1998) also suggest that students experience difficulties in making sense of the results of intermediate steps of an algorithm. In the present study, however, students appeared to make sense of the residual values produced by the intermediate steps. The students' apparent understanding of the intermediate results appeared to emerge from their initial experiences with solving problems with a small number of elements. Furthermore, the incremental approach to introducing each step of the algorithm possibly offered students an opportunity to examine the results of the intermediate steps in isolation.",

First, the incremental approach to introducing an algorithm offered students opportunities to make sense of how each step in the algorithm works. Although the focus in this study was the Hungarian algorithm, I suggest that this incremental approach would also apply to a range of other network algorithms, such as Prim's algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. Further research might explore how an incremental approach supports students' understanding of these algorithms. Second, the design heuristics that I developed in this study might be used by teachers and researchers in developing problems and activities to enhance students' sense making of network algorithms. Finally, the findings of the present study provide empirical support for the instructional pattern proposed by Hart (1998) .
