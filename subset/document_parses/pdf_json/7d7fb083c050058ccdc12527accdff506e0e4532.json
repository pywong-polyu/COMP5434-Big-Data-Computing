            "text": "Cervical cancer, ranked after breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer, is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, with approximately 530,000 new cases and 275,000 deaths every year [1] [2] [3] . According to current data, nearly 85% of women's deaths from cervical cancer occurred in developing or underdeveloped countries [1] . In China, cervical cancer is ranked as the eighth most common killer for women and continues to be a public health problem affecting women's health [4] . Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted virus, which is mainly passed on through genital contact and also passed on by skin-to-skin contact. HPV infection can cause cervical cancer and other cancers, including the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, or oropharynx. Persistent infection with HR-HPV is the major cause of cervical cancer. Globally, HPV infection has been involved in more than 99% of cervical cancer [5] . HPV is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus with a genome of approximately 8.0 kb. As of 9 March 2015, more than 200 different types of HPV, identified numerically, have been identified by the International HPV Reference Center [6] . Based on epidemiological and biological data, twelve HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45 , 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59) have been classified as HR-HPV [7] . Eight HPV types (26, 53, 66, 67, 68, 70, 73 and 82), identified as single HPV infection in about 3% cervical cancer, are classified as probable/possible (p) HR-HPV due to lack of biological data [8] . It is extremely difficult to isolate and culture HPV in vitro. Additionally, not all patients infected with HPV have an obvious antibody response. Thus, HPV DNA detection by PCR becomes a non-invasive and sensitive method for confirming cervical HPV infection. Since persistent infection with HR-HPV is a necessary cause for cervical cancer development, DNA detection and genotyping of HPV can be an essential method for controlling and preventing HPVrelated diseases in China.",

However, the current vaccines offer protection only targeted at a few HPV genotypes and provide crossprotection for certain HPV genotypes. For example, the bivalent vaccine against HPV16 and 18 has a cross-protection against HPV 31, 34 and 45 [9] . The vaccines cannot prevent infection of all subtypes of HPV. Since the prevalence of HPV infection in women shows geographical distribution [10, 11] , understanding HPV prevalence would be necessary to introduce an HPV vaccination program for cervical cancer prevention.",

However, only the bivalent vaccine and the quadrivalent vaccine against HPV are available in northern Henan Province. The 9-valent vaccines are only used in some provinces in China since May 2018. Lack of epidemiological data on HPV infection and genotype distribution makes it difficult to implement preventative measures such as HPV vaccination in northern Henan Province. The sponsors and local government may support HPV vaccines by using the scientific data of HPV prevalence. Therefore, the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV among women attending gynecology clinics in Henan Province were identified in this study. The results of this research are of great importance for estimation of the awareness of HPV infection and the introduction of vaccination program in northern Henan Province of China.",

Some studies reported the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV in different provinces in China [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, there are few reports on HPV prevalence in Henan Province. The present study provided the prevalence and genotype data of HPV from women attending regular gynecological outpatient clinics from January 2018 to December 2019 in the northern Henan Province of China. Our study showed that the overall HPV infection rate was 19.7%, which was similar to the results from several surveys of HPV prevalence reported in other provinces of China [16] [17] [18] . The prevalence of HPV in northern Henan Province was lower than that reported in Shandong Province (28.4%) and Fujian Province (38.3%) [19, 20] , but higher than Yunnan Province (12.9%) and Shanxi Province (8.92%) [12, 21] . The different HPV prevalence in northern Henan Province was expected and could have been due to the different economic conditions, living habits and customs, cultural diversity, sampling strategy, and the HPV detection methods [13, 22] . According to the previous reports, the HPV infection rate ranges from 6.7 to 44.5% in China [23] . Although the HPV infection rates in northern Henan Province are not the highest in China, the women need education on prevention and control of HPV infection and the related diseases. This present study provided age-specific HPV infection rates among women. Our results showed that women under 20 years had the highest infection rate. Single, double and multiple infections rates were also the highest in women under 20 years. There are two possible reasons for this phenomenon: the first reason is that literature shows that HPV prevalence is higher in the younger age group [22, 24] . The second reason is that younger women may engage in unprotected sexual activities, exposing them to infections. The above two reasons led to the highest infection rate in the G1 group. It was reported that young women infected with HPV were temporary, and the immune system would clear the virus in most cases [25, 26] . Therefore, the infection rate of HPV will gradually decline with age increased.",

            "text": "The present study found that the prevalence of HPV declined gradually in the middle-aged groups and slightly increased in the G6 group (22.9%), which indicated that women over 60 years suffered severely from HPV infection. For women over 60 years, HPV infections may occur when they are young, and the infections probably are persistent infections instead of new HPV infections. If the HPV cannot be eliminated by the immune system and persist for several years, this will present as a risk factor for neoplasia development. HPV infection rates was 21.1% in women aged [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] 18 .1% in women aged [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] 17 .7% in women aged 40-49 and 20.8% in women aged 50-59. According to recent data from China National Cancer Center, there were 98,990 new cases of cervical cancer and 30,500 deaths in China in 2015 [27] . The number of new cervical cancer cases was 10,948 in Henan Province, with an incidence of 21.09 per 100,000 [28] . Since HPV infection is a major etiological factor for cervical cancer development, future treatment that could eliminate HPV infection and prevent the progression of cervical cancer is of great importance. Our present study also provided the age-specific distribution of single, double, and multiple HPV infections rates. Except for the G1 group, the single, double, and multiple HPV infections rates of the rest groups were very close. There has not been a consensus on whether numerous HPV infections raise the risk of cervical cancer more than a single HPV infection up until now. Some studies have reported that multiple HPV infections had a higher risk of cervical cancer occurrence and development than single HPV infections [29, 30] . However, other studies have found that single HPV infections had a greater risk of developing cervical cancer concerning multiple infections [31, 32] . In our study, the prevalence of single HPV infections is higher than that of double and multiple HPV infections, accounting for 13.7% of the total cases, and HPV16 was the most commonly detected genotype in a single HPV infection. HPV16 infection is the one with the highest oncogenic risk [32] . Thus, more attention should be paid to single HPV16 infection. The double HPV infections and multiple HPV infections accounted for 4.3% and 1.8% of the total cases, respectively. The investigation of double and multiple HPV infections is of great importance to study the prevalence of HPV and is also of great significance to develop a multivalent HPV vaccine.",

In the present study, HPV16, HPV52, HPV58, HPV53, and HPV39 were the top five HR-HPV genotypes. HPV16 ranked first in our study, and the infection rate reached up to 4.3%. HPV52 and HPV58 ranked second and third, respectively. Besides HPV16, both HPV52 and HPV58 are also strongly correlated with cervical cancer development [31] . The top three genotypes distribution pattern is consistent with the data from several previous Chinese population-based HPV investigations [19, 33, 34] . It was reported the HPV18 ranked second in Chinese women between 1991 and 2016 [4] .

The 9-valent HPV vaccine is used to prevent infection with HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV45, HPV52, and HPV58. Our results support the recommendation of the 9-valent HPV vaccine for routine vaccination in northern Henan Province. Meanwhile, vaccines against HPV53, HPV39, and HPV51 should also be developed for women in this area.",
