The real-time polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard for detecting the coronavirus in various types of biological specimens. However, this technique is time consuming, labor intensive, and expensive. Screenprinted electrodes (SPEs) can be used as point-of-care devices because of their low cost, sensitivity, selectivity, and ability to be miniaturized. The ability to detect the spike protein of COVID-19 in serum, urine, and saliva was developed using SPE aided by magnetic beads (MBs) and a portable potentiostat. The antibody-peroxidase-loaded MBs were the captured and catalytic units for the electrochemical assays. The MBs enable simple washing and homogenous deposition on the working electrode using a magnet. The assembly of the immunological MBs and the electrochemical system increases the measuring sensitivity and speed. The physical and electrochemical properties of the layer-by-layer modified MBs were systematically characterized. The performance of these immunosensors was evaluated using spike protein in the range 3.12-200 ng mL \u22121 . We achieved a limit of detection of 0.20, 0.31, and 0.54 ng mL \u22121 in human saliva, urine, and serum, respectively. A facile electrochemical method to detect COVID-19 spike protein was developed for quick point-of-care testing.",

Conventional methods for virus detection include lateral flow strips, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [1] . Among these techniques, PCR is the gold standard for detecting coronaviruses from various types of biological specimens. The main drawbacks of thermal cyclers include long analysis time, expensive instrument setup, and the need for skilled personnel [2] . Various virus detection methods, including electrochemical biosensors, fluorescence biosensors, surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based biosensors, colorimetric biosensors, chemiluminescence biosensors, surface plasmon resonance-based biosensors, and magnetic biosensors, have been developed for SARS-CoV-2 [3] . Among these detection principles, electrochemical biosensors can consist of potentiometric, amperometric, conductometric, voltammetric, polarographic, impedimetric, capacitive, or piezoelectric elements [4] . Moreover, biosensors incorporated with different recognition elements such as imprinted Pravanjan Malla and Hao-Ping Liao contributed equally to this work.",

Layer-by-layer modified MBs are used to fasten the assay through simultaneous capture and concentration of the targets with the aid of a magnet. The APBA modified MBs (MB/APBA) can immobilize Ab-HRP via diol-boronic ester bond to prepare the MB/APBA/Ab-HRP and then glucose treatment to obtain MB/APBA/Ab-HRP/GLU. HRP is one of the most extensively studied and commonly used enzymes for the construction of H 2 O 2 biosensors. Generally, direct transfer of an electron between HRP and an electrode is difficult because the active sites of HRP are deeply buried in a thick protein shell and because the large distance between the active sites and the electrode surface will slow down the electron transfer. Electron transfer via a mediator like HQ, however, is more effective for establishing an electrical connection between the redox centers and the electrode [20] . In this work, H 2 O 2 was a substrate reduced by Ab-HRP, and HQ was used as a mediator for electron transduction. Previously, chorionic gonadotrophin has been proved to decrease the catalytic activity of the Ab-HRP on the detection probe and reduce the current signal on the immunosensor [21] . In another paper, when the antigen of parathyroid hormone increased, the catalytic activity (Kcat) of Ab-HRP on SPCE decreased, and the signal current decreased [17] . These papers suggest the mechanism as follows. When the concentration of antigen increased, the thickness of immunocomplexes on MBs increased. The non-electroactive complex was a blocking layer against the mass transfer of H 2 O 2 to HRP sites and also impeded the transfer of the electron mediator HQ to the electrode. EIS is an effective method for probing the features of an electrode using an impedance signal. We also found an increase in the Rct values after the formation of immuno-complexes on MBs when an increase",

            "text": "The morphology of modified MBs was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging. Figure 2 (A-D) shows microscale images of the original MBs and modified MBs with a 1.0 \u00b5m scale bar. All images were obtained with 15 kV voltage. MBs are typically sphere shape, as seen in Fig. 2 (A); MB/APBA has an aggregated cloud-like structure, as in Fig. 2(B) , and MB/APBA/Ab-HRP have expanded clusters, possibly from the interaction of Ab-HRP with increased size, as shown in Fig. 2 (C). An aggregated globular structure was observed in Fig. 2 (D). In addition, the various sizes of the MBs were characterized using a Zeta sizer. An increase in size from 978 to 1041 nm was indicated the conjugation of APBA on the MB surface. Similarly, after immobilizing Ab-HRP, the size increased to 1535 nm and finally reached 2674 nm after adsorption of spike protein (Table S1) . To select MBs, we performed a test with two kinds of MB, one containing the NH 2 group and the other containing the COOH group. We evaluated HRP adsorption using two kinds of MBs modified by APBA. The crosslinkers tested for MB-NH 2 and MB-COOH were glutaraldehyde and EDC/NHC, respectively. We measured the APBA remaining in the solution using UV absorbance at 233 nm. By using the APBA standard as a reference, the concentration of APBA was evaluated and plotted, as in Fig. S2(A) . To confirm the effect of correct orientation, glutaraldehyde is used as a cross-linker to conjugate Ab-HRP to magnetic beads without APBA. The MB-NH 2 was directly activated using a glutaraldehyde solution to form MB-NH 2 /GA. The Ab-HRP was added to the MB-GA and incubated for 30 min, and a TMB assay was used to evaluate the HRP activity of the MBs. Figure S2 (B) shows the comparison of the calibration curve of MB with and without the APBA layer. MB-NH 2 /GA/APBA/Ab-HRP had higher activity (slope) than MB-NH 2 /GA/Ab-HRP. The APBA can covalently bond to 1,2-and 1,3-diols of the carbohydrate moiety of glycoproteins that can immobilize the Ab-HRP on the MBs. Previously, antibodies were immobilized using their lysine, arginine, and glutamine residues by random conjugation of glutaraldehyde on electrode surfaces, resulting in unsatisfactory activity in antigen targeting [22] . The immobilization of the oriented antibody with the proper targeting activity has been achieved using APBA [23] . Owing to the oriented immobilization of Ab-HRP via boronic acid groups on MB, more activity of the Ab-HRP was preserved in this study. Glutaraldehyde randomly conjugates the Ab-HRP using the amino-acid residues with the amines on MB-NH 2 , resulting in the decrease of HRP activity. The presence of APBA on the MB surface help to preserve more Ab-HRP activity, as shown in Fig. S2(B) . can maintain the correct antibody orientation and improve antibody targeting efficiency [26] . Therefore, we adopted APBA as a ligand to the immobilized antibody on MB to maintain the correct orientation of antibodies.",

After conjugating MB-NH 2 with APBA, the Rct value increased to 3316 \u03a9. Then, there was a significant increase in the Rct value after the antibody was immobilized on the MB surface. After blocking with glucose, the MB/APBA/Ab-HRP/GLU had the highest Rct. The solution resistance and the doublelayer capacitance were similar after layer-by-layer modification on MBs, suggesting these parameters were not affected by the APBA conjugation and antibody immobilization [10, 28] . However, Rct values were significantly influenced by the binding of spike protein on MBs. The hindrance to the electron transfer process, blocking of a redox reaction, and the hamper of electron tunneling to the electrode attributed to the increasing thickness of the immuno-complex formed on MB surfaces [29] .

Glucose has the BA binding ability via the cis-diol linkage and affects the antibody purification by BA-MB. Borlido et al. also demonstrate that glucose can compete the BA on MB with the glycoproteins [31] . Using this concept, we first immobilized the Ab-HRP and sequentially blocked the free APBA binding sites using the optimized glucose concentration to avoid the nonspecific binding from the samples. The blocking process is very crucial for immunosensor preparation because it protects the immobilized antibodies and avoids nonspecific binding of impurities on electrodes. Therefore, six blocking agents were added to the MB surface and evaluated for their ability to prevent nonspecific binding. The chemicals tested included 5% dextran sulfate, bovine serum albumin, phosphate buffer solution, gamma-cyclodextrin, glucose, polyethylene glycol. Based on experimental data, the S/B ratio of glucose was higher than BSA shown in Fig. S6 . Therefore, glucose was chosen to block the free APBA on the MB surface. The optimized parameters are summarized in Table 1 . In addition, other related parameters, such as the APBA concentration and the incubation time of the spike protein, were tested using a HRP activity assay. The optimized APBA concentration on MBs was 0.1%, and the incubation time of spike protein was found to be 30 min (Fig. S7) .",

            "text": "The analytical performance of the MB-based immunosensor was investigated by SWV. The dose-effect of spike protein ranging from 3.12 to 200 ng mL \u22121 was evaluated. We investigated the sensor's ability to detect the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 added in human saliva, urine, and serum. The SWV spectra of saliva, urine, and serum samples are shown in Fig. 5(A, B, C) , and their standard curves are shown in Fig. 5(D, E, F) . The current signal decreased with increasing doses of spike protein because higher concentrations of antigen decreased the current signal of the HRP-labeled antibody. This was because the antigen occupied the limited binding sites of antibody-HRP to form an immunocomplex. The current was inversely proportional to the concentration of spike protein, and there was a linear dependence on spike protein concentrations in the range of 3.12 to 200 ng mL \u22121 . This yielded sensitivities of 4.44, 2.49, and 0.84 \u00b5A ng \u22121 mL and LODs of 0.20, 0.31, and 0.54 ng mL \u22121 in human saliva, urine, and serum, respectively. The dose-dependent SWV signals could be explained by Rct results. The thickness of immuno-complexes on MBs increased when the spike protein increased. The inert complex hindered the H 2 O 2 /HQ reaction with HRP and also reduced the electron transfer of the redox mediator to the SPE. Previous reports also demonstrate the targets of immunosensors decrease the activity of the HRP-labelled antibody on the immunosensor and reduce the current signal [21] . A detailed comparison of LOD is shown in Table S3 . The data and recovery of SWV, ELISA, and EIS are summarized in Table 2 . The developed MBs can also be applied to the colorimetric assay. In the absence of spike protein, the TMB was converted by MB/ APBA/Ab-HRP/GLU and became blue. The dose-effect of spike protein on EIS is shown in Fig. 6(A) . The Rct value increases with an increase in the dose of the spike protein.",

The storage stability of modified MB was evaluated based on the S/B ratio and SWV signal in Fig. 8(A) . After 49 days of storage of MB/APBA, the S/B ratio was 3.66, which indicated it has great sensing ability. For MB/ APBA/Ab-HRP/GLU, the S/B ratio on Day 1 was 3.44, and after 49 days of storage, it declined to 2.85. The activity and targeting of antibody-peroxidase on MBs could be retained after 49 days of storage, as shown in Fig. 8(B) . More than 80% of the S/B ratio had been maintained as compared with freshly prepared MBs. This suggests that the antibodyimmobilized MBs had good stability. A comparison of the published immunosensors to this study is summarized in Table 3 . These reported immunosensors adopted the EIS, DPV, SWV, and CV methods to quantify the targets on SARS-CoV-2. For example, Eissa and Zourob integrated sample collection and detection into a single platform using diazonium-modified SPEs for nucleocapsid detection. They achieved a limit of detection of 0.8 pg mL \u22121 for SARS-CoV-2, and there was no significant cross-reactivity against the influenza antigen [32] . SPEs coated with graphene oxide and gold nanostars can detect the viral spike protein, with a superior limit of detection of 1.68 \u00d7 10 \u221222 \u03bcg mL \u22121 [33] . In these papers, nanomaterials such as MBs and gold nanoparticles are used to amplify the electrochemical signal using different mechanisms, including a large active surface, extraordinary electron-transfer ability, and multivalent affinity with the enzyme and antibody. Very recently, an electrochemical assay was developed for Nucleocapsid protein using primary antibody-labeled MB to capture antigen and secondary antibody-labeled phosphatase to detect antigen and generate enzymatic product naphthol [34] . The carbon black modified SPE then converted the naphthol to the current signal. This novel device of Fabiani et al. provides low LOD and rapid analysis. However, two antibodies and several wash steps were needed as compared to the single antibody and simultaneous detection in the present study. Our proposed MB-based immunosensor could detect spike protein using the SWV and EIS methods with a fast procedure and acceptable sensitivity. However, these following challenges still need to be carefully investigated in future studies. This developed method is limited to the viremia stage, where viruses enter the bloodstream and have access to the rest of the body. Because the clinical samples contain proteins, cells, and biomolecules that can interfere with the selectivity and sensitivity of the developed biosensors, the evaluation using in patient's samples from nasopharyngeal swabs can prove the clinical application of this system. Finally, the antibody used in this study has the limits of being heat sensitive and unstable to long-term storage, which will need further improvement.",

Antibody immobilization and signal amplification are two key factors in target detection at ultra-low concentrations. The boronic acid in APBA forms cyclic esters with 1,2-and 1,3-diols on the carbohydrate moiety of glycoproteins that can immobilize the antibody on the MBs[24,25].
