The availability of COVID-19 vaccines met the willingness of approximately 80% of European MS patients to receive vaccination (ref). The greatest interest in vaccination was observed in older patients and in those with comorbidities (25) . This evidence is reflected in our case series, where mean age was 46.7 \u00b1 10.3 and median EDSS score was 2.5. Immunosenescence increases the risk of adverse events in older adults. Beyond reduced response to vaccines, changes that take place in the immune system with aging generally result in higher susceptibility to infections and prevalence of autoimmunity (26) , factors that can precipitate reactivations in MS patients. During mass immunization campaign, such as that occurred in France between 1995 and 1997, several cases of MS were reported a few weeks after HBV vaccination, suggesting that vaccine may accelerate the transition from subclinical to clinical disease (27) . However, two subsequent case-control studies showed a nonsignificant increase in risk of developing MS following the HBV vaccine (ref). Therefore, conclusions derived from case reports and case series are not free from biases and should not influence vaccine hesitancy (28) .",
