[2] On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 the sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern, [3] and on 22 February 2020, called the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease 2019 . On 11 March 2020, the WHO formally announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic. [4] Since 18 March 2020, more than 5.370.375 cases have been confirmed, with 344.454 deaths, which exceeds the number of confirmed cases and deaths associated with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. [5] [6] [7] Most of the patients have experienced mild symptoms and have made good prognosis, but a minority have developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or multiple organ failure and died. [8] Mortality among patients critically ill with COVID-19 is substantially high, and the risk of death is increased in older patients with ARDS and co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. [9, 10] Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and identification of risk factors for the progression of COVID-19, with chest computed tomography (CT) being considered the firstline imaging modality in highly suspected cases. [11, 12] Previous experience with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome indicates that CT is more sensitive and specific than Xrays. CT can identify lung abnormalities earlier, [13] and is significantly more sensitive than real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in diagnosing COVID-19 (98% vs 71%). [14] The pathologic findings that can be detected at the chest CT scan during COVID-19 are different, among them consolidation, linear opacities, a crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, and extra-pulmonary lesions. [12, [15] [16] [17] [18] The extent and severity of these lesions has a major influence on the prognosis. However, to date, little has been done in trying to attribute a quantitative definition of pulmonary involvement identifiable in CT. Measuring pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia quantitatively may help the clinician in defining the severity of the case.",

The 2 readers analysed the axial images (but were free to evaluate the multiplanar reformats) for the following features based on the Fleischner Society nomenclature recommendations and similar studies: ground-glass opacities (GGO); consolidation; nodules or fibrosis; the number of lobes with GGO or consolidation; the site (s) of the lesions (subpleural or not); the halo sign, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram, of vascular dilatation; interlobular septal thickening; bronchodilatation; pleural thickening, pleural or pericardial effusion; lymphadenopathy and pneumothorax. [22] A sub-pleural lesion was defined as a lesion located no more than 1 cm from the pleural surface. GGO was defined as subtle GGOs seen around the small airways and vessel. The halo sign was defined as GGO around a nodule or mass. Consolidation and GGO were defined as hazy areas of increased attenuation respectively with and without obscuring the underlying vasculature. GGOs with superimposed inter-and intra-lobular septal thickening were defined as crazy-paving, and nodular opacities were defined as round focal solid opacities or GGOs with a diameter of <3 cm. Reticulation was defined as inter-and intralobular septal thickening. Sub-pleural bands were defined as thin linear opacities peripheral and parallel to the pleura. Traction bronchiectasis was defined as irregular or distorted dilated airways seen in areas of fibrosis, with an increased bronchus diameter in comparison with the associated pulmonary artery. Vascular enlargement was defined as increased vessel diameter in comparison with a vessel of similar cross section. Lymphadenectasis was defined as lymph nodes with a short axis of >1 cm. The abnormalities were characterised as unilateral or bilateral, and their distribution was categorized as focal (a single focus of abnormality), multifocal (more than 1 focus), or diffuse (involving most of the volume of 1 lung).",

The right and left lung were evaluated separately and the results were summed to give the final score for each level. The nature of the lung abnormalities in each area was defined on the basis of a 4-point scoring system detailed, and the percentage of lung involvement at each level was categorized as 0 for normal lung; 1 for <25% lung abnormalities; 2 for 25% to 49% abnormalities; 3 for 50% to 74% abnormalities and 4 for \u226575% abnormalities. The 2 scores (the extent and nature of the abnormalities) were multiplied by each other and added to the scores of all six levels (3 levels on each side). A final radiological severity score ranging from 0 to 96 was attributed to parenchymal involvement. The final score was agreed by all 3 radiologists.

The normality of continuous variables was tested for using Shapiro-Wilk tests. The x 2 test was used to compare the categorical variables, and the association between the severity scores and the study outcomes (mild/typical vs severe/critical) was examined using 1-way analysis of covariance after adjusting for age (the overall p value is that of the main effects of the fixed factor provided by the age-adjusted 1way analysis of covariance). When significant, pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni's correction were used to ensure an experiment-wide error rate of 0.05 and identify the groups with significant differences. The inter-observer agreement concerning the chest CT severity scores was determined by means of intra-class correlation coefficients.

            "text": "Li et al have designed a 0-60 scoring system predictive of mortality based on the percentage involvement of each lung and according to the time interval between symptom onset. In patients with an interval between symptom onset and chest CT 5 days, they described a CT score of 14.5 (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 77.3%, adjusted AUC 0.881), while in patients with an interval between 6 and 10 days, a CT score of 27.5 (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity of 70.6%, adjusted AUC 0.895) is predictive of mortality. However, this study only included patients over 60 years of age. [33] Two other studies have described scoring systems measuring the extent of lesions in each lung lobe in order to assess the changes in pulmonary involvement during the course of COVID-19 pneumonia. [15, 16] However, the correlation between scores and clinical outcomes was not evaluated. A fourth study used the mean pulmonary inflammation index to assess severity on the basis of the size and distribution of lung abnormalities and found a significant relationship between the pulmonary inflammation index and clinical symptoms, lymphocyte counts and Creactive protein levels. [34] Our results show that the mean CT score of the patients with severe/critical disease was higher than that of the patients with mild/typical disease, and ROC analysis showed that the optimal cut-off score for predicting a severe/ critical outcome was 38, which had a sensitivity of 93.33%, a specificity of 59.26%, and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.29. The identification of this cut-off score should make it easier to interpret CT findings. This study has a number of limitations. Its retrospective design may have limited its power to identify prognostic factors. Secondly, the critical situation in which the data were collected meant that more detailed information (such as baseline medication use) was not obtained. Thirdly, the 2 groups were not balanced in so far as the group with severe/critical disease was relatively small; more reliable cut-off values will require further studies of larger populations. Fourthly, none of the patients underwent a lung biopsy or autopsy to reflect the histopathological changes. Finally, the specificity of the CT severity score might not be high enough, although we should not overlook the clinical usefulness of CT as an indispensable means of assessing patients with such a highly contagious disease.",
