Design: A cross-sectional survey collecting data in Hong Kong and Fujian Province of China in April 2020. Methods: A convenience and snowball sample of 2706 students aged 18 years or older and studying a healthcare programme were recruited in tertiary education institutions/universities in Hong Kong and Putian. The participants completed the questionnaire with six scales: Social Distancing Scale; Personal Hygiene Scale; Empathic Responding Scale; Wishful Thinking Scale; Perceived Stress Scale and Perceived Threat Scale. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the preventive measures outcomes. p value < .05 was considered as statistical significance. Results: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing (SoD) and personal hygiene measures (PHM). Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance with SoD and PHM. The final model constructed demonstrated a very good fit to the data. Conclusion: The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance with the COVID-19 preventive measures.",

As the infection control behaviours of healthcare students, whom are still under training and are the high-risk group of being infected and infecting others in the community, are rarely reported in literature, this study has provided empirical evidence to nurses and other healthcare professionals to identify students susceptible to poor compliance and provide early monitoring and education to suppress the COVID-19 transmission.",

            "text": "At present, implementing essential ICPs is the sole approach to mitigate virus spread in the community. WHO and national health agencies have compiled a recommended list of COVID-19 ICPs for the general public to follow, including social distancing (SoD), avoiding crowds, wearing face coverings, handwashing with soap and water or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, and regular cleaning and disinfection of touched surfaces(CDC, 2020; Centre for Health Protection, 2020; WHO, 2020b) . Reports related to numerous community cluster infections have indicated the importance of strict compliance with the recommended ICPs to minimise viral transmission. For instance, the nightclub cluster in South Korea, which was initiated by a man visiting several nightclubs without wearing a mask, led to a resurgence of new infections in South Korea (Wilder-Smith et al., 2020) . Understanding the underlying factors that determine people's compliance with ICPs in a community setting is therefore a pressing need (Bish & Michie, 2010) . Evidence regarding compliance with ICPs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently underreported. With reference to previous studies concerning factors related to ICP adherence during the earlier SARS and H1N1 outbreaks, notable regional and demographic differences were observed in the adherence to the ICPs by the general public (Bish & Michie, 2010; Bults et al., 2015; Eastwood et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2004; Marshall et al., 2012; Tooher et al., 2013) . Older, more educated females are generally reported as having higher compliance with the ICPs (Bish & Michie, 2010; Eastwood et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2004; Tooher et al., 2013) . Moreover, higher ICP compliance is also associated with those who have a higher anxiety level, higher perceived risk of infection, better knowledge about the infection, and belief in the effectiveness of the recommended ICPs (Bish & Michie, 2010; Bults et al., 2015; Eastwood et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2004; Tooher et al., 2013) . Greater trust in authorities has also been found to favour engaging in ICPs (Bults et al., 2015) . This study targeted healthcare students, a group that is currently underinvestigated regarding their compliance with ICPs. Relevant studies have often targeted healthcare workers during virus outbreaks (Brooks et al., 2020; Chor et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2005; Powell-Jackson et al., 2020; Sigayeva et al., 2007) . According to the scanty evidence available, healthcare students were not as knowledgeable and competent as their seniors regarding ICPs. Even medical students' significant improvement in hand hygiene practice after experiencing SARS was still considered insufficient (Pittet et al., 2004) . In contrast, nursing students were found to exercise moderate compliance with universal precautionary measures when they possessed sufficient knowledge about infection control precautions (Darawad & Al-Hussami, 2013) . When healthcare students participate in internship/practicum in hospitals/clinics, insufficient compliance with ICPs on their part may facilitate viral spread from community to hospital, or vice versa. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the determining factors associated with compliance with COVID-19",

Engaging in behaviours that promote health (i.e. COVID-19 ICP behaviour) is influenced by the perceived threat (PT) of COVID-19, such as the chance of becoming infected, the prognosis, and the perceived stress (PS) level, which is affected by the degree of PT. An increase in the stress level will bring about an evaluation of coping responses to overcome the stress, which will eventually provoke a series of health behaviours to cope with stress.",

Examples of SoD are avoiding crowded places and refraining from shaking hands, while measures related to PHM include wearing a mask and handwashing with hand sanitizer. For the coping response in this study, we chose wishful thinking (WT) and empathetic responding (ER), which were found to be commonly adopted by individuals during outbreaks of SARS and West Nile virus (Lee-Baggley et al., 2004; Putermna et al., 2009) . WT is a type of emotion-focused coping response that refers to an individual's effort to cognitively escape from or avoid a situation by simply fantasising or hoping the situation will go away or will somehow be over. Evidence has shown that WT is often associated with negative health outcomes such as poor adjustment to illness (Penley et al., 2002) . ER is a relationship-focused coping response in which the individual attempts to understand what others are experiencing and makes an effort to offer support and assistance. Lee-Baggley et al. (2004) found WT was positively associated with avoidant health behaviours such as eschewing public areas and people during a SARS outbreak. Conversely, ER was associated with proactive prevention behaviours such as mask wearing and exerting caution in personal hygiene (Lee-Baggley et al., 2004; Putermna et al., 2009) . The previous literature has suggested that demographic characteristics play a significant role in people's health behaviours. Consequently, demographic characteristics were included in the hypothesised model as they were believed to indirectly influence engagement in ICPs through PT, PS, and coping responses.",

The extent of community spread of COVID-19 is significantly greater than that for previous viral outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012 and 2015. The highly contagious nature of COVID-19, even during the incubation period, favours the insidious and rapid transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (the virus responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak) from person to person via respiratory droplets and contact, as asymptomatic people are unaware of being infected (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention [CDC], 2020; Special Expert Group for Control of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine, 2020; WHO, 2020b). In efforts to swiftly control the continuous spread of the virus, many countries have been launching a series of stringent infection prevention and control measures (ICPs), such as mandatory quarantine, massive lockdowns, border control, and suspending schooling to seal off transmission. However, these aggressive ICPs have unprecedentedly restricted daily living and hampered global economic activities. Reports warn that the COVID-19 pandemic will shrink global GDP by almost 1% in 2020 (United Nation, 2020), hitting people's livelihoods hard due to the resulting depression of the employment market (France-Presse, 2020; Hugh Rise, 2020). To mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, governments have been gradually resuming normal social and economic activities along with less restrictive but essential ICPs to control the spread of the virus (Wilder-Smith et al., 2020).",

The higher compliance with SoD found in Fujian students might be the result of a difference in regulations regarding SoD between Hong Kong and Fujian. Restrictive measures were launched at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Fujian. The Fujian government imposed the strictest measures to control social contact among people, such as banning social gatherings and suspending public transportation. In contrast to Fujian, the regulations affecting SoD in Hong Kong have been less restrictive at that time. For instance, in Hong Kong, people could have gatherings, though these were limited to four attendees at most. Public transport was still in operation, but passengers were required to put on facemasks. In addition, students and workers in Mainland China are used to travelling across cities and provinces seeking better study and job opportunities. Residents of Fujian may thus be more vigilant about the potential for infection caused by contact in public areas with strangers from high-risk cities. Regarding the negative association of clinical experience and compliance with SoD, we should interpret it with caution, as students with clinical experience were mainly clustered in the Hong Kong samples. The results might be biased by the skewed samples. Further studies shall be launched to confirm it.",

The different findings among studies may be explained by the differences in the key strategies to control viral spread in different outbreaks. In COVID-19, SoD is a key strategy to mitigate community spread of the infection, along with PHM. However, in the case of SARS, PHM were emphasised to quell the outbreak. Another possible explanation for the incongruence may involve the sample characteristics in the present study. In our samples, over 80% of the participants were from Fujian. This number is significant because the Fujian group was found to have a significantly higher mean ER score than the Hong Kong group in subgroup analysis. The greater use of ER observed in the Fujian group may be attributable to the social norm to maintain close relationships within neighbourhoods and support each other in Mainland China. Although public health measures to control COVID-19 have forced the participants to isolate themselves from others with whom they used to be in close contact, they may continue to interact as usual through other means such as communication apps or social media to share their stress and difficulties.",
