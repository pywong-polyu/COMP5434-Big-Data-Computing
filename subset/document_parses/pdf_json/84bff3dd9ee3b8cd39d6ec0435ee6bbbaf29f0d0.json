Despite the severe warnings and enforcement of the \"stay-at-home\" orders after the COVID-19 outbreak, the high number of dermatology outpatient clinic visits for acne management highlights the immense psychological impact of acne in this cohort of primarily teenage patients. In addition, the increasing rates of patients with scabies, psoriasis, and urticaria indicates that these diseases may be a result of increasing anxiety and stress. These diseases may negatively impact quality of life, leading patients to seek care in dermatology clinics during this time.
