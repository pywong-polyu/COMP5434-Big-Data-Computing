            "text": "Background: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 , human mobility restriction measures have raised controversies, partly because of the inconsistent findings. An empirical study is promptly needed to reliably assess the causal effects of the mobility restriction. The purpose of this study was to quantify the causal effects of human mobility restriction on the spread of COVID-19. Methods: Our study applied the difference-in-difference (DID) model to assess the declines of population mobility at the city level, and used the log-log regression model to examine the effects of population mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19 over time after adjusting for confounders. Results: The DID model showed that a continual expansion of the relative declines over time in 2020. After 4 weeks, population mobility declined by \u00c054.81% (interquartile range, \u00c065.50% to \u00c043.56%). The accrued population mobility declines were associated with the significant reduction of cumulative COVID-19 cases throughout 6 weeks (ie, 1% decline of population mobility was associated with 0.72% [95% CI: 0.50%-0.93%] reduction of cumulative cases for 1 week, 1.42% 2 weeks, 1.69% 3 weeks, 1.72% 4 weeks, 1.64% 5 weeks, and 1.52% 6 weeks). The impact on the weekly new cases seemed greater in the first 4 weeks but faded thereafter. The effects on cumulative cases differed by cities of different population sizes, with greater effects seen in larger cities. Conclusions: Persistent population mobility restrictions are well deserved. Implementation of mobility restrictions in major cities with large population sizes may be even more important.",

            "text": "Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been used as a major strategy for mitigating the disease spread. [1, 2] In response to the serious health crisis, China has taken unprecedented measures to contain COVID-19, including Wuhan lockdown and implementation of strict NPIs nationwide. [2] Those NPIs may generally be classified into two categories. One aimed at controlling sources of infection, including treatment and isolation of confirmed cases, quarantine of exposed persons, or screening of suspicious persons who traveled from Wuhan. [3] The other was the implementation of human mobility restriction, aiming to address asymptomatic transmission or transmission before symptom onset, [4, 5] and the strategies included suspending intra-city public transport, prohibiting inter-city travels, closing entertainment venues, or banning public gatherings. [2] Among the 342 Chinese cities, 39.7% suspended intra-city public transport and 64.3% closed entertainment venues. [3] The COVID-19 epidemic in China was under control for 3 months after the outbreak. [6, 7] COVID-19 continues to spread across the world. [8] In the context of resource-limited settings (eg, lack of virus detection kits), implementing a universal coverage to detect COVID-19 cases is unlikely. The necessary personal protective measures (eg, face masking) are still in short supply. As a result, human mobility restriction has been widely used to contain COVID-19 in most countries. [9] [10] [11] However, the effectiveness of this strategy is in doubt. [12] Emerging studies investigated its effects on containing COVID-19 [3, 11, [13] [14] [15] including spatial-temporal relation between mobility restriction and disease transmission [13, 14, 16] and initial investigation about the impact of mobility restriction at the early stage. For instance, one study found that suspending intra-city public transport or closing entertainment venues was associated with the number of cases reported during the first week of outbreaks [3] ; the other suggested that travel restriction was effective at the early stage of the outbreak, but may be less useful when the disease is widespread. [17] However, distinct knowledge gaps exist about the impacts of human mobility restriction on the disease spread. In particular, the real-world effects of mobility restriction policy remain less clear, as the policy implementation may differ across regions and over time. One plausible argument is that the effects of human mobility restriction may fade over time, and a decision on the level and length of mobility restriction represents a core question for policy makers, whereby disease control and economic growth have to be balanced. All these are linked to thorough assessments on the magnitude of the effects of human mobility restrictions by time and baseline risks. Thus, we conducted a study to bridge this important gap.",

Given that Wuhan lockdown was implemented on January 23, we used that date as the starting point for implementing human mobility restrictions in China. Subsequently, we used the log-log regression model to examine the effects of mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19, after adjusting for confounders; the analyses were at the city level given the availability of data and policy implementation. We collected the number of laboratory-diagnosed cases from the National Health Commission of China, [7] Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, [18] and Provincial Health Commission from January 11, 2020 to March 11, 2020, 7 weeks after Wuhan lockdown.

In our critical analyses that assessed the effects of mobility declines on the disease spread, we found that the accrued population declines were associated with the reduction of both cumulative COVID-19 cases and new cases across the 6 weeks after the policy implementation.

First, we believe that the implementation of population mobility restrictions is appropriate and strongly needed in balancing the serious pandemic and the fatal consequences it has caused vs. the economic loss and temporary loss of personal mobility. Up to March 2020, several documents have been issued from national governmental authorities. These policy documents covered nearly all social activities across cities and rural areas, including healthcare services, education, transportation, tourism, elderly care, child welfare service, employment, work at home, and community management. Accordingly, the continual policies implementation Chinese Medical Journal 2021;134 (20) www.cmj.org resulted in prompt mobility declines, and further led to effective and rapid reduction of new cases in subsequent weeks, which would, in turn, rapidly eliminate the impact of the pandemic. Second, we may also infer from our findings that the effects of the mobility restriction policies would be large in the first few weeks, but attenuate over time. After 5 weeks, their effects became smaller. This alerts that persistent mobility restrictions are highly deserved, but flexible mobility restriction policies may be warranted particularly after several weeks of rigorous mobility restriction. Third, our study suggested larger effects among bigger cities over time, which highlighted that the implementation of mobility restrictions in major metropolises is particularly important and meaningful. Fourth, the findings strongly advised that, in resourcelimited settings where healthcare resources are not readily available, non-medical interventions may be optimal strategies in containing the disease transmission. We also believe that these strategies are not only effective in the early stage of the disease outbreak but also at the stage of widespread, because of its sheer mechanism to block population contacts at emergencies. Thus, those nations amid the disease pandemic may still consider implementing these strategies.",

[30] However, a large number of movements actually occurred before Wuhan lockdown, and such populations were likely infected or even asymptomatic patients that could lead to outbreak in cities outside Wuhan. [3] Several studies investigated the effects of other measures, [3, 11, [13] [14] [15] [33] [34] [35] among which simulations were extensively used to quantify the effects of physical distancing, early case detection or isolation, or combination of multiple measures.

            "text": "Up to now, empirical studies still fall short. [36] One early study assessed the impacts of human mobility restriction on COVID-19 cases at the first week, and the other suggested that travel restriction was more useful in the early outbreak, but attenuated if the outbreak was expanded. However, the extent to which the mobility restriction policy led to mobility decline and whether human mobility restriction causally controlled the spread of COVID- 19 were not yet established. An earlier study, using mobility data from four metropolitan areas in the United States, mainly examined the temporal correlation between the timing of public policy measures and cumulative cases of COVID-19, [16] but indicated a lack of causality because of the nature of descriptive analyses. [16] Strengths and limitations Our study has several strengths. First, we have used rigorous methods to assess the causal effects of human mobility restriction on the spread of COVID-19. We have also profiled the declines of population mobility by using the DID model, which avoided the reverse causality and confounding by the usual fluctuation of population mobility over time. Second, we included important confounders in the models with precise measurements, such as the number of times of population movements from Wuhan to imported regions, number of residents and geo-distance from Wuhan (kilometers). As a result, good model fitting is achieved (R 2 > 70%). Third, we have used thorough and real-time population mobility data to assess the impacts of NPIs during the outbreak of infectious diseases. Real-time mobility data, such as airline flights data [37, 38] and aggregated human mobility data, [22, 39] when combining with routine epidemiological surveillance, could play a crucial role during the disease pandemic. Our study also had limitations. First, the measurement of population mobility may not be optimal because not everyone uses Baidu App in their smartphones and some subgroup populations (eg, children or elderly) were not covered. Nevertheless, it covers about 55% of smartphone users in China, [20] and was well used previously. Thus, we believe that it may be nationally representative to some extent. Second, in our analyses, we assumed that the mobility restriction would be effective 1 week after the implementation of mobility restriction given the reported incubation period between 1 and 14 days. [6] This assumption may affect the resulting estimates and slight changes may occur. Third, although we have satisfied the parallel trend assumption before using DID model, the substantial difference of lockdown strategies and resumption plans might occur among Chinese cities after Wuhan lockdown. The effect examined by DID model could be affected by these factors to some extent.",

The resulting population mobility declines had a direct impact on the reduction of cumulative and new COVID-19 cases; this effect particularly had a larger effect in the first few weeks and attenuated thereafter, and was also more pronounced in larger cities. Our study confirmed that strict implementation of comprehensive population mobility restriction policies was highly warranted, particularly in large cities.",
