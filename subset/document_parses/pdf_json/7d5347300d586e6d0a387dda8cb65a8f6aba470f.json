Initial reports of common COVID-19 symptoms included fever, cough and shortness of breath, 1 but current Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines include loss of smell/taste, chills, fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion and gastrointestinal symptoms. While our understanding of COVID-19 is evolving, 2 most of the data used to inform its presentation are based on hospitalised patients 3 4 and remain focused on those initial symptoms. However, data from broader samples also confirm fatigue, loss of appetite and chills as predictive of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. 5 Symptom profiles in COVID-19 are largely based on community and hospitalised patient-reported quantitative data. 5 To date, qualitative research has largely focused on the experiences of those hospitalised by COVID-19 6 and of the healthcare Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba We conducted in depth, qualitative interviews with patients and independent clinicians about the experience of outpatient, mild-to-moderate COVID-19; to date, there have been no qualitative studies exploring the symptoms and daily life impacts of COVID-19 in this population. \u25ba This study provides unique and valuable insights from the patient perspective into the symptom experience of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and how it could impact their lives more broadly, including physical, emotional and psychological functioning. \u25ba The main limitation was that participants were predominantly white and had a young average age. \u25ba Further studies could explore the symptom trajectory in a more diverse sample and at an earlier stage of their COVID-19 experience. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 (ie, 'long COVID-19') could also be explored further.",

Fifty-two interested patients were screened for their eligibility and had the opportunity to discuss the study before providing written consent; of those, 30 met the inclusion criteria. A sample of this size was considered to be sufficient for reaching conceptual saturation 13 14 ; in the event that this was not the case, additional interviews would be planned until saturation was reached.

While others have investigated the long-term experiences of patients with COVID-19, 27 28 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to explore the experiences of non-hospitalised patients who are in the acute phase of disease and still experiencing symptoms. Symptoms were consistent with those reported by the CDC, 15 and we collected and summarised those symptoms in a clinically grounded conceptual model containing the following groups: upper and lower respiratory, systemic, gastrointestinal, and loss of or alteration in taste or smell. We consider this model to be a comprehensive representation of COVID-19 symptoms based on patients' heterogenous symptom profiles and the achievement of conceptual saturation, indicating the adequacy of the sample size; therefore, it is a basis to determine which symptoms to consider when evaluating treatment benefits in COVID-19.",

            "text": "Although the symptoms in the conceptual model can be considered comprehensive at a group level, the individual combination of symptoms per patient varied greatly. The individual patient experience also varied in terms of symptom duration, severity and timing of onset, culminating in the lack of one, clear symptomatic COVID-19 profile. This key finding is supported by clinician feedback, and is consistent with the current medical knowledge of COVID-19 manifestations and recently published narratives describing the variability with which people experience this disease. 28 Heterogeneity of altered senses of smell and taste was a key finding not described by clinicians, who commonly reported that both senses would be lost completely, often in conjunction with one another. However, patients described experiencing changes in only one of these senses or both senses non-concurrently; patients also described alterations in senses, rather than loss. This symptom was commonly reported in this study and is one of the strongest predictors of a COVID-19 infection in mild-to-moderate cases. 29 Although frequent in influenza infections, the manifestation of this symptom without other upper-respiratory symptoms is distinctive in COVID-19. 30 With regards to the daily life impacts associated with COVID-19, the emotional/psychological impacts for patients is of interest, consistent with existing qualitative research 28 31 and in line with research priorities to collect data on the mental health and psychological impacts experienced by patients with COVID-19 at all clinical stages of infection and illness. 32 The current study builds on existing research by drawing attention to the wide range of impacts experienced by outpatients with COVID-19, including physical, leisure, routine and broad ADLs. Despite interviewing outpatients with mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 (at the time of interviewing), patients reported all aspects of their daily lives as being impacted while experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. The ways in which patients' daily lives were impacted while they were experiencing symptoms played a significant role in the experience that patients depicted. Given that the impacts of daily living occurred concomitantly with symptoms, we can hypothesise that a reduction in symptoms should reduce at least some impacts described by patients. Further qualitative research should aim to understand the relationship between specific symptoms of COVID-19 and associated impacts of daily living.",

Patients, on average, completed the interview 12 days after their positive diagnosis. Further studies could explore the symptom trajectory at an earlier stage of the acute COVID-19 experience, but recruitment challenges may make this difficult, such as the time between being tested and receiving the results. Second, the participants were not of a representative racial/ethnic background, and therefore further research in a more diverse population is required as racial/ethnic disparities in illness severity have been identified across all age groups. 33 The relatively young average age of the study sample is also a limitation; age is a documented risk factor for COVID-19 infection, and older patients have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 symptoms. 34 However, younger patients did report a range of symptoms and daily life impacts, emphasising the importance of infection prevention measures in younger adults. 35 Moreover, the types of symptoms experienced by patients did not differ by participant age; further research should be conducted to confirm the differentiation of symptoms by age groups. Finally, almost half of participants described their general health as excellent or good. It is likely that patients were responding to this question based on how they perceive their health outside of the study. It would be of interest to explore the experiences of those patients with additional health concerns. Additional research should explore the symptom experience quantitatively, including long-term effects of COVID-19, through non-interventional observational studies and clinical trials.",

Existing clinical guidelines for treating outpatients with mildto-moderate COVID-19 are limited; as of April 2022, the National Institute of Health provides guidelines for those at high risk of clinical progression but does not suggest treatment methods for the remainder of the outpatient population. 37 By providing insights on the patient experience, the current study elucidates the extent to which patients' lives are impacted by having even mild-to-moderate experiences of COVID-19.
