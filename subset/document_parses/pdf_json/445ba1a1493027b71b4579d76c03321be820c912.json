It is known that heat and cold can influence a person's productivity and performance in simple tasks. With respect to social cognition, it has also been suggested that temperature impacts on relatively high-level forms of decision-making. For instance, previous research demonstrated that cold temperature promotes utilitarian judgment in a moral dilemma task. This effect could be due to psychological processing, when a cool temperature primes a set of internal representations (associated with \"coldness\"). Alternatively, the promotion of utilitarian judgment in cold conditions could be due to physiological interference from temperature, impeding on social cognition. Refuting both explanations of psychological or physiological processing, however, it has been suggested that there may be problems of reproducibility in the literature on temperature modulating complex or abstract information processing. To examine the role of temperature in moral decision-making, we conducted a series of experiments using ambient and haptic temperature with careful manipulation checks and modified task methodology. Experiment 1 manipulated room temperature with cool (21\u00b0C), control (24\u00b0C) and hot (27\u00b0C) conditions and found only a cool temperature effect, promoting utilitarian judgment as in the previous study. Experiment 2 manipulated the intensity of haptic temperature but failed to obtain the cool temperature effect. Experiments 3 and 4 examined the generalizability of the cool ambient temperature effect with another moral judgment task and with manipulation of exposure duration. However, again there were no cool temperature effects, suggesting a lack of reproducibility. Despite successful manipulations of temperature in all four experiments, as measured in body temperature and the participants' self-reported perception, we found no systematic influence of temperature on moral decision-making. A Bayesian meta-analysis of the four experiments showed that the overall data tended to provide strong support in favor of the null hypothesis. We propose that, at least in the range of temperatures",

It has also been reported that a hot temperature promotes prosocial behavior (Williams and Bargh, 2008) and enhances cooperative behavior in prisoner's dilemma tasks (Storey and Workman, 2013) . On the other hand, research has shown that a cold temperature induces lower investment in trust games (Kang et al., 2011) , tougher inferences of suspect guilt (Gockel et al., 2014) , and more utilitarian judgments in moral dilemma tasks (Nakamura et al., 2014) . These studies suggested that temperature has a considerable impact on real-world behavior beyond simple task performance. Especially, the fact that cooperative behavior and moral judgments can be affected is an important finding when considering the behavior in uncontrollable temperature environments. At the most general theoretical level, there may be two divergent types of explanations for temperature effects on social cognition. On the one hand, the physical temperature could affect people psychologically, by activating internal representations associated with different temperatures. For instance, Williams and Bargh (2008) interpreted their observations as a form of social priming, called temperature priming, whose mechanism is the activation of specific concepts linked to temperature based on embodied cognition (see also IJzerman and Semin, 2009; Gockel et al., 2014; Steinmetz and Posten, 2017; Wang, 2017) . Specifically, the physiological experience of warm temperature connects to an interpersonal impression of warmth; in terms of the perception of psychological distance, a warm temperature induces an impression of close social proximity. Cool temperature induces the opposite effects.",

In this task, the offered dilemmas reflect situations in which the subject can save a larger number of lives by sacrificing one person's life. Nakamura et al.

Specifically, Cool (21\u00b0C) and Hot (27\u00b0C) were set as the experimental temperature conditions which could be stably controlled, and 24\u00b0C, the middle value between the two experimental conditions, was adopted as the control.",

We used the new version of the task by Christensen et al. (2014) in this experiment to carefully control the composition of the dilemmas. Nakamura et al. (2014) , when manipulating temperature using a scarf, used deception to suggest that the temperature manipulation and moral judgment were completely different experiments. Here, we did not apply such deception since the temperature manipulation was ambient temperature, not tactile temperature through an object. We employed a manipulation check on the experimental temperature condition to measure the validity of the objective temperature manipulation, independent from the task performance. In addition, in accordance with the university's ethical guidelines, the participants were informed at the start of the experiment that this study related to temperature. However, the participants were not informed about the experimental conditions and research hypotheses. Thus, the details of the experimental conditions were unknown to the participants, such as how many conditions there were in this study and whether there were hotter or colder conditions than their own. Accordingly, we assumed that any specific effect from temperature would derive from implicit processes in this study, comparable to other temperature studies.",

There were 4 scenario factors (Personal force, Evitability, Benefit receptor, and Intentionality) that could affect judgment in moral dilemmas. To create a dilemma set composed of two items per combination of scenario factors, the factor of Intentionality was fixed to only Instrumental, and 16 items were selected by factorially combining the other three factors. Participants were asked to rate the moral acceptability of the proposed utilitarian action in each dilemma using a 7-point scale (1 = Completely unacceptable; 7 = Completely acceptable).",

Variation from differences of stimuli in the experiment may be considered as a random effect for analysis (Judd et al., 2012) . Therefore, a generalized linear mixed effect model with Poisson distribution was computed to treat the 16 scenarios of the moral dilemma task as a random effect, using the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015) in the R environment (Ver. 3.6.0; R Core Team, 2019). The moral judgment rating was a discrete variable, with integers from 1 to 7. Since this dependent variable reflects the frequency of events, we applied the Poisson distribution rather than the Gaussian distribution for the analysis. For other dependent variables (not based on integers or including negative values), we applied the Gaussian distribution. Temperature condition, each scenario factor in the dilemma task (Personal Force, Benefit Recipient, Evitability), and the interaction between the temperature condition and scenario factors up to three-way (e.g., temperature condition \u00d7 Personal Force \u00d7 Evitability) were modeled as fixed effects. Because there was a significant interaction between experimental condition and season on the indices of the manipulation check, season and interaction of season and experimental condition were modeled as fixed effects to rule out effects of such an interaction. Moreover, comfort ratings were different as a function of the temperature condition. There is a possibility that the temperature effect can be accounted for by comfort feeling rather than temperature setting. To examine this point, the comfort rating was also modeled as a fixed effect. Finally, the participants and stimuli (dilemma scenarios) were modeled as random effects. Categorical variables, Season (Summer/Winter), Personal Force (Personal harm/Impersonal harm), Benefit recipient (Other-Beneficial/Self-Beneficial), and Evitability (Avoidable harm/Inevitable harm) were coded as \u22120.5/+0.5 contrasts. Temperature condition was coded as a combination of two categorical variables C1 and C2 with \u22120.5/+0.5 contrasts. The Control condition was coded with C1: \u22120.5 and C2: \u22120.5; the Cool condition with C1: +0.5 and C2: \u22120.5; and the Hot condition with C1: \u22120.5 and C2: +0.5.",

Conversely, there was no significant effect of the Hot temperature condition The results showed a temperature effect on moral judgment. Previous studies reported that decision time was associated with moral judgment tendency in the moral dilemma task such that longer decision correlated with utilitarian judgment (Greene et al.,2001; Suter and Hertwig, 2011) . To examine whether temperature affected the decision time here, we computed a generalized linear mixed effect model with Gaussian distribution. The temperature conditions (C1, C2) were modeled as fixed effects. The participants and stimuli were modeled as random effects. The results showed no significant effect, neither for the Cool temperature condition (C1: b = \u22125.810, 95% CI = [\u221215.129, 3.509] , t (79) = \u22121.217, p = 0.227) nor for the Hot temperature condition (C2: b = \u22121.758, 95% CI = [\u221211.161, 7.646], t (79) = \u22120.365, p = 0.716).

The moral image task included situations depicting matters of life or death as well as less dramatic images; this was in contrast with the situation of the moral dilemma task, which always presented matters of life or death. There were no dilemmas or choices about life or death presented in the moral image task. Moreover, the moral image task only required subjects to judge the moral acceptability of the situation, whereas the judgments in the moral dilemma task required the subjects to specify their own action to resolve the situation. If the ambient cool temperature properly affects moral decision-making, inducing participants to be more \"coldhearted\" or \"cool-headed,\" significant effects from temperature should be obtained in both moral judgment tasks. If ambient cool temperature affects only the thinking in terms of sacrificial behavior toward the greater good, then significant effects from temperature should be obtained only in the moral dilemma task.",

Notably, however, our ambient temperature manipulation in Experiment 3 was not strong enough to exert a physiological influence. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between task order and temperature condition. Though there were no clear tendencies to be observed from that interaction, it is possible that the exposure duration played a complex modulating role. It is possible that, for the cool temperature effect to obtain, it is not sufficient to induce a subjective (or psychological) sense of cold. In an effort to examine this point more closely, we conducted Experiment 4 in such a way as to strengthen the temperature manipulation to ensure a physiological influence.",

Thus, we decided in Experiment 4 to focus on the exposure duration to cold, comparing between short and long exposures to a cold environment. If the difference between Experiment 1 and Experiment 3 is due to the exposure duration, then the cool temperature should promote utilitarian judgment only in the long exposure condition.

In this setting, we followed temperature studies of social judgments that set cold temperature in the range of approximately between 20\u00b0C and 22\u00b0C (e.g., Gockel et al., 2014; Wang, 2017) . However, the 21\u00b0C here reflects a cool temperature within the range used in this study, and could be interpreted as a relatively warm temperature in terms of general temperature. While this range allowed us to effectively elicit both psychological and physiological responses to the temperature conditions, it might not be strong enough to turn temperature into a salient stressor or trigger that could induce an effect on moral judgment. Thus, our findings suggest that the onset of psychological and physiological signatures of temperature does not co-occur with influences on moral judgment. Awareness of cold does not lead to a change in moral judgment. However, it is still possible that influences in the moral dilemma task arise outside the range of 21\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C, when temperature works as a more salient stressor. Especially, temperatures of less than 21\u00b0C should be examined to inspect the relationship between more salient cold temperature and moral judgment. Hancock et al. (2007) suggested an inverse U-shaped relationship between the effect size and temperature intensity. The effects would be relatively weak in the comfort zone and rapidly become stronger outside this zone. Yeganeh et al. (2018) indicated that the direction of the effect becomes more stable and stronger as the temperature difference increases. From this perspective, the question remains open how an extreme cold temperature would affect performance in the moral dilemma task.",

The process of moral judgment in moral dilemma situations is explained from dual-process theory (Greene, 2007; Greene, 2009) . In this theory, the decision in dilemma could be predicted according to whether automatic emotion or cognitive control predominates. Studies of moral dilemma revealed that manipulations that induce negative emotions like stress lead to the dominance of automatic emotion processing, and this would lead to suppressing utilitarian judgment (Starcke et al., 2012; Youssef et al., 2012) . In our study, the cool conditions consistently elicited unpleasant emotions. Nevertheless, to the extent one might discern an effect of cool temperature in certain conditions (our Experiment 1 and the work by Nakamura et al., 2014) , the tendency would be for cold to promote utilitarian judgment.",

In particular, the option to save more people by sacrificing one victim in the moral dilemma task is called utilitarian judgment; however, this does not accurately reflect utilitarian thought in the strict sense. Specifically, it was pointed out that the \"the greater good\" aspect of the genuine idea of utilitarianism may not be reflected in the tendency to answer utilitarian judgments in the moral dilemma task (Kahane et al., 2015; Crone and Laham, 2017) . Two separable dimensions have been identified regarding utilitarian thought in moral psychology (Kahane et al., 2018) . One dimension reflects the essence of utilitarianism with impartial concern for \"the greater good, \" and the other dimension involves permissiveness toward instrumental harm. Strictly speaking, the moral judgments measured in this study may not have reflected a utilitarian tendency, but the acceptability of actively sacrificing victims to save others.",

There was no significant interaction between temperature condition and any of the other scenario factors: Personal Force and temperature condition (C1: b = 0.054, 95% CI = [\u22120.106, 0.213]; C2: b = 0.060, 95% CI = [\u22120.100, 0.219]); Benefit Recipient and temperature condition (C1: b = 0.056, 95% CI = [\u22120.106, 0.213]; C2: b = \u22120.102, 95% CI = [\u22120.265, 0.059]). Comfort rating also had no effect (b = 0.000, 95% CI = [\u22120.055, 0.055]).",
