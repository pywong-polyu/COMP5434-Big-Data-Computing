The concept of decentralized or hybrid clinical trials has rapidly gained currency, given that it aims to reduce patient burden, increase patient enrollment and retention, and preserve quality of life, while also increasing the efficiency of trial logistics. Therefore, the clinical trial environment is moving toward remote collection and assessment of data, transitioning from the classic site-centric model to one that is more patient-centric.",

            "text": "In recent years, and especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly clear that the traditional methods of conducting clinical trials need to change in order to bring newer medicines to patients in a more cost-effective and expedited manner. Clinical trial logistics have traditionally placed the hospital or clinic at its core, a model termed site-centric. The disadvantages of this model are becoming clearer, and the concept of redesigning the clinical trial logistics with the patient at its core is gaining support. Such a patient-centric model may facilitate patient enrollment and retention, reduce the burden of multiple extra visits to the site to comply with trial requirements, and mitigate the disruption in adhering to the protocol requirements during periods of difficulty in accessing the site, such as during a public health emergency. This is likely to reduce instances of protocol deviation and ultimately improve data quality and integrity. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] It has been estimated that only a small minority of patients with cancer, ranging from about 5% in the USA 7, 8 to 14% in the UK, 9 participate in clinical trials. Socioeconomic factors, lack of available clinical trials, not meeting eligibility criteria, and aspects related to the attitudes of patients and physicians are the main factors for such low participation rates. 7, 8 In this regard, physician engagement plays a key role in patient enrollment to trials, which can drive patient recruitment and retention and thus impact in the success of the study. A variety of elements influence physician attitudes to enrolling their patients into clinical studies, from lack of awareness of available trials, complexity of trial eligibility criteria, site accessibility (since this may affect patient compliance), resource constrains in supporting staff, extra workload on investigators, and even financial incentives. [10] [11] [12] The Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation (CISCRP) ran a global survey in 2017 to explore the participation in clinical trials. It revealed that a lack of patient's awareness of clinical trials (\u223c61%) and the distance to the clinical site (60%) were the main barriers for patients to participate in a clinical trial. 13 Additionally, sponsors and contract research organizations (CROs) influence study site selection based on prior experience, 14 site capacity and reputation, and physician expertise, which may have the unintended consequence of limiting equity in clinical trial participation.",

            "text": "Decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), also variously known as a site-less, 15, 16 direct-to-patient, 17 hybrid [17] [18] [19] remote, 20, 21 or virtual clinical trials, 16, 22 are focus on patient-centricity, rather than site-centricity, giving patients considerably more flexibility in the way they participate. DCTs enable remote data and sample collection, including from the patient's home or other convenient locations in order to reduce burden on patients and their caregivers. DCTs also have the potential to partially bridge the gap between the current gold standard of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with their rigid rules, central laboratories, and physician-verified data on the one hand, and a more \"realworld\" paradigm of flexibility, local laboratories, patientsupplied data via wearables and mobile applications (apps) on the other. 23 This approach has gathered support from regulatory agencies, 24, 25 and in December 2018, the FDA announced a new strategic framework to advance the use of real-world evidence to support the development of drugs and biologics 26 and in November 2020 published a new guidance called \"Enhancing the Diversity of Clinical Trial Populations -Eligibility Criteria, Enrollment Practices, and Trial Designs.\" This new guidance reflects FDA's support to DCT solutions such as digital health technology, and the use of mobile medical professionals, that is, nurses and phlebotomist as a way to reduce patient burden, but as well provides advice to increase enrollment of minorities not previously included in clinical trials. 27 In addition, based on the changes to trial methodology since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has recently requested the applicants of new drug application/biological license application (NDA/BLA) to indicate in the datasets whether the data were collected remotely or at the trial site, in order to learn about the opportunities and challenges of the use of DCT solutions. 28 The acceptance of this new research model will increase the use of technological advances, but the adoption of these solutions depends on different factors such as how the health system is organized, investment in infrastructure and accessibility to technology, regulatory barriers, 29 and internet connectivity in remote areas, which may all vary between countries with different per capita income, but also within countries. In countries that have a stronger health care system and adequate investment in innovation, technology, and health infrastructure, the implementation of DCT solutions may be easier than in countries with lower incomes. 30 Nevertheless, despite the advantages that the new technologies can bring, the perception of losing human contact between the patient and his/her physician can be challenging. Investment of time and effort will be necessary to generate enough confidence in all stakeholders toward this new methodology. As such, it will require education and training of clinicians, the research team, patients, and their caregivers in order to highlight key benefits, including equity in the accessibility to clinical trials. 2, 31, 32 Available DCT solutions include (a) mobile apps that can help patients and caregivers with study alerts and reminders, schedule study visits, and collect data remotely through electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) of treatment related symptoms, among others. Such apps, customized to individual trials, could also help impart education to the patients, for example, how to recognize symptoms of concern, how to manage expected toxicities expeditiously, and so on; (b) the use of tele-visits to reduce patient and caregiver site burden (i.e. travel, parking, avoid hold in the waiting area) and exposure to a potentially infectious environment by replacing some on-site visits, allowing more family members to participate in discussions with the investigator and decision making, facilitate access to clinical trials, reduce disparities in cancer care in rural areas, and enable sites to perform clinical assessments remotely; (c) allowing mobile nurses and phlebotomists to go to patient's homes or other agreedupon locations to collect blood, urine, and other biologic samples for safety labs and pharmacokinetic analysis, and to enable mobile nurses to perform clinical assessments commensurate with local licensure limitations; and (d) the use of wearable devices to remotely monitor vital signs such as heart rate, respiration, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and temperature, which could help in the early detection of treatment-related toxicities; such devices could also track activities of daily living such as sleep duration and quality, step count, time in sedentary position, etc., which can be correlated with ePRO and may assist in a more objective assessment of ECOG/performance status. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] However, there is no one solution that fits all approaches of study execution. A case-by-case evaluation will be required, based on the clinical trial, objectives and endpoints, and patient population. Additionally, the value of reducing duration of an on-site visit versus fully remote visit needs to be carefully assessed in order to select the best approach.

In May 2020, Informa Connect surveyed 180 clinical trial professionals globally, encompassing CRO, investigator site, patient advocacy group, and regulators, among others. There was a wide variation in the adoption of DCT solutions in the different medical areas, the top five being insomnia, smoking cessation, Parkinson's disease, coronavirus, and type 1 diabetes. However, the adoption of these newer methods by the oncology subspecialty was in the lowest position, which may be partially explained by the complexity of inclusion criteria, type of treatment (infusion administration), and the frequent requirement of tumor response assessments. 39 Labcorp drug development, previously called Covance, a global research organization focused on oncology and patient-centric trial design, surveyed oncologists and patients with cancer in order to gauge clinical trial experience understand their knowledge and familiarity with DCT solutions and how the move to a more decentralized model will affect the way they conduct or participate in such trials, which is presented in this paper.",

However, despite of the acceptation, still the implementation of DCTs is in the start-up moments and the opinions are not uniforms. There is an important consensus among oncologist participants in this survey that oncologist patients are typically motivated with the option to be referred to a clinical trial and willing to cooperate with the logistic and requirement of them. DCTs will help them to reduce transportation issue, site visits, and family burden. However, someone still considers that as oncology patients are a fragile population managing toxicity by patients using apps will increase extra work to the patients what can trigger in reluctance to participate in trials which may require it. On the other hand, oncology patients have a chronic disease and need a lot of psychological care, which these solutions will not be able to supply, unless through the use of telemedicine, which cannot replace the human contact.",

In addition to patient advocacy groups awareness efforts and potentially social media outreach, 47 DCT solutions will be another important tool in the clinical trial field to support patient access and participation and to advance on the use of real world data. However, despite the fact that the findings in this survey show the positive acceptance of implementing DCT solutions in oncology, the responses also identify the necessity to guarantee data integrity and protection. This will require investment in training and education to provide confidence in all stakeholders involved in this space, with particular focus on supporting the patient's journey thorough the new clinical trial pathway model.",
