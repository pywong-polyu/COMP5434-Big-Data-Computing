The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in more than 6,700,000 infections and 390,000 deaths worldwide. Coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by this virus. In this project concept, we aim to focus on the peptide-protein interaction analysis using two important drug targets in SARS-CoV-2 such as spike (S) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein. These proteins play an important role in the virus entry and encapsidation of the viral particles. Motifs or functional regions in these two proteins must be sharing sequence homology with human protein (ACE2) which may be involved in the binding mechanism. The results will show a set of motif regions which can disrupt the viral infection. Once we identify these sets of antigenic determinant regions, antibody binding activity studies can be performed by in vitro methods. Our results from this study may suggest the existence of antigenic mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and host proteins. The hit peptide components will have therapeutic applications to be developed into a wide variety of medicinal formulations against SARS-CoV-2 such as vaccine, intranasal and inhalation formulations. Also, the choice of conserved regions will lead to development of cross protective therapeutics against wide range of coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity against particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigens specific for B and T cells. Peptide vaccines have a whole lot of advantages though they suffer from certain challenges such as low immunogenicity, susceptibility to enzymatic digestion etc. (Skwarczynski and Toth 2016) . Advanced bioinformatics tools and databases help to speed up and design peptide-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 where peptides could be used as ligands (Abdelmageed et al. 2020) . The viable approach in designing peptide vaccines should be to identify peptide epitopes on the immunogens and to use synthetic versions of these peptides. Since these vaccines are totally synthetic, they would not carry the risk of reversion or of complete inactivation, and in principle; epitopes could be selected to avoid components that give rise to unwanted side effects (https ://www. who.int/biolo gical s/publi catio ns/trs/areas /vacci nes/pepti de/WHO_TRS_889_A1.pdf?ua=1). Also, peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe, and their selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses (Dudek et al. 2010) . Studies shows that effective vaccines can be developed using T cell and B cell epitopes comprising the immunome, which constitutes the immune system (Groot et al. 2008; Tahir ul Qamar et al. 2019) . Epitopes are short amino acid sequences of a protein which can induce an immune response and epitope finding is quite expensive and laborious. The use of in silico methods are an alternative and effective strategy due to the importance in biomedical applications such as vaccine design, disease diagnostics, biomarker studies etc. (Bahrami et al. 2019; Backert and Kohlbacher 2015) . There are many peptide vaccines in development, such as vaccine for AIDS by the virus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Liu et al. 2007) , malaria (Epstein et al. 2007 ), anthrax (Oscherwitz et al. 2010 ), human papilloma virus (HPV) (Solares et al. 2011 ). Our hypothesis is based on the fact that, epitope region of the drug targets which share the sequence identity and similarity to human proteins may be involved in their binding and fusion to human cells (Hwa et al. 2008 ).",

Coronavirus entry into host cell is mediated by the transmembrane Spike (S) glycoprotein that forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface (Tortorici and Veesler 2019). S comprises two functional subunits responsible for binding to the host cell receptor (S 1 subunit) and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (S 2 subunit). SARS-CoV-2 and several SARS-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) interact directly with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via S to enter target cells (Song et al. 2018; Kirchdoerfer et al. 2018; Ge et al. 2013) . As the coronavirus S glycoprotein is surfaceexposed and mediates entry into host cells, it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) upon infection and the focus of therapeutic and vaccine design. After binding of RBD in S1 subunit of S protein on the virion to the ACE2 receptor on the target cell, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) domains in its S2 subunit interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core, bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion and infection (Bosch et al. 2004 ).",

Also, the ACE2binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 subunit of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10-to 20-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV which may contribute to the higher infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV (Wrapp et al. 2020) . Sequence alignment studies also show that S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share consensus regions with 92.6% and 100% in HR1 and HR2 domains, respectively (Xia et al. 2020) .

            "text": "Our results may suggest the molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 drug target protein sequences (spike and nucleocapsid) and human proteins. Our study will use immunoinformatics tools to identify the possible epitopes of spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2. These epitopes can be the ideal candidates to formulate the initial component to develop a therapy against COVID-19 either in the form of peptide and sera based vaccine, based on the selected antigenic determinants. However, our analysis will require several in vitro and in vivo validations before formulating the therapeutic products to resist COVID-19. Antibody binding activity of these motifs will be performed in vitro to evaluate the neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection or participate in the immunopathogenesis induced by SARS-CoV-2. Our studies on the mimicry motifs of S and N protein, may provide approaches to inhibit or disrupt the infection of SARS-CoV-2. The peptides selected from the study after testing for toxicity in vivo, can have wide range of applications-be made into vaccines or intranasal and inhalation formulations. Also, since these peptides are selected on the basis of their binding specificity to regions Peptide Synthesizer, RT-PCR, ELISA system of the viral proteins that are highly conserved across various coronaviruses, the execution of such therapeutic approaches could lead to cross-protective antibody responses against future coronavirus epidemics and pandemics and help us be better prepared for the next novel coronavirus outbreak.
