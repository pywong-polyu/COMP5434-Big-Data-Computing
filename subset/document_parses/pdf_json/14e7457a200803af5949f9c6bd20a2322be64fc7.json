However, this is mainly explained by the restrictions imposed by the Italian government regarding outpatient's hospital services. In fact, the overall availability for consultation was decreased, as a consequence of lockdown policy and reduced healthcare personnel.

To this regard, the increased psychological distress resulting mainly after lockdown period, on top of the pathophysiological mechanisms in COVID-19 affected individuals, represents one of the main drivers of sexual dysfunctions in the \"general\" population. On the other hand, in our experience of an Andrology unit in Italy, in 2020, male population could have underestimated the pathological disorders causing reproductive dysfunction, perceived as \"less urgent\" reasons, and such other severe andrological abnormalities, postponing controls and screening. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude whether the reduced request for infertility consultation could be a consequence of the reduced interest for sexual activity.",
