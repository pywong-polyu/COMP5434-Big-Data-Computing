The design of vaccines and choice of therapies 6 depends on the structure and mutational stability of encoded proteins in the open 7 reading frames(ORFs) of this genome. In this study, we computed, using Expectation 8 Reflection, the genome-wide covariation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome based on an 9 alignment of \u2248 130000 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences obtained from 10 GISAID. We used this covariation to compute the Direct Information between pairs of 11 positions across the whole genome, investigating potentially important relationships 12 within the genome, both within each encoded protein and between encoded proteins. 13 We then computed the covariation within each clade of the virus. The covariation 14 detected recapitulates all clade determinants and each clade exhibits distinct covarying 15 pairs.",

Because inference 88 with ER relies on mutations at a given position we must consider the resulting number of 89 columns, or incidence, after such curation. In addition, region-specific incidence may also 90 underline importance to the efficacy of the virus because higher incidence represents more 91 variation and mutation.

In December 2019, this pneumonia-like disease re-emerged 20 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and the novel beta-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was iden-21 tified as the causative agent [Zhu et al., 2020]. The genome was first characterized by 22 Wu et al. in December 2019 [Wu et al., 2020]. Since then the SARS-CoV-2 virus has 23 spread relentlessly all over the world and been declared a worldwide pandemic with 24 79 million cases leading to 1.7 million deaths to date [World Health Organization, 2020, 25 John Hopkins University, 2020]. SARS-CoV-2 is an +ssRNA virus belonging to the coron-26 aviridae family major genera Betacoronavirus [Gorbalenya et al., 2020]. The viral genome 27 encodes several open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, 28 ORF8, ORF10. These ORFs encode for several non-structural proteins (NSPs) while 29 there are specific regions encoding the spike glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane 30 glycoprotein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The genome (NC_045512.2, 29870 nu-31 cleotides long) of the virus can be broken into 11 encoding regions: ORF1ab (266-21555), the reference genome is used for most investigations, there is also an abundance 36 of data available which can be used to monitor variations in the genome and analyse the 37 the evolution and nature of the virus. This data was assembled by GISAID to document 38 different strains of the virus in a new database: EpiCoV. With the first viral entry on January 39 10 2020, the database has grown to 292,000 submissions [Shu & McCauley, 2017].

Comparative RNA 48 sequence sequence analysis has long been used to investigate co-evolution via covariance 49 of nucleotide mutations (30,31) with difficulty arising in the separating of indirect and 50 direct interactions that lead to such co-variation. A similar issue in inferring protein 51 residue interactions was addressed by Lapedes et al. [Lapedes et al., 2012] and many later 52 groups [Cocco et al., 2018, Nguyen et al., 2017, Weigt et al., 2009] any ab initio inference problem, when inferring co-evolutionary interactions between 78 nucleotide positions in the SARS CoV-2 genome, we must consider certain properties of 79 the data at hand. As an example, the length of the full genome is approximately 29000 80 nucleotide positions. However, when we consider genome positions in which no single 81 nucleotide is expressed more than 95% of the time (95% conserved), the relevant positions 82 are reduced by approximately two-thirds. Decreasing the conserved percentage decreases 83 the number of allowed repetitions in a given position (data column). In other words, as 84",

Showing the interaction map for the S V Clade Interaction Map. Showing the interaction map for the V work we have presented a novel analysis of the SARS CoV-2 genome by finding 277 genome interactions both within and across encoding regions. In our analysis of the SARS 278 CoV-2 genome we have presented several perspectives on nucleotide interactions in the 279 genome. These interactions showed both proximal interactions within individual encod-280 ing regions as well as distal interactions between different encoding regions throughout 281 the genome. We inferred nucleotide position interactions for the entire genome as well 282 as the separate encoding regions. Particular attention was given to the ORF1ab and S 283 regions, which demonstrated the highest variability in the given dataset. We were able 284 to draw analogous conclusions from previous work by inferring the the most common 285 variations previously reported [U\u011furel et al., 2020]. Additionally, our genome-wide inter-286 action maps expressed determinant positions of all clades available at the time our data was 287 acquired [Mercatelli & Giorgi, 2020]. Generating interaction maps of individual clades 288 showed clade-specific coevolution of nucleotide positions. 289 We further considered the level of variability, both within regions of the full genome 290 data set and for different clades. This was accomplished by varying the threshold for 291 conserved columns while considering the retained column incidence. This relationship 292 shows nucleotide variability is different both between encoding regions of the full genome 293 and between different clades. Region-specific incidences are not consistent between clades, 294 with individual regions expressing different variability in different clades. Comparison of 295 region-specific incidence can also give intuition on the level of variability or specific regions 296 within specific clades. 297 Our work shares significant similarities in results with the work of Zeng et al.

We inferred 5 of the 8 epistatic links described in their work with 300 the notable exception of not inferring 3 interaction pairs: (17858, 18060), (17747, 17858) 301 and (17747, 18060) in the ORF1ab region. This exclusion is likely due to the larger data-set 302 used in our analysis as those links were removed during post-processing due to insignificant 303 DI scoring (< .1). Another notable difference between the results and methodology of 304 this work and that of [Zeng et al., 2020] is in the consideration of inherited significance. 305 It should be noted that phylogenetic statistical analysis is a deep subject and there is a 306 great deal of subtlety regarding the applicability of simple approaches like randomiza-307 tion [Martins & Hansen, 1996]. [Zeng et al., 2020] utilize phylogenetic randomization to 308 filter out insignificant inferences that arise only due to phylogenetic relationships. We 309 simply use data-driven clade stratification to remove such effects. This stratification in turn 310 yields novel sets of interactions which are clade specific and therefore are unlikely to be 311 influenced by shared inheritance. In the absence of clade determinant positions however, 312 the use of phylogenetic randomization by [Zeng et al., 2020] would be necessary. 4 Materials and Methods 321 4.1 Ising model covariation analysis 322 We use the standard Ising model analogy first applied to protein sequences by Lapedes et 323 al [Lapedes et al., 2012]. This basic method has been applied by many groups with small 324 refinements on how the couplings of the Ising model are actually computed. We formulated 325 the Ising model coupling calculation in terms of logistic regression with one-hot encoding of 326 the genome sequences. As there is no closed form solution to logistic regression problems, 327 essentially all methods for finding coefficients are iterative. The particular algorithm we 328 used to find the logistic regression coefficients was Expectation Reflection which has been 329 demonstrated to perform well in the limit of for small sample sizes [Hoang et al., 2019b], 330 but the results do not differ appreciably from logistic regression with regularization as im-331 plemented in the Scikit-learn Python package, for example. Indeed, the Scikit-learn logistic 332",

This transformation converts a nucleotide into a binary representation, us to convert the genome sequence set into a binary sequence set. Therefore336 the previous sequence in Equation 1 becomes = OneHot( we have established the conversion of a set of genetic sequences into a set of 338 binary variables we can continue to the computation of the interactions between these 339 binary variables. Given a binary variable ( ) representing the \u210e sequence such that 340 with \u2208 [1, = 137686] sequences, or states, which the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome can 341 take.

This conditional relationship allows us to iteratively 350 search for the ideal using all available sequences. The method, and resulting algorithm, 351 is discussed in further detail in previous work [Hoang et al., 2019a, Hoang et al., 2019b]. 352 The concept of how to go from the coefficient matrix to a measure of interaction strength 353 between sequence position pairs we take from [Weigt et al., 2009, Morcos et al., 2011, 354 Ekeberg et al., 2014, De Leonardis et al., 2015].
