            "text": "I examine to what extend the financial crisis of 2008 affected levels of individual satisfaction with governments in general and three policy areas in particular; the economy, health services and education. I use data from the European Social Survey (9 rounds, 2002-2018, 14 countries, approx.195000 observations). Running Interrupted Time Series regressions I find that, on aggregate, there was a decrease of satisfaction with the government and the economy immediately after the crisis, but an increase for health and educational services. Longer term, satisfaction gradually increased for all the four indicators examined. In separate regressions for each country, a consistent pattern of behavior emerges. Where the short-term effect on satisfaction was negative, the long-term effect was positive, and vice versa. The switch, from short-term negative to long-term positive effect, could be attributed to the successful efforts of governments to correct the immediate adverse effects of the crisis. On the contrary, some individuals seeing the problems other countries faced, applauded their own government's short term performance in handling the crisis. With the passing of time however, they gradually became more critical. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to implement policies reviving the economy and improving services in health and the education sectors, amongst others. Results of this study may be used when measuring and evaluating the effects of the current pandemic.",

Naturally, the immediate effects were felt in the tourism, transportation, restaurant and entertainment sectors, and where big individual financial commitments are made such as the real estate and the car industries. Economic activity came to an abrupt stop because everything closed within a few days. That in turn caused thousands of layoffs and an upsurge in unemployment claims. Governments and central banks hurried to support the collapsing system by promising subsidies, loans with better terms and occasionally free money to those immediately affected firms and individuals alike. Work from home suddenly became the norm. Schools and universities were closed. Despite initial difficulties, teaching was soon conducted via the web.

Must countries with exceedingly high debt to GDP ratios nonetheless attempt to borrow from the financial markets to revive their economies? 4 The COVID-19 pandemic is still an ongoing event that no one knows how it will actually develop in the future. The second wave observed during the autumn of 2020 struck with greater intensity than many had estimated. Some acknowledge that a third wave might be on its way in the spring of 2021. Regardless of the virus's potency, however, its repercussions on billions of people will be felt for years to come. The sudden and extreme measures imposed by governments to fight the pandemic, combined with the fear of contracting the lethal virus itself, have generated considerable anxiety and mental illness amongst the general population (Fofana et al. 2020) . Vaccines to immunize against the virus have been produced and have recently received licensing. Nonetheless, even if these vaccinations are implemented in sufficient numbers for the general population, it will take a considerable amount of time for socioeconomic conditions to return to pre-virus period levels. It is thus interesting from a sociological perspective to investigate how individuals reacted in the short-and long-term, during another calamity of the recent past.",

It was the subprime problem in the US that burst, bankrupted Lehman Brothers and created a tsunami of financial collapses initially and fiscal problems in many countries later (Ervasti et al., 2019 (Ervasti et al., , p. 1210 . The two crises are indeed not completely comparable. A significant difference is the mindset of the people affected by both. In 2008 many were suddenly faced with a financial collapse and the uncertainty of the potential unemployment ahead. With the COVID-19 pandemic the negative financial repercussions are only one aspect. The restrictions on movement due to lockdowns and, as discussed above, the fear of contracting the lethal virus have created even harsher living conditions for millions. And yet, the two crises are similar at a more 1 https ://www.bbc.com/news/busin ess-52113 841. 2 https ://www.bbc.com/news/busin ess-52350 082. 3 For example, on June 4, 2020, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced among other measures that \"\u2026the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) will be increased by 600 billion to a total of 1,350 billion euro\". (https ://www.ecb.europ a.eu/press /pr/date/2020/html/ecb.mp200 604~a307d 3429c .en.html) 4 Additional borrowing from the financial markets increases a country's sovereign dept. As discussed above due to the crisis and the lockdown, the GDP will decrease. Hence the debt to GDP ratio will become even higher. macro level. They were both sudden crises, were generated by exogenous events and they effected directly or indirectly all countries around the globe. 5 In examining the 2008 crisis we have the opportunity to investigate how different countries coped with the sudden exogenous shock, both short and long term. In particular, we can examine the opinions of citizens about their governments and how they evaluate the policies on the economy, education and health services. This might provide a gauge in the future for comparing it to the current COVID-19 crisis. The European Social Survey (ESS) has the suitable data for this. Respondents are asked how satisfied they are with their government, the economy, education and the health services. All these four indicators provide a reasonable assessment of how citizens evaluate their government. Although the majority of the literature is focusing on the level of trust citizens have in political and impartial institutions, examining the satisfaction level with respect to specific policies is a more direct and practical approach in measuring the success or failure of government activities concretely. Morgeson (2014, p. 7) asserts that the satisfaction of citizens refers to the \"\u2026individual citizens' (in the aggregate) happiness or contentment (or what another author called \"fulfillment response\") with an experience or experiences with the services (or goods, or processes, or programs) provided by the government bureaucracies and administrative institutions.\" Surveys measuring satisfaction of citizens with governments in general but also with different policies in particular, have been conducted since the 1970s. They have been popular especially with regard to services provided at local and municipal level (Stipak 1979) . Such surveys have been conducted with increasing frequency in recent years (Dutil et al. 2010, p.31; Howard 2010, p. 66) .",

(2017, p. 796 ) note, the \"democratic rule\" implies that there is a connection between the citizens and the state and that citizens' preferences are considered by the political institutions that govern the country. Huber and Powell (1994, p. 293) even assert that what constituents prefer, is best represented by the preferences of the median voter. This feedback approach also has a theoretical framework similar to that discussed in Campbell (2012) ; it resembles the responsive approach due to the democratic obligations of elected governments. It says that policies obviously influence citizens' behavior, which then gives feedback (sometimes \"feed forward\" to describe the temporal ordering of things) and thus influences future policy formulation and implementation (Ziller 2019, p. 287) .",

            "text": "The feedback process is not geared solely towards the government's performance, in general. There are instances where feedback focuses on specific policies and measures. For example citizens are concerned about education and health care policies, among others (Stecker and Tausendpfund 2016, p. 496) . Moreso, voters are eager to evaluate their governments' economic performance because depending on its success, it can affect directly their wellbeing. The evidence on the link between economic performance and citizens' satisfaction goes back many decades and remains topical. (see for example, Fiorina (1978) Furthermore, satisfaction with government policies is closely correlated with another very popular theme in social and political sciences, trust. Most authors would agree that satisfaction is a prerequisite for trust. Van de Walle and Bouchaert (2003, p. 892) state that many accept the implicit assumption that \"\u2026better performing public services will lead to increased satisfaction among their users, and this, in turn, will lead to more trust in government.\" This has shown to be true both regarding trust with the government in general, but also with specific policies in particular. For example Van Ryzin et al (2004, p.332 ) have used the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) model to capture the process through which residents of New York evaluate the different services provided by the city. They clearly show that satisfaction with the government comes temporarily before trust (ibid, p. 333, Fig. 2 ). Within his own theoretical model, Vigoda-Gadot (2007, p. 290 , Fig. 1 ) depicts a similar relationship. Finally, satisfaction with particular services such as health care is also mentioned as a prerequisite for trust in the government (Christensen and Laegreid 2005) .",

Thus, the same controls have been used not only in models measuring satisfaction but trust as well, where research is even more extensive. (see, for example Brewer et al.( 2004, p.102) , Fridberg and Kangas (2008, pp.79-82) , Arpino and Obydenkova ( 2020, p.409 ,  Table 3 ), Torrente et. al.

Specifically, Rudolph and Evans (2005, p.661 ) find that at the individual level, political trust matters more to conservatives than to liberals. Jost et al. (2009) also find that political ideology is a factor that is accepted as important when measuring people's attitudes towards officials who govern. Also Haugsgjerd (2018, p.628 ) uses household income, educational background, employment status, age and gender as controls in his regressions measuring trust. Finally Currie et al. (2015) investigated how the great recession affected mothers' health. They found that mothers with less education, unmarried and from minorities experienced a greater deterioration in their health compared to those who were white, married and had gone to college.",

For a non-experimental ex-post evaluation-as it is the case here -the best case scenario is having 2 populations, with measurements on the indicator of interest; one that is exposed to the treatment and the other that is not exposed. Preferably the observations cover the periods before and after the intervention, for some time. However since the classification is not done at random, it becomes problematic because we do not have two groups of data that differ by just that exposure to the intervention, on average. This, in turn, implies that their measured differences in the indicator might not be solely due to this intervention (Holland 1986; Imbens and Wooldridge 2009 ). An even weaker scenario is where the intervention covers all the available population. As I show later, this compels us to approximate the counterfactual population using a very weak assumption on its behavior; that it will continue to behave the same post-treatment, as during pre-treatment. This in fact is the main methodological constraint with the current data and the research questions. On the other hand, measurements on the indicators of interest are present, both pre-and post-intervention. Hence, we can perhaps identify trends in growth, positive or negative, before and after 2008, the seminal year during which the crisis erupted.",

The other weakness in the design is that the surveys in these two rounds occur at different times.

Therefore it is natural to expect a \"temporal heterogeneity\" of conditions, and consequently of behaviour.

I only have about half such instances in my data (4 rounds before and 5 rounds after). Although estimations can be calculated, they result in coefficient confidence intervals that are too narrow, consequently exaggerating precision. In such cases it is recommended that one runs the models using repeated samples via bootstrapping (Efron and Tibshirani 1993; cited in Zhang et al. 2009, p.146) . 12 Abiding by the standard rules of ITS analysis, the following segmented regression model is used: Y depicts levels of satisfaction.

Note that the country dummy coefficients do not always have the same sign across the 4 models and their mean satisfaction differences come out statistically significant. Following Venetoklis (2019, pp. 3042-3043) , for each of the four dependent variables of interest, I run 14 separate Interrupted Time Series OLS regressions. With these I depict the slope (growth rate) before the crisis, the change -if any -in the levels of satisfaction during the two-year period immediately after the crisis and the difference in slopes (growth rates) between the period before and after the crisis. In essence, I interact the country dummy with the control variables in each of the Models 1-4. Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 show the results of the models for each dependent variable of interest (satisfaction with government, the economy, health services and education). Each table contains 14 models, one for each country examined. I list the 3 coefficients of interest, b 1 , b 2 and b 3 with their statistical significance. For b 2 I also calculate the respective elasticity, that is, how much satisfaction changed percentage wise from 2008 to 2010. 14",

After the crisis, the slopes of all indicators came out statistically significant with Table 7 Short (STE) and long-term (LTE) effects of the 2008 crisis on satisfaction a positive sign. Comparing the pre-and post-crisis slopes, satisfaction with the government in general and with the economy in particular grew faster after the crisis. The opposite was the case for health services and education policies. Their slopes grew as well, but at a pace slower than before the crisis. Applying the same analysis for each country separately, the results were mixed. There was no indication of any country with consistently low or high coefficient values for any of the four satisfaction indicators. In the four pairs of Figures for each type of satisfaction (Figs. 1 and 5, 2 and 6, 3 and 7, 4 and 8) we see interesting behavior patterns within each country. In the majority of cases (20 + 23 = 43 out of 56) if the short-term effect (STE) is negative (N), the long-term effect (LTE) is positive (P) and viceversa. Table 7 depicts these effects for each country and each type of measured satisfaction. Overall, short-and long-term effects of the 2008 crisis seem to have balanced out. The switch from short-term negative to long-term positive satisfaction could be interpreted as reflecting the successful efforts of governments to correct the immediate dissatisfaction felt by many due to the 2008 crisis. In contrast, the long-term reduction in satisfaction compared to the short-term positivity is not as easily explained. It could be that some individuals seeing the problems other countries faced applauded their own government's short-term performance in handling the crisis. Long-term however, they became more critical, both overall and regarding the three individual policies under scrutiny.",

Nonetheless, by choosing only those countries that participated in all the survey rounds, I created a longer time series cross-sectional data set, and thus was able to run the ITS regression models. Furthermore, the ITS design requires at least 8 observational instances for the two periods, before and after the exogenous intervention. Since in my dataset I had only 9 in total (4 + 5), I bootstrapped all the models to ensure that the confidence intervals of the variable coefficients were of the correct size. Consequently this made the statistical significance of the coefficients more robust. Lastly, there is the school of thought which argues that, regardless of survey results, people respond to their evaluation of governments based not on facts, but on pre-existing beliefs (Hvidman 2019, p. 265) . I did not test this assertion. This may indeed be a topic for future research wherein one combines evaluative responses on specific government policies with general perceptions on the functions and ethics of public sector officials and politicians.",

In countries such as Finland and Norway, where the death toll per million is relatively low, satisfaction with health services could end up being much higher compared for example to Belgium, Spain, the UK or France. Further, satisfaction with the economy will most probably be inversely correlated to the magnitude of the net GDP loss during 2020 and 2021. This is because reduction in GDP usually means revenue losses, bankruptcies, higher unemployment and fewer investments. In addition, both the COVID-19 number of victims and the GDP figures may also affect satisfaction with the government, in general. Finally, when it comes to the satisfaction with education, it is difficult to evaluate in advance how it will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It will perhaps depend on the operational instructions given by each country's ministry of education, on the technological infrastructure already in place for distance learning in each country, on whether employers encourage work from home or other arrangements.",
