The paper proposes a modified Wells-Riley model for risk analysis in public transportation systems to capture the passenger flow characteristics, including spatial and temporal patterns in terms of number of boarding, alighting passengers, and number of infectors. The model is utilized to assess overall risk as a function of OD flows, actual operations, and factors such as mask wearing, and ventilation. The model is integrated with a microscopic simulation model of subway operations (SimMETRO). Using actual data from a subway system, a case study explores the impact of different factors on transmission risk, including maskwearing, ventilation rates, infectiousness levels of disease and carrier rates. In general, mask-wearing and ventilation are effective under various demand levels, infectiousness levels, and carrier rates. Maskwearing is more effective in mitigating risks.

Figure 4a shows the impact on risk of mask-wearing under various demand levels. When the demand levels are lower than 30% the risk is relatively low, and the differences among the various maskwearing cases are small.

Figure 5a shows the risk heatmap for Scenario 1 at 100% and 60% demand levels, under combinations of ventilation and mask-wearing factors. Lower ventilation and mask-wearing rates result in higher transmission risk. However, differences exist between the two demand levels. At 100% demand, risk levels vary with changes in ventilation rates as well as with changes in mask-wearing popularity. With 70% ventilation rate and 0% mask-wearing rate, the risk is 60% higher than with 100% ventilation. With 100% mask-wearing rate, the risk levels are relatively low regardless of ventilation rates. At 60% demand and mask-wearing rate above 90%, the overall risk levels remain as low as 10% of the base case for all ventilation rates. On the other hand, if no one is wearing a mask, the transmission risk changes significantly as a function of the ventilation rate. The results confirm the importance of mask-wearing in mitigating the transmission risk in public transportation. Even with under-performing ventilation, the transmission risk remains relatively low if more than 90% of the passengers wear masks. Figure 5b shows the results for Scenario 2. The heatmaps illustrate the risk under combinations of mask-wearing rates and infectiousness levels. With 100% demand, risk levels vary with changes in infectiousness as well as with changes in mask-wearing rates. With infectiousness of 270 quanta per hour, the transmission risk with 0% mask-wearing is more than 2 times higher than with 100% mask-wearing. When mask-wearing is 100%, the risk levels are relatively low for all infectiousness levels. At 60% demand, and mask-wearing rate higher than 80%, the risk levels remain as low as 10% of the base case for all infectiousness values. On the other hand, if the mask-wearing rate is 0%, the transmission risk changes significantly with changes in the infectiousness levels. Figure 5c summarizes the results for Scenario 3. The risk heatmaps for 100% and 60% demand under different combinations of ventilation rates and infectiousness levels indicate that lower ventilation rates and higher infectiousness levels result, as expected, in higher transmission risk. With 100% demand and infectiousness level of 270 quanta per hour, the transmission risk is 40% higher when ventilation performs at 70% compared to when it operates at normal levels. When the ventilation rate is 140%, the risk levels are relatively low, but the risk is still sensitive to an increase in infectiousness. At 60% demand, even with ventilation rate of 140%, the overall risk level is still relatively sensitive to the increase in infectiousness. The results highlight the effectiveness of ventilation in mitigating the transmission risk in public transportation operations. However, even at high ventilation rates the risk is not negligible.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 129, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 261, "end": 270, "text": "Figure 5a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1375, "text": "Figure 5b", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2147, "text": "Figure 5c", "ref_id": null}], "section": "C.

This is the result of load and travel time changes as the demand increases. Figure 6a shows the boxplots for runtimes from the terminal station to the peak load station under demand level ranging from 50% to 90%. Figure 6b shows the corresponding boxplots of passenger load per train at the peak load point. The mean and variability of runtimes as well as loads increase significantly as demand increases. The system experiences congestion and delays, and trains are more crowded. The increase in the number of passengers onboard, as well as the increase in runtimes and decrease of reliability, result in the risk increasing at a higher rate for demand levels above 70%. To further explore the impact of service reliability on risk, we compare the risk under two alternative schedules, one with more regular dispatching and uniform scheduled headways during the entire peak period, the other with relatively uneven headways. Both schedules have the same average headway of about 4.3 minutes. The headway coefficient of variation (cv) of the variable schedule is 0.3 and the cv for the regular 0.2. The other settings for the experiment are the same as in Table 1 . The demand is 100% and mask-wearing is at 0%. Figure 7 illustrates the passenger load under the two schedules.

We assume a demand level at 70% of the base case. Under normal conditions, agencies would adjust the scheduled frequency accordingly. However, under a pandemic, reducing headways may increase infection risk. We hence, explore the impact of frequency of service on risk for a given demand level. The remaining settings for the experiment are the same as Table 1 . Figure 9 shows the infection probability for a random passenger in the system under 7 different headway scenarios (equation (21)). As the headway increases from 4 to 4.5 minutes, the infection probability increases slightly. For headways exceeding 5.5 minutes, the infection probability increases sharply. Increase of headways causes increase in runtimes, dwell times, train load, and the deterioration of service reliability, so the infection probability increases accordingly. The paper explores the transmission risk of airborne viruses through the use of public transportation, in particular subway systems. The Wells-Riley model is utilized to develop an overall risk metric as a function of OD flows, actual operations, and factors such as mask-wearing, ventilation, infectiousness, and virus carrier rate. The model is integrated with a microscopic simulation model of subway operations (SimMETRO) and uses trip by trip data on passenger and train movements as inputs. The risk metric captures the spatio-temporal characteristics of demand and operations and provides means to evaluate the effectiveness of various strategies to reduce the associated risk. The paper explores, using a case study with an actual subway system, the sensitivity of overall risk to various mitigation strategies, including operational strategies, mask-wearing, ventilation rates, as well as factors such as carrier rates in the population, and infectiousness of the virus. The results show that mask-wearing and ventilation are effective mitigation methods under various demand levels, infectiousness, and carrier rates. Mask-wearing is more effective at mitigating risks. Impacts from operations and service frequency are also evaluated, emphasizing the importance of maintaining reliable, regular operations at high frequencies in order to lower transmission risks.
