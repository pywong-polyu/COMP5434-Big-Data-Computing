To further optimize response rate, informants/caregivers were surveyed as proxies for participants with known CI or dementia.

First, because our primary aim was to determine feasibility of remote assessment, and we wanted to keep the survey as brief as possible, we did not ask follow-up questions that may have clarified the reasoning behind participants' responses. As a result, we cannot determine, for example, if those who do not use video chat do not do so because of access, knowledge, or choice. Second, although the demographic characteristics of our cohort are fairly typical of current volunteers for clinical trials and observational studies of AD, they do not represent the general population of older adults, which is more racially diverse and has, on average, less formal education than our cohort. Further, participants at our ADRC are highly motivated and dedicated to the program's aimsfor example, most of our participants have consented to lumbar puncture and brain donation-and this also may limit the generalizability of our survey results. Nevertheless, to the extent that our ADRC cohort is representative of current volunteers in AD clinical trials and longitudinal cohort studies of cognition in aging that may need to transition to remote, on-line interactive assessments, these results suggest that access to the requisite technology and willingness to participate in remote assessments are generally high among non-demented participants. Remote cognitive assessment using interactive video technology may be a practicable option for nondemented participants in longitudinal studies; however, additional resources will be required to ensure representative participation by Latinos and other groups that are underrepresented in clinical research.

F I G U R E 3 Percent of participants responding \"yes\" by diagnostic classification (A) and ethnicity(B)    to have access to the requisite technologies. A 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center similarly found that Black and Hispanic adults are less likely to report owning a traditional computer or having high-speed internet at home than White respondents.2 Ownership of a smartphone, however, is comparable among Latino and non-Latino respondents in both our survey and the Pew survey, suggesting that smartphones may play a role in improving access to interactive video technology for these participants.7 The relatively limited number of Latino respondents in our survey sample (N = 53) precluded subgroup analyses to determine whether there was an interaction between ethnicity and level of cognitive impairment; however, this will be an important direction in future research. Similarly, the number of non-White, non-Latino participants in our cohort is not sufficient to analyze their survey responses separately.While these results suggest that use of interactive video technology may be a practicable option for fostering and/or maintaining participation of older adults in cognitive aging research, they do not speak to the validity of remote cognitive assessments. Although there is mounting evidence that assessments conducted remotely can yield results that are comparable to face-to-face assessments in older adults8 and in patients with MCI and mild AD, 9 the majority of studies have been conducted with participants being assessed in a highly controlled and structured in-clinic setting, with the examiner located remotely. For example, a recent critical review, published in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, examined published validity studies that used counterbalanced cross-over designs of face-to-face and teleneuropsychology assessments in older adults (aged 65+). 8 Results showed strong support for the validity of remote administration of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, and Letter Fluency; moderate-to-strong support for Digit Span (Forward, Backward, and Total); good support for the Boston Naming Test; and moderate support for Category Fluency (for animals). There was limited support for remote administration of measures of executive functioning and processing speed, primarily because they are rarely included in remote assessment. Sim-ilarly, a small pilot study found no differences in the MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) scores of patients with AD when the tests were administered face-to-face or by (in-clinic) videoconference, except for severely impaired patients (MMSE < 17) in whom the assessment via videoconference overestimated cognitive impairment. 14 Despite these encouraging findings from validity studies of in-clinic cognitive assessments performed remotely using interactive video, to date there have been few investigations of remote assessments done with participants located in their own homes and using their own device(s). Validity data on home-based assessments are likely to be forthcoming as research centers and clinical programs worldwide make accommodations to continue data collection in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the NIH/NIA Alzheimer's Disease Centers program has adapted portions of the Uniform Data Set Neuropsychological Test Battery 10 for remote administration and plan to examine the comparability of remote and in-person administrations. Efforts by researchers worldwide to maintain continuity and integrity in researchprograms with cognitive assessment may provide a natural laboratory to produce results that will improve knowledge of methods, measures, and best practices for home-based remote assessment.",
