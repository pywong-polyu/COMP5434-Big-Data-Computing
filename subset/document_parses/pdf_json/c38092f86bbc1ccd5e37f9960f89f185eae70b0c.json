He was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA 10 days after symptom onset, which revealed a negative result and was treated by the primary care physician at home. Premedical history was uneventful and the patient did not take regular medication. On April 1 st , oral methylprednisolone 10mg/d was started for suspected rheumatoid arthritis due to persistent pelvic girdle and muscle pain of the proximal lower extremities, a C-reactive protein of 8.5mg/dL (normal: 0.0-0.5mg/dL), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (63mm/1h). On April 3 rd (14 days after onset of pulmonary disease) the patient had recovered from respiratory symptoms, but still complained of severe fatigue and developed symmetric distal tingling in both feet followed by ascending dysesthesias up to the knees and proximal weakness.",

Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to touch and pinprick in the lower extremities, absent ankle jerk, atactic stance and inability to walk without assistance. Additional truncal dysesthesia prompted spinal cord MRI with unremarkable findings. Lumbar CSF on day 2 after onset of neurological symptoms showed normal cell counts (2/mm\u00b3) and protein level (64 mg/dL) and a serum/CSF glucose ratio of 0.83. Due to the history of pulmonary symptoms a chestcomputed tomography was performed and revealed residual ground-glass opacities in both lower lungs suggestive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on the neurological presentation GBS was diagnosed, the patient was admitted to the COVID-19 isolation ward and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG, 30g) was initiated. His respiratory condition worsened, and the patient required oxygen supplementation (3L/min) followed by pressure support non-invasive ventilation after 36 h. Nerve conduction studies performed on the following day showed F-wave abnormalities in all nerves, delayed distal motor latency in one nerve, reduced distal amplitudes in two and a sural-sparing pattern supporting acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy subtype of the GBS (table 1) ",

Given the patient's symptoms of infection, the origin from a highly endemic area of SARS-CoV-2 cases, ground-glass opacities on chest CT-scan on admission, repeatedly negative PCR-SARS-CoV-2 testing in oropharyngeal swabs, CSF and BAL fluid, and the highly positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, we believe that the patient had recovered from COVID-19 with adequate immune response at the onset of GBS. Importantly, respiratory failure was triggered by progressive weakness of in-and expiratory muscles in our patient. Considering the temporal association, we speculate that GBS might have been triggered by humoral immune response against SARS-CoV2 in this patient. Our findings and a recently published cases support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may trigger GBS as para-/ post-infectious disease as reported by Zika virus. 5, 6 Underling mechanisms for this process may include immune molecular mimicry against nervous system antigens before clinical symptoms of covid-19 are manifested (para-infectious), 3 This article is protected by copyright.

PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was repeatedly negative in oropharyngeal swabs (3 times) as well as in CSF and the patient was transferred to the neurological intensive care unit. At the same time, Anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies were highly positive in serum and CSF with an optical density (OD) ratio relative to the calibrator OD (normal <0.8) of 9.6 in serum (diluted 1:100) and 9.1 in CSF (diluted 1:2) determined by commercially available CE-marked ELISA (Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany; https://www.coronavirus-diagnostik.de) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Due to the non-linearity of the read-out the intrathecal fraction (i.e. antibody specific index) could not be quantified and it is not possible to differentiate intrathecal synthesis of antibodies or passive transfer across the blood-CSF barrier. As yet, we detected no false positives or negatives using this ELISA. Antiganglioside antibodies, PCR for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza virus A/B,Respiratory Syncytial Virus and IgM antibodies for Chlamydia pneumoniae andMycoplasma pneumoniae were negative in this patient.

Whether anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies cross-react with axonal or Schwann cell epitopes needs further evaluation. The limitation of this case is the absence of a positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR before admission. Still, the preceding febrile illness and high antibody titer at the onset of neurological symptoms suggests a post-COVID-19 state with adequate immune response. It remains imminent to exclude common triggers for GBS as was performed in our patient. In summary, this case report only suggests a possible association between COVID-19 and GBS and needs more evidence from epidemiologic data supported by immunological studies. Clinicians should be vigilant for the occurrence of immune Accepted Article mediated neurological diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to elude on a potential novel mechanism of coronavirus-triggered diseases.",
