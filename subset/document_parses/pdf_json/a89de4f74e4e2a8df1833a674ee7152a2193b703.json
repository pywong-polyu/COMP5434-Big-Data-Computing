While substantial research has sought to characterize the disease natural history and the acute management of COVID-19, comparatively fewer studies have focused on the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Much of the publicly available data on PASC come from case reports and single-institution prospective cohort studies [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Patient reported symptom data have shown that prolonged fatigue, headache, dyspnea and anosmia are PASC symptoms 14 . However, there are fewer claims and electronic health record (EHR) data about the incidence of PASC symptoms. Therefore, the public knowledge about PASC symptom presentation is evolving. The National Institutes of Health has encouraged the study of PASC on large-scale observational databases in order to better understand the condition and its public health impact 15 . In alignment with that effort, we present data on PASC patients from EHR and claims databases with an aim to characterize the natural history of patients with SARS-CoV-2 who developed symptoms or diagnoses related to PASC. Additionally, we characterized related long-term sequelae of influenza to provide a comparison.",
