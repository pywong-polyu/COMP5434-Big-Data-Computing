            "text": "Tables: 3  Figures: 5  Introduction   53 The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world, leading to at least 5.3 million deaths and many permanent 54 injuries, with over 271 million cases worldwide as of 20 December 2021 55 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, date of last access: 12/20/2021). 56 Despite advances in diagnosis and vaccination, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens to keep the 57 pandemic going 1 . The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 58 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html, date of last access: 12/20/2021) 59 have identified SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs), which lead to increased disease severity 60 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nervtag-paper-on-covid-19-variant-of-concern-b117, date of 61 last access: 12/20/2021), increased transmission 2 , and immune/vaccine evasion [3] [4] [5] . Variants of Interest (VOIs) 62 have also been identified that present theoretical risks because they possess mutations similar to the 63 mutations in the VOC. Specific frequently occurring mutations have also been identified which can affect 64 therapeutic antibody treatments for patients infected with such variants 6 . These new variants and analysis 9 , and several other strategies such as PerkinElmer's PKamp (Waltham, MA), and Aldatu Biosciences 76 (Watertown,MA). However, most of these assays either target single mutations per reaction or lack the 77 appropriate number of targets to thoroughly characterize SARS-CoV-2. Simple assays that detect multiple 78 mutations at the same time are needed for identification of circulating VOCs, VOIs, and for the identification 79 of specific mutations. 80 Our approach is to create a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 variants by exploiting the superior selectivity and 81 self-quenching characteristics of molecular beacons. Molecular beacons can be designed to selectively bind to 82 a mutant target sequence, while avoiding the wild-type sequence, which differs from the mutant by a single 83 nucleotide substitution. The interaction of a molecular beacon with its target is inherently more specific than 84 linear oligonucleotides that do not have a stem and loop structure, because target binding requires the 85 dissociation of the stem, which is thermodynamically costly 10 . The utility of this discriminatory power has been 86 previously demonstrated in real-time PCR for a number of applications 11, 12 . 87 Here we present a two-tube multiplex qRT-PCR assay that identifies current VOCs by detecting eight different 88 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We selected mutations that have been shown to increase immune 89 escape, avoid neutralization, and increase transmissibility. Targeting these causative mutations is fruitful, 90 because these strains may mutate and lose certain coincidental mutations, but mutations that increase 91 transmission and immune evasion are likely to be maintained. Also, by targeting these types of mutations, it is 92 possible to detect new variants that arise from combinations of previously confirmed mutations, as is the case We designed our primers so that they will function at the PCR annealing temperature of 58 \u00b0C. We selected a 122 region of sequence around the site of each mutation such that the Tm of the perfect probe-target hybrid was 123 above the annealing temperature, but that the mismatched single-nucleotide polymorphism had a Tm lower 124 than the annealing temperature. These Tm's were predicted by using the then all values in that channel were divided by the maximum intensity for that molecular beacon, to derive 147 relative fluorescence units, which range between 0 and 1. These data are shown in Supplemental Figure S1 . Table 1 along with their   158 sequences.",

The tubes were sealed, briefly shaken, spun down at 800 g for 1 min. and then run on a to Rutgers's laboratory for initial testing of the multiplex variant molecular beacon assay. Table 2 . 196 The RdRp and N genes were chosen as targets to detect lowly and highly expressed transcripts generated by Before assembling our multiplex assay, we designed molecular beacons for each targeted mutation, 246 determined their thermal denaturation profiles, and tested them in monoplex PCRs. To determine whether 247 the molecular beacons were allele discriminating at the annealing temperature, we determined the thermal 248 denaturation profiles of the molecular beacons by themselves, and together with mutant or wild-type targets. 249 In these experiments, the targets were synthetic oligonucleotides, and they were used in a molar excess above 250 the molecular beacon concentration. A representative profile is shown in Figure 2 , and the profiles of all the 251 molecular beacons are shown in Supplemental Figure S2 . Although, the window of discrimination varies 252 somewhat from molecular beacon to molecular beacon, all of our molecular beacons permitted single 253 nucleotide discrimination (see Figure 3A ). After qualifying the molecular beacons in this manner, we After demonstrating the specificity and sensitivity of the variant molecular beacon assay with in vitro-279 transcribed RNAs, we performed this assay on RNA purified from inactivated virus obtained from ZeptoMetrix 280 (Buffalo, NY). As can be seen in Figure 4A , our assay identified each of the mutations as listed in Figure 1B for 281 the respective VOC. We next tested a set of patient samples (RNA extracted from mid-nasal swabs) that were 282 SARS-CoV-2 positive, as identified by a multiplex screening assay, which we previously developed 283 (Supplemental Figure S2 ). After being identified as positive for SARS-CoV-2 by this assay, the samples were 284 sequenced to identify all mutations present in the strains' genomes, this sequencing data is available online at 285 https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/v3n2dzt8st/1, date of last access: 1/13/2022.

            "text": "Design and implementation of an Omicron identifying molecular beacon assay 301 The recent emergence of the omicron variant, which possesses over 30 mutations in the spike protein, 302 necessitates the design of a new identifying single nucleotide discriminating molecular beacon. Since a 303 number of Omicron mutations occur in the target regions of the two-tube assay, it is not feasible to 304 incorporate uniquely Omicron specific molecular beacons into the two-tube assay discussed above in a 305 straightforward manner. Therefore, a new two-color Omicron specific assay was designed by targeting the 306 E484A mutation, which is unique in the Omicron variant (represented in Figure 5A ), along with N gene 307 detection. Previous studies have also shown that this mutation is important for immune evasion 19 . The melt 308 curve for the designed molecular beacon is shown in Figure 5B , which shows high specificity for its intended 309 target at the annealing temperature of the assay of 58\u00b0C. Next the sensitivity was tested using in vitro-310 transcribed Omicron spike fragment RNA, similar to what was done previously. The results in Figure 5C show 311 the sensitivity to detect 50 copies of the RNA target. The sequences of probes and primers are listed in Table 3 312 and the amplicon schematic is shown in Figure 5A . This Omicron assay was tested against the other VOC 313 sequences and the results in Figure 5D show targets can be designed and added to the assay in two or three weeks. This assay not only enables the 329 identification of the four variants of concern and many variants of interest, but since it targets many known 330 mutations that confer increased transmission and immune evasion, it will be able to identify new variants that 331 recombine with existing mutations. An example of the assay's ability to pick up newer variants lies in the Delta 332 variant's mutations, which include the L452R mutation that is also present in the Epsilon variant as can be 333 seen in Figure 1B . 5'-TTGTTTAGGAAGTCTAATCTCAAACC-3' 100 nM S.E484A-MB 5'-Cy5.5-ccgcctTTGTAATGGTGTTGCAGGTTTTAATTaggcgg-BHQ2-3' 250nM N501Yr",

For Supplemental Figure S2, each reaction was initiated with 2 to 5 \u00b5L RNA 203 template. The PCR assays were performed in 200-\u00b5L white polypropylene PCR tubes (USA Scientific, Ocala, FL) 204 in a CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The thermal cycler was 205 programed to incubate the reaction mixtures for 10 min at 53\u00b0C to generate cDNA, followed by 2 min at 95\u00b0C 206 to activate the DNA polymerase and by 45 thermal cycles that consisted of DNA denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s 207 and primer annealing and elongation at 58\u00b0C for 60 s. Molecular beacon fluorescence intensity was monitored 208 during the 58\u00b0C annealing and chain elongation stage of each thermal cycle. 209 RNA Purification from inactivated SARS-CoV-patient and inactivated virus samples were tested in a similar manner to how we tested the 218 assay's sensitivity and specificity. 5 \u00b5L of each sample was combined with 15 \u00b5L each completed master mix 219 using TaqPath and run as mentioned before. 220 qRT-PCR analysis and plotting 221 Data generated from the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System was analyzed with Bio-Rad's CFX 222 Maestro Software Version 2.0, which corrects for fluorescence drift, subtracts the baseline, and fits curves to 223 each qRT-PCR signal. Threshold cycles (Ct) were determined via a manually specified single threshold of our 224 analyzed data, which was clearly above all negative control signals. For the specificity plots, fluorescent signals 225 were normalized by dividing all values by the highest fluorescent value in each channel for the of a two-tube, eight mutation, multiplex qRT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 Variants 229 In our assay, SARS-CoV-2 variants were identified by probing the coding region of the spike protein transcript 230 for the presence of eight different point mutations, as detailed in Figure 1. Since only the mutants are 231 expected to yield a positive signal, we included an additional set of primers and molecular beacons for the molecular beacons and the locations of the primers are indicated in Figure 1A. In Tube one, 235 there were three amplicons, and in Tube two, all four targets were present in the same amplicon. 236 Even though individual isolates of each variant may possess other mutations, we focused on sets of mutations 237 that are functionally the most important. By using in vitro binding and epidemiological data of how these 238 mutations affect immune evasion and binding to the ACE2 receptor 2-5,17,18 , we chose to identify the mutations 239 shown in Figure 1: d69-70, K417N/T, L452R, T478K, E484K/Q, and N501Y. We also chose these mutations such 240 that a single mutation in Tube one is sufficient to identify the VOCs, which of course is subject to change as the 241 virus evolves. The mutations targeted in Tube two complete the identification of the VOCs and identify other 242 common mutations, which are useful for identifying other variants. 243 The variant molecular beacon assay is specific for the identification of common SARS-CoV-2 variant 244 mutations 245",

To demonstrate 258 the specificity of the multiplex assays, six pairs of reactions were carried out, in which each reaction received 259 5,000 copies of either the wild type, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.427 (Epsilon), or E484Q 260 and T478K (Kappa/Delta)-containing spike RNA sequences. The targets were in vitro-transcribed RNAs 261 corresponding to a portion of the spike protein, or commercially available RNA standards, as detailed in 262 methods and in the legend to Figure 3. The results of these reactions are presented in Figure 3A, where the 263 targets are indicated inside the panels, and the color response of each molecular beacon is indicated by the 264 color of the line. This data shows that when the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 genome is present, only the N gene 265 positive control signal occurs. When testing spike RNAs containing the variant mutations, the correct mutations 266 were identified. For example, the Beta variant (B.1.351) contains not only the uniquely identifying K417N 267 mutation, but also the N501Y and E484K mutation. 268 The variant molecular beacon assay can detect at as few as five copies of viral RNA 269 To demonstrate the sensitivity of the variant molecular beacon assay, PCR assays were initiated with serial 270 dilutions of each target. The results are shown in Figure 3B. Each dilution series tested from 5,000 copies to 271 0.5 copies. Where a clear signal was present, the threshold cycle was determined by a manually identified 272 single threshold for each channel. Reactions starting with as little as five copies yielded a detectable signal in 273 each case. The correlation coefficients between the logarithm of the copy number and the threshold cycles in 274 each case are each greater than 0.98, showing a very strong exponential relationship between the two. These 275 results also indicate that in Tube one, which contains four pairs of primers, the amplification of multiple 276 different amplicons does not interfere with each other, which would diminish sensitivity. 277 Inactivated virus and patient sample strains of SARS-CoV-2 are accurately identified 278",

            "text": "to the specificity of the molecular beacons, other mutations in the target region do not elicit false-positive 335 signals. Evidence of this is found in the lack of signal in one of the samples which contained the L452Q 336 mutation, as identified by sequencing. More evidence of the specificity is in the clean differentiation of the 337 K417T and K417N mutations, as well as the E484Q, E484K, and E484A mutations, where these signals only 338 become positive in the presence of their respective mutations. This specificity enables precise identification, 339 but also comes with the downside that mutations in the binding region of the molecular beacon could result in 340 false-negative signals. Despite this, if other mutations do arise near the uniquely identifiable mutations, such 341 as in the case of the Omicron variant, this can be accounted for by either designing different molecular 342 beacons, or by introducing degenerate nucleotides into the current molecular beacons. 343This study is limited by the number of patient samples tested. In the cases where a variant harbors multiple 344 mutations in the target regions of molecular beacons of the two-tube assay, false negatives may result due to the high specificity of molecular beacons. However, in such situations a completely new assay can be easily 346 assembled with equal ease as was demonstrated in the case of Omicron variant inFigure 5.347    This assay introduces the sequences of many useful molecular beacons for the identification of point 348 mutations in SARS-CoV-2. These variant molecular beacon assays are most useful as a screening tool for 349 positive SARS-CoV-2 patient samples which can identify all major VOC (seeFigure 1B). The primers and 350 molecular beacons can also be combined in varying combinations to test for other pathogens, they can be 351 added to current assays, and they can be used with human RNA controls as were added in the multiplex 352 COVID-19 multiplex screening assay (see SupplementalFigure S2). These assays can then be used to test for 353 the most common variants in a region or to directly test human samples as a single pathogen/COVID-19 354 variant identification test in general practice.355    Here we describe multiplexed molecular beacon assays for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants via their 356 identifying functional mutations. We have shown that the assay clearly differentiates between the different357 SARS-CoV-2 variant sequences, and accurately classifies patient samples that have been identified by deep 358 sequencing technologies and S gene dropout assays.
