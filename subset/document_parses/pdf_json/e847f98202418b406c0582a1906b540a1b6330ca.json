We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of subsublineages and novel haplogroups respectively. Due to the recombinant property and high transmissibility of omicron virus, we suggest continuous and more widespread genome sequencing in all states of India to track evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in real time.",

Through mutation, viruses continuously evolve into new variants. According to their severity, these variants may be classified under variants being monitored, variants of interest, variants of concern, and variants of high consequence. Following the report of the first case on December 31, 2019, WHO officially declared an outbreak of n-CoV-2 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 . The variant of concern, omicron (B.1.1.529), is circulating across the globe with different sublineages including BA.1 (B.1.1.529.1), BA.2 (B.1.1.529.2) and BA.3 (B.1.1.529.3). In a report from WHO, omicron cases were confirmed in 149 countries, but current data suggest that this variant is detected in approximately 177 countries, so international travel is the most likely way for this variant to spread globally. The omicron gains attention due to the number of mutations in the spike protein gene, which influences its viral transmissibility, replication, and binding of antibodies, and its dramatic increase in South Africa [3] . Based on baseline studies, it was confirmed that the new variant was able to significantly escape immunity developed from previous infections and vaccinations [4, 5] .",

Moreover, there are equal numbers of minor haplogroups that results from the sharing of haplotypes between four and two states (not marked).

Additionally, visibility of short and long branches within the BA.1 and BA2 clades inferred by maximum likelihood tree point towards recombination property of SARS-CoV-2 virus and their possibilities of evolving into new lineages (Fig 2) . In addition to this, density of the population, vaccination status of the hosts, would also further determine the evolution of sub-sub lineages within the sub lineages into novel variants of concern. A study published by [16] Loconsole et al. and horizontal gene transfer should be used with caution [17] . Rapid evolution of omicron variant as observed in the maximum likelihood tree is also supported by RM network constructed using same dataset. The higher number of major haplogroup including sub haplogroups and associated singleton haplogroups further confirms rapid evolutionary rate of recombination in both lineages (Fig 3) .",

Methodology From the GISAID database, whole genome sequences for omicron (B.1.1.529) variants deposited until 29 th January 2022 from different states of India were retrieved. We analyzed only complete genomes with high coverage, while gaps and incomplete genomes with missing information were discarded. In total, 564 genomes were aligned using MAFT version 7 [7], and haplotype numbers were estimated using DnaSP v624 [8]. Prior to alignment, all 564 genomes were assigned lineages using Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner (https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/) [9]. A final dataset consisting of 297 haplotypes was compiled after excluding 7 genomes with many missing bases. A multi-type birth-death model was used in BEAST v2.6.6 [10], in which a HKY nucleotide substitution model with a gamma category count of 4, with a strict clock rate of 2.4E-4 was applied. Parameters were sampled in MCMC analysis every 1000 generations over a total of 10 million generations.",

Consequently, in this course of omicron evolution, emergence of new sub lineages and variants in future cannot be ruled out.

            "text": "et al. 2020 at the onset of the epidemic and with our own previously published MJ network [21], significant differences were observed. In comparison with our previously published MJ, RM exhibits a more distinct and faster evolution of variant in human hosts, evident in the emergence of more variants/haplogroups (colored circles) and the accumulation of large number of mutations across connecting lineages. We argue that the possible sub-sub lineages and several novel haplogroups inferred by our phylogenetic and RM network construction method respectively have the potential to be evolved into more transmissible and infectious variants. Thus, to monitor SARS-CoV-2 evolution in real time with the aim of developing more effective vaccines in the future, we recommend strict tracking of lineages through timely and regular genome sequencing of viruses across India. Conclusion Our first-ever omicron genome-based study representing various states of India revel two lineages, BA.1 and BA.2. The BA.2 exhibits greater transmissibility. The study also shows the emergence of sub-sublineages and autochthonous haplogroups. In light of these findings, we recommend continuous and broad genome sequencing, and full vaccination of Indian population.
