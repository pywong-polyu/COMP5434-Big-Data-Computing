Business models, their connection with the capital-ownership system and the evolution of competitive strategies were also discussed. The starting point for this analysis is a unique (as contradicting the rules of marketing) DNA of luxury business model (see Kapferer and Bastien 2009 ). The analysis reveals the extent to which modern business strategies adhere to these principles. Based on the analysis of the latest global consumer trends the summary attempts to determine the future directions of development of enterprises creating the supply of luxury.",

            "text": "The growth rate of the luxury market has been impressive over the last 30 years. It started in 1994 and Bain & Company calls this period \"sortie du temple\". At that time luxury goods sales began to increase dynamically, spreading geographically and socially, thanks to the widespread application of extension strategy into less affluent consumer segments while maintaining a luxurious brand image. However, the beginning of this vast dynamic can be traced back to the 1970s when Cartier created the \"Les Must\" jewellery series aimed at less wealthy audiences who could not afford to buy the then cult Panth\u00e8re necklaces and watches (Economist 2014) . In this phase of dynamic growth global sales of luxury products almost doubled from EUR 74 billion to EUR 133 billion in 2001 and slowed down when the World Trade Center towers were attacked (Bain & Company 2018) . The next stage called the phase of democratization of luxury 3 began with a temporary stagnation caused by a drop in the exchange rate of the dollar where the U.S. at that time was the world's largest luxury buyer. The luxury market continued to develop dynamically to reveal speculative stock exchange bubbles, to record small (lower than average in other industries) decreases in sales in 2016-2017, and then rapidly moving upwards due to the \"Chinese luxury bulimia\" (Bain & Company 2016, p. 6) . 2018 was a return to normality understood as an average 4-5% annual growth of the sector, which, however was unattainable for many industries.",

The main forces that have driven this dynamic growth are the demand for luxury from Chinese citizens and the global Millennial group along with the dynamically growing importance of online sales channels. Even Pandemic Covid 19 in 2019/2020 does not seem to change this growing role of the Chinese and other fast growing luxury markets in the development of this sector and will possibly even strengthen this dependence. China was the starting point of the pandemic, but was also the first to deal with its subjugation. Unfortunately at the time of writing this book the world has been experiencing a global panic and both social and economic lockdown caused by the spread of the coronavirus. The first consequences of stopping the Chinese economy to allow drastic measures to be taken in the fight against the coronavirus have a very broad spectrum of impacts, both negative and positive, including in the luxury sector. One of the few positive consequences was a reduction in the level of air pollution in China caused by the stoppage or a drastic reduction of production due to quarantine. Another quite positive effect of coping with communication difficulties was the massive launch of e-learning at Chinese universities and schools. This has forced many universities to adapt quite rapidly to the new way of learning and the effects of such a change can be both permanent and global. However the range of positive changes is much smaller than the negative outcomes. While we can introduce elearning during the quarantine to continue the education process this is still impossible to introduce for example e-sewing (especially when hand made work is a value creating factor) or e-welding to mitigate the effects of production stops. The slowdown in the Chinese economy will most probably translate into higher production and commodity prices worldwide. Although the effects of Coronavirus should not be equated with the ones of the global crisis one can expect a longer term stagnation in the dynamics of sales of luxury goods and services on a global scale.",

(2020) predicts that it will take the industry at least two to three years to recover to the sales level before the epidemic although two scenarios of this recovery are assumed, depending on the region. As regards the Asian market a rapid rebound is forecast and the expected rate of recovery will be faster than in the rest of the world for two reasons. First, the Chinese are a major and growing group of luxury consumers on a global scale responsible for the 90% growth in luxury sales in 2019 (see e.g. Bain & Co. 2019) . The second scenario refers to the so-called western world: mainly North America and Europe. These regions are experiencing a deep recession and a slower return to stability. These regions have been experiencing a stabilization of interest in luxury for years and sales growth has only been in the region of 1-3%, with more sales growth in hospitality and well-being services. However it should be stressed that these areas of luxury are growing everywhere at a higher rate than the so-called private core luxury. Moreover according to Unity Marketing (2020) , these will become the industry of broadly defined hospitality services that will be the one to which most global luxury brands will turn and expand significantly after the end of the COVID 19 Pandemic.",

Japan is an important region for the sale and production of luxury goods; a country of wealthy people fascinated for decades by so-called \"high\" luxury (see Table 3 .1). However the size of the markets in terms of the value of sales of luxury goods in particular years does not fully reflect the dynamics of consumption. The Chinese are now the largest and consumer group of luxury but in terms of growth in demand they are outstripping India and Poland (see Table 3 .2).",

In Poland with a population of 38 million with a balanced but relatively low GDP growth rate even a high luxury sales growth rate will not result in a sudden increase in the importance of this market on the global arena.

The second reason is the aforementioned drop in oil and gas prices, and a large part of the demand for luxury goods is created by countries rich in natural resources such as Russia or the Middle East. The third reason is that the Chinese government has introduced restrictions to stimulate domestic consumption and halt purchases outside China (Solca et al. 2016) .

The fund's authorities have consistently refused to provide information on how much of the profits are spent on charity and doubts about the sound financial management of the company are exacerbated by the fact that Rolex is involved in the infamous Bernard Maddoff fund. 15 In 2016 there were about 10,000 luxury yachts with a length of more than 24 meters and annual production volume of about 150 boats. 16 The book will continue to use the term luxury brands only for the sake of stylistic simplification.",

This means that their aura created around magic, charisma and uniqueness, bears the traces of authenticity through original creative contribution, non-mechanical and non-mass human effort, meticulousness related to the selection of materials and respect for tradition. These qualities are supposed to make its value timeless. Luxury brands while shaping the image of their products put varied emphasis on communicating the particular attributes of value proposition for the consumer. Moreover in this business success is not measured by copying and improving competitors' value propositions and even if it does it is unacceptable for such practices to be publicly communicated. In this market there is no place to make consumers aware that the company is cheaper/more efficient/offer more functional for the same price, etc. compared to other brands on the market. The aim is to create a unique, incomparable brand, which translates into unique way of competing. The rule in the luxury business (even though informal) is the coexistence of companies whose efforts are focused on proposing a unique offer with the imposition of a veil of silence on the costorganisational layer of their activity and emphasizing the uniqueness, innovation, care, diligence, control over the entire process of production and sales. Berthon et al. (2009) propose a typology of luxury brands based on philosophical aesthetic considerations. The axes of the model determine the ontological and aesthetic understanding of art and the process of its perception described by Martin Heidegger and Alfred North Whitehead (Heidegger 1993; Whitehead 1978 , after: Berthon et al. 2009 .",

An important criterion for differentiating brand attributes which is missing here is the target segment of consumers with a given purchasing power. This is another level of luxury determined by the consumers' wallets. Brands, especially those from the classic area while striving to maintain their timeless artistic image, \"migrate\" to the remaining parts of the model in order to monetize their luxury potential in wider, though less affluent, segments of the market. Although Chanel and Dior with their haute couture collections are still undisputedly strong players in the most prestigious, traditional category of luxury brands their biggest revenues are generated by cosmetic and perfume lines sold on a massive scale under their brands. In this way they extend their brand to the remaining segments.

These include custom-made yachts, planes, cars, jewellery and clothing for very special occasions (e.g. Oscar galas). Below that level but still at the top of the pyramid there is the so-called high, absolute luxury: a short series of expensive, masterfully made goods of exceptional aesthetic and functional qualities. In order to reach this tier of the pyramid the brands must not only have their own history, but their reputation has to stem from their tradition and manufacture in the place where the brand was established. Both \"griffe\" and absolute luxury, despite the evident changes in the market (resulting in pressure on global e-sale for instance), still adhere to the traditional understanding of luxury. The communication strategies are based mainly on maintaining the image with economical use of the promotional impact (Brun and Castelli 2013; Castelli and Sianesi 2015) . The lower tier is a popular/aspiring luxury available to a wider audience intensively using marketing tools aimed at creating an impression of uniqueness and exclusiveness. These are well-known brands with a long history and reputation, producing goods on a global scale. At the lowest level there is a luxury available with \"masstige\" brands (i.e. prestige for the masses, see e.g. Truong et al. 2009; Paul 2019) . There are popular and quite widely available brands offering goods at a still high price, available for the middle classes. The lowest level of the pyramid has been undergoing the greatest changes for more than 25 years and it includes the activities of those brands which are largely responsible not so much for the redefinition as for the degradation of the concept of luxury.",

The lower the level, the more effort it takes to convince consumers that the composition of value attributes offered is still luxurious. When rarity, the extraordinary quality of materials, or mastery of not mechanical and mass production cease to be proposed other, mainly emotional, symbolic, epistemic and social components of values must replace these deficiencies.

In China many luxury niche brands (such as Sophie Hulme and Bottega Veneta) are becoming more and more desirable and popular. Chinese consumers increasingly want to emphasize their individuality and excellent taste. According to Rambourg (2014) Luis Vuitton is now considered a brand for well-paid Chinese secretaries.

While sales and brand sizes on the absolute luxury tier have remained fairly stable for years the revolution has taken place at the accessible luxury and masstige level. The core strategy causing dynamic changes in this tier is an artificial creation of increasingly smaller segments, such as sports and casual luxury brands, intended for various activities (leisure luxury) or for teenagers or children with the aim of creating an aura of suitability and uniqueness in this increasingly competitive part of the market (see Silverstein and Fiske 2003a, b; Paul 2019) . The image of the luxury pyramid has been transformed in recent decades. The elegant form of the triangle has evolved into a thick pear, swollen from the number of brands and \"about -luxury\" quality products (see Fig. 3 .2). The pyramids of luxury deformed by the growth of the lower levels are the result of the brand owners' efforts to stabilize and maximize revenues while maintaining the status of a luxury brand in their so-called \"core business\". 18 There is therefore a general trend towards the stretching and extension of brands (Reddy et al. 2009; Ahn et al. 2018; Dall'Olmo Riley et al. 2015) .",

The extension of the brand is the start of activities outside the leading industry (fashion) in sectors such as lifestyle (Armani Hotels, Armani Fiori, Armani Casa), cosmetics and perfumes (Tiffany, LV perfumes), watches (Burberry or LV watches) and even outside the luxury market (the cooperation of Porsche with Acer, residences of Aston Martin' in Biscayne Boulevard Way in Miami).

Today, the Armani brand monetizes its value in many luxury industries (hotels, sweets, home accessories etc.), significantly reducing the value of the Armani Priv\u00e9. Other examples of attempts to stretch the brand upwards come from the automotive industry, although they are hardly a success. For example, VW created and promoted the Phaeton brand and after a few years gave up the production of this car because it was not able to convince consumers that VW is a brand that could offer a product similar to Bentley or Maybach.",

The value network, created through enterprise relationships, crosses the boundaries of the value system, i.e. the links of enterprises within one industry, creating value chains and offering products/services to a specific group of customers. The value offered to different purchasers is created through a cooperation and interaction between companies that benefit from the flow of information, technology and resources. As a supplier within one value system, for example, a company acquires competences, skills, which it then uses to function within another value system and in its own value chain. 20 The term value creation is simplified (and therefore misleading), when used by researchers analyzing business models.

Ensuring adequate quality control of both materials and production processes should go hand in hand with the management of close, long-term and fruitful relationships with suppliers and contractors, as well as the management of training and human resources (Christopher and Towill 2002; Caniato et al. 2009 ). Ideally the whole production process, as well as the provision of materials should be carried out within a single company and at the point of origin of the brand. The origin of goods from certain countries (perceived by consumers as centres of handicraft or the gift of creating beautiful things) is a guarantee of quality, heritage, competence and high social standards for consumers (Balabanis and Diamantopoulos 2008; Money and Colton 2008; Oetzel and Doh 2009 ).

The production of goods in the brand's place of origin is currently maintained in relation to the so-called strict core of business; products-icons, symbolizing grandeur, uniqueness and tradition. Herm\u00e9s produces Kelly and Birkin bags in France but never in the case of accessories (belts, jewellery, blankets, toys) is this place of production disclosed. 21 The growing trend of the relocation of production is visible. It is becoming the norm, especially in the luxury fashion industry, to commission the production of collections (especially for lower segments) to countries within Europe (so-called nearshoring) or in the Far East. The principle of choosing a location for production relocation is simple: the lower the brand positioning in the luxury pyramid, the further the cost effective, but less controllable aspects in terms of the maintenance of quality of the manufacturing site.",

For the sake of fairness it should be noted that while in the luxury fashion industry top and middle level brands still try to maintain the image of locally produced goods, in the case of the automotive industry, or jewellery in particular, the country of manufacture loses its importance. The jewellery industry imitates the fashion industry by reacting quickly to emerging trends and shortening the production cycle while at the same time dispersing the production sites. Outsourcing is natural especially when it comes to obtaining ores and precious stones, often extracted in poor, unstable countries, stigmatised by corruption which is a cause for concern for the more environmentally and socially engaged consumers. Most jewellery companies (including those producing and selling luxury jewellery) do not provide information about their sources of supply to the public even if they declare that they are socially responsible and controlled. The Swarovski Group (2015) says it regularly audits its factories in Thailand (The Marigot Jewellery Company and Swarovski Gemstones Thailand) and Austria (Swarovski Gemstones Business) to maintain high production standards and respect for workers' rights. Tiffany & Co. points to Russia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Namibia, Sierra Leone and Botswana as well as Canada, the United States, Belgium and Australia as major diamond mining and supply sites. In order to increase control over its supply chain and ensure transparency for socially engaged customers, Tiffany & Co. has developed a longterm programme based on the principles developed by the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA).",

Production is widely outsourced to workshops and factories located in the Far East. Indian and Chinese companies not only produce but also often design entire collections for European, Arab and their own markets, acting as OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). The production is later accompanied by the logo of a large, world famous luxury brand (McKinsey 2014). Interviews conducted by the author with representatives of suppliers (mainly precious stones), jewellery manufacturers and retailers at the international fair of the jewellery and watchmaking industry in Dubai 22 in December 2016 clearly show that consumers do not ask about the place of jewellery production. According to the representatives of these links in the chain the main element that is the decisive factor in the purchase of jewellery is the style of the product, combined with skilful sales technique. The owner of the Chinese manufactory who produces jewellery for the world's most famous retailers admitted that the local, anonymous designers employed by him are responsible for the diversity of styling but they know well the preferences of Arab, American and European consumers. The Lebanese owner of a chain of jewellery stores in the Arabian Peninsula and Europe was convinced that the country of origin of stones and precious metals does not matter to the recipients. The most important factor is the emotions that the seller will be able to evoke using the argument of exceptional product design.",

The most prestigious cars are assembled in the place that is the cradle of the brand while maintaining strict control over the entire supply chain. As assembly in a traditional brand headquarters is the norm for the most prestigious brands this is not the case for lower-level brands. Given the complexity of a good such as a car it would be unreasonable to expect all components to be manufactured by a single manufacturer. The automotive supply chain is much more complex than in the fashion and jewellery industry. For example, the BMW Group (BMW, Mini, Rolls Royce) works with around 13,000 suppliers in 70 countries but each of them is subject to quality controls to ensure that the quality standards set by the industry and the Group are met (BMW Group 2017). On the other hand, Mercedes-Benz is trying to create a supply chain close to an assembly site. China is a good example of this strategy-the number of local suppliers has grown from five to more than 300 in the last decade in line with the slogan \"Made in China for China\" (Daimler 2018) .",

On the one hand luxury brands are still worried about how a given blogger or other influential person can change the brand image to an undesirable one, but on the other the temptation to use the services of these people is huge. According to the reports of Luxury Daily, about 70% of brand activity is caused by influencers and not by the brands themselves (Ramirez 2018) . However according to the research conducted by L2 (Infleuncer Special Report 2018) it is not worth investing in luxury pyramid brands in people who have millions of followers on their social networks because being very popular and promoting a lot of goods, they are not perceived as being credible. While such actions may have an impact on the communication strategies of masstige products or accessories or cosmetics, the 27 higher luxury is preferred to niche, exclusive bloggers, bloggers and celebrities whose activities guarantee greater emotional attachment and loyalty of consumers.",

Some luxury brands when selling their products off-season require the removal of labels before they are displayed in discount stores but this requirement is rather a simulation of a selective distribution policy since the reality of these discount stores shows the exact opposite. On the other hand it must be acknowledged that luxury fashion sales by discount stores (as well as online flash sales portals) are often made without the formal consent of the brand owner.

Even in the case of car brands maintaining an annual production limit is the result of a compromise between the need to maintain the image and the desire to increase profits, 33 and expenditure on the development of so-called concept vehicles clearly shows that capacity expansion is not a problem in these companies.",

Unlike consolidators gathering private luxury brands from the fashion, jewellery, cosmetics or life-style industries the main component of the value proposition is not symbolism, aura or uniqueness. In this industry technical excellence and innovation are essential, although combined with the complimentary (but crucial) attributes of luxury in areas of the emotional, social and symbolic \"magic\". The competition in the global automotive industry takes place through: global sales, pooling of capital of the main players in order to increase the pace and diversification of the risk of design and research activity, dispersal of the production and supply chain on a regional and global scale. The aim of such a configuration is to develop technical innovations as quickly as possible while optimising the cost and global monetisation of manufactured goods to the widest possible audience. The strategies of car corporations in the luxury segment are twotrack: they consist in the simultaneous development of their own, traditional brands with a wide range of goods, as well as the acquisition and development of other niche brands with a clearly defined customer profile (Ferrari, Aston Martin, Bentley, Rolls Royce, etc.). The Volkswagen Group controls Lamborghini, Audi, Porsche, Bugatti and Bentley; Tata Motor owns Jaguar Land Rover; Rolls-Royce is owned by BMW; Lexus is owned by Toyota; Infinity is owned by Nissan; Lincoln is owned by the Ford Motor Company; Cadillac GM and Maserati are controlled by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The companies control the entire supply chain dispersed on a global scale but closely connected with intra-and interorganization and capital relationships. In the case of luxury niche brands (sport, uber-luxury), brands retain a high degree of freedom to shape their strategies, although the guiding principle is to keep the production of the number of cars in check, which helps to persuade consumers of their scarcity, unavailability and desirability. 3.

The body, children, spouses and even the soul become a product which, like everything else, has its price and is judged by the extent to which it pleases others. In this context an attempt to move away from the commonness of mass consumption is an escape into an atypical, ephemeral and totally individual (and thus unique) experience. This are created by means of experience marketing or the so-called context, combining forms, channels and ways of influence (see). In the marketing of experience activities are focused on arousing and sustaining specific customer feelings related to their lifestyle. Consumers shall be provided with sensory, emotional, cognitive and relational values that are consistent with what they expect (and can expect experiences different from those of everyday life). The aim is to achieve synergy between meaning, perception, consumption and brand loyalty. The assumption of these marketing strategies is to base consumers' decisions on a combination of emotion and rationality. However experience marketing requires a wider range of research methods to understand the causes of specific consumer behaviour in order to involve them. The richness of experience and commitment depends on the interplay between the \"experimental zones\": entertainment, education, escape from everyday life and aesthetics (Pine and Gilmore 1999) .",

Using AR and AI technologies luxury brands can also provide a personalised consumer experience, reach a wider audience, deepen product consumption experiences and establish more intense customer relationships. 40 In addition to AR and AI we 39 Okonkwo described this as a love and hate relationship, Okonkwo (2007) . 40 These expectations relate primarily to the Millennials and Generation Z group which is expected to represent 40% of the global luxury consumer group by 2025 (Delloite 2018) . I am also not convinced that the intensification of virtual relationships with the customer is simply aimed at tightening ties resulting in increased shopping and loyalty, although there are studies indicating such dependencies (see e.g. Table 9 , Chapter 2). should also mention the development of virtual commerce with extensive sensory stimuli (voice, sound, image) and the Internet of Things (IoT), which makes it possible to use the services of the Internet:",

Perhaps then Socrates' vision of luxury the highest measure of which is to serve the public good will be realized.

Luxury versions of autonomous vehicles will be produced next to them in production units or the elite access to limited virtual amusement parks will become more important.

This group includes Herm\u00e9s, Loro Piana, Rolls Royce, Bentley, Patek & Philippe or Schaffhausen, \u2022 modern brands-offering prestige and status by clearly signalling through style/design, logo and communication strategy that they are expensive, unavailable to the general public but having lasting artistic values, combined with uniqueness and social desirability (intensively strengthened by marketing). The main component of their offer is, apart from the aura of uniqueness and artistry, the social value. These are examples of the so-called well-known brands, such as Gucci, Cavalli, Dolce Gabbana, Prada, Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Tag Hauer, Omega, Rolex, \u2022 impression brands (Wabi Sabi)-their main component of value is the experiencing of contact with fleeting beauty; this is primarily the domain of services: e.g. offering culinary experiences of molecular cuisine combining the aesthetics of the service, interior design and unusual form and flavours of the food offered (ice cream with the taste of truffle, broccoli \"earth\", foam from herring or caramelized larvae), a marathon at the North Pole, camping in Mount Everest, a snow safari in Antarctica, meditation classes in hammocks in an oasis and so on \u2022 postmodernist brands-basing their value on the search for new forms of aesthetic and emotional impact. The novelty that will be accepted publicly as interesting is the main component of the value of the brands from this area. Examples of such brands include Moschino or Fog Point Vodka (advertised as made with the use of liquefied fog from San Francisco).",
