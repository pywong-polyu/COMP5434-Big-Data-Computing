In this study, we aimed to have a historical investigation on how infectious diseases have affected the tourism industry in Korea, to reach practical implications for managing the medical tourism sector. The impact of global infectious diseases, including MERS, and COVID-19, on the tourism industry was studied in South Korea. First, the available information was collected to clarify how these two outbreaks have impacted the tourism market in South Korea, and then the government's countermeasures were studied. Investigating among the policies resulted in practical implications for the post-pandemic revitalizing plan for the medical tourism market. The infectious outbreak caused a significant decrease in the number of inbound tourists to South Korea, moreover, the crisis response system of the government has been useful so far. Hence, several practical implications can be achieved for the medical tourism market. A framework is suggested which involves 5 stages of strategies to revitalize medical tourism market. It presents remedies to revitalize the medical tourism industry and to enter the global market again. Korea's quarantine model, which succeeded in preventing COVID-19, can be a preemptive response to another pandemic in the future. The medical tourism industry policy based on Korea's quarantine model will contribute to the revitalization of the international medical tourism industry after COVID-19.",

            "text": "From the last decade, several countries in Asia have focused on the international marketing of medical tourism due to its significant economic benefits (1) . The characteristics of medical tourism in most of the countries in East Asian countries are low cost of medical treatment, highquality medical service, and a short waiting time However, in Korea, after the revision of the Medical Service Act in 2009, the medical tourism market has been one of the main concerns of the government. This country mainly focused on a high-quality medical service, and specifically in the area of cosmetic surgery and cancer treatment (2) . Despite concerns that the country started later than other countries in Asia, Korea has achieved remarkable growth in a short period and has recently become a major medical tourism country. However, the frequent outbreaks of global infectious diseases (SARS, MERS, and COVID- 19) in recent years have raised the need to review the system of international medical tourism. Infectious diseases are deeply related to personal medical care, social and public health care. After World War II, infectious diseases were thought to be no longer a problem due to vaccines and antibiotics. However, in just a few decades, infectious disease has become a worldwide crisis (3) . Urbanization, high population density, and transnational mobility accelerate the speed of spread of infectious diseases (4) . SARS, one of the most common infectious diseases of the 21st century, has resulted in a total of 8,098 cases in 26 countries and 74 deaths since it began in China in the winter of 2002 and ended in July 2003 (5 (6) . Even though the quality of life has improved significantly (for instance, the development of hygiene environment, the development of medicine, and the extension of life expectancy) the fear of infectious diseases is as high as ever (7) . COVID-19, which occurred in early 2020, has been unpredictable and out of control and it has changed our lives entirely. The spread of COVID-19 around the world has become a serious problem as many people believe that it is impossible to return to the world before COVID-19 again. This is an opportunity for countries around the world to recognize that the medical crisis caused by this pandemic is a task to be solved through transnational cooperation, and it is essential to establish a new frame of global \"health security\". The Director-General of the WHO said on Mar 10, 2020, that the outbreak of this novel coronavirus is a public health emergency of international relations, which is the highest level of awareness of the WHO (8) . This was also a declaration calling for a world-class countermeasure of infectious diseases at a global level. This study investigated the situation in which infectious diseases have affected the tourism industry in South Korea, and how the government designed the revitalization plan. The final goal was to reach to lessons and design some remedies that can be applied in medical tourism sector. When it comes to the medical tourism sector, designing the revitalization plan during and after the pandemic is far more difficult due to the nature of this sector. The involved customers are in a very vulnerable situation; besides safety and trust have been always the basic requirements in medical tourism. While during the epidemic or pandemic there is a shortage of both safety and trust levels for travelers around the world. We aimed to have a historical investigation on how infectious diseases have affected the tourism industry in Korea, to reach practical implications for managing the medical tourism sector. With COVID-19, the spread of infectious diseases can harm the medical tourism sector in the short to long term (9). . During that epidemic period, Hong Kong issued a red warning (restriction of unnecessary travel) for travel to Korea, and China recommended a temporary suspension of visits to Korea (10) . The Korean government administered the information provision service by phone for incoming tourists and conducted various activities to address the reliability of the Korean health care system. In 2015, the Korean government operated a crisis response team under control of the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, taking into account the seriousness, spread speed, duration, and ripple effects of MERS and the government's capability to respond to MERS (11) . On May 20, 2015, when the first confirmed patient with MERS occurred, the government raised the alert level of infectious diseases from concern to caution. The government initiated several measures by different organizations, for instance \"public-private joint action group\", the \"task force team for new infectious diseases response\", and the \"MERS coun-termeasure headquarters of the Korean medical association\". The advisory committee, countermeasure committee, and policy committee under the countermeasure headquarters were operated and, especially, the policy committee proposed a mid-to long-term plan for the operation of risk management for infectious diseases at country level. Later, the government announced a plan to reorganize the national quarantine system, and to proceed with the paid compensation for losses to the damaged medical institutions related to MERS. On Jan 2016, the Board of Audit and Inspection announced the results of the MERS incident, and since then, this committee has been operating as a medical-related infection council and to operate the improvement during the epidemic or pandemic (12) .",

There was no noticeable change in the demand of Asia Pacific region except Korea. The total number of tourists traveling to Korea in 2015 was 13,231,651. It had decreased from Jun to Sep and recovered to the previous level after Oct, which caused severe loss in tourism balance (13) . During the three months of the MERS outbreak, the Korean government isolated 16,993 people and spent around 850 million dollars to minimize the effect of MERS (14) . The emergence budget was mostly spent on assistance for the designated hospital for MERS, care facility, and transformation of national quarantine system. The total economic loss is estimated as 8.5 billion dollars. There were tremendous losses in the overall industry including tourism industry; however, since the duration of the MERS outbreak in Korea was rather short, it is inferred that the impact of MERS outbreak is not as massive as that of COVID-19.",

The first COVID-19 confirmed case in Korea was a Chinese woman, who crossed the border on Jan 20, 2020 from Wuhan, China, and as a Korean, a 55year-old man was confirmed on Jan 24. The Korean government established the Central Disaster Management Headquarters on Jan 27. The medical profession connected quarantine and clinical service, operating an emergency medical coun-termeasure headquarter based on the Korea Medical Association and Korean Hospital Association. However, as the cases surged sharply, the government raised the crisis level to \"seriousness\" and other measurements were adopted. They strengthened the quarantine system and public medical system. Specifically, they set up the main department for epidemiological investigation, supplied masks to the public through pharmacies, and implemented the social distancing campaign. In addition, it has been mandatory to quarantine for two weeks after taking the test, and all passengers entering the country must download the diagnostic mobile app and respond to the monitoring of officials. Consequently, the rising trend in the confirmed cases had slowed down in the second half of 2020. The response of the Korean government and the Korean society to COVID-19 demonstrates that not only the government policies but also the cultural context and lifestyle of Korea play a significant role in controlling the spread of virus; all these factors has let to organize the response system actively and promptly (16) .",

However, the experience of MERS in Korea left many valuable lessons on the countermeasures policies to infection diseases. On the previous experience, Korean government enforced neither state control nor active movement control orders. However, for the COVID-19 pandemic, the proactive and transparent regulations of the Korean government decreased the level of negative effects. Even though vaccinations began in some countries, still there is a possibility of another crisis and COVID-19 is far from a complete end. Searching among those action plans that have assisted in revitalized the tourism industry after crisis in Korea, we found the advanced technology as a privilege that can facilitate the revitalization of medical tourism, in the contemporary situation. The world has applied the digitalized health-bio industry based on telemedicine as a remedy to disease prevention and health management and, several countries put much effort into building the telemedicine system. According to McKinsey, since COVID-19, the usage rate of the telemedicine service in the United States increased by 46%, and more doctors and medical institutions are using the telemedicine system (20) . The Korean government has inevitably granted temporary permission for telemedicine only in tele-counseling and prescription. It can be inferred what the medical tourism industry should prepare after the pandemic. If the non-face-toface medical service enlarges in the medical tourism industry, more than 20,000 Korean doctors worldwide, who can communicate in English, can utilize the Korean telemedicine system at their base. Accumulated data for various diseases, diagnoses, and clinic can be exploited to cure patients several times (21) . In the era of COVID-19, it is recommended to reduce the disagreement between the medical and IT industry and decrease the strict regulations on telemedicine. Moreover, specific measures such as the clean tourist destination campaign, the quarantine certification system, and insurance plans for infectious diseases are necessary. Therefore, the nonface-to-face medical service will lead to more promising outcomes in response to infectious diseases later. Specifically, it is recommended to develop a digital health care platform for the biohealth industry and implement an international quarantine certified system and health insurance policy for infectious diseases.",

Firstly, it is recommended to establish a government-centered collaborative system between de-partments and deliver the countermeasures to local health centers and private hospitals in a topdown manner. Secondly, it is advised to ensure transparency in communication with citizens to embrace the decided measures without discordance and request cooperation at the national level. Thirdly, it is proposed to systemize the non-faceto-face medical service. It should provide detailed information such as extensive antibody tests, the movement and isolation of confirmed patients, and vaccination to mobile phones through the IT system. Fourthly, it is encouraged to adopt the international quarantine certification, maintain the quarantine system of local governments, and manage the intact areas. It is principal in the medical tourism industry of the local. Lastly, it is advised to promote the excellence of the K-quarantine model as a country to successfully manage the pandemic.",
