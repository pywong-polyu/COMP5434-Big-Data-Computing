Methods: Children aged 11-12 years and their mothers participating in a UK population-based birth cohort (Wirral Child Health and Development Study) provided mental health data between December 2019 and March 2020, and again 3 months after lockdown, 89% (N = 202) of 226 assessed pre-COVID-19. Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed by self-and maternal reports, and longterm vulnerability by maternal report of prior child adjustment, and maternal prenatal depression. Results: The young adolescents reported a 44% (95% confidence interval [CI: 23%-65%]) increase in symptoms of depression and 26% (95% CI [12%-40%]) for posttraumatic stress disorder, with corresponding maternal reports of child symptoms of 71% (95% CI [44%-99%]) and 43% (95% CI 29%-86%). Disruptive behaviour problem symptoms increased by 76% (95% CI [43%-109%]) particularly in children without previous externalising symptoms. Both female gender and having had high internalising symptoms earlier in childhood were associated with elevated rates of depression pre-pandemic, and with greater absolute increases during COVID-19.",

Follow-up has indicated increases of parent-reported emotional and behavioural problems in children up to age 11 and a decrease of parent-reported emotional problems in adolescents, with adolescent self-report indicating no change in symptoms. In the recent report 'NHS Mental Health in Children Study' (Vizard, Sadler, et al., 2020) , a post-COVID follow-up was collected on a sample of 5-22 years old (N = 3570, 45% follow-up rate) who were assessed 3 years prior to the pandemic. The study reported an increase in rates of probable mental disorder as reported by parents in 5-16-year olds. The increase and absolute rates were similar in boys and girls. However, pre-and postlockdown status was heavily confounded with time, and this limits the ability to attribute the increase to the pandemic. Two studies have provided a more direct test of an increase associated with the pandemic by comparing measurement prior to, and during, the pandemic. Based on parent, but not child, report, Bignardi et al. (2020) found an increase in depressive but not anxiety symptoms in children aged 7-11 years who had been assessed 1",

This includes living in a deprived neighbourhood, inter-partner abuse in the home and specific aspects of COVID-19 exposure, such as having a frontline worker in the household, home-schooling whilst home-working or being exposed to COVID-19 associated stressors, both financial and non-financial (Banks & Xu, 2020; Clark et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020; Vizard, Davis, et al., 2020) .",

Analysis was undertaken in Stata v15.1. Figure 1 shows the participant flow for the 226 families included in this study, and Table 1 their demographic and pre-lockdown characteristics. The 202 responders to the post-lockdown follow-up (89%) did not differ significantly on any of the measured characteristics from the 226 who provided pre-lockdown data ( Table 1) . The majority (66%) of the sample responded within 2 weeks of the survey being sent out, with 90% responding prior to mid-July when schools closed for the summer. Table S1 gives the descriptive statistics for the study measures at the pre-and post-onset COVID-19 assessments. Figure 2 shows, above the horizontal line, the percentage changes in symptoms from pre-lockdown to during lockdown. Children reported a 44% increase in their symptoms of depression (p < .001), and a 26% increase in PTSD symptoms (p < .001). Based on maternal reports, children's depressive symptoms increased by 94% (p < .001); the increase was reduced to 71% (p < .001) after adjusting for levels of maternal depression, a potential source of reporting bias. Mothers also reported marked increases in children's PTSD symptoms (58%, p < .001) and behaviour problems (76%, p < .001); however, they did not report an increase in their anxiety. Sensitivity analyses gave the corresponding estimates of Figure S1 weighted for cohort attrition over the 13 years since recruitment in pregnancy and showed a very similar pattern in both magnitude and statistical significance. Since there was a high correlation between the Child Trauma Screen PTSD questionnaire and the SMFQ (rho = 0.83), we undertook additional exploratory analysis examining the COVID-19-related change on the PTSD measure item by item (described further in Appendix S1). This is shown in Figure S2 , where it can be seen that the changes were confined to items likely to reflect depression. percent change from pre-pandemic * adjusted for raters own PHQ depression score at time of rating mother child F I G U R E 2 Post versus pre-pandemic percentage increase in mental health symptoms and behaviour problems, with child symptoms above the horizontal line and maternal symptoms below Pandemic impact on young adolescent mental health in relation to gender and prior childhood emotional and behavioural problems Figure 3 shows how COVID-19 impacted on rates of clinically significant symptoms in relation to two key influences on adolescent depression, gender and pre-existing emotional and behavioural problems. Based on self-report, girls had more depressive symptoms than boys' pre-lockdown (p = .001) and both genders experienced a similarly large percentage increase in symptoms during lockdown (interaction term, p = .829). Because girls started at a higher level, by mid-lockdown, the difference was substantial, with almost a quarter of girls having clinically significant symptoms compared to around 10% of boys. By contrast, the maternal reports of child symptoms did not show a gender difference either pre-or post-lockdown. In the case of behaviour problems, this may reflect the within-sex standardisation of the CBCL T-score, whereby girls receive a higher T score than boys for the same raw score.",

Their own symptoms of depression increased by 42% over the same period, but there was no change in their levels of anxiety, and they did not report an increase in psychological abuse in the home. Maternal depression prior to the pandemic was higher among those with prenatal depression 12 years earlier, and rose further post-lockdown, while neighbourhood deprivation was associated with more pre-COVID-19 depression but not with a greater rise post-lockdown. None of the COVID-19 associated experiences, such as the presence of a frontline worker in the family, working while home-schooling, COVID-19-related stressful events or financial difficulties, was associated with a disproportionate change in pre-to post-lockdown child or maternal mental health.",

The risk of bias associated with poor child or parent mental health was minimised by a high follow-up pre-to post-lockdown. In this general population birth cohort, we were able to use pregnancy variables to show where attrition over time had not been at random, and account for that in data analyses, thus enhancing the generalisability of our findings. The narrow age range of our sample was both a strength and a weakness. On the one hand, it enabled us to identify an effect at a specific and important developmental period, and on the other hand, it limited the generalisability of our findings. Generalisability is also limited by the lack of ethnic diversity reflecting the demographic characteristics of the Wirral. Whilst the study had good power to detect main effects, statistical power for the moderator effects was the modest. Although we used a measure of PTSD with reported divergent validity from the MFQ in adolescents (Lang & Connell, 2017 , item-level analysis indicated that the increase we observed may be better accounted for by changes in depression. Finally, the majority of the post-COVID survey data was collected within a narrow time frame when strict lockdown restrictions were in place (prior to 4 July), but data collection continued until 4 August, meaning that there is some variation in the experiences of the families who responded.",

First, the follow-up rate from pre-COVID-19 to post-lockdown was 44% compared to 89% in this study reducing risk of bias from mood effects. Second, responses were gathered solely online, while in the current study paper collection was also available, reducing the risk of bias associated with lack of access to the Internet. Third, the measure of depression, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) , unlike the SMFQ used in this study, does not provide coverage of DSM symptoms of major depression, and has a predominance of items referring to a loss of interest in usual activities.",

The first arises from what is well established, that two syndromes of emotional and behavioural problems in childhood and adolescence, depression and disruptive behaviour problems, are associated with increased risk for depression later in life, as well as other mental health problems and social difficulties (Clayborne et al., 2019; Copeland et al., 2009; Harrington et al., 1990 ). Both increased markedly over a short period following the COVID-19 onset, raising the question of whether COVID-19 exposure has added risk for adolescent depression that will persist for much longer over the life course. Second, concern for the possible long-term implications is further raised in children entering adolescence, because this is a period of a rapid increase in depression, when the gender difference is widening and the long-term vulnerability for depression in women is becoming apparent (Cyranowski et al., 2020) .",

It also differs by reporting only on a broad measure of mental health problems and on a sample with a wide age range spanning childhood and adolescence.By embedding this study of COVID-19 impact in a prospective study with recruitment during pregnancy, we were able for the first time to examine how COVID-19 interacts with prior adjustment. The evidence for young adolescents, according to their own reports of their current depression, was that those who were vulnerable, by virtue of having had elevated emotional symptoms five years earlier, had high higher levels of depression prior to COVID-19 which were further added to by COVID-19 exposure. The effect in mothers of prenatal depression 12 years earlier was very similar, underlining the need for evaluated treatments to reduce persistent vulnerability through young adult life. There was no evidence, however, that COVID-19 had a disproportionate effect in those with previous mental health problems. Furthermore, according to mother reports of young adolescent depression and behaviour problems, there was a greater effect of COVID-19 among those not previously identified with higher symptoms. Like previous studies that have found a lesser increase in mental health symptoms in the unemployed than the employed(Pierce et al., 2020;Vizard, Davis, et al., 2020), the explanation for lower COVID-19-related proportional increase in depression among the most deprived families, appeared to arise from pandemic exposure bringing more of the previously advantaged to similar depression levels as the disadvantaged. It may be that COVID-19 does not add substantially to the pressures already experienced by those with fewer economic resources, while those with less prior deprivation experience a greater change.",

            "text": "). Third, our findings indicate that referrals for depression and disruptive behaviour problems during the pandemic are likely to comprise both young people with new onsets of mental health problems for which COVID-19-related stressors may be the most relevant, and others where COVID-19 has added to pre-existing vulnerability with a need for attention to both. Finally, COVID-19 has added risk for those who have already experienced mental health problems, and may have added disproportionally more for those without previous problems, perhaps creating an additional group of young children at risk for future mental health problems. Only further follow-up will tell us whether this is the case, or whether COVID-19 exposure has simply 'brought forward' the first episode of depression in children who would have become depressed later in its absence. Meanwhile, the findings underline the need for a better understanding of risk and protective factors for COVID-19-related mental health problems as a basis for new treatments.",
