Low-and middleincome country governments, for example, have built clinical trial infrastructure to encourage overseas investment that leverages access to their large populations and low-cost base. In India, for example, the government established training institutes to upskill the clinical trial workforce and hospital departments were provided additional equipment and funding for staff to act as clinical trial investigators. v These types of infrastructure investments have increased activity though the resulting trials may prioritise the health concerns of the higher-income markets funding the trials over local health issues. At the same time, in developed countries, over-complex infrastructure and fragmented regulatory and approval systems have been a frequent target of reform. In addition, saturation of the clinical trials services market has meant that fees for some aspects of trial conduct have risen to unsustainable levels, leading to reduced investment and activity particularly in non-commercial trials. A 2013 Government of Australia review found that \"Australia has become one of the most expensive locations for clinical trials in the world\" vi spurring calls to make the sector more efficient and more internationally competitive.",

The largest effects were observed from multi-modal interventions targeting the same diseases areas under the United States Orphan Drug Act, which included direct funding of researchers and trial participant costs as well as an R&D tax credit for participating corporations. Similarly, Canada achieved a large increase in trials addressing human immune deficiency virus in the early 1990s following a dedicated $20.5M funding tranche provided direct to researchers. xxii Less focused initiatives, such as the establishment of a new funding route through the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), have also driven substantial growth. As well as providing significant additional funding to researchers, the establishment of the NIHR funding mechanisms is credited with attracting new funding from commercial companies (\u00a34.4B between FY 2016-19) leading to a 30% increase in the number of clinical trials done over that period. xxiii Governments have also direct-funded a wide range of initiatives to enable the better conduct of clinical trials. The Korean Drug Development Fund established 15 purpose-built clinical trial centres attached to major teaching hospitals operated under the supervision of the Korea National Enterprises for Clinical Trials that also runs a training academy for professionals involved in clinical trials. From 2007 to 2013, there was a 50% increase in the number of sponsor-initiated commercial oncology trials, while investigator-initiated trials increased by 640%.",

Both the 150% rebate and the ensuing 16.7% inducement rate are considered high. xxvii The rebate was subsequently lowered, removed altogether and recently reinstated such that small-to-medium enterprises with an annual turnover of <$20M receive a 43.5% tax credit on eligible expenditure versus a 38.5% tax credit for larger companies. An industry group report asserts that the R&D tax credit is responsible for about 10% of Australian clinical trial activity. xxviii India has also deployed an R&D tax credit to boost clinical trials activity commencing in 2001 at 150%. Due to its success, the rate was increased to 200% between 2010-2017 xxix but was later reduced due to concerns about effectiveness when national research spending shrank from 0.83% to 0.63% of Indian gross domestic product between 2011 and 2015. xxx The United States' R&D tax credit was first implemented in 1982 as part of The Economic Recovery and Tax Act passed the year prior and provided a credit of 125% for eligible items of expenditure.

Rather, they boosted multiple aspects of research and development, many of which were only peripherally associated with clinical trials. As such, taxation policies may be a more expensive intervention for governments seeking to increase clinical trial numbers or lower the costs associated with doing clinical trials, though broader benefits across the research sector may accrue. In one intervention in India, the government removed import duties only on items required for use in clinical trials, xxxii which enabled more specific targeting of the intervention. Likewise, in another Indian government intervention, more generous tax exemptions were provided specifically for trials relating to orphan medicines or rare diseases where the nature of the patient population makes economies of scale impossible to achieve. xxxiii This strategy provided for a more targeted application of the taxation benefits. A final approach to targeting of preferential income tax rates was to make only a highly selected subset of companies eligible. xxxiv Developing country nations have achieved a major increase in their share of the clinical trial market in recent times. India, for example, grew its portion of global clinical trials from 0.9 per cent in 2008 to 5 per cent in 2013 and China has experienced similar expansion. At the same time, the share of clinical trial activities done in the United States and other developed countries has been declining as research organisations seek to take advantage of lower costs. xxxv Likely as a reflection of this trend, 29 of the 41 fiscal interventions identified by this systematic review were done by developed countries seeking to lower their costs and boost their competitiveness (Figure 3 ).",

A subsequent review of this tax credit found it had inducement rates of 16.7% meaning that for every $10M of expenditure, it would induce a company to invest an additional $1.67M which is considered high. l The year following its introduction saw a sharp increase (close to double) in the number of PubMed clinical trial publications. liThe explicit aim to grow clinical trials was given to support a 150% R&D Tax Credit that began in 2001/2. Over the next ten years clinical trials grew from 40-50 trials registered India to over 1850 trials registered in 2011 lii .Corporate Income Tax Law 2007/8 set R&D tax rates at 150% The paper points to massive growth of the CT industry 4 trials registered in 2001 to 497 in 2010 however much of this exponential growth took place before the tax law changes.Reduced corporate tax rate by 15% for eligible companies.

Although clinical trials have grown significantly over time, it is difficult to attribute that growth to the tax credit.",
