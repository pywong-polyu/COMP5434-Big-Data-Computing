Conclusion. Psychological support can affect positively the perception of tinnitus and the change in moods experienced during the pandemic. Because personal contact and quotidian activities are severely limited during the pandemic, internet-based interventions should be prioritised in tinnitus therapy.",

Many risk factors have been defined for tinnitus, such as sensorineural hearing loss, ototoxic drugs, tumours and emotional stress. 6 Tinnitus has also been associated with psychosocial disorders, such as stress, depression and anxiety. 7, 8 Changes in the emotional state and quality of life of individuals who have subjective tinnitus complaints appear to be important factors for changes in tinnitus perception. 9 It was observed that the patients who were diagnosed and were being followed up for subjective tinnitus in our clinic before the Covid-19 pandemic experienced more emotional complaints and increased tinnitus severity when re-admitted to our clinic during the pandemic. We believe that the increased stress levels due to quarantine conditions during the pandemic may have changed the patients' perception of tinnitus and increased its severity. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the pandemic in terms of changes in emotional state and quality of life associated with tinnitus severity in these patients.",

Several studies have reported that factors such as anxiety, stress and pessimism have a negative effect on tinnitus. 8, 13 Almost half of the respondents reported occupational changes due to the pandemic; this was reflected in the survey results, and indicated that this situation negatively impacts tinnitus. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and VAS scores were worse during the pandemic than those before the pandemic. The mechanism of tinnitus occurrence and treatment methods are still being discussed. Tinnitus is often claimed to be more noticeable in quiet environments, and this has led to the use of some form of background noise during tinnitus treatments to help prevent the starkness of tinnitus perception. 14 Avoiding a silent environment has been suggested as an effective method to overcome auditory deprivation and increase symptom masking. 15 During the pandemic, it is believed that the absence of environmental masking sounds in daily life may have increased the perception of tinnitus. 16, 17 Moreover, increased stress and anxiety levels during the pandemic are other potential risk factors that could have worsened tinnitus perception. 16, 17 In our study, parallel to these results, it was observed that the pandemic increased stressful, anxious and pessimistic moods, and consequently increased the perception of tinnitus.",

(1990) , which utilised the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory questionnaire in tinnitus cases, revealed a high score on the depression scale in men, and indicated a connection between long-term tinnitus and hypochondria, defined as health phobia. 20 In the literature, it is stated that a high score on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory depression scale is specific to patients with severe tinnitus, and that stress and anxiety exacerbated their tinnitus symptoms. 21 When compared with the general population, the rate of anxiety and somatoform disorders are higher in individuals with tinnitus, and anxiety and somatoform disorders are also associated with tinnitus perception. 16 In our study, a difference was found between the pre-and peri-pandemic Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores ( p = 0.026), which is in line with studies that found a relationship between tinnitus and mood. 11, 22 Individuals with tinnitus complaints are unhappy, pessimistic, anxious, aggressive, stressed and depressive, and can find it difficult to fall asleep. Tinnitus can prevent these individuals from enjoying life, focusing and relaxing. 16 In addition, the perception of tinnitus loudness and annoyance increases in emotional situations, such as when experiencing stress, anxiety, pessimism, unhappiness or sadness. 16 Besides the worsened perception of tinnitus in 2020 associated with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant increase in tinnitus incidence was observed. An increase in tinnitus cases due to elevated psychological stress related to the Covid-19 pandemic was supported by relevant studies, according to which the psychological stress that emerged when coping with various pressures related to the Covid-19 pandemic increased the prevalence of anxiety in tinnitus patients. 11, 22 We attributed the increase in the scores to elevated stress associated with the Covid-19 pandemic because we found a positive correlation between the participants' moods and their Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and VAS scores. More studies need to be conducted to investigate the long-term effects of coronavirus infection on the hearing system and tinnitus. Our study included only a small sample size, with a limited number of research articles reviewed.",
