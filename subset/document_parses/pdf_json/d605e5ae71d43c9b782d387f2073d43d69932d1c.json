            "text": "Congenital anomalies and genetic conditions are noted in approximately 2-5% of pregnancies and are major causes of fetal demise and infant death. 1, 2 Chromosomal microarray is recommended to evaluate for chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses with congenital anomalies, but 60-70% of fetuses remain without a genetic diagnosis after microarray, which can complicate counseling, prenatal management, and parental decision-making. 3, 4 With the decreasing cost and turnaround time (TAT) of genomic testing methodologies, broad testing approaches such as exome sequencing (ES) are being used more frequently for prenatal diagnosis of monogenic disorders not detectable by microarray. Current professional society opinions support the use of prenatal ES (pES) in select cases of anomalies suggestive of a genetic disorder with the input of a clinical geneticist. 3, 5, 6 Prior case series have reported highly variable diagnostic yields of pES from 6.2% to 89%, with most reporting yields of 20-40%. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] However, it remains to be determined whether this improved diagnostic yield is meaningful to the patient and family. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics defines the clinical utility of genetic testing as its \"effects on diagnostic or therapeutic management, implications for prognosis, health and psychological benefits to patients and their relatives, and economic impact on health-care systems.\" 21 Most genetics providers believe that pES will have clinical utility. [22] [23] [24] [25] Previous studies of pES indicate that results can impact decision-making about continuation or termination, pre-or postnatal medical management, delivery planning, recurrence risk counseling, reproductive planning, and parental medical management. [8] [9] [10] 13, 18, 20, 26 However, there are also risks and limitations of pES that must be considered. Since parents may choose to terminate their pregnancy based on the results, there is a potential for harm if results are ambiguous, unexpected, and/or misunderstood. 25, 27 As in postnatal ES, there is a risk of discovering incidental or secondary findings. The interpretation of variants detected on pES can be also challenging because the prenatal-onset phenotypes of many disorders are poorly characterized and the phenotype information about a fetus is often limited. 19 Additionally, pES requires a rapid TAT if results are to be used for clinical management, which can be labor-intensive for both the clinical and laboratory teams. The cost of pES may pose a significant burden to patients because most US health-care insurance providers do not cover the cost of this test, citing a lack of evidence to support its clinical utility. 28 Given the potential limitations, additional studies are needed to establish the clinical utility of pES to justify its use. Here, we examine the clinical utility of pES in a cohort of 20 patients seen at our institution for pregnancies affected by congenital anomalies.",

All patients underwent detailed prenatal phenotyping via ultrasound, fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and fetal echocardiogram, as well as evaluation by a multidisciplinary team including a clinical geneticist, genetic counselor, maternal fetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, and additional subspecialists as needed based on the fetal anomalies (e.g., fetal/pediatric surgeon, neurologist). Patients were considered eligible for pES if their fetus had congenital anomalies thought to be caused by an underlying genetic 1 disorder but for which multigene panels were not felt to be suitable as determined by the clinical geneticist and genetic counselor. All patients underwent chromosomal microarray testing prior to or concurrently with pES. Some patients had additional testing, such as amniotic fluid viral studies, based on their indications. There were no gestational age restrictions for eligibility. Patients considering TOP, a comfort care approach, or full medical interventions were all eligible. Patients were eligible for this chart review if pES produced a result (i.e., no sample failure) and they were no longer pregnant at the time of chart review.",

The parents had previously decided on palliative care based on the poor prognosis associated with the imaging findings (Fig. 1a) . Phenotypes reported in animal studies of NMNAT2 were consistent with the fetal anomalies. The clinical team believed this was likely the diagnosis for the fetus, which facilitated counseling about a recurrence risk of 25% and prompted the parents to pursue preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) resulting in a healthy child. They later had another pregnancy affected by similar anomalies and underwent targeted prenatal diagnostic testing that confirmed the same NMNAT2 variants in this fetus. Functional studies established that these variants impair NMNAT2 function and supported this gene's association with fetal akinesia deformation sequence. 29 Case 2. Megalencephaly, neuronal migration anomalies, enlarged globes, thickened chin soft tissue, and ambiguous genitalia detected by ultrasound at 23 2/7 weeks gestation pES detected a pathogenic variant in AKT1 consistent with a diagnosis of Proteus syndrome (OMIM 176920). Based on the grave prognosis of Proteus syndrome in the context of the fetal anomalies ( Fig. 1b) , the parents enrolled in perinatal palliative care. At 35 weeks gestation, the fetal head circumference was greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean. Due to concerns that continued overgrowth of the head was likely and could result in maternal morbidity during delivery, her delivery timing was changed from 37 to 35 weeks gestation to reduce the risk of maternal morbidity and she delivered by an uncomplicated cesarean section with a low-transverse incision. After birth, the baby received a full-body MRI to screen for additional Proteus syndrome-related overgrowth. Her known diagnosis and enrollment in palliative care allowed her medical team to minimize the duration of her hospital stay and she was discharged at 10 days of life. She later developed seizures requiring polypharmacy, including the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus to target the AKT1 biochemical pathway. Unfortunately, she died of respiratory failure at 6 months. The parents were counseled about the negligible recurrence risk for future pregnancies due to the sporadic nature of Proteus syndrome. The parents reported psychosocial utility of the result as it facilitated their connection to Proteus syndrome support groups.",

The mother had opted for full neonatal intervention prior to receiving the pES results of a presumed de novo pathogenic variant in KMT2D consistent with a diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920). Due to the risk for immunodeficiency associated with Kabuki syndrome, an immunology evaluation was performed at 3 weeks of life which demonstrated lymphopenia. At 18 months, he developed hypogammaglobulinemia requiring intravenous immunoglobulin.

Therefore, pES was recommended to guide parental decision-making. pES detected compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in NEB consistent with nemaline myopathy 2 (OMIM 256030). After receiving the pES results, the prenatal care team recommended against performing an EXIT delivery due to the poor long-term prognosis of this condition and the increased risk of maternal complications associated with EXIT delivery. Instead, the care team and mother elected for a C-section delivery with attempt to intubate the infant while still on placental support. They also referred the parents to a perinatal palliative care team. Given the likely respiratory distress and lifelong need for mechanical ventilation, the parents requested intubation and a trial of mechanical ventilation after delivery but declined chest compressions and tracheostomy placement. The delivery and intubation were successful, and the baby ultimately remained ventilator dependent. His parents took time for valuable psychosocial interventions including memory-making activities and baptism prior to removal of his breathing tube. The diagnosis also allowed for counseling about the 25% recurrence risk. ",

While COL2A1 is known to be associated with multiple types of skeletal dysplasia, it had not been previously associated with heart defects. Therefore, it is uncertain whether this case expands the phenotype of COL2A1-related skeletal dysplasia or if the heart defect had a separate etiology. The prenatal genetic diagnosis supported the decision to pursue palliative care and facilitated counseling about the low recurrence risk for the skeletal dysplasia due to the de novo nature of the variant. pES also identified two variants in PIEZO1, a gene associated with autosomal dominant iron overload, splenomegaly, and gallstones (OMIM 194380), and autosomal recessive lymphedema (OMIM 616843).

The patient declined amniocentesis solely for genetic testing, so pES was sent at 36 weeks gestation when she required an amnioreduction due to polyhydramnios.

As intensive neonatal care and targeted therapies are not available at all hospitals, prenatal genetic diagnosis can facilitate referrals to institutions that are able to provide the appropriate therapies without delay. A prenatal genetic diagnosis may also limit expensive or invasive diagnostic testing that may be performed while postnatal testing is pending.",

With earlier referrals to palliative care services, families form stronger bonds with their health-care team and have a healthier grieving process. 35, 36 While families may choose to redirect to a palliative care approach after learning of a life-limiting diagnosis in their newborn, deciding to withdraw care that has already begun is often more difficult for families than avoiding invasive and painful care in the first place. 37 Indeed, the diagnoses in cases 2 and 6 facilitated prenatal enrollment in a perinatal palliative care program, allowing these families to request avoidance of futile, painful procedures such as chest compressions; decrease the baby's inpatient hospital stay to maximize family bonding at home; and plan meaningful rituals, such as baptism and memorymaking, prior to the baby's death. Therefore, while it is not always possible to improve a baby's long-term outcome, prenatal diagnosis can improve the baby's quality of life and the overall experience of the family.",

We did not identify any cases where clinical management changes were made based on the lack of a genetic diagnosis from an inconclusive or negative result, which may be in part because pregnancy termination is not common in our clinic's population. Additionally, for our patients who had pES during an ongoing pregnancy, it was ordered in the late second to late third trimesters; we therefore cannot comment on the clinical utility of pES results in the first or early second trimesters. Future prospective studies should be performed to better evaluate and maximize the impact of positive, inconclusive, and negative pES results on clinical decision-making throughout pregnancy.",

As some of these decisions are only possible in the prenatal period, deferring genetic testing to the postnatal period is not always ideal. In cases where a genetic etiology is suspected and parents are pursuing TOP or where intrauterine fetal demise is likely, pES may be the only feasible opportunity to establish a genetic diagnosis to guide future reproductive planning. Additionally, pES may have clinical utility in cases where multiple care options are available, such as intensive in utero or neonatal intervention, TOP, and palliative care, but where the imaging findings alone are not sufficient to guide parental decision-making.",
