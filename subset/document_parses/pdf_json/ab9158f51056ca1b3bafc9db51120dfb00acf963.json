Another RCT found no differences in perceived quality of responses using the between chatbot versus real-time physician-written responses to user queries from women treated for breast cancer (average QLQ-INFO25 score 2.89 and 2.82 respectively) 16 . The third RCT reported no significant difference in symptoms of anxiety and depression, quantified using the Emotional Disturbance Anxiety Score, between patients using a chatbot (cohort 1) and a control cohort without chatbot access (cohort 2) over a 4-week study period. Upon completion of the first study period, the control cohort (cohort 2) were then granted access to the chatbot and symptoms of anxiety and depression were quantified after a second 4-week study period. After the second study period, patients in cohort 2 demonstrated a reduction in reported symptoms of anxiety compared with baseline measurements and anxiety scores after the first study period, although this reduction was not statistically significant 17 . A nonrandomised comparative study demonstrated comparable follow-up consultation rates after orthopaedic surgery using a telephone-based conversational agent compared with calls made by individuals, saving an estimated 9.3 hours per 100 participants 18 .
