            "text": "Telemedicine (remote consulting) is defined as the exchange of medical information and delivery of medical care through electronic, digital and internet-based or telephone-based communication. Pre-pandemic, the main benefit of remote consulting was providing subspecialty healthcare to rural or underserved populations, where reducing patient travel for hospital visits was seen as a way to improve equity of service delivery 1 and achieve better access for patients with impaired mobility or other disabilities (eg, cognitive) from chronic neurological conditions. [2] [3] [4] Remote consulting has been a wellestablished care model in neurology for over 10 years, 5 primarily for stroke treatment. Stroke telemedicine has enabled accessibility to acute stroke care and timely administration of thrombolysis with improved patient outcomes such as independent ambulation and reduction in disability days. 6 More recently, it has evolved as a model in chronic neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] A study by Qiang and Marras 12 implementing remote consulting for patients with Parkinson's disease demonstrated high patient satisfaction due to improved convenience, accessibility and reduced caregiver burden. Additionally, for patients with multiple sclerosis, remote consulting enhanced medication compliance. 11 Despite the benefits of remote consulting, there are drawbacks. It is a less personable medium, which challenges the building of rapport in the clinician-patient relationship. 9 13 As it can be difficult or impossible to perform clinical examination via remote consulting, it lends itself best to history-driven conditions. The implications of missing key information or clinical signs from remote consulting remain to be examined in the context of patient safety and quality of care. Additionally, remote consulting comes with risks associated with the digital divide among patients 14 ; alongside technical, logistical and regulatory challenges. 9 The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a huge shift towards remote consultations. 15 Physicians and healthcare systems worldwide have adopted remote treatment approaches that obviate the need for physical contact between patients and healthcare providers, thus reducing risk of viral transmission. Many Open access of these changes and models of care will likely persist after the pandemic-sustainable adaptations and enhancement of remote delivery systems are therefore crucial to optimise healthcare provision and mitigate inconsistencies in care.",

In addition, patients aged >80 years were associated with lower odds of satisfaction compared with other age groups.

Male patients were more likely to report satisfaction with remote consultations compared with female patients (1.38, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.79).

The majority of clinicians preferred phone over video (phone 63% vs video 33%, p=0.003), indicating that phone consultations were as effective and informative as video appointments, without the added technical challenges (for both patients and neurologists) of the latter. Phone appointments were largely the preferred consultation type as they were easier to organise, more widely available and reliable, and less technically complex. Although favoured by fewer clinicians overall, the stated benefits of video consultations included the enhanced ability for rapport-building through non-verbal communication and improved performance of clinical examination, even if limited.",

Although patients were enthusiastic about video consultations, the majority of patients received phone appointments as this type of remote consultation was the favoured method for clinicians. This preference of clinicians may be related to some internet connections being insufficient for \"Attend Anywhere\" consultations, which consequently often results in them switching to phone appointments. 19 The contrary patient preference may be related to video consultations allowing greater familiarity and engagement with the physician through body language and non-verbal communication, such as eye contact, supporting the patient's confidence and trust in the physician. 20 Additionally, the satisfaction and subjective success of remote consulting differed between the two groups. Most clinicians (72%) described obstacles around establishing patient rapport and therapeutic relationships during remote consultations, while the advantages, such as the effect on overall workload, were less clear. This is in contrast to prior studies that reported numerous benefits for physicians, including time saving and fewer missed appointments and cancellations. 3 21 Nevertheless, similar findings regarding challenges with technology and subsequent impairment in the consultation quality have been reported in other studies. 3 19 22 The majority of patients surveyed expressed satisfactory communication with their clinicians-citing adequate explanations (88%) and competent responses to their questions and concerns (89%)-which may have contributed towards the high overall patient satisfaction. This relates to the findings of Elliott et al, 23 who concluded that the factors most associated with high patient satisfaction were the physician's capability to build rapport, share information and provide guidance. Despite the differing views between clinicians and patients on remote consulting, both groups agreed that routine remote consultations should be implemented in the future. ",

Considering that individuals with neurological conditions frequently have communication disorders (ie, speech and hearing disabilities), research into the infrastructure requirements to support this patient cohort is necessary for effective remote consulting to be implemented more extensively. 24 This may include remote interpretation services being available and easily accessible to physicians when needed. 25 Additionally, certain patient groups were overrepresented in the data (ie, individuals with myasthenia gravis and other myasthenic syndromes account for 24% of respondents and those with epilepsy/genetic epilepsy comprise 20%); as such, the neurological conditions of the patients included in this study are not accurately representative of the variety of neurological patients Open access encountered in the community. The high number of patients with myasthenia gravis participating in this study may reflect the enthusiasm of this patient cohort and implicitly suggest that patients with myasthenia gravis may be relatively more amenable to remote reviews. Such findings could be attributed to greater promotional activity by the corresponding charitable organisations, which led to increased awareness and completion of the online survey in these cohorts. We also need to acknowledge that the patients who responded to the online survey are likely the ones who are more technologically proficient and familiar with web-based applications and those with less severe forms of neurological conditions; these factors may have also influenced the outcomes. Finally, the survey was conducted from October to November 2020 and therefore provides a snapshot of experiences during the pandemic. Factors such as improved telehealth care systems, acclimatisation to the new clinic workflow and navigation through the telehealth platforms by patients and clinicians-but also pandemic and digital fatigue on the other side-would inevitably affect the outcome profile when re-implementing the survey.",
