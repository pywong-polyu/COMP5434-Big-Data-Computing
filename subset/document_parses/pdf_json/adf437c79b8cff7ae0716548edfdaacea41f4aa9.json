More specifically, the SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by combinations of epidemiological risk, clinical features, and positive detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens using the National Medical Production Administration authorized GeneoDX kit. COVID-19 patients' blood samples were immediately collected when admitted into the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen.

Furthermore, consecutive failed detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from upper respiratory specimens in patients with apparent clinical symptoms were also sporadically reported, in which the positive results can only be achieved by collecting the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for re-testing [21] . Hence, a sensitive serological diagnosis method may serve as a handy compensation tool for current clinical diagnosis situations. Our results demonstrated that the IgG testing is helpful for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, as a relatively higher specificity and sensitivity were observed in our chemiluminescence method particularly in patients with onset over 2 weeks. In the humoral immune response, the antibody IgM was generally produced earlier than the IgG isotype as the IgM can be expressed without the isotype switching. Unexpectedly, no statistically significant detection rate difference was observed between these two antibodies isotype testing manner in patients with the onset of disease less than 7 days. Since we only had 12 cases in this category, the limited samples may serve as a confounding factor for this phenomenon. In contrast, a significantly higher detection rate was seen for IgG testing manner in patients with symptom onset over 1 week compared with that of the IgM testing manner (57/67 vs 42/67).

An indepth look of their symptom onset time indicates that all of them were less than 14 days, with six people even less 7 days when collected samples (Supplementary Table S2 ). Hence, the lower detection rate for these twelve people younger than 18 years old was likely associated with less or no production of antibodies in them at the time when we collected the peripheral bloods. In our parallel performance testing, the same antigen of nucleocapsid protein was used in both the commercially available ELISA kit and our chemiluminescence immunoassay.
