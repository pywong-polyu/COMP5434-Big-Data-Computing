Pre-CORAL, ID physicians reviewed all PUI records to guide workup and precautions. Post-CORAL, frontline clinicians evaluated PUIs directly using CORAL. We compared pre-and post-CORAL frequency of repeat SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), time from NAAT result to PUI status discontinuation, total duration of PUI status, and ID physician work-hours, using linear and logistic regression, adjusted for COVID-19 incidence.",

CORAL solved this critical problem, because it guided diagnostic evaluation and discontinuation of the PUI status 24 hours/day.

However, the difference in these key outcomes pre-CORAL and post-CORAL was sustained after adjusting for COVID-19 incidence. Furthermore, in the late pre-CORAL period, we also observed paradoxical increases in these outcomes, as well as time from final result-return to CoV-Risk discontinuation and overall CoV-Risk duration, despite declining COVID-19 incidence. These increases corresponded to a shift from a system of active PUI to passive PUI evaluation, which makes it more likely that the decreased testing A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 15 utilization and CoV-Risk duration were directly attributable to the standardization of and 24/7 access to diagnostic guidance through the CORAL CDSS rather than declining COVID-19",

For example, the Corona-score algorithm relies on age, sex, chest imaging, and laboratory values; it demonstrates 82-96% sensitivity to predict COVID-19 infection among patients presenting to the emergency department [30, 32] . While other scoring systems have demonstrated reasonable sensitivity for COVID-19 infection compared with a single NAAT, CORAL remains unique as the only algorithm, to our knowledge, that has been incorporated into routine, prospective clinician workflow via an EHR CDSS. CORAL guides clinicians through additional diagnostic recommendations after a negative test, which other published tools do not incorporate [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Finally, since CORAL is embedded into Epic\u2122, it could be adopted by This study has several limitations. COVID-19 incidence declined before CORAL was implemented; however, differences in outcomes pre-and post-CORAL were sustained after adjusting for COVID-19 incidence to capture pre-test probability. Delays in test TAT may have contributed to longer duration of CoV-Risk in the early pre-CORAL period, but CoV-Risk duration was lower post-CORAL compared with the late pre-CORAL. Our evaluation of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the 14 days after CoV-Risk discontinuation is limited by cliniciandirected testing of patients, and may have been influenced by the lower COVID-19 incidence in the post-CORAL period. CORAL requires recent imaging and accurate history taking by frontline clinicians. Due to changes in PUI definitions over time, patients in the pre-CORAL period were more likely to be at higher risk for COVID-19, given that testing was initially focused on symptomatic individuals; however, testing of all admitted patients regardless of symptoms started mid-way through the pre-CORAL period. Finally, this analysis was conducted at a singlecenter with specific testing protocols and guidelines for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions. However, other facilities have similar protocols and guidelines [34, 35] , and CORAL has since been implemented in eight other affiliated facilities and used over 19,000 times. ",

Throughout the study period, all NAATs were performed on emergency use authorized assays, including a laboratory-developed qPCR test (turnaround time [TAT], 8-36 hours; through March 23 rd ), Roche COBAS \u00ae SARS-CoV-2 (TAT, 6-18 hours; used March 23 rd onwards), and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress \u00ae SARS-CoV-2 (TAT, 2-4 hours; used March 30 th onwards). Please see full details regarding test availability in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figure 1. In early March, SARS-CoV-2 NAAT was limited to inpatients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Admission NAAT screening for all patients began on April 23 rd . Patients were considered PUIs if they endorsed COVID-19 symptoms, had epidemiologic risk factors (i.e., living in a congregate setting, experiencing homelessness, or receiving hemodialysis treatment), or if a history could not reliably be obtained. PUIs were isolated with Enhanced Respiratory Isolation (ERI; gown, gloves, N95 or powered air purifying respirator, and eye protection), admitted to single-occupancy rooms, and marked with \"CoV-Risk\" in the electronic health record (EHR; Supplementary Table 1). Discontinuation of CoV-Risk indicated that the patient was no longer a PUI and allowed for discontinuation of ERI. If clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remained high despite negative NAATs, PUIs were labeled \"CoV-Presumed\" and maintained with ERI. Pre-CORAL: ID physician review of PUIs From March 18 th to April 23 rd , ID physicians actively evaluated all hospitalized PUIs who had an initial negative NAAT prior to discontinuation of ERI. These physicians iteratively reviewed a list of PUIs in the EHR and proactively contacted frontline providers with diagnostic recommendations. From April 24 th to May 19 th , ID physicians passively evaluated all PUIs; frontline clinicians conducted guideline-based COVID-19 workup (Supplementary Figure 2), and requested ID physician review once complete. A team of 6-12 ID physicians/day, each contributing 4-12 hours/day, reviewed the EHR and, if needed, spoke to care teams to examine clinical details regarding the PUI's exposure history, epidemiologic risk factors, symptom types and duration, laboratory values, imaging studies, and response to treatment for alternative diagnoses. Based on this information, the ID physician recommended discontinuation of CoV-Risk or additional work-up (e.g., repeat SARS-CoV-2 NAAT from a NP or lower respiratory tract [LRT] specimen, serology, chest computed tomography [CT]; Supplementary Methods,",
