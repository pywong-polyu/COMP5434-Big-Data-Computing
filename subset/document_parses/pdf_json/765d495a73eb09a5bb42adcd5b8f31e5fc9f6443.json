Actually, Japan focused on only finding clusters and tracing strategy without rigorous testing for the public, did not enforce a lockdown with penalties, and promoted domestic travel through \"Go to Travel and Eat campaigns\" to mitigate economic damage until the end of 2020. Also, Sweden did not close bars, restaurants, and other public spaces, and actively discouraged people from wearing face masks, which some experts described as a \"herd immunity\" strategy.",

Although such data in Japan is not available, the country has the most advanced aging population in East Asia, which might be responsible for the serious economic damage. Therefore, lenient infection control measures may have limited economic benefits in countries with aging populations like Japan and Sweden.",
