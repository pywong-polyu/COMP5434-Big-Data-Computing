Among aeroallergens, the house dust mite (HDM) allergen Dermatophagoides farinae major allergen 1 (Der f1) is one of the most important contributing factors in asthma exacerbation. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that the mediators from airway epithelial cells elicited by respiratory viruses and Der f1 may differ between rhinoviruses and other respiratory viruses. Among these mediators, IL-8 (CXCL8) is a CXC chemokine with the neutrophil-attractant Glu-Leu-Arg (ERL)",

The aim of this study was to compare the chemokine production induced by HRVs in airway epithelial cells with that induced by other respiratory viruses, and to investigate synergistic interactions between HRVs and HDMs on the induction of inflammatory chemokines in vitro. Methods: A549 human airway epithelial cells were infected with either rhinovirus serotype 7, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-A2 strain, or adenovirus serotype 3 and analyzed for interleukin (IL)-8 and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) release and mRNA expression. Additionally, activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and activator protein (AP)-1 were evaluated. The release of IL-8 and RANTES was also measured in cells stimulated simultaneously with a virus and the HDM allergen, Der f1. Results: HRV caused greater IL-8 and RANTES release and mRNA expression compared with either RSV or adenovirus. NF-\u03baB and AP-1 were activated in these processes. Cells incubated with a virus and Der f1 showed an increased IL-8 release. However, compared with cells incubated with virus alone as the stimulator, only HRV with Der f1 showed a statistically significant increase. Conclusions: IL-8 and RANTES were induced to a greater extent by HRV compared with other viruses, and only HRV with Der f1 acted synergistically to induce bronchial epithelial IL-8 release. These findings may correspond with the fact that rhinoviruses are identified more frequently than other viruses in cases of acute exacerbation of asthma.",

            "text": "Long-term follow-up of infants has showed that HRV-bronchiolitis infections are associated with a greater risk of wheeze compared to RSV-associated bronchiolitis. 2 Further, recent epidemiological studies indicate that rhinoviruses are the only type of virus significantly associated with asthma exacerbations in children aged 2-17 years. 3 However, it is not entirely understood why rhinoviruses are more frequently associated with asthma development and acute asthma exacerbations compared with motif. Both IL-8 and neutrophils are features of difficult-to-treat asthma phenotypes, similar to virus-induced acute asthma and severe asthma. 4, 5 Regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES [CCL5]) is another chemokine that plays an important role in asthma by inducing selective recruitment of Th2-type T-cells and eosinophils. With regard to the transcription of IL-8 and RANTES, previous studies have shown that activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB or activator protein (AP)-1 can induce the production of these two chemokines, each with distinct kinetics. [6] [7] [8] To address our question, A549 cells were infected with rhinovirus serotype 7, RSV-A2 strain, and adenovirus serotype 3 with or without Der f1. We analyzed the release and mRNA expression of IL-8 and RANTES. In this process, we also investigated the relationship between the production of chemokines and the activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1.",

The CC chemokines eotaxin, RANTES, and MIP-1\u03b1 are known to be potent chemoattractants for eosinophils. In particular, RANTES is another key proinflammatory chemokine produced by virus-infected epithelial cells and is present in the respiratory secretions of asthmatics. 12 Compared with respiratory disease-free children, greater concentrations of RANTES and MIP-1\u03b1 have been demonstrated in nasopharyngeal secretions and tracheal aspirates of infants with RSV-associated bronchiolitis. 13 RANTES not only plays a major role in governing eosinophilia but also in controlling viral replication by recruiting CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. 11 In our study, rhinovirus http://e-aair.org and RSV showed statistically significant increases in the release of RANTES, but this was not the case for adenovirus. Many other reports show the relationship between rhinovirus or RSV and RANTES secretion in airway epithelial cells. Konno et al. 14 reported that the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 by T-cells and NK-cells within airway tissues during the early stages of rhinovirus infection could regulate interactions between viral particles and host epithelial cells, and subsequent RANTES secretion. They suggested that because RANTES is a potent chemoattractant for memory T-cells, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, augmentation of RANTES secretion in vivo could enhance airway inflammation and promote airway obstruction. John et al. 15 showed that RSV-induced RANTES contributes to exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation in a study utilizing a murine model. However, in the case of adenovirus infection, there are no previous reports that analyze the relationship between adenovirus and RANTES secretion in acute asthma exacerbation. The present study did not find a correlation between RANTES and adenovirus in the airway epithelial cells.",

In the present study, all three viruses activated the NF-\u03baB pathway, and the use of a NF-\u03baB inhibitor suppressed virus-induced IL-8 and RANTES production. Van Ly et al. 23 recently showed that the NF-\u03baB inhibitor BAY-117085 (BAY) inhibited rhinovirus-induced IL-6, but not IL-8. They suggested that NF-\u03baB activation alone may not be the causative factor for rhinovirus-induced IL-8 production, but perhaps the combined activation of NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) may be more important. However, in the present study, we used PDTC as an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB and successfully suppressed the production of IL-8 and RANTES by viral infection. In addition, activation of AP-1 with all three viruses was observed, and an inhibitor of AP-1 also suppressed virus-induced chemokine production. These findings can be interpreted as NF-\u03baB and AP-1 pathways being involved in virus induced IL-8 and RANTES production, each with distinct kinetics. To develop an effective therapeutic strategy for respiratory virus induced asthma exacerbation, combined treatments incorporating an NF-\u03baB inhibitor, multiple NF-\u03baB inhibitors, or inhibitors of other transcription factors such as AP-1 may be effective.",

            "text": "Finally, this study yielded new data relating to the inflammatory response of human alveolar epithelial cells after exposure to two major environmental stimuli associated with asthma exacerbation. We showed that rhinovirus and Der f1 are synergistic with regard to the induction of IL-8, but this synergy was not observed in the case of RSV or adenovirus. Bossios et al. 25 described the stimulation of IL-8 release from BEAS-2B cells by the HDM Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus major allergen 1 (Der p 1), HRVs (HRV1b or HRV16), or both in different sequences. In these experiments, both rhinovirus and Der p 1 induced IL-8, IL-6, IL-29, and IP-10, while RANTES was induced only by rhinovirus. Further, synergistic induction was observed only for IL-8, giving similar results to the results presented in this study. In our study Der f1 and three respiratory viruses induced IL-8, while RANTES was not induced by Der f1. Further, viruses with Der f1 were not synergistic with regard to the induction of RANTES. However, a previous study reported that synergy was not observed when cells were initially exposed to Der p 1 and then to HRV. 25 In contrast, our study showed that exposure to an allergen, specifically Der f1, preceding viral infection yielded a significant increase in IL-8 production. Recently a birth cohort study showed that allergic sensitization precedes HRV wheezing and that the reverse is not true. 26 This sequential relationship, whereby allergic sensitization can lead to more severe HRV-induced lower respiratory illnesses is consistent with our findings. Furthermore, this cohort study showed that allergic sensitization led to an increased risk of wheezing illnesses caused by HRV, but not RSV.",

            "text": "In contrast to the present study where Der f1 and RSV did not show synergistic induction, a synergistic effect between Der p 1 and RSV, during the induction of IL-8 by epithelial cells, has been reported. 27 This may reflect differences in the infectious dose of RSV used or in the exposure time of Der f1 allergen. Because our study was mainly focused on the comparison of three different respiratory viruses under the same conditions, the amount of viral infection had to be standardized. Considering dust mite allergen action is short lived, showing its effect during the first few hours of exposure, 28 the exposure time to Der f1 in the present study is thought to be sufficient. As a result, when all conditions are equal, the rhinovirus is the only virus that can act synergistically with Der f1 in the induction of IL-8. Such a characteristic of rhinovirus may represent an important mechanism in virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",
