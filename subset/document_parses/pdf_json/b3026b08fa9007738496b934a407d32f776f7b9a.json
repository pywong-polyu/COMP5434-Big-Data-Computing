A recent meta-analysis of 19 studies, including a total of 11,590 confirmed COVID- 19 patients, showed that current smoking was associated with a twofold increase in the risk of disease progression (7).",

The outbreak was subsequently reclassified as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 . In many countries, including France, lockdown measures were implemented to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, with drastic limitations imposed on travel and social interactions, including for work. The lockdown was introduced in France from March 17 to May 11, coverage of the crisis, and so on. Previous research showed that anxiety and depressive mood are associated with tobacco smoking (11) (12) (13) (14) and alcohol use disorders (15, 16) , as both substances are used to cope with stress or break boredom, for example. Furthermore, it has been shown that economic crises like the 2008 financial recession and unemployment are associated with a deterioration in mental health (17) , an increase in deaths from alcohol abuse (18) , and an increase in binge drinking (19) . Finally, the epidemiological context itself and the perceived risk of infection with a respiratory disease could have motivated some smokers to quit or reduce their consumption, while others may have been encouraged to increase their consumption or relapse after the media reported scientific debates about the potential protective effect of nicotine against COVID-19 infection.",

A national sample of 2,003 respondents aged 18 years and older living in Metropolitan France (i.e. excluding overseas departments) was selected by the private company BVA Institute from a panel of internet users using the quota method for the following variables: sex, age, occupation, region, and size of urban area, reflecting the structure of the population from the 2016 French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) census (23). While the sample was similar to the general population structure according to quota variables, it differed from it in terms of level of education, as 44% of respondents reported being college graduate compared to 30% in the general population. Besides, the proportion of smokers (21.2%) and alcohol drinkers (66.7%) in the study sample was lower than that previously recorded in representative surveys in France (respectively, 28.7% among 18-85 years old in 2019 and 86.5% among 18-75 years old in 2017) (24, 25) .",

Respondents who reported that they currently smoke manufactured cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars, pipes, or waterpipes were classified as smokers. Smokers were then asked about the number of cigarettes smoked per day (for cigarette users) as well as the evolution of their consumption with the question: \"Compared to pre-lockdown, has your smoking consumption changed?\" Three possible responses were possible: \"It has increased / it has remained stable / it has decreased.\" Cigarette smokers who reported an increase were also asked about the number of cigarettes smoked per day before lockdown, which was dichotomized into less than 10 cigarettes per day versus 10 or more cigarettes per day.",

Changes in alcohol consumption were more favorable, with around one in ten drinkers reporting higher consumption and one in five lower consumption, which could be due to the restrictions placed on social interactions. The results of the present study in France differ from previous research conducted in other countries, especially concerning alcohol use, for which more negative changes have been observed elsewhere (21, 22) . Such differences may be due to cultural factors and drinking patterns in different countries, as well as the political measures implemented to manage the epidemic, not to mention the methodological differences in the sampling and recruitment strategy that could lead to various profiles of respondents.",

            "text": "Increased tobacco consumption was associated with higher anxiety levels, age of 18-34 years, and a higher level of education (i.e., college graduates), while decreased tobacco consumption was associated with an intermediate level of education (i.e., high school graduates). Compared to stable consumption, increased alcohol consumption was associated with depressive mood, age of less than 50 years, living in urban areas, and high socio-professional category. Being aged under 50 years and living in urban areas were also associated with a decrease in alcohol consumption, which shows the heterogeneous behaviors within sociodemographic groups. Associations between mental health and smoking and alcohol use are in line with the available knowledge (11, 15, 16) as well as previous research on the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic (22) . However, the present study conducted during the first weeks of the French lockdown suggests a closer relationship between tobacco and anxiety on the one hand, and alcohol use and depression on the other hand. Moreover, the observed increase in tobacco and alcohol use appears to be more frequent among young people, city dwellers, and individuals from a high socio-professional category or with a high level of education. This cannot be fully explained by lower levels of substance use before lockdown, since the increase in tobacco and alcohol use was not related to pre-lockdown consumption levels in the sensitivity analysis. This could partly be due to the inequalities that emerged regarding working conditions: for the \"essential workers\" who mostly belonged to the lower socioeconomic groups and continued to travel to work, the lockdown may have had a more limited impact on their everyday lives (30) . On the contrary, some workers in the more advantaged groups may have benefited from remote working, leading to more dramatic changes in their lifestyle habits, and perhaps more opportunities to smoke and/or drink alcohol at home compared with the workplace. While remaining cautious about this assumption, this could have led to more unfavorable changes in smoking and alcohol behaviors among the most socially advantaged groups, compared with less advantaged ones, excluding those from the most vulnerable populations (e.g., homeless, incarcerated, or illicit drug users) that are usually not included in internet surveys (31, 32) .",
