The global health emergency led to the call for strict shutdown with many measures, like curfews, lockdown, and air travel restrictions, which resulted in disruption of social and economic activities with huge economic losses (Leggett, 2020) . The reduction of anthropogenic activities during the COVID-19 outbreak played a key role in significantly reducing air pollution and improving ambient air quality (He et al., 2020; Isaifan, 2020) in various parts of different countries. He et al. (2020) also found that highly industrialized and colder cities experienced a larger reduction in air pollution levels.",

NO 2 is responsible for catalysing the ozone (O 3 ) and acts as a precursor to inorganic aerosols, with consequences for human health (Atkinson et al., 2018; Faustini et al., 2014; Lelieveld et al., 2015; Myhre et al., 2013) . Various studies have also demonstrated the role of these pollutants in severe health-related problems like respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, and lung cancer in human beings (Agrawal et al., 2006; Humbal et al., 2019; Le Tertre et al., 2002; Koken et al., 2003; Persinger et al., 2002; Arden Pope et al., 2004; Saeha et al., 2020) . Sulphur dioxide is the major precursor for the nucleation formation of particles in the atmosphere, which in turn leads to increased human exposure to ultra-fine particles in high-density population zones (Kulmala et al., 2004) .",

The wind speed also leads to greater dispersion of atmospheric pollutants (Holzworth, 1967; Shair, 1974) ; similarly, temperature also has a direct impact on the ambient air quality (Bashir et al., 2020) . Generally, the excess concentration of greenhouse gasses controls the temperature variation in the lower atmosphere. The accumulation of CO, NO 2 , SO 2 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 in lower atmosphere modifies the intensity of surface air temperature (Global Carbon Project, 2020) . The two particulate pollutants PM 10 and suspended particulate matter (SPM) show a negative correlation with rainfall, humidity, and wind speed during the study period (March-May 2020) which is known to be related to atmospheric washout. Higher concentrations are normally recorded in the winter seasons for both particulate pollutants (Vijay Bhaskar & Mehta, 2010) .",

To prevent the rapid transmission of coronavirus, a countrywide lockdown was enforced in India on 24 March 2020 and continued till 12 May 2020. The lockdown led to a reduction in vehicular traffic and related emission of pollutants. In recent times, several studies have highlighted the impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 on atmospheric pollution over India (Bera et al., 2020; Devara et al., 2020; Mahato et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020; Gautam, 2020) . Unlike other pollutants, SO 2 seems to have increased during the lockdown, and this could be due to no restriction on power plants (Sharma et al., 2020) . There was a reduction of particulate matter in the atmosphere during the lockdown in New Delhi and Kolkata (Mitra et al., 2020; Bera et al., 2020) . The present study is an attempt to assess the status of air pollution during the lockdown in the city of Bangalore using the ground-based observation obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).",

The rapid growth in the industrial, power, and transportation sectors have contributed to the rapid increase in ambient air pollution (AAP) levels in India (Gordon et al., 2018) . Bangalore, the capital city of Karnataka is also witnessing very high levels of air pollution due to increased population and traffic. Bangalore Page 3 of 13 395 (12\u00b00. 40\u2032N, 13\u00b00.15\u2032N, 77.20\u00b0E, 77 .50\u00b0E), shown in Fig. 1 , is located in the southern part of the state of Karnataka, covering an area of 741 km 2 . The estimated population of the city is about 12.34 million which makes Bangalore the 24th most populous city in the world with a population density of about 4000/km 2 . The city is located at an elevation of 900 m above mean sea level and enjoys a moderate climate thorough out the year with temperature ranging from 15 to 36 \u00b0C, and the average annual rainfall of around 1288 mm. There has been an increasing trend in air pollution over the years due to rapid urbanization, traffic, industry, and related economic and developmental activities (CPCB, 2010 (CPCB, , 2014 . Earlier studies revealed that the air quality of the city is within acceptable limits set by CPCB, but there is an increasing trend in NO 2 and SPM over Bangalore (CPCB, 2010). The major sources of air pollution are; road dust re-suspension, open waste burning, vehicular emission, and diesel generators used in industries (Guttikunda et al., 2019) . People often spend more time in traffic and get exposed to air pollution which contributes to increased chronic diseases related to the lungs and heart. Like other parts of the globe, COVID-19 also reached Bangalore, and the first positive case was reported on 8 March 2020, and the number of cases rose to 200 in 2 months (https:// www. mohfw. gov. in). During COVID-19 lockdown imposed by the Government of India and the State Government of Karnataka, roads were deserted with hardly any traffic except for essential and emergency services. All outdoor and commercial activates were closed down.",

The data (daily average) on air pollutant concentration (\u03bcg/ m 3 ) was obtained from the CPCB and KSPCB for the period between March and May (for the years 2019 and 2020). The CPCB established the national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring (AAQM) program in 1984 to monitor ambient air quality (Nasir et al., 2016) . The monitoring of pollutants at CPCB stations is generally carried out daily with 4-hourly sampling for gaseous pollutants and 8-hourly sampling for PM 2.5 . The detailed information like siting criteria, measurement techniques, and QA/QC procedures followed are reported in several earlier works (CPCB, 2003a, b; 2010) . Ambient air pollutant measurements from 10 locations across the city of Bangalore are used in this analysis. These stations are listed in Table 1 as S1, S2, S3, \u2026, S10, and the exact locations are marked in Fig. 1 . Table 1 also describes the location category like commercial, industrial, and railway station. The daily meteorological measurements (temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed) are being collected from the Indian Meteorological Department, Bangalore, and the daily variability is analysed during the lockdown period.",

The daily mean temperature varied between 23.4 and 30 \u00b0C, the range of relative humidity was from 33 to 84%, and the average observed wind speed varied between 0.2 and 1.9 m/s during the period of analysis over the city of Bangalore. It is also observed that during 01 March-23 March, only 3 rainy days were observed, while it was 9 days during the lockdown period (24 March to 12 May). Similarly, the average temperature during the lockdown period (April-May 2020, summer) was 28 \u00b0C as against 27.6 \u00b0C in the pre-lockdown period. The average humidity during both pre-lockdown and lockdown period seems to be the same at around 53%. During the lockdown period, the atmospheric condition was stable with moderate temperature and humidity, low wind speed (0.8-1 m/s), and no intense rainfall. Thus, the prevailing atmospheric conditions over the city do not seem to be conducive for the quick dispersion of pollutants. The daily average concentration of the six major air pollutants; PM 2.5 , NO X , NO 2 , NO, SO 2 , and O 3 over Bangalore for the period 01 March to 12 May 2020 is shown in Fig. 3 . It is inferred from the time series analysis that most of the pollutants show a decreasing (liner) trend during the period of analysis with a maximum for PM 2.5 (\u22120.34 \u00b5g/gm 3 /day); for NO X and O 3 , it is about \u22120.2 \u00b5g/gm 3 /day, and no trend for SO 2 , indicating the clear impact of lockdown on the daily concentration of the above atmospheric pollutants over Bangalore City.",

This shows that there is a reduction in the pollutant concentration in 2020 during the lockdown period when compared to the same day in the previous year. The same analysis was also carried out on a weekly scale to reduce the influence of meteorology on atmospheric pollutants during the lockdown. As can be inferred from Fig. 5 , except for SO 2 , all other pollutants show weekly reduction in the concentration relative to most of the corresponding weeks in 2019. The PM 2.5 was increased only during the 1st and 2nd week during the lockdown as compared to the same weeks in 2019, pointing to the direct impact of lockdown on ambient concentration of atmospheric pollutants in the Bangalore City.",

During the whole phase of lockdown, i.e., 24 March to 12 May, there was a significant reduction in the concentration of NO, NO 2 , NO X , SO 2 , PM 2.5 , and O 3 with 47.3%, 49.0%, 49%, 10%, 37.4%, and 15.6%, respectively. All pollutants show significant reduction during the 1st lockdown except O 3 , which was only about \u22128%. The analysis of hourly ozone data for some locations indicate that the magnitude of O 3 levels is a bit higher during the lockdown period in day times compared to the prelockdown period. This may be because of the summer temperature (Warminski & Bes, 2018) and decreased titration by NO (Sicard et al., 2020) . The decrease in pollution levels may be attributed to the fact that the lockdown was very strictly implemented with no traffic or any other construction or industrial activities. The concentrations started increasing during lockdown Page 10 of 13 2 and lockdown 3 when compared to lockdown 1 due to easing of restriction and subsequent movement of vehicles. Nevertheless, concentrations were still low compared to the pre-lockdown period (Fig. 6) . Overall, the lockdown brought a reduction in the ambient air pollutants in the city during March-May 2020; this is in contrast with higher level pollution observed during the summer season. The same analysis was also carried out at each station to assess the region-wise impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the ambient concentration of air pollutants and the results are presented in Fig. 7 . It is observed that the concentration of NO, NO 2 , and NO X is very low at most stations during all phases of lockdown, but slightly increased in the station S5 and S8, which are located in the commercial area. Available PM 2.5 data over 8 stations show relatively low values, indicating the reduction of pollutants during most phases of lockdown. But SO 2 was reduced only in 4 stations (S1, S3, S4, and S7), and the concentration is high in the other 6 stations; this may be attributed to domestic cooking and vehicle movements of essential services as mentioned earlier. Similarly, the trend of O 3 concentration also decreased in all stations except for station S10 which is located in the industrial area. The average trend in all industrial stations (S4, S7, S9, and S10) shows greater reduction in the pollution concentrations than the commercial stations (S1, S2, S5, S6, and S8), indicating the role of lockdown in reducing the ambient concentration of air pollutants and improved air quality over the Bangalore City.",

The main objective was to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown on ambient air quality (AAQ) at a city scale. The impact of lockdown is shown to be remarkable in improving the air quality with a significant reduction in the ambient concentration of air pollutants: NO (\u221263%), NO 2 (\u221248%), NO X (\u221248%), and O 3 (\u221223%) during the lockdown period when compared to the same period in 2019. The spatial analysis also witnessed significant improvement in the air quality throughout the city during the lockdown. In Bangalore, to a large extent, the decline in road traffic resulted in a significant decrease (48-63%) in the levels nitrogen oxides (NO 2 , NO X , and NO). Also, the comparison of concentrations during the lockdown and pre-lockdown period shows that the lockdown period (2020) witnessed a significant reduction by 47.3% (NO), 49% (NO 2 ), 49% (NO X ), 10% (SO 2 ), 37.7% (PM 2.5 ), and 15.6% (O 3 ) over Bangalore. These sharp reductions during April and May 2020 can be attributed to a reduction in industrial and traffic activities. The stationlevel analysis supported the widespread reduction of pollutants across the city. In a nutshell, the COVID-19 lockdown resulted in improved air quality over Bangalore City. This type of observational studies can be integrated with model predictions to assess the impact of intervention strategies and help environmental monitoring and regulating agencies to achieve their objective of air quality compliance.",
