To solve the above problems, based on complex network theory, the paper uses the identified hazards and the relationship between hazards to construct the propagation network of tailings dam failure risk (PNTDFR). The traditional analysis methods of network centrality usually focus on one aspect of the information of the network, while it cannot take into account to absorb the advantages of different methods, resulting in the difference between identified key nodes and real key hazards. To find the key hazards of tailing dam failure, based on the characteristics of multi-stage propagation of failure risk, the paper proposes a multi-stage collaborative hazard remediation method (MCHRM) to determine the importance of hazard nodes by absorbing the advantages of different centrality methods under different hazard remediation (deletion) ratios. The paper applies the above methods to Feij\u00e3o Dam I. It can be found that when the priority remediation range is increased to 45%, the key hazards obtained by the MCHRM will cover all the causes of accidents proposed by the Dam I failure investigation expert group. Besides, the paper compares the monitoring data, daily inspection results and safety evaluation information of key hazards with the 'Grading standards of hazard indicators', and obtains the formation process of the Dam I failure and 30 key hazards in trigger state.",

If the tailings can not be managed effectively, the tailings may leak under the tailings dam failure, which will pose a serious threat to the surrounding environment and communities. On January 25, 2019, the Feij\u00e3o Dam I in Brazil suddenly broke. More than 200 people died or were missing in the tailings dam accident. The Dam I has a complete management system and monitoring system, using ground-based radar, satellite (InSAR), high-definition video and drones and other advanced monitoring equipment, but before the accident, it was not found that the tailings dam had significant abnormal signals that may cause a failure 1,2 . This shows that even in tailings dams with a very high level of safety management, there are still some key accident hazards that have not been discovered or effectively monitored. Therefore, the use of effective methods to timely and accurately to identify the key hazards in the tailings dam system, and to control the various hazards that induce accidents in the bud or latent state, is of great significance for preventing accidents and reducing the risks of tailings dam failure.",

There are dozens of commonly used methods for identifying hazards, such as failure type and impact analysis, pre-hazard analysis, checklist method, hazard and operability research, fault tree analysis, event tree analysis 3 . In response to the differences in research systems, scholars have proposed a series of new hazard identification methods that are more suitable for the research system based on these conventional hazard identification methods. According to the results of accident analysis and interviews, Nascimento F et al. applied grounded theory and template analysis to compile a list of hazards affecting pilots' night flight capabilities 4 .

Li Zhaodong et al. established a checklist of factors affecting the tailings dam accidents, and assigned points to it 3 . Pier-Luc Labont\u00e9-Raymond et al. have studied the impact of climate change on the drainage system of tailings ponds 8 . MG Lemos et al. identified the chemical, mineralogical and metallurgical properties of gold tailings located in the Santa Barbara mine 9 . Baker K E et al. applied process safety management tools to the tailings storage and transportation system, and visually characterized the possible hazards and control measures to prevent accidents 10 . The safety management of tailings dam is a whole-process management, and the hazards are coupled and influenced by each other during the whole life cycle. Therefore, the above methods are difficult to complete and systematically identify the hazards of tailings dams. In order to overcome these problems, facing the life cycle of tailings ponds and combining the four influencing factors of natural factors, design factors, construction factors and management factors, Zhao Yiqing et al. proposed the process-causing grid method to identify hazards of tailings ponds. Although the process-causing grid method can identify the hazards of tailings dams relatively completely and systematically, it relies more on the subjective judgment of researchers, and the supporting evidence for the identification of hazards is not clear 11 .",

In order to identify the key nodes in a complex network, Yu E Y et al. generated a feature matrix for each node in the network, and used a convolutional neural network to train and predict the influence of the node 20 . Hou B et al. used the all-around distance method to find influential nodes in complex networks 21 . AXZ et al. used the information transfer probability between any pair of nodes and the k-medoid clustering algorithm to identify influential nodes in complex networks with community structure 22 . Freeman LC etc. defined centrality in terms of the degree to which a point falls on the shortest path between others 23 . In order to rank the spreaders, an average shortest path centrality is proposed 24 . Qin Xuan et al. applied the centrality analysis of the complex network to the study on the important hazards of tailings pond accidents 25 .

Because the China Tailings Pond Safety Grade Classification Standard divides the tailings ponds into four levels: normal, mild, moderate, and dangerous, the paper also divides the grading standards of the key hazard indicators of tailings dams into four levels combining the Technical Regulations for Safety of Tailings Pond and the Code for Design of Tailings Facilities. Level 1 is a normal state, level 2 is a mild danger, level 3 is a moderate danger, and level 4 is a serious danger. In the classification of grading standards, the indicators that can obtain specific values are classified using quantitative analysis methods. For example, the evaluation indicator of hazard 5 (Heavy rainfall) is rainfall, which is calculated in the depth of the water layer per unit area within 24 h. Hazards that are difficult to quantitatively classify are qualitatively used. For example, hazard 355 (Insufficient experience in personnel or organization qualification problems) are divided into four levels based on the personnel's education, working hours, and qualification levels of the institution. According to the above method, the paper has formulated the grading standards of some hazard indicators, as shown in \"Appendix B\".",

The hazards with greater betweenness centrality bear more risk propagation tasks, while the closeness centrality of hazards reflects its connection with other hazards.

The MCHRM not only utilizes the advantages of the three indicators, but also combines the characteristics of multi-stage propagation of dam-break risk, which better reflects the importance of hazards of dam-break.

At the same time, due to the complex causes of dam failure accidents and the difficulty of quantification, it is difficult to accurately give the weight of the relationship between hazards. In order to solve the above problems, this paper sets a certain reserve range when determining the range of key nodes in the PNTDFR, Figure 7 .

The specific reserve range can be adjusted to a certain extent according to the difference of the research objects. Key hazards are the main causes of dam failure, but for a specific accident, not all key hazards have played an important role. Therefore, if you want to reproduce the process of the accident, you must determine the status of these key hazards in the risk evolution of the accident. The network constituted by key hazards in the trigger state and the relationship between hazards intuitively represents the whole process of the accident.",

Although the reserve range of priority remediation can cover all key hazards of dam failure, it is difficult to give an accurate reserve ratio, and the actual application needs to combine the experience of some technical personnel. b. In the formulation of hazard grading standards, due to the numerous influencing factors of hazards and the difficulty of quantifying some of the influencing factors, the grading standards of some hazards adopt a subjective qualitative classification method, which affects the accuracy of some grading indicators. c. The hazards and the relationships between hazards in this paper are all based on evidence (accident cases, laws and regulations, documents and media, etc.), but the reliability of different evidences is different, which will affect the accuracy of the research. To better solve the above problems and improve the practicability of above methods, the author of this paper plans to study more accident cases in the next step, so as to determine a more specific reserve range of priority remediation and build a hazard information database of tailings dams, which are suitable for the whole industry.
