Whenever an emergency occurs, such as the occurrence of COVID-19, it is easy for rumors about COVID-19 to appear and to swirl due to asymmetric information, fuzzy facts, and subjective conjectures (1) , which have numerous negative effects. With the rapid development of mobile networks and various social applications, the speed and breadth of information dissemination have changed qualitatively. This has demanded new requirements for relevant organizations to effectively guide the public opinion about COVID-19 and to reduce the harm of rumors about COVID- 19 .",

            "text": "The research on the propagation model of rumors started in the 1970s. Daley and Kendall (2) proposed a Daley-Kendall (DK) model that combines rumor diffusion with virus infection and divides the individuals into three groups: people who have not heard of the rumor, people who actively spread it, and people who help stop the rumor. As the follow-up research continued, Maki and Thompson (3) , based on the DK model, assumed that when a rumor spreader contacts with another spreader, only the former spreader can be transformed into an immunizer. With the development of modern technology, scholars have started to consider the complexity of large-scale social networks. For the first time, Zanette and Dami\u00e1n (4) put a model of rumor propagation in a small-world network environment and obtained its threshold. Subsequently, Moreno et al. (5) replaced the environment of rumor propagation with a scale-free network, described the propagation process with an average field equation, and verified it with a random analysis and computer simulation. Pan et al. (6) studied the propagation simulation of rumors on a scale-free network with a power law distribution and variable clustering coefficients and found that increasing the variable clustering coefficient can effectively prevent the diffusion of rumors and increase the information transparency which helps to dispel rumors.",

            "text": "Nekovee et al. (7) combined the phenomenon that some people stop spreading on account of forgetting rumors in real life, integrated the forgetting mechanism into the classic SIR rumor model, and analyzed its threshold. On this basis, Zhao et al. (8) improved and carried out simulation experiments with LiveJournal data. It was found that the network average degree, forgetting parameters and immune parameters, had significant effects on the rumor diffusion. Later Zhao et al. (9) added the hibernator role with the forgetting and memory mechanism and proposed a new Susceptible-Infected-Hibernator-Removed (SIHR) model. Wang (10) introduced a trust mechanism and concluded that trust factors can effectively reduce the size of the final rumor diffusion and delay the process, but it will increase the threshold of propagation in the network. Wang et al. (11) divided the people into four categories based on the forgetting mechanism, and proposed SIRaRu. The Ra is used to indicate those who have heard rumors but have no interest in spreading them. The Ru stands for those people who are completely immune to rumors. It has a significant impact that the forgetting parameter can determine the final propagation threshold. Wang et al. (12) proposed a Credulous-Spreader-Rationals (CSR) model based on the increasing convenience of social networks, which divided the nodes in the group into three categories: credulous, spreader, and rational. Huo and Huang (13) applied the idea of system dynamics to integrate the influence of popular science propaganda and media reports on the diffusion of false information, and proposed an optimal control strategy. Wang et al. (14) extended the forgetting mechanism, set the forgetting rate which could be changed over time, and proved that a larger initial forgetting rate or forgetting speed can reduce the size of the final rumor. Zhang et al. (15) constructed a net rumor diffusing model with a social strengthening mechanism and attenuation characteristics and proved that intervention in public interest can effectively curb rumor diffusion. Liu et al. (16) studied the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model on a scale-free network and compared the effectiveness of the two strategies of group immunity and target immunity. Li and Ma (17) constructed a two-tier social network, which is online and offline, to describe the diffusion of public opinion. Seoyong and Sunhee (18) analyzed rumor data collected from the social survey about Fukushima nuclear accident. They think the best way to neutralize rumors is by reducing the perceived risk and negative information, and enlarging the source credibility, perceived benefit, trust, and knowledge. Zhu and Ma (19) proposed a Susceptible-Hesitated-Infected-Removed (SHIR) model with hesitant roles on heterogeneous random networks based on the individual dynamic relationship changes and subjective judgments, and people who expressed individual choices through the weight of edges. Zan (20) proposed a Double-Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (DSIR) (Double Rumor) model, where two rumors compete with one another. The selection parameters are used to represent the attractiveness of each rumor, while the time delay parameter is used to represent the time difference between each other. Amaral and Arenzon (21) proposed a propagation model with skeptical characters and simulated the symbiosis of survivor zombies to characterize the equilibrium status of each character during the diffusion of rumors. Zhu and Wang (22) established a rumor propagation model with uncertainty based on the spatiotemporal diffusion framework. Experiments proved the uncertainty of network topology and human behavior when it reaches to the threshold and determines the density of infected connections. With the improvement of specific capabilities of society, rumors diffuse to a stable state at a faster rate. Ankur et al. (23) found that the different interests of each person are uncertain and volatile about rumor propagation. Therefore, a deterministic model and a random model were established on a homogeneous network, and a deterministic equation was introduced on the random uniform network to discuss if the noise could extend the diffusion of rumors. Liu and He (24) proposed a non-linear dynamic propagation model for information competition from the viewpoint of public opinion control. The Markov chain theory was used to analyze the node state transition matrix in the perspective of competition and verified the feasibility of competing information dissemination with the empirical analysis of hot events, which was used for comparison. Zhang et al. (25) added a communicator who will diffuse real information, combined with the effect of forgetting mechanism on propagation, and used the regeneration matrix to obtain the threshold for simulation experiments. Guo et al. (26) designed a multi-feature diffusion model (MF-model), formulated a multi-feature rumor blocking (MFRB) problem on a multi-layer network structure, and proposed a Revised-IMM algorithm, considering the spread of rumor is determined by multiple features. Leonid (27) modified the spreader which is divided into the low rate of active spreaders and the high rate of active spreaders, and got its stability under stochastic perturbation with the method of linear matrix inequalities. Guo et al. (28) proposed an overall evaluation on benefits of influence (OEBI) problem, based on the phenomenon that a user is influenced by both our own information and the information of our rival. They proved the objective function of the OEBI problem is not monotone, not submodular, and not super modular.",

Take the information \"Wuhan lockdown\", for example, that once diffused online.

A study shows that, in the context of the increasingly sound development of new media functions, the elderly population is enjoying short videos spread through WeChat and Microblog, and the authenticity of which cannot be verified. These contents were often identified as rumors (12) . Among those people who heard this news, some people were reflecting on the news or were waiting for the news from the official website which could be in a silent state of not spreading. After a period of silence, some silencers became immune to this rumor because of rational thinking or other reasons. Some silencers might return to the state of \"diffusing rumors\". The rumor will continue to mutate under the turmoil. Previous studies have often ignored the role of \"silent people\" and focused on the own propagation of the communicator. Also, the rumor variation in the process and the influence of variation instability factors on the entire communication chain were neglected, as circled in Figure 1 .",

Due to the character of the individual, the spreader appeared before the variation and the oyster. When the rumors about COVID-19 begins to diffuse, the spreader comes to the stage in large numbers. During the individual-to-individual interaction, the information about COVID-19 rumors that carried starts to change, which led to the emergence and swift increase of the variation. When the spreader reaches the threshold, its number goes into a declining period, and people who propagate the rumor in the network will be composed of the spreader and the variation.

For the same reason, the increasement of the silent probability of the spreaders also works to refute the rumors about COVID-19. Compared with Figures 5-7 , it can be illustrated that if the variation's silent and immune probabilities both changed, the adjustment of the silent probability can control the diffusion of rumors about COVID-19 with a better result. As far as it is concerned from the conclusion when rumors about COVID-19 occur, people with a higher level of elaborative faculty will be more cautious about facing the unknown public opinion.

As shown in Figure 11A , when the infected probability increases, the density of the variation has undergone a rapid increase to the threshold, and then decreased. And, when the infected probability is higher, the density of the variation increases faster, and the peak value that is reached is also larger. It can also be concluded from the changing curve in the figure that the initial rumors about COVID-19, with great infectivity, can quickly affect the surrounding people when diffusing in the group, making more and more groups infected with rumors about COVID-19, which leads to a rapid increase of the variation. But, in the middle and late stages of the COVID-19 rumor propagation, the growth of the infected probability from the figure will cause the amount of the variation to fall faster after reaching the threshold, and it cannot keep the variation in a state of a large quantity. Therefore, it can be concluded that if there are more information communicators in the social group, diffusing the information versions and contents tend to be more consistent, which proves that the more sufficient each individual information is, the faster the quantity of people who spread rumors about COVID-19 drops, the less rumors about COVID-19 are likely to diffuse.",

When the infected probability is higher, the oyster density goes up faster, and the threshold reached is also larger. Combining Figures  11A,B , the rise of infected probability will lead to more variation and more oyster. In the middle and late stages of the COVID-19 rumor diffusion, as the quantity of all diffusers increased, the COVID-19 rumor content or version begins to stabilize, and the quantity of variation grows slowly or even decreases, but the number of the oyster did not increase accordingly. With the changes in the scale-free network of density of the recovery in Figure 11C , the reduced variation does not become the oyster, and, on the contrary, turn to the state of the recovery. It can be concluded that when the infected probability increases, the thresholds of the variation and the oyster will increase, but with its large quantity, it is difficult to maintain stability. Everyone will have multiple versions of the content at first, but when there is more information about COVID-19 communicators in the social group, the version or content will quickly tend to be unanimous.

The increase of the immune and silence probability of the variation can effectively improve and reduce the density of diffusion of the propagation of truth in the group. A higher infected probability will bring more people who diffuse the rumors about COVID-19, but it will not always maintain a large quantity of the variation. The more information disseminators in the society, the more easily the version and content of the disseminated information tend to be consistent. It can prove that with more adequate information among individuals, the amount of people who diffuse the rumors about COVID-19 drops more quickly, and the chance of diffusing rumors about COVID-19 could be smaller.",

Secondly, the oysters, which are silent and often possesses good skepticism ability, thus, availably guide the people who are captivated by the rumors about COVID-19, which will play a positive role in shaping the public opinion about COVID-19. Thirdly, compared with non-response, timely and effective interpretation can improve the ability of the group to distinguish rumors about COVID-19. In the meantime, it provides a new model for the related departments to solve the phenomenon of increasingly widespread internet COVID-19 rumors, which has certain practical guiding significance. This study about the individual's own situation is not detailed enough. The next stage will study the interaction between individuals at the micro level in the context of the spread of epidemic rumors. In the future, the research results can be applied into various fields including personalized recommendation (33) (34) (35) , anomaly detection (36, 37) , sustainable tourism (38, 39) , personal health (40) , and so on.",
