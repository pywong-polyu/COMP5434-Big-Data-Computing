            "text": "Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), efforts have been made to map the genetic diversity of the virus and to identify variants with a selective advantage. 1 The variations of interest include changes in immune targets, such as the spike glycoprotein; changes in primerbinding and probe-binding sites, which can reduce the sensitivity of diagnostic tests; and genetic variations that might affect transmissibility and virulence. [2] [3] [4] A SARS-CoV-2 variant with a 382-nucleotide deletion (\u0394382) was detected in a cluster of cases in Singapore that occurred in January and February, 2020. 5 The deletion truncates open reading frame (ORF) 7b and removes the ORF8 transcription-regu latory sequence, eliminating ORF8 transcription. This variant was successfully transmitted early during the epidemic, but was not detected after March, 2020. An identical \u0394382 variant was also detected in February, 2020, in a traveller who returned from Wuhan, China, to Taiwan, and other SARS-CoV-2 isolates with different deletions in ORF8 have been reported from cases in Bangladesh (345 nucleotides), Australia (138 nucleotides) and Spain (62 nucleotides). 5, 6 In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus responsible for the 2002-03 SARS epidemic, a characteristic 29-nucleotide deletion (\u039429) in ORF8 occurred soon after its zoonotic transmission from civets to humans in 2002, and larger deletions of 82 nucleotides and 415 nucleotides in the same genomic region were also reported. 7 The effects of these deletions on the course of the SARS epidemic is unknown. However, in-vitro studies have indicated that the \u039429 variant of SARS-CoV replicates less efficiently than the wild-type virus, and consequently this variant has been hypothesised to result in a milder clinical illness than that caused by the wild-type virus. 8, 9 The biological function of the ORF8 protein in SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. A recent study suggested that ORF8 mediates immune evasion by downregulating MHC-I molecules. 10 A previously reported interactome analysis that used affinity-purification mass spectrometry also identified 47 human proteins-mainly associated with glycoprotein metabolism-that interact with ORF8, of which 15 are known drug targets. 11 In-vitro evidence has suggested that the deletion does not affect viral replicative fitness, and an analysis of subgenomic RNA has shown that transcription of the ORF6 and N genes, known SARS-CoV interferon antagonists, is altered in \u0394382 variants as compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. 5, 6 In this study, we compared the clinical outcomes and immune responses of patients infected with wild-type and \u0394382 SARS-CoV-2.",

The \u2206382 variant causes clinically significant illness, including pneumonia, but infections tended to be milder compared with those caused by the wild-type virus, with less pronounced cytokine release during the acute phase of infection. The observed attenuated clinical features further suggest that ORF8 is a possible target for therapeutic intervention and for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 controlled human infection model. We observed that patients infected with the \u2206382 variant had lower concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that are strongly associated with severe COVID-19. 15, 16 Notably, patients with pneumonia from the \u2206382 variant had higher concentrations of SDF-1\u03b1, which is usually downregulated during hypoxia. 17 These findings corroborated our clinical observations that patients infected with the \u2206382 variant had better clinical outcomes, as shown by the lower proportion of patients in the \u2206382 variant group who had hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen. The in-vitro replication kinetics of the \u2206382 variant are similar to those of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the viral loads observed in these patients, indicating that the ORF8 deletion does not reduce replicative fitness. This finding is contrary to the reduced replication observed in SARS-CoV viruses with an ORF8 deletion. 9 Further analysis of immune mediator profiles in patients with mild symptoms revealed that patients infected with \u2206382 variants had more effective T-cell responses and platelet regulation during the early phase of the infection. T-cell responses are severely impaired in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18 Lymphopenia 19 and functional exhaustion of T cells 20 correlate with disease severity in COVID-19. The more robust production of IFN-\u03b3 during the early phase of the infection, which was observed in patients infected with the \u2206382 variant, could promote and maintain the effector functions of T cells, which might mediate rapid and effective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2. 21, 22 SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 targets host proteins in endoplasmic reticulum quality control, extracellular matrix organisation, and glycosaminoglycan synthesis. 11 Our STRING analysis showed that host proteins in endoplasmic reticulum trafficking are interacting partners pivotal to multiple pathways in T-cell-mediated immunity and platelet regulation. This finding is consistent with an interaction between the viral protein encoded by ORF8 and host MHC-I leading to downregulation of cytotoxic CD8 T-lymphocyte-mediated antiviral activity. 10 Given the important roles of ORF8 in mediating SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion, inhibition of its function could be investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy.",

            "text": "The repeated emergence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with a deletion in ORF8 suggests this region is important for viral adaptation to humans. Studies have reported that ORF8 is strongly immunogenic, and that antibodies are produced against ORF8 early during SARS-CoV-2 infection. 23 Significant CD4-positive and CD8-positive T-cell responses to ORF8 have also been described in patients who recover from COVID-19. 24 Our analysis of serial respiratory samples from patients with wild-type and \u2206382 variant co-infection suggested that the \u2206382 variant out-competed the wild-type virus. The disappearance of \u2206382 variants in Singapore, Taiwan, and presumably China could be attributed to infection control measures. However, \u2206382 variants might also be less effective at establishing infection in a new host because of the loss of the immune evasion functions of ORF8. Importantly, genomic data indicate that the \u2206382 variants are not related to the D614G clade, which might or might not exhibit altered virus transmissibility, 4 but belong to early outbreak sequences for which no significant difference in trans missibility is observed. 25 Our study has a number of limitations. First, respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 PCR were collected as part of routine clinical care. We did not have samples from early in the course of the illness for many patients, and some patients' samples were not available. Second, although every effort was made to corroborate epidemiological data, the data are subject to recall bias and linkages might have been missed or incorrectly inferred. Third, we adjusted for known major determinants of severe COVID-19 in the multivariable model, but there might have been unmeasured confounders that could explain some of the differences in clinical outcomes. The presence of transmission clusters can also amplify bias, and it is possible that recruited patients were not representative of their infection groups. Fourth, some mixed wild-type and \u2206382 variant infections are suspected from epide miological linkage but were undetected by PCR. This could reflect limitations of this assay for detecting mixed infection, or virological sampling only later in the course of infection. Finally, blood samples were collected as early as possible in the course of the illness, but inevitably they were not available on the same day post-infection or symptom onset.",
