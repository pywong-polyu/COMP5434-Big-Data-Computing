Prior to the development of specific drug therapies or a vaccine, more immediately available treatments were sought including convalescent plasma. A potential improvement from convalescent plasma could be the preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG).",

A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases. Results: Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product. Normalized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activity (per mg/ml IgG) was maintained throughout the process. Protein content in these final product batches was 100% IgG, consisting of 98% monomer and dimer forms. Potentially hazardous proteins (IgM, IgA, and anti-A, anti-B, and anti-D) were reduced to minimal levels. Conclusions: Multiple batches of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG that met regulatory requirements were manufactured from human convalescent plasma. The first clinical study in which the hIVIG will be evaluated will be Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin (ITAC) [NCT04546581].",

Convalescent plasma was quickly identified and investigated as a potential treatment for COVID-19. 3 Convalescent plasma has a long history of treatment of infectious diseases extending from the Spanish flu pandemic 4 to more recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 5 and Middle East respiratory syndrome. 6 There are, however, some disadvantages of convalescent plasma, including that the nature, titer, and neutralizing power of the antibodies therein can vary greatly from one donor to another. 7 Many of these disadvantages can be overcome through the purification and concentration of the specific antibodies into drug preparations. Human immunoglobulin products made from pooled plasma of convalescent or vaccinated donors have been used for many years in the treatment of various infections. Here, we report on collection of convalescent plasma and manufacture anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG) for use in clinical studies.",

Symptomatic donors must have complete resolution of symptoms at least 14 days before donation if they were negative by follow-up NAT or 28 days if they had no follow-up test. Similarly, asymptomatic donors (positive by NAT or antigen tests) must wait 14 days after the initial test if they had a follow-up negative NAT but must wait 28 days after the initial test if they had no follow-up test. Asymptomatic donors tested only by a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test were required to wait 7 days prior to donation but could donate immediately if they had a negative NAT. Donors may be male or female, but females who have been pregnant must test negative for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II antibodies. 10 All donations were tested by NAT (Procleix SARS-CoV-2 Assay; Grifols Diagnostic Systems, Emeryville, CA) to confirm absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and by serology to confirm a suitable level of anti-SARS-COV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay; Abbott Ireland, Diagnostics Division, Finisklin Business Park, Sligo, Ireland, or Recombivirus Human Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Virus Spike 1 IgG ELISA Kit; Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX).
