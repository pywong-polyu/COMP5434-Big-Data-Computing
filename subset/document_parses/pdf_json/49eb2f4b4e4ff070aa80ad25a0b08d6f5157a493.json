Benefits and risks of systemic treatments remain unclear, with multiple clinical trials still ongoing. Radiotherapy could play a role in reducing the inflammatory response in the lungs and relieve life-threatening symptoms. Methods We designed a prospective study of Ultra-Low Doses of Therapy with Radiation Applied to COVID-19 (ULTRA-COVID) for patients who suffer pneumonia, are not candidates for invasive mechanical ventilation and show no improvement with medical therapy. Results We present the preliminary results of two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with ULTRA-COVID. After one radiotherapy session, significant clinical response and a good radiological response was observed in both cases, resulting in both patients being discharged from hospital in less than 2 weeks after radiation treatment. Conclusion Preliminary clinical and radiological results suggest a potential benefit of treating COVID-19 pneumonia with ULTRA-COVID. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394182",

It showed 80-85% rates of inflammatory relief success and an overall mortality reduction from 30% to 10% [6] . The established role of radiotherapy in nonmalignant inflammatory conditions [7] due to its antiinflammatory properties such as decreasing levels of proinflammatory cells including cytokines and macrophages (polarizing them toward an anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype) has been practically explored in our study [8] [9] [10] .",
