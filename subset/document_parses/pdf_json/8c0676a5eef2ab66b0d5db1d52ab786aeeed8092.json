According to the Household Pulse Survey, 30% of American adults showed symptoms of anxiety and 24% reported depressive symptoms, 8 a sharp increase from the National Health Interview Survey results (9.2% for anxiety and 6.6% for depression) collected from January to June 2019 prior to the onset of the pandemic. Restrictions and resulting social isolation due to the coronavirus disease have not affected individuals equally, however.

Specifically, we investigate whether the association between coronavirusinduced restrictions and feelings of distress is more pronounced among individuals in an objectively and/or a subjectively vulnerable condition: people with preexisting health conditions and/or those who feel insecure about their job prospects, respectively. We first conjecture that preexisting symptoms (objective vulnerability) and job insecurity (subjective vulnerability) are related to mental distress independently of coronavirus-related restrictions or social isolation. We further hypothesize that the negative effects of imposed restrictions would be greater for the two vulnerable groups. Additionally, we check whether the impact varies temporally. Based on multilevel modeling (individuals nested in region-wave units), we find significance evidence in support of our hypotheses, as well as limited support for the increasing trend effect. The present study is the first to empirically demonstrate the contingent impact of COVID-19 on mental health over time and across two distinct moderators operationalized in terms of objective (physical) and subjective (financial) vulnerability.

Corona Impact Survey is designed to provide estimates of the US adult household population nationwide and for 18 regional areas including 10 states (California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New York, Oregon and Texas) and 8 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (Atlanta, Baltimore, Birmingham, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Phoenix and Pittsburgh).

We combine subsamples from the regions across W1 (N = 7467) and W2 (N = 7420). After listwise deletion of cases with missing data, the effective sample size (for the fully specified pooled model) is 12 825 observations nested in 36 (18 \u00d7 2) region-wave units.

We thus proceed in Model 2 by including 'COVID restrictions', which is positively significant (b = 0.035; P < 0.001), showing that one-unit increase (an additional restriction) raises the distress level (in terms of factor score) by 0.035. In Model 3, the two moderators are added. Objective vulnerability ('Preexisting conditions') is positively related to mental distress (b = 0.122; P < 0.001), as is subjective vulnerability or 'Job insecurity' (b = 0.023; P < 0.05). The effect of social isolation as gauged by restricted mobility on the outcome measure remains robust (b = 0.038; P < 0.001), even after including these two additional predictors. For a more conservative test, we introduce the set of socioeconomic and demographic controls in Model 4. Except for the education dummies and employment status, they are all statistically significant. On the one hand, age, family size and household income are negatively related to psychological distress; on the other, being female and white and living in an urban area are positively related to it. Inclusion of these confounders does not reduce the significance levels of the associations found in Model 3 with respect to 'COVID restrictions', 'Preexisting conditions' and 'Job insecurity'. Having examined these relationships, we now turn to this study's primary focus: the moderation effects involving these three variables. According to Model 5, we find that the interaction between 'COVID restrictions' and 'Preexisting conditions' is positive and significant (b = 0.009; P < 0.001), i.e., the impact of social isolation on distress is greater for the physically vulnerable in support of H1. Model 6 shows a similar result concerning the interaction between 'COVID restrictions' and 'Job insecurity' (b = 0.005; P < 0.05). The impact is also greater for those who feel financially insecure, which supports H2.",

            "text": "In Table 3 , as a robustness check, we incorporate the level-2 covariates. Model 1 shows that the parameter estimates for 'Infected cases' and W2 are both significant but in opposite directions. First, the total number of infections covary positively with the average level of 'Mental distress' across 36 region-wave units (b = 0.033; P < 0.01). Figure 1 graphically illustrates this relationship. The state of New York during W1 (NY_w1), for example, has the highest score on the distress index. At the other end of the spectrum is the state of Montana during W1 (MT_w1) with the lowest score, both in terms of the number of infections and the average distress level. Second, there is a difference in the average mental distress across the two waves of data. Specifically, it is lower for W2, as indicated by the negative sign of the coefficient (b = \u22120.739; P < 0.05). Although holding constant these additional level-2 controls, we re-estimate the two interaction terms discussed above. Results for the moderating roles of 'Preexisting conditions' (b = 0.009; P < 0.001) and 'Job insecurity' (b = 0.005; P < 0.05), as shown in Models 3 and 4, respectively, are consistently robust, lending further support for our hypotheses. The random slope coefficient for 'COVID restrictions' in Model 4 (b = 0.027; P < 0.001) also confirms that the impact is not constant but varies across region-wave units. To answer our RQ, we turn to the main finding in Model 5, where the cross-level interaction term ('COVID restrictions' \u00d7 W2) is positive and significant, albeit marginally (b = 0.012; P < 0.1). We thus conclude that there is limited evidence for an increased negative effect of social isolation over time (see Fig. 2 ).",

Specifically, the more severely individuals experienced movement restrictions in their everyday lives, the higher their reported levels of mental distress. Far from abating, there is some evidence that this impact may be worsening over time. Moreover, the findings clearly demonstrate that this toll has not been shared equally across all people. Rather, more vulnerable individuals, particularly those with preexisting health conditions and those perceiving greater employment precarity, suffered a disproportionately greater impact of 'COVID restrictions' on their mental health.",

'Social isolation', a significant byproduct of movement restrictions, has not been borne equally among individuals. With respect to previous pandemics, this has particularly been the case with respect to black and minority ethnic communities, 19 and we are witnessing a similar phenomenon with respect to COVID-19 when it comes to the physically and/or financially vulnerable. 9 Indeed, contrary to initial expectations, COVID-19 is not a social equalizer but an egregious magnifier of social inequality. [20] [21] What this study adds Evidence generally suggests that less privileged segments of the population are more prone to infection and mortality. However, as of now, 'little is known about the consequences of social distancing (p.1)'. 22 Based on multilevel analysis, this study provides original insights into the conditional association between lockdown experience and mental distress in the USA Unlike most prior research, it uses two waves of probability data to offer a more dynamic analysis. A central finding is that the effects of COVID-induced restrictions are not fixed but variable. Ceteris paribus, the physically weak and the economically precarious are shown to be especially at risk. In addition, our study makes clear that people's mental wellbeing appears to respond to the trajectory of the virus' impact across their regional context over time. Where the reported impact has been stronger in a region (as measured by number of cases), residents' average distress level is correspondingly higher. The severity of the virus' impact in one's wider social environment, and the anxiety that likely induces, is a key channel through which the pandemic has harmed individual wellbeing. In other words, aside from individual-level factors, geography matters.",

Specifically, using a large representative US sample, we demonstrate that the 'preexisting inequalities' in health status and job stability moderate, i.e., amplify, the deleterious psychological consequences of the coronavirus-induced movement restrictions.
