For each patient, a preoperative SarsCov2 test was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasal and oropharyngeal swabs. For patients with typical symptoms of COVID-19 disease such as fever, cough and dyspnea, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan and infective evaluation was obtained. For these patients a hospital stay in a dedicated COVID-19 ward was predisposed. Finally, surgical activity was compared between COVID 19 pandemic and the same period of time (from March 1st to June 1st) in 2019 at our institution to evaluate the COVID-19 pandemic impact of on the spinal surgery activities.
