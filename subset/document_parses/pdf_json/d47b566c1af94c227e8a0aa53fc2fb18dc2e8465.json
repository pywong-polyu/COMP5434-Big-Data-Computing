Next, we connected the volunteer and the HCW, and they worked out the logistics. Our initial goal was to provide 1:1 longitudinal pairing to minimize the number of household contacts. While this system was effective in creating matches, it required contacting volunteers individually, a labor-intensive process. Due to the urgent nature of the requests (many HCWs needed support within 48 hours), we developed a secondary request form to optimize our system (see Supplemental Digital Appendix 1B at http://links.lww.com/ACADMED/ B88). We de-identified these requests and displayed them on a cloud-based sign-up sheet. This allowed volunteers to sign-up for a shift that fit their schedule at a household they could easily travel to and eliminated the need for us to contact individual volunteers directly.",

Therefore, we created a Venmo account for donations to support volunteers who were providing childcare while experiencing financial hardship. While we were initially concerned that this donation system would not be robust enough, many volunteers reported that HCWs were tipping them, despite being offered the service for free. In addition, as of May 15, 2020, our general fund had received a total of $3,980, and every volunteer who expressed a need received a donation.",

Timely, clear communication was key to gaining the trust of the HCWs requesting childcare. HCWs were therefore encouraged to express expectations to volunteers ahead of time in recognition of the reality that not all students had childcare experience. The student leaders who managed the service remained in close contact with volunteers and HCWs to address concerns and instituted a low threshold cancellation policy, allowing either party to cancel for any reason. While childcare is never risk-free for children or for those who provide the care, none of the HCWs and none of the volunteers raised concerns beyond the few instances when a volunteer canceled on short notice because they were feeling unwell. While none of the volunteers encountered any personal liability or legal concerns, local regulations, especially regarding background checks, should be reviewed carefully in other settings.",

In managing this service, we developed a system for triaging childcare requests ( Figure 1 ) and took responsibility for the outcomes of that protocol. The student leaders regularly received requests for childcare services that had to be either denied or delayed to prioritize those with higher \"acuity\" and for the good of public health. This service benefitted from remaining completely student-run and completely independent. While it was started by OHSU students, we were careful to make clear that it was not organized, funded, or provided by any institution. The volunteers were not all OHSU students, and the service was not offered exclusively to OHSU employees. This independent grassroots structure afforded us flexibility around concerns of institutional liability. Just as medical students have the freedom to volunteer at, for instance, a soup kitchen, without considering their enrollment, so too can students offer childcare to their neighbors. We do not raise this point to argue against working with or within one's institution. Rather, Figure 1 Triage algorithm for childcare requests developed by health professions students providing childcare on a voluntary basis to HCWs serving on the frontlines in inpatient settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Screening questions for HCWs about their roles and responsibilities were included in the secondary request form (left) and responses were used to assign priority labels (right). These priority labels were displayed on the sign-up sheet such that volunteers would try to address requests in sequential order. Requests that did not meet tier 1-3 criteria were not displayed on the sign-up sheet. When a request was declined, a student leader would notify the requesting HCW directly and provide a list of alternative childcare options. Abbreviation: HCW, health care worker.",

As police brutality leads community members to gather and protest systemic racism, medical students could build a network to create and distribute personal safety materials.",
