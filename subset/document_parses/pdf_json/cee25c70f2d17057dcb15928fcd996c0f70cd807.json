            "text": "Administering COVID-19 vaccines at a societal scale has been deemed as the most appropriate way to defend against the COVID-19 pandemic. This global vaccination drive naturally fueled a possibility of Pro-Vaxxers and Anti-Vaxxers strongly expressing their supports and concerns regarding the vaccines on social media platforms. Understanding this online discourse is crucial for policy makers. This understanding is likely to impact the success of vaccination drives and might even impact the final outcome of our fight against the pandemic. The goal of this work is to improve this understanding using the lens of Twitter-discourse data. We first develop a classifier that categorizes users according to their vaccine-related stance with high precision (97%). Using this method we detect and investigate specific user-groups who posted about vaccines in pre-COVID and COVID times. Specifically, we identify distinct topics that these users talk about, and investigate how vaccine-related discourse has changed between pre-COVID times and COVID times. Finally, for the first time, we investigate the change of vaccine-related stances in Twitter users and shed light on potential reasons for such changes in stance. Our dataset and classifier are available at https://github.com/sohampoddar26/covid-vax-stance .",

To make these vaccines effective against COVID-19 at-scale and to eradicate the disease from a society, almost everyone in that society needs to consent to be vaccinated. In other words, only with near societal-scale vaccination, can we achieve the \"herd immunity\" and eradicate the disease (and prevent countless deaths) 2 . These vaccines are naturally welcomed by many people. However, some have also speculated that the development of these vaccines might be rushed and propelled by monetary and political reasons, thus indicating their hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines (Chou and Budenz, 2020) . This hesitancy persists in large sections of the society in spite of Governments giving various incentives towards vaccination.",

            "text": "There exists a long-drawn debate about vaccines since long before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The debate is between Anti-Vaxxers who believe that vaccines do more harm than good, and Pro-Vaxxers who support and promote the benefits of vaccines. Both the groups are known to actively propagate their views over social media (Mitra et al., 2016; Gunaratne et al., 2019) . It is important to know what the present attitude of the Anti-Vaxxer and Pro-Vaxxer communities is towards COVID-19 vaccines, and whether there has been any change in these attitudes in the pandemic times. While there have been a few surveys and manual analyses that have attempted to answer these questions Funk and Tyson (2020) ; Bonnevie et al. (2020) , to our knowledge, there has not been any prior attempt to devise automatic methods of answering these questions at scale using data from social media. It is important for policy makers to get answers to these questions at multiple stages of the pandemic, e.g., to figure out what the main concerns about vaccines are at different stages, so that they can take intervening steps accordingly. To our knowledge, this study is the first that (i) devises automated methods over data collected from social media (Twitter) to answer such questions, and (ii) conducts a long-term (over 2 years) analysis of people's attitudes towards vaccines, both individually and collectively. Specifically, we investigate two key questions -(1) What are user-attitudes towards COVID-vaccine as expressed by Anti-Vaxxers and Pro-Vaxxers on Twitter? Especially, are the anti-vax opinions about COVID-19 vaccines similar to the traditional anti-vax arguments that were prevalent in pre-COVID times?, and (2) Has the vaccine-related stance of some users changed over time due to the pandemic and why?",

Through this analysis, we find that some anti-vax themes such as the vaccine development being rushed and concerns about vaccines being ineffective have become more frequently discussed in COVID times (compared to the pre-COVID times).",

Understanding this set of users, whom we call stancechanged users, can be important for the authorities who are attempting to maximize the coverage of vaccines. Though some prior works have shown that people have changed their stances towards COVID-19 vaccines Funk and Tyson (2020) ; Bonnevie et al. (2020) , no prior work has systematically explored such users and why they changed their stance. In this work, we characterize different sub-groups of stance-changed users. Furthermore, we explore possible reasons of such stance-change. To this end, we uncover correlations between the stance-change of a user and life-events (e.g., loss of a close relative) as well as change in stance of the users' social contacts.",

To this end, we randomly selected 1, 700 tweets posted between January 2020 and March 2021, to be annotated into the three classes.

Out of a total of 37,127 distinct words in all the datasets combined, the classifier does not label Anti-vax/Pro-vax for as many as 37,011 words, indicating no bias with respect to 99.7% of the words. Only 116 words were predicted as Anti-Vax or Pro-Vax. These words were manually observed by a human annotator. All these words are found to be hashtags that are used almost exclusively with the corresponding stances. For example, hashtags such as '#refusePoisonVaccines', '#dontTrustVaccines', and '#vaccinesKill' were labeled as Anti-Vax, whereas hashtags such as '#getVaccinated', '#vaccinesSaveLives', and '#vaccinateToStopTheSpread' were labeled as Pro-Vax. We believe these keywords are indeed strongly associated with the corresponding stances. Thus we did not find any unjustified bias in the classifier. Also, we ran the classifier on the datasets after removing these hashtags, and the performances remained almost the same (e.g., on the [Cotfas + our unanimously labeled tweets] dataset, there was a decrease of only 0.003 in the macro-F1 score).",

We then label a user as Anti-Vaxxer or Pro-Vaxxer during a specific time period if they posted at least 3 vaccine-related tweets during that period, out of which more than \u03c4 fraction is labeled as Anti-Vax or Pro-vax respectively. We filter out users who posted less than 3 tweets as it is difficult to accurately estimate their stance from so few tweets. We use \u03c4 = 0.7 similar to Mitra et al. (2016) to get good precision in detecting user-stances. Using this method, we identified several users as Anti-Vaxxers and Pro-Vaxxers during the three time periods, as summarised in Table 5 . Evaluation of user classification: To evaluate the user classification, we randomly sampled 50 users from each of Anti-Vaxxer and Pro-Vaxxer groups, as predicted by the classifier for each of the three time periods. Thus, overall, we selected 300 users for this evaluation. Two annotators proficient in English and use of Twitter checked all the tweets posted by these users during the corresponding time periods, along with the users' Twitter profiles to determine their actual stance towards vaccines. Table 6 shows the results of the user-classification evaluation. Both annotators agreed that all the 100 users from the pre-COVID period were classified correctly. For the COVID period, 98 were correct, the other two users being ambiguous (i.e., at least one of the annotators was unsure of the user's actual stance). For the COVID-vax period, 93 out of the 100 users checked were correctly classified, while 6 Pro-Vaxxers were wrongly classified as Anti-Vaxxers (both annotators agreed in all cases). This relatively higher misclassification rate for the COVID-vax period is because during this period, many users criticize the government for mismanagement of vaccination programmes, and the classifier wrongly classified some of these users as Anti-Vaxxers.",

From these tables, it is evident that a lot more users have started discussing about vaccines since 2020, than in the pre-COVID times.

In the COVID-vax period even more users are concerned about the effectiveness, following reports of people affected by COVID even after getting vaccines. Another major concern is that the vaccines are being rushed by the government and the big pharma, and that not enough testing has been done before releasing the vaccines to the general public (the topic [Rushed] in Table 7 ).

A lot of users have actively stated that they wish to take vaccines or have taken vaccines ([Want Vaccines]) and are seen to actively post information that promotes the adoption of vaccines (the [Promote Vaccines] topic in Table 8 ).

This question is important to ascertain the practical utility of the insights about these users (as reported later in the paper), for policy-makers. As stated in Section 4.2, we attempted to detect the stance of a user during a certain time-period only if that user posted at least 3 tweets during that period. Thus the stance-changed users have posted at least 3 tweets each in two different time periods. Hence, we compare these users with the population of active Twitter users who posted at least 6 tweets related to vaccines in the entire time period of analysis (Jan 2018 -March 2021). In total, there are 340K such active users. Figure 2 compares social network properties (number of followers and followings) and the tweet composition behaviour of the two user-groups. Figures 2a and 2b show that the followers and followings distributions of the stance-changed users and the active users are very similar.",

Two authors manually examined the vaccinerelated tweets posted by these users from the time period when they were Anti-Vaxxers, to identify which anti-vax topics (out of the ones we identified in Table 7 ) they posted about. Figure 3 compares these groups of users -the anti-vax topics are shown on the X-axis while the fraction of users from each group who posted tweets corresponding to the topics is shown on the Y-axis. Note that we did not see any tweet about deeper conspiracy theories (Topic 8 in Table 7 ) from any of these groups. Since all these users were/became Pro-Vaxxers at some point, it is likely that they were not staunch Anti-Vaxxers, and conspiracy theories may be an opinion prevalent among staunch Anti-Vaxxers only.",

We compute what fraction of u's followings were Pro-Vaxxers and Anti-Vaxxers during each of the three time periods, based on the vaccine-related tweets that they (the followings) posted in the respective time periods. Thus, for user u, we first compute the fractions of Anti-Vaxxer and Pro-Vaxxer followings of u during a particular time period. Then we see how the fractions of Anti-Vaxxer and Pro-Vaxxer followings of u have changed from one time period to another (e.g., from 2018-19 to 2020, or from 2020 to 2021).

Similarly, for the users who are Anti-Vaxxers throughout, the fraction of Anti-Vaxxer followings was 4 times the fraction of Pro-Vaxxer followings at minimum (pre-COVID period) and 7 times at maximum (COVID-period).",

Essentially, we provide a framework to use social media data to automatically detect the vaccine-stance of users at scale, and understand the primary vaccinerelated concerns (if any) of users in different time periods. This framework can help the authorities in the following ways -(i) Devising targeted approaches to alleviate people's vaccine-related concerns: A policy maker cannot educate people unless they know the reasons/concerns behind their vaccine-related stance. We have seen that the anti-vax concerns are very different, from deep-rooted (e.g., vaccines kill people) to contextual (e.g., concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines being ineffective and rushed). So, the policy makers need a targeted approach to educate people having different types of concerns. (ii) Identifying and reaching out to people who changed their stances: We showed there is a population who have changed their vaccine-stances. The authorities can identify the people who can potentially move over from anti-vax to pro-vax, and better nudge those people towards vaccination. Perhaps, the experiences of some of the users who changed from Anti-vaxxer to Pro-vaxxer, can be used to nudge others in the Anti-vax community towards vaccination. Also, the authorities can investigate why some originally pro-vax users have become hesitant to take COVID-19 vaccines, and which specific concerns need to be clarified for them. (iii) Utilizing social media for nudging people towards vaccination: We found that the social connections can potentially influence the stance of users, which suggests the importance of using popular social media users in promoting more Pro-Vax information. However, the information needs to be carefully designed in accordance to the primary concerns of different target user groups, without which they might just be mistaken as propaganda. Also, policy makers can design targeted friend/content recommendation algorithms to break into today's Anti-vax echo chambers with pro-vax opinions.",

This implies that, for the stance-changed users, the amount of Anti-Vaxxers and Pro-Vaxxers among their followings changed by quite a margin across different time periods. In most cases, we also see correlation between the change of stance of the users with the change in the fraction of followings of the corresponding stance. Even though the overall number of Anti-Vaxxers increased in 2020, and Pro-Vaxxers in 2021 (as was seen in Section 4.2), we see a difference in the amount of increase in the fractions between the different user groups.
