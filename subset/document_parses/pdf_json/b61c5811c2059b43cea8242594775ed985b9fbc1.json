Salmonella Typhimurium (STm), which causes severe systemic disease in most inbred mice, has been used as a model for disseminated disease. To screen for new infection phenotypes across a range of host genetics, we orally infected 32 Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains with STm and monitored their disease progression for seven days by telemetry. Our data revealed a broad range of phenotypes across CC strains in many parameters including survival, bacterial colonization, tissue damage, complete blood counts (CBC), and serum cytokines. Eighteen CC strains survived to day 7, while fourteen susceptible strains succumbed to infection before day 7. Several CC strains had sex differences in survival and colonization. Surviving strains had lower pre-infection baseline temperatures and were less active during their daily active period. Core body temperature disruptions were detected earlier after STm infection than activity disruptions, making temperature a better detector of illness. All CC strains had STm in spleen and liver, but susceptible strains were more highly colonized. Tissue damage was weakly negatively correlated to survival. We identified loci associated with survival on Chromosomes (Chr) 1, 2, 4, 7. Polymorphisms in Ncf2 and Slc11a1, known to reduce survival in mice after STm infections, are located in the Chr 1 interval, and the Chr 7 association overlaps with a previously identified QTL peak called Ses2.

We used a population of genetically different mice (Collaborative Cross) to identify their range of responses to STm infection. We identified a broad range of outcomes across these different mice, including a group of mice susceptible to lethal infection and a group that survived our 7 day study. We found that mice that survived STm infection had a cooler core body temperature before infection than susceptible mice, while remaining active. Thus, body temperature, rather than activity, appears to be a better predictor of poor outcomes after STm infection. We identified several regions of the mouse genome that are associated with outcome after STm infection. One of these regions, mouse Chromosome (Chr) 1 has genes that are already known to influence susceptibility to STm infection. Two other regions that we identified to influence survival after STm infection, located on mouse Chr 2 and 4, are novel and contain numerous genes of interest that may be linked to susceptibility. Our work defines the utility of exploring how host genetic diversity influences infection outcomes with bacterial pathogens.",

Some mouse strains are particularly susceptible (C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ), while others are able to resist severe systemic disease (CBA/J, 129/SvJ, and A/J) [11] [12] [13] . Previous studies have largely attributed differential susceptibility to a mutation in solute carrier family 11 member 1 (Slc11a1) encoding a metal cation pump in macrophages that reduces intracellular growth of bacteria [2, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Natural variation in other genes has also been shown to play a role in differential survival after STm infection, including neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (Ncf2) and toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4). Ncf2 encodes a component of the NADPH complex in neutrophils that generates superoxide and is vital to neutrophil's killing ability [18] [19] [20] . Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and is a key component of innate immune response activation and cytokine production [21, 22] .",

At necropsy, organs and blood were collected to analyze colonization, histopathology, complete blood counts (CBC), and cytokine levels. Strains that survived to day 7 had lower uninfected baseline body temperatures and were less active during their active period pre-infection. Temperature patterns were disrupted earlier than activity patterns, suggesting that temperature is a more sensitive measurement for illness. All parameters were strain dependent, but in general, mice were colonized in systemic organs independent of survival time, spleen damage was most correlated to survival, and cytokines and CBC parameters were not predictive of survival. Several CC strains showed sex differences across survival, weight change, and bacterial burden, but one strain, CC027/GeniUnc, showed stark sex-dependence across all parameters. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for survival time revealed three significant and two suggestive associations, confirming known loci and detecting previously unknown variants providing new candidate genes not previously associated with STm. Furthermore, despite having susceptible alleles in both Slc11a1 and Ncf2 that are linked to early death from Salmonella infection, CC045/GeniUnc mice were able to survive 7 days with a high bacterial load and exhibited tolerance to systemic Salmonella infection.",

At the time of necropsy, sections of ileum, cecum, colon, liver, and spleen were collected to determine bacterial load. We focused our analysis on the systemic phase of infection. In comparison to previous studies that injected STm intravenously into CC mice, our STm oral infections produced a much wider range of colonization in critical organs (Fig 1) [40] .

Resistant/tolerant mice that survived the infection had a baseline pre-infection median minimum temperature of 36.32\u02daC during their resting period compared to susceptible non-surviving mice with a pre-infection median minimum temperature of 36.67\u02daC at rest ( Pre-infection activity measurements were analyzed by what fraction of the time the mouse was active, with a higher fraction suggesting more activity. Before infection, all mice had maximal activity during their active period at night. In pre-infection periods where mice were minimally active (day), both susceptible strains and surviving strains were active for equal amounts of time ( Fig 4B) . Considering an entire 24-hour period prior to infection, there was no statistically significant difference in activity between susceptible and surviving strains ( Fig  4B) . During the most active periods for the mice, strains susceptible to STm infection spent significantly more time active than strains that survived STm infection (0.83 versus 0.74, Fig  4B , P = 0.0139).

This wide range of colonization phenotypes reflects the genetic diversity of the CC, and is a wider range than represented in previous studies of the CC with STm [40, 41] . We identified 14 CC strains that were very susceptible to STm infection that did not survive the 7 day screening period. Several of these strains (CC025, CC021, CC013, and CC031) developed signs of systemic infection in the same time frame as B6 (susceptible control), but with lower bacterial colonization of both liver and spleen, suggesting increased sensitivity to STm infection. One of the susceptible strains, CC019, is also susceptible to intravenous infection with M. tuberculosis [37] . Mice in the CC042 strain developed very high ",

Finally, the remaining 18 CC strains we screened survived the full study period. Two of these strains, CC001 and CC002, were previously shown to display resistance to M. tuberculosis infection [37] . The range of survival for CC strains in our experiments was four to seven days (median), similar to those observed for B6 and CBA mice in our acute infection paradigm. The limited survival range is likely due to technical parameters of our experiment. Four days appears to be the fastest mice display symptoms of serious systemic disease after STm infection using our current infection paradigm. Seven days, the length of our screening period, is not long enough to capture the variability of longer survival after acute infection. Previous studies using CC mice and STm infection have not captured variability in survival after acute infection, because all mice were euthanized at day 4 post-infection regardless of disease state [40] .",

CC051 mice were very poorly colonized and appeared healthier than CBA mice (resistant control). Thus, CC051 mice are more resistant to STm infection than previously studied strains, results consistent with low level colonization after intravenous STm infection [40] . CC045 mice have mutations in both Slc11a1 and Ncf2, both typically leading to poor survival after STm infection [14] [15] [16] 18, 19] . While CC045 mice had higher bacterial loads of STm similar to susceptible mice, they survived the full study period and lost only~7% of their body weight. Thus, CC045 is a candidate \"tolerant\" strain, as it survives STm infection in the context of a bacterial colonization load that would be lethal to an otherwise susceptible mouse. CC045 mice must have compensatory mechanisms for survival despite the Slc11a1 and Ncf2 mutations that remain to be discovered.",

We identified several CC strains that exhibited sex differences in survival after STm infection (CC013, CC042, CC030, and CC027, Fig 2) . In keeping with the general hypothesis that females have stronger innate and adaptive immune responses than males and are less susceptible to many infections [56] , CC027 and CC042 females survived longer than males. CC027 exhibited the most dramatic sex difference as males were susceptible and all became moribund during the study period, while females survived. Consistent with the survival data, CC027 males were more heavily colonized in spleen and liver than females: (males: 4.80 x10 6 and 1.63 x10 6 CFU/g, females: 9.33 x10 5 and 8.87 x10 4 CFU/g, respectively). However, for the remaining two strains that exhibited sex differences in survival, CC013 and CC030, males survived longer than females. This finding is not without precedent however, as female mice lacking leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 protein (Lrrk2) are more susceptible to S. Typhimurium infection than males [57] . Future work focused on the sex differences we describe should uncover additional genes linked to sexual dimorphism in susceptibility to bacterial infection.",

Furthermore, in our experiments mice that survived STm infection had a lower baseline core body temperature prior to infection, a novel and unexpected finding. As fever is generally thought to be disease fighting [59] [60] [61] [62] , we expected mice with higher baseline temperatures to be able to mount a quicker fever response. Although female B6 mice reportedly have a higher baseline body temperature than males, it is not known whether this difference influences susceptibility to infection [63] .

Increased rest in surviving strains is unlikely to be the cause of lower core body temperature in these strains because it only occurred during the active period, while the temperature difference was maintained across all periods of the day. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in how rapidly surviving and susceptible infected mice deviated from their normal circadian pattern of activity after infection. However, susceptible mice deviated from their temperature pattern significantly earlier than their activity pattern, suggesting that core temperature is a more sensitive measurement to detect early disease.",

Splenic damage drove the small correlation suggesting that liver damage, while more severe, is better tolerated than splenic damage. Interestingly, there were some strains that exhibited quite severe damage in both organs yet survived (CC011, CC017, CC045, CC072, and CC078) and some strains that had milder damage and did not survive (CC005, CC025, and CC030). While mice are typically categorized into resistant and susceptible, this variable damage data suggests that there is more than one way to respond to infection. Discovery of these phenotypes highlights the usefulness of the CC as a way to assay responses that may be influenced by genetic diversity.",

Intravenous injection bypasses the intestine and defenses in this niche. Eighteen CC strains were shared between our study and previous work [40] . When median colonization in liver and spleen was compared, the oral infection route (current infection) produced higher bacterial burdens and a wider range of colonization in general (liver: 10 4 to 10 6 CFU/g vs 10 3 to 10 4 CFU/g and spleen:10 3 to 10 7 CFU/g vs 10 4 vs 10 5 CFU/g, excluding CC042) (Fig 2) . Possible reasons for the differences in colonization levels include different route of delivery, different time to necropsy and bacterial strain differences [40] . CC051 was an exception, with lower bacterial counts in the spleen after the oral infection versus IV infection. This finding suggests that CC051 mice are better at clearing intestinal STm, are better able to contain STm in the intestine, or are better at clearing STm prior to sustained systemic infection. CC051 is a model to explore true resistance to STm infection as it was the only strain that appeared to control systemic spread and systemic growth of STm after oral infection [1, 65] .",

Promising genes in this region include: BPI fold containing family B, member 2 (Bpifb2), and SAM domain and HD domain, 1 (Samhd1). Bpifb2 is a member of the lipid-transfer protein family and is predicted to have bactericidal and permeability-increasing properties, making it a promising candidate for further investigation [66] . While preliminary RNA-seq results do not show a significant difference between survived and susceptible mice, Bpifb2's family member Bpifa2 is more highly expressed in surviving mice than susceptible mice and binds LPS and acts as a bactericide, suggesting this family of proteins is important to the bacterial immune response [67, 68] . Samhd1 regulates interferon pathways in response to viral infections through NF-KB [69, 70] . While Samhd1 is linked to the immune response in viral infections, it may play a previously unknown role in immunity against bacterial pathogens. Further investigation is needed to prove such a link. Preliminary RNA-seq results do not find a significant difference in expression between survived and susceptible mice for Samhd1 however this does not mean the SNP difference does not affect the protein function. In both median survival and percent survived to day seven QTL intervals for Chr 4 and 7, haplotype differences did not help us narrow the gene list, but preliminary RNA-seq identified one predicted gene (Gm31510), of unknown function, and one gene, vomeronasal 2, receptor 66 (Vmn2r66), that is involved in pheromone detection and not likely to be involved in immune function [71] .

We defined CC strains bearing Slc11a1 or Ncf2 mutations that unexpectedly survive acute STm infection. Finally, we identified both known and novel regions of the mouse genome associated with survival time after STm infection. The data we describe here is both complex and diverse. While we don't yet fully understand how all the elements of physiological, immunological and genetics participate in the phenotypes we describe here, we hypothesize that there may be more than one way to survive STm infection.
