The number of changes did not differ by the severity of reinfection and reinfecting variants were similar to the contemporaneous sequences circulating in the community.

In addition, the diagnosis of COVID-19 reinfection has been complicated by the increasing reports of persistent COVID-19 infection, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. Like reinfection cases, persistent COVID-19 can also span the range of disease severity, from asymptomatic to severe disease, and recurrent symptoms can last for months [8] [9] [10] [11] . Differentiating between persistence and reinfection can be challenging, and little is known about differences in the location and quantity of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in these scenarios. We performed an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from published cases of COVID-19 reinfection and persistence, characterizing the hallmarks of reinfecting sequences and the rate of viral evolution in persistent infection.",

We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for reviewing literature and for reporting search results. Additional preprints that appeared through Google search and that met our criteria were also included. For cases of reinfection, papers were included if the authors described it as a case of reinfection diagnosed >30 days after the initial infection and if A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences or sites of mutations relative to a reference sequence (e.g., Wuhan-Hu-1) from both infection time-points were available.

Persistent cases were included if the authors described it as a case of persistent COVID-19 infection and if longitudinal whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences were available. The search returned 129 results, 7 of which met the inclusion criteria and were included in the present report along with one other preprint (Supplemental Figure   1B ). Only sequences obtained directly from patient respiratory tract samples were included in our analysis to exclude the possibility of sequence changes during the ex vivo culture process. Three cases were excluded due to uncertainty in their classification as either reinfection or persistent infection cases (Supplemental Methods, Supplemental ",

This suggests that the whole dataset has a realistic temporal signal and it is appropriate for an estimation of temporal parameters. No outliers were found in this sample. To further examine the temporal signal in the sequences from persistent patients (especially these with > 2 sequences), separate root-to-tip regression analysis also supported temporal signal for a time-measured phylogeny. To compare the evolutionary rates between the reported persistent infections and the general population infections, timemeasured phylogenetic reconstruction was conducted in Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) v1.10.4 [15]. Nine partitions, including eight persistent patients and the global sequences, were used as separate groups of taxa, to estimate separate evolutionary rates. Due to large uncertainties with small samples, persistent patients with only two viral sequences were excluded from this analysis. A general time reversible (GTR) model was applied with gamma-distributed rate variations among sites. A lognormal relaxed molecular clock was used with an initial mean of 0.0008 and a uniform prior ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. A logistic growth tree prior was applied. Four independent Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains of 100 million generations were performed with a sampling step every 10,000 generations to yield 10,000 trees per run. To ensure a sufficient effective sample size ESS > 200, the convergence of three runs was diagnosed in Tracer v 1.7.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) for all parameters. LogCombiner v1.10.4 as part of the BEAST software package was used to combine the multiple runs to generate log and tree files after appropriate removal of the burn-in from each MCMC chain. The comparison of the evolutionary rates from the combined log file is analyzed and visualized in R v4.0.2 (https://www.r-project.org/).",

However, the reinfecting variants generally contained a substantial number of mutations compared to the initial variant, including frequent changes in the S gene, and additional studies are needed to assess whether these changes may have contributed to the risk of repeat infection.While the number of immunosuppressed individuals with available sequences remains limited, the results suggest that the rate of viral evolution (measuring both synonymous and non-synonymous changes), is accelerated within immunosuppressed individuals. In addition, treatment with convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibody cocktails was insufficient to fully halt viral evolution and the emergence of viral escape with treatment has been documented[26,34]. Mutations associated with immune escape and/or more efficient replication kinetics, including E484K, S494P, N501Y and N-terminal spike deletions, have been observed in both immunosuppressed individuals and the novel variants of concern[35,36]. The results raise the possibility that novel variants, including those harboring escape mutations against current treatments, could arise from immunosuppressed individuals and suggest that immunosuppressed individuals should be a focus of public health efforts. Amongst the current reports of persistent COVID-19, B-cell dysfunction appears to be a common thread, including in reports that were not included in this analysis due to a lack of available full-length sequences[37][38][39][40][41]. It is important to note, though, that T cell function may also play a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2[42] and a subset of these patients also included concurrent suppression of other aspects of the immune response. Additional studies are needed to fully define the type and intensity of immunosuppression that would place patients at greatest risk of persistent COVID-19.Two factors generally differentiated between reinfection and persistent infection scenarios: first, reinfections have so far been largely described in immunocompetent individuals while the majority of persistent COVID cases have been in immunosuppressed patients. Secondly, phylogenetic analysis can generally differentiate between reinfection and persistent infection, especially in cases where persistent infection allowed the longitudinal collection of >2 sequences. However, given the slow rate of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and of this work is that it relies on case reports, which can be influenced by publication bias and limits our statistical power. However, to date, there have been no systematic, large-scale sequence-based studies of COVID-19 reinfection or persistent infections. This is partly due to the rarity of these types of cases and that initial infecting sequences are frequently unavailable for comparison with reinfecting or persistently infecting variants. Overall, our results demonstrate the need to further explore factors that increase the risk of breakthrough reinfections and persistent COVID-19. This line of investigation will have important implications on the durability of current available vaccines and for preventing the rise of novel variants.",
