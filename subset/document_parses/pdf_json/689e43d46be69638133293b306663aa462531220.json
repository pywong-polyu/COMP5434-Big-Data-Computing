In many countries, LTC has been the epicentre of the pandemic, with the incidence and severity of illness and mortality shifted towards older people particularly those with multiple comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [1] . In addition, a quarter of residents have diabetes and two-thirds may have frailty which is a better predictor of intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes than age or other factors [2] . Residents in LTC are a highly co-morbid population who are particularly vulnerable to developing rapid serious acute illness as has been demonstrated with COVID-19 infection. The huge burden on hospital-based care for managing COVID-19 has meant that many residents with this infection remain in LTC and are not referred to hospital, with care staff being expected to take on additional care not previously considered to be within their remit. This includes administering oxygen and/or dexamethasone therapy.",

Dexamethasone has a favourable benefit-risk profile when used in those with severe pneumonia. Short-term use (< 2 weeks) is associated with few side effects apart from hyperglycaemia in non-diabetic individuals [5] but may worsen glucose control in those with diabetes mellitus by reducing peripheral use of glucose. It is also important to monitor for fluid and sodium retention.",
