            "text": "Worldwide, respiratory tract infections are one of the leading causes of emergency department (ED) visits 1 and also one of the leading causes of infectious-disease-related deaths. 2 Among the causative pathogens of pneumonia and respiratory infections, the role of viruses has recently been highlighted by the emergence of syndromic testing. 3 Specifically, the frequency and role of noninfluenza respiratory viruses has been increasingly recognized in recent years. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Because antibiotic overuse drives antimicrobial resistance, it is essential to quickly document the pathogen responsible for lower respiratory tract infections and decide whether antibiotic treatment is required. The number of rapid syndromic testing assays (<2 h) has been expanding in the past few years, 12 but they continue to be used primarily in central laboratories despite their utility as a point-of-care test (POCT). The guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recently included multiplex PCR (mPCR) as one of the diagnostic tools to manage patients with lower respiratory tract infections who require hospitalization, whether or not they are immunosuppressed. 13 Several recent studies have evaluated the benefits of using rapid syndromic testing assays as POCTs, including decreased antibiotic use, decreased need for complementary examinations, reduced duration of hospitalization and increased antiviral use for influenza-related infections. Some of the results of these studies conflict, but two studies have shown substantial reductions in lengths of hospital stay and either decreases in the use of antibiotics or increases in the numbers of patients receiving a single dose of antibiotics. [14] [15] [16] However, a limitation of these two studies was that they often compared the use of rapid syndromic testing as a POCT targeting multiple viruses and some atypical bacteria with the use of a classic central laboratory approach without the use of rapid syndromic testing (i.e. systematically testing for influenza but testing for other respiratory viruses only on physician request). Thus, the observed benefits could be explained both by the delay of results and by the systematic detection of all respiratory viruses.",

This last point is of importance as single room availability is limited and can lead to double room misattribution for influenza-positive patients, as observed in our previous study for up to 75% of influenza-positive patients. 19 We therefore designed a monocentric, prospective, controlled clinical trial to measure the impact of using the same rapid syndromic test as a POCT versus using it in the central laboratory.

This is particularly relevant because nosocomial acquisition of influenza is associated with more severe cases and substantially increases hospital LOS. 29, 30 The same impact should also be expected for other viruses, but very few data are available aside from data related to influenza. 10, 11 The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the need for more efficient respiratory infection control measures. In this context, our results are in line with a study 18 that demonstrated that rapid POCT for SARS-CoV-2 decreased the time to availability of results compared with laboratory PCR (1.7 versus 21.3 h); this reduction was associated with improved infection control measures and reduced patient time in the ED before hospitalization. It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate and burden health systems for years to come. Thus, forthcoming testing strategies will be impacted by the potential co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 with the other major respiratory pathogens, such as influenza, coupled with uncertainty about the duration of protection after infection or potential vaccination. In those strategies, it will be critical to be able to accurately detect pathogens of concern and isolate patients appropriately.",
