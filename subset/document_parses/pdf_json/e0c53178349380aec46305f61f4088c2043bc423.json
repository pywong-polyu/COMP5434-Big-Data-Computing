The latter causes cell loss, edema of the alveolar walls and enhanced vascular permeability, leading to the apoptosis of alveolar type-1 pneumocytes. After apoptosis, cells start recruiting immune effector cells that activate tissue remodeling [4] . The clinical picture of RILI is radiation pneumonitis (RP). Symptomatic RP occurs in about 30% of patients receiving concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [5] . The incidence of RP is multifactorial, including treatment-related and patient-related conditions, particularly older age and larger volume of lungs receiving higher doses; some chemotherapy regimens are also associated with increased risk of RP [5] .",

Moreover, lymphopenia is frequently observed, as lymphocytes are more radiosensitive than other white blood cells.

Among its features, the algorithm module includes automated segmentation of the core features of COVID-19 lung lesions and the segmentation of the lung lobes (right upper lobe, middle lobe, right lower lobe, left upper lobe and left lower lobe). The output also includes the estimated risk probability for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The core algorithm is based on a novel deep convolutional neural network structure and uses the U-net network structure as the core segmentation network [24] . The model training process is presented elsewhere [25] . The cleaned and labeled data were trained through the designated network structure. Continuous testing and parameter adjustments resulted in a final model that meets all the requirements. The model was developed initially after training on a population of patients diagnosed in Wuhan, China, and was later further developed through training on a larger population. Specifically, for the trained AI model, patients' characteristics (n = 2191 adult patients; Wuhan Chinese COVID-19) were mixed, including all stages and clinical presentations of the disease (e.g., symptoms could have been mild, moderate or severe) [24] . Based on a preliminary analysis of the deep learning algorithm, evaluated in our hospital with the first 100 patients undergoing RT-PCR test, the cut-off value of the estimated risk probability of COVID-19 was set at levels higher than 30% (\"COVID-19 High Risk\"), as the percentage of patients confirmed to have COVID-19 above this cut-off value was higher than 95%. Values of estimated risk probability below 30% were classified as \"COVID-19 Low Risk\" [26] , as the definite diagnosis requires a positive RT-PCR test.",

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value are presented as point estimates (95% CI). Table 1 shows the study population characteristics and the three independent datasets testing the AI model. Patients with COVID-19 and RP were older than pneumonia-free patients (p = 0.001). The number of males was higher than that of females across all patient groups. A positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was available for all patients with COVID-19 and a negative RT-PCR test was available for 14/30 (47%) pneumonia-free patients. In Group 2, chest CT scans showed the known features of COVID-19 pneumonia, including peripheral, bilateral and multi-lobar ground-glass opacity, with or without crazy paving pattern and, in some cases, with consolidations. These features were automatically detected and segmented by the AI software. In Group 3, despite similar CT findings, although mostly unilateral, the diagnosis of RT-related pneumonitis in patients occurred as a complication during the course of and within the first 3 months after radiation treatment. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was the most prevalent primary tumor (32/4; 89%) within Group 3. Most patients presenting RP (66.7%) were classified by the algorithm as \"COVID-19 Low Risk\". All RP cases classified as \"COVID-19 High Risk\" were \u2265G3 (CTC AE vers. 4.0). Age reported as median value (minimum and maximum). COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019; RP = radiation pneumonitis; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; RT-PCR = reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; AI = artificial intelligence; NSCLC = non-small cell lung cancer; n.a. = not applicable. Table 2 shows the performance of the deep learning algorithm on the risk estimation of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT images. The sensitivity for discriminating COVID-19 pneumonia from RP was 97% (true positive = 33/34), with 95% CI (0.94-0.99); however, the specificity was very low (2%; 95% CI = 0.0-0.05%) without a COVID-19 risk cut-off value. Indeed, the specificity increased to 63% (95% CI = 0.51-0.74) when the risk cut-off value was set at 30%. The deep learning algorithm's performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia compared with pneumonia-free patients had high sensitivity and specificity (97% and 47%, respectively). The ROC curves for the AI risk prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia are shown in Figure 2 . The corresponding AUC value for COVID-19 and RP independent of the 30% cutoff value was 0.72 (95%CI: 0.66-0.78) but increased to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78-0.90) when applying the 30% risk cut-off value. The AUC values were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00) for COVID-19 and pneumonia-free and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.82-0.88) for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. Table 3 summarizes the results of the comparison between COVID-19 pneumonia and RP in terms of total and lobar involvement.

The deep learning algorithm was able to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia and RP with good diagnostic performance (AUC 0.72). However, the specificity was very low (2%); indeed, almost all patients with RP were classified as suspected patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirming that lung interstitial disease in patients with previous radiation treatment represents a confounding factor in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Nevertheless, the assessment of CT scans based on the low-risk/high-risk classification that used the 30% cut-off value showed a net increase in specificity up to 63% (AUC 0.84); in fact, the median values of estimated risk probability were significantly lower in patients with RP than in those with COVID-19 (p = 0.001). This result supports the idea that risk stratification rather than binary classification is helpful in discriminating different entities with overlapping CT features [16] . Moreover, these data reinforce the idea that deep learning algorithms based only on CT images cannot distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other lung interstitial diseases with overlapping CT features with high specificity; thus, adding clinical/laboratory findings to the algorithm can improve the diagnostic performance based on binary classification. In the case of the deep learning algorithm used in this study, CT scans classified as low risk (below the 30% threshold) matched with a positive molecular test in less than 5% of the cases (preliminary study in our institution). Nevertheless, further data collection is needed to improve the generalizability of our results. In addition, total lung volume involvement was significantly higher in COVID-19 than in RP patients, as an expected consequence of the typical bilateral and multi-lobar lung involvement of COVID-19. Moreover, the RP pattern is usually strictly related to the target volume and to the dose distribution of the treatment plan. The lobar involvement analysis demonstrated that both lower lobes were significantly less affected in patients with RP than in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. These differences in chest CT patterns are the main factors that justify the cut-off value for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and the good performance of the deep learning algorithm. The AI algorithm was able to detect COVID-19 pneumonia features on chest CT images of a tested population (Caucasian) with ethnic characteristics different from the population used for training (Asian). The algorithm showed good performance in segmentation of the most typical CT findings in COVID-19 pneumonia, such as multifocal and peripheral, often bilateral, ground-glass areas associated with patchy consolidations. The performance of the algorithm was excellent in terms of sensitivity and negative predictive value for the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia (AUC 0.99) and confirmed the utility of this software as a rapid diagnostic tool to flag suspected COVID-19 patients. This study has also some limitations: it is retrospective in nature, the size of the samples is small and the protocols used with three different scanners were variable. In addition, overlapping chest CT features of several diseases reflect common mechanisms of response of the lungs to different etiologies. Subsequently, measurements of volume, shape or density of pulmonary lesions may not be sufficient to develop powerful deep learning models. The study does, however, confirm that artificial intelligence solutions can assist in the clinical management and follow-up of patients with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation phases.",

These results may be improved in time with the addition of clinical data, leading to more accurate AI solutions in the differential diagnosis of lung diseases with interstitial involvement. Our results suggest that lesion distribution as well as other radiomics-based data and clinical information are necessary to improve the reliability of AI algorithms for the diagnosis of radiation therapy-related pneumonitis.",
