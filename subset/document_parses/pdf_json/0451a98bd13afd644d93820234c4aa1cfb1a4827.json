Our results are in line with those reported by these previous studies and suggest that CT may be an effective tool for the initial individual risk assessment. This is of exceptional importance primarily in those cases whose symptoms and overall general condition do not suggest severe lung disease. However, quantitative CT data alone are not enough to predict shortterm outcomes. In this regard, we also analysed the influence of patient-related factors in the definition of early outcome. The most predictive patient-related factors of adverse outcome were age and the presence of a significant comorbidity. The combination of CT, clinical, and laboratory findings can provide valuable information to direct toward a correct diagnosis while waiting for RT-PCR results. This was demonstrated by some works that showed a high sensitivity of CT in diagnosing COVID-19 in patients with respiratory symptoms [3, 4] . In the background of high disease prevalence, the relatively lower specificity of CT is mitigated by the low likelihood of alternative diagnosis.

First, the retrospective nature of this study makes it prone to selection bias. CT was performed in patients who sought medical attention despite restrictive quarantine measures, i.e., the patients with mild symptoms did not come to our institution. Second, this was a single-centre study, and therefore the included cohort of patients may limit the generalizability of our observations. However, all models achieved high accuracy in previously unseen samples, which is an indicator of generalizability to external data. Third, another limitation was that we did not consider the interpersonal variability of total lung volumes. This issue can be addressed by providing the percentage of involved lung by calculating the VoD over the total lung volume. Yet, if not performed automatically, this may be a lengthy process and not suitable for clinical practice. Moreover, in our work we calculated COVID-19 lung involvement directly from the CT workstation; image transfer to open source third-party software tools may be difficult to perform in high-volume clinical settings. Fourth, we did not evaluate inter-rater agreement in VoD quantification. It is plausible that quantitative CT data may be less prone to interobserver variability than qualitative CT findings and thus more reliable in the prediction of short-term outcome in COVID-19 patients. Fifth, even though patients that did not require hospitalisation were instructed to return to our institution as soon as their symptoms worsened, a small fraction of individuals could have been lost in follow-up. Sixth, we did not correlate quantitative CT findings with other important clinical data (e.g., hypertension, D-dimer, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation); unfortunately, these data were not available in all patients. We used CT surrogates for cardiovascular disease (aortic and coronary calcifications), which may limit the applicability of these results to the real world. Finally, another limitation is that we grouped all comorbidities in one feature. Yet, this allowed for statistical robustness considering the relatively low number of patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, measuring the VoD in the lungs using a simple CT post-processing tool allows estimation of COVID-19 burden.
