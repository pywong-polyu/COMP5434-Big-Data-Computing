            "text": "Purpose We examined whether financial burdens occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted healthcare utilization among survivors of adolescent and young adult cancers. Methods We surveyed survivors enrolled in a patient navigation program to obtain self-reports of delayed/skipped cancer care or other care, changes to medication obtainment, and changes to medication use since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Reported financial burdens were defined as financial toxicity in the past 4 weeks (COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity [COST] \u2264 median 21) and material hardships (range = 4-11) since March 2020. Adjusted logistic regression models calculated associations and effect modification by gender. Results Survivors (n = 341) were mostly female (61.3%) and non-Hispanic White (83.3%). Nearly 20% delayed/skipped cancer care, 35.2% delayed/skipped other care, 19.1% changed medication obtainment, and 12.6% changed medication use. Greater material hardships were associated with delayed/skipped cancer care (odds ratio (OR) = 3.13, 95% CI = 1.44-6.81) and other care (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.18-3.98), and changed medication obtainment (OR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.43-5.18) or use (OR = 4.49, 95% CI = 2.05-9.80). Financial toxicity was associated with delayed/skipped other care (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.31-4.89) and changed medication obtainment (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.01-3.83) and medication use (OR = 3.73, 95% CI = 1.59-8.73). The association of material hardships and any changes in healthcare utilization was greater among female compared to male survivors. Conclusion Financial burdens experienced during the pandemic impeded survivors' ability to utilize necessary healthcare, with worse impacts among female survivors. Implications for Cancer Survivors Delayed or skipped healthcare may lead to an increased cancer mortality or severity of therapy-related conditions. Providing resources that enable survivors experiencing financial burdens to continue critical cancer and preventive care during the COVID-19 pandemic is a priority.",

Healthcare systems have reduced patient loads to limit in-person contact and preserve resources for COVID-19 care, but these changes have limited capacity for cancer care [4, 5] . Shifting to telehealth has been challenging for cancer patients whose care may require laboratory tests or hands-on examination [4, 5] . While some patients are hesitant to start or continue cancer care during the pandemic, expedient cancer care is still a priority. Even a month-long delay in treatment can increase cancer mortality by between 6 and 23% [6, 7] . Survivors of adolescent and young adult cancers, who were diagnosed between the ages 15 and 39 years (AYA survivors), already had financial and insurance-related barriers to utilizing healthcare before the pandemic [8] . COVID-19-related health care challenges may cause additional barriers for AYA survivors, affecting their treatment, management of late effects, and screening for second cancers [9, 10] . Pandemic-related delays in cancer care have been reported in 40% to 60% of surveyed AYA survivors [11] .",

To cope with financial toxicity and out-of-pocket costs, AYA survivors may engage in cost-coping behaviors such as skipping treatments that likely have adverse impacts on their survival [13] . An estimated 71% of AYA survivors have engaged in at least one cost-coping behavior, and those with the greatest financial toxicity had the highest risk for these behaviors [13] . While health insurance can offset some costs, cancer-related unemployment can create gaps in health insurance coverage and can impede survivors' ability to build savings [14] . The pandemic appears to have worsened the prevalence of these financial, health insurance, and employment-related barriers to healthcare in AYA survivors [13, 15] .",

These disparities may have widened during the COVID- 19 pandemic, but few studies involving young cancer survivors have addressed this topic. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed AYA survivors through the Huntsman-Intermountain Adolescent and Young Adult (HIAYA) Cancer Care Program about their healthcare utilization, financial burdens, and changes in employment or school that they experienced during the 2020 calendar year. This exploratory study identifies whether these changes were correlated with survivors' self-reported healthcare utilization. We captured four dimensions of healthcare utilization: delayed or skipped cancer care, delayed or skipped other care, adaptive behaviors to obtain lower cost medications, and changes in medication use.",

In our study, financial toxicity and material hardship had significant impacts on delayed/skipped cancer care. Even a 4-week delay in starting care increases mortality from treatable cancers that are diagnosed among AYAs, including breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer [6, 7] . In this study, financial burdens were the only significant contributing factors to delayed/skipped cancer or other care. Over a third of surveyed survivors delayed/skipped other care while nearly 20% delayed/skipped cancer care, perhaps due to perceptions that cancer care was of greater importance. While receiving timely cancer care is important for cancer survival, primary care is still needed to detect preventable diseases, cancer screenings, and administration of vaccines including COVID-19 vaccines. The lower percent of delayed/skipped cancer care suggests that AYA survivors may have a higher need or feel more pressure to pay for cancer care than other types of healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite access to patient navigation services, one-fifth of AYAs in our sample still reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had severe effects on their finances and ability to utilize healthcare. Our study provides strong support for the profound impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic had on delayed/skipped healthcare utilization among AYA survivors that may not be able to be addressed through patient navigation services alone. The HIAYA participants were predominantly non-Hispanic White, for whom the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was less generally severe than racial and ethnic minorities [48] . Thus, we can infer that impacts on healthcare utilization among minority AYA survivors likely have been more severe than reported by our sample.",

Prior to the pandemic, AYA survivors already experienced systematic inequalities in health insurance coverage, cancer care delivery and healthcare access, and employment discrimination that influence their health outcomes [49, 50] . During the pandemic, AYAs from historically marginalized groups (e.g., women, LGBTQ +) appeared to be the most vulnerable to the financial impacts of the pandemic and disruptions in healthcare. Thus, addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19 for these groups requires a systematic approach that considers and addresses the fundamental causes of socioeconomic disparities in the US healthcare system, such as lack of insurance access.",

We also do not have information about the number of dependents belonging to each participant, nor more detailed information about their work history or household income prior to the pandemic. But we do have detailed information about their reported financial burdens and the origin of those financial burdens. Like all cross-sectional studies, the causal nature of these associations between financial burdens relative to the changes in healthcare utilization cannot be determined due to temporality.

Provider/ facility preference was responsible for delays/skips in 47.7% of cancer and 44.2% of other care. Oncology (13.8%) was the most commonly delayed/skipped type of cancer care. Primary care (2.1%) and mental health (2.6%) that were related to cancer were the least commonly delayed/skipped cancer care. For other care, primary care (23.8%) was most commonly delayed/skipped. Nearly 20% of survivors changed their medication obtainment and 12.6% changed their medication use. Financial burdens due to cancer (39.9%) or COVID-19 (54.8%) were the most common type of reported material hardship (due to any cause = 77.5%). Other common material hardships included taking money out of savings (due to any cause = 63.2%, COVID-19 = 22.9%, cancer = 32.0%) and spending \u2265 10% of income on medical expenses (due to any cause = 38.4%, COVID-19 = 4.7%, cancer = 31.4%).Odds ratios for delayed/skipped other care were greater among female survivors (OR = 2.41, 95%CI = 1.26-4.62) compared to males and among married/cohabiting survivors (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.15-4.76) relative to single survivors(Table 3). Changing medication obtainment odds ratios were elevated among divorced/widowed/separated survivors (OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.08-10.2) and inverse among survivors with employer/military/individual health insurance (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.21-0.82) relative to their comparison groups.

We found no significant results by cancer diagnosis or self-reported cancer therapy since March 2020.Financial burdens had significant impacts on delayed/ skipped cancer and other care appointments.
