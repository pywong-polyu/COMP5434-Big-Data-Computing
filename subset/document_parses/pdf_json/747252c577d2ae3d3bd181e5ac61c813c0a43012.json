The aim of this study is to assess the community knowledge, attitude and practice strategy implementation on SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 . A cross-sectional survey study was done from July to October, 2020 in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia. Interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 404 respondents. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square test with a 95% confidence interval to know the association of socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. From a total of 404 responses collected (64.1%, n = 259/404), (50.7%, n = 205/404) and (39.6%, n = 160/404) of the respondents were between ages 18-39 years, males and were diploma and above, respectively. The majority of the respondents had good knowledge about the transmission mode and symptoms of COVID-19 and they obtained information mainly through mass media. The knowledge of the respondents about the transmission mode of COVID-I9 through coughing and sneezing, direct contact with infected person and touching contaminated materials was statistically associated with education and occupation (p <0.001). Among the total respondents (53.7%, n = 217/404) had a negative attitude that COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled. The attitude of the respondents towards successfully controlling of COVID-I9 was statistically associated in terms of age, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.001). Most of the respondents (63.1%, n = 255/404), (58.9%, n = 238/404), (66.8%, n = 270/404) and (63.9%, n = 258/404) did not wash hands with soap, avoidance of touching the nose and mouth, practicing social distancing and wearing of face masks in public or crowded places, respectively. The practices of the respondents towards COVID-19 were statistically associated with sex, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.01). COVID-19 is currently the cause of death and it has a great impact on the economy, politics and social interactions in the study area. The government should strength the health system by increasing surveillance activities in detecting cases. Our findings suggest that the community should practice the WHO and EMoH recommendations to minimize the spread of the virus.",

A study done in China reported that SARC-CoV-2 was obtained from lower respiratory tract samples identified from affected patients. The newly discovered virus was given the name COVID-19 in February 2020 [2] . This disease has become a major problem on public health across the world and creates a great fear within the people and spreads rapidly all over the world [3] . The consequences of the disease in terms of psychology, politics, economic and culture was beyond anything experienced in a generation [4] . SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA new strain of virus that can infect humans and causes SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID- 19) and it mainly attacks the respiratory system of the body [5] . The virus is highly contagious and can easily be transmitted from human to human through respiratory droplets when infected people sneeze or cough and it has survival capacities on the surface of different materials for several hours [6] . The virus easily transmitted to the healthy person by touching droplet-contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth [7] . The major clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, malaise, fatigue and difficulty to breathe [8] . The highly contagious nature of COVID-19 makes it to spread an alarming rate throughout the world, including Ethiopia [9, 10] . The severity of the disease is high in individuals of older age, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, kidney, lung and heart diseases [10, 11] . There are no scientifically produced proven antiviral drugs or vaccines on hand for the disease since now to control the spread of COVID-19 and thus create a significant risk to health care delivery [12] . Many countries throughout the world planned different strategies like staying at home, practicing social distancing, remote office activities, international travel bans, and using face masks to minimize the transmission of the virus [13, 14] .",

Following the first confirmation of the virus in the country, the Ethiopian government declared different restriction strategies to prevent the spreading of the disease which is in line with WHO [15] . According to Ethiopian Ministry of Health (EMoH) and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) report on October 22, 2020, there were 91,118 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,384 deaths and 44,506 recoveries in the country due to COVID-19. Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, epicenter of COVID-19, is highly hit by COVID-19 [16] . Restriction of social activities to prevent the disease throughout the world causes a great impact on global economic fall [17, 18] and this is also a problem of Ethiopia which affects the socio-economic development and political environment. COVID-19 also affects the community daily life in different ways, such as physically, mentally and psychologically.

The questionnaire was prepared in the English and Amharic languages. The data from the respondents were collected by wearing a face mask and glove at air ventilated area, keeping a minimum of 2m distance from the respondents. The questionnaire consisted three sections. The first section consisted information on respondents' socio-demographic characteristics. The second section contains participants' Knowledge, attitude and practices about COVID-19. The questionnaires assessing Knowledge, attitude and practice of the community towards COVID-19 were answered in yes/no. The third section assessed restriction strategy implementation by the community declared by the government towards COVID-19 by using a five-point Likert scale.

At present, even if there are trials to develop the vaccine, there is no effective vaccine and treatment for the SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the world. Therefore, the only solution to prevent the disease is increasing the communities' awareness, attitude and practices about the COVID-19 [9] . The aim of this study was to assess the communities' knowledge, attitude, practices and government restriction strategy implemented by the communities to prevent COVID-19 in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia. The majority of the study participants were male and in the age range of 18-39. The finding of this study is in line with the findings done in Africa [21] where 83.3% were between 18 to 39 years. The majority of the respondents (76.0%) got the information about COVID-19 from mass media such as TV and radio which was in agreement with the findings done in Addis Zemen Hospital, Ethiopia [10] and Egypt [22] . Most of the respondents had good knowledge about the transmission mode of COVID-19 that is in agreement with previous studies done in Kenya and Nigeria [8, 23] . Similarly, a study done in Asia indicated that the majority population had a very good knowledge about COVID-19 [24] . Of the respondents surveyed in this study (80.4%) had very good knowledge about the mode of transmission and the clinical symptoms of COVID-19. A previous study reported in Saudi Arabia [13, 25] is persistent with the findings of the present study. The good awareness of respondents about COVID-19 transmission ways and clinical symptoms was obtained through television and radio. Both the government mass media and non-government mass media had a great contribution to increase the awareness of the community towards COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings showed that (44.6%) of the participants responded pseudoscientific practices (using garlic, ginger, feto, etc. as home remedies) are not necessary to confront the SARS-CoV-2. Of the total respondents (80.7%) answered isolation and treatment of people who are infected with COVID-19 are effective ways to reduce the spread of viruses.",

The reason of low practice to stay home might be due to socio-economic problems faced by the community. Our findings revealed (26.7%) and (56.0%) of the respondents were obeying the government restriction strategies of avoiding weeding ceremonies and funeral ceremonies, respectively, in the presence of crowded people without practicing social distancing. This might be due to lack of strict enforcement of the required lockdown. However, a similar study done in China, a majority of the participants (96.4%) avoided attending in people crowded places [8] . The reason for this difference might be due to socioeconomic, religious and educational differences between the study populations.",

In the current study (44%) of the study participants responded that the community in the study area did not wear face masks when they go to people crowded places (e.g., market, bus station). This is in line with a study has done in Addis Zemen Hospital, Ethiopia [10] but in contrary to the findings has done in China [8] only (4.0%) went to crowded areas or went outside without a face mask. The low practice of wearing face masks in the present study might be due to low income to buy it and shortage of the masks in the study area. Similarly, the low commitment of the local government to enforce the community also might be a reason for poor practice to wear face masks in the study area.",

In our study, the majority (91.2%) of the study participants had good prevention knowledge towards the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the practical knowledge and implementation of governmental restriction strategies to prevent the disease is very low. Only 36.9%, 36.1% and 33.2% of the participants practice hand washing with soap, wear face masks and social distancing, respectively. The majority of the community is lacking safety practices like celebrating holidays with crowded people, wearing face masks and social distancing which have a great contribution of spread of the disease. We recommend that implementing frequent washing of hands with soap and sanitizer, practicing social distancing and face mask wearing could inhibit the spread of COVID-19 and successful control in the study area.",
