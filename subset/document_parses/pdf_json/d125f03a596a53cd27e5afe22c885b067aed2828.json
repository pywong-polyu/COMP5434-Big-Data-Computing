She replaces Prof. Russ Hovey, who has worked tirelessly for the last 11 years to sustain the quality of the Journal, to raise its profile and to adjust it to the current needs of the field. Under Prof. Hovey's leadership, the Journal underwent several important transformations. First, it evolved from a compendium of thematic issues containing only solicited reviews to a publication accepting both highquality peer-reviewed original research and review articles (both solicited and unsolicited) [2] . Second, the Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia became a transformative journal, offering the possibility for authors to publish Open Access. Furthermore, to connect with the next generation of mammary gland biologists and to support its trainees, Prof. Hovey initiated a Facebook page to promote the contents of the Journal and the greater research community (https:// www. faceb ook. com/ mamma rygla ndbio logis ts). The Journal also now has an annual student award for the best manuscript which, like a second parity, encourages a highly-productive and efficient next generation of mammary gland biologists.",

For starters, the global dairy industry relies on dairy animals to provide milk for a diversity of foodstuffs for human nutrition, which are preserved and processed for consumption across the planet. At the same time, the livestock sectors rely on the mammary glands to raise the next generation -whether that be piglets, lambs, calves, or foals, of which billions are born each year. And lastly, milk as a foodstuff has undergone a renaissance in recent years, not only through efforts to increase the uptake of breastfeeding worldwide, but also to capture a range of bioactive molecules from unique or abundant milks, and to use these to benefit infant human nutrition.",

The livestock sector has been successfully applying scientific knowledge, such as selective breeding, improved nutrition, and better management of animal physiology and regulation of mammary gland function to make dairy animals far more efficient in producing milk than ever before. Looking forward, the landscape also presents tremendous opportunity for a real impact from genetic engineering with the advent of widespread genome editing technologies that have been integrated into a range of species. \"Low-carbon livestock\" can help produce enough food to eliminate hunger and malnourishment while minimizing the overall output of greenhouse gases [5] . Likewise efforts are underway in a number of venues to synthesize all the components of milk without the animal [6] . What remains to be seen -with all questions remaining with the consumer -is how public acceptance steers the uptake of all these technologies.",

Like all species, wildlife must consume the nutrients they need to produce milk, yet they face growing challenges to cover sufficient distances to access sufficient nutrients, alongside limited access to adequate water. Species also face greater thermal stress which changes the dynamics of metabolic state in support of lactation. And, to top it all off, the environment is increasingly contaminated by various chemicals that can appear in milk, which can have potentially long-lasting effects not only on infant performance but also cancer risk.",

Development of precision (mechanism-based) and personalized (patientsuited) therapies has raised the hope for more efficacious and less toxic treatments. Efforts in this area have increasingly employed patient-derived xenograft models and patientderived organoid techniques [6, 9, 10] . Advances in singlecell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics open new avenues to deep-dive into the heterogeneity of breast tumors and its implications for therapeutic approaches. Major developments also lie at the front of cancer immunotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, approved in 2017 by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy to improve the survival rates of patients with solid tumors, which do not respond to traditional targeted therapies, such as triple negative breast cancer.

Once again, this pandemic has shown us how capable, problemsolving and flexible humans are in the midst of a crisis. Despite the many challenges associated with mandatory work from home due to closed universities, institutions and laboratories, scientists and students made use of the time to finish data analysis or to write articles, all while overcoming the challenges of online classes and meetings. They even managed to organize international conferences online, including, among others, two conferences, on which we bring reports in this issue; the Twelfth Annual ENBDC Workshop: Methods in Mammary Gland Biology and Breast Cancer [11] and the First Buenos Aires Breast Cancer Symposium [12] .
