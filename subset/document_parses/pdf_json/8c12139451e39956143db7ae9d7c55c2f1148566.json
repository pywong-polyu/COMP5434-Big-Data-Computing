            "text": "The cohort of the study included consecutive patients with HMs treated with ASCT at our Department of Hematology who had received anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Information was collected regarding patient demographics, HM characteristics, last HM treatment, ASCT, previous Covid-19. Post-vaccination cases of Covid-19 were detected through regular follow-up. We evaluated antibody and T-cell responses four weeks after the completion of the vaccination regimen. To test humoral immunity, we used the DiaSorin's Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test. All results were expressed as WHO international standard unit BAU/ml. A cutoff of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG antibodies (Abs) >33.8 BAU/ml was considered as a positive test result. Cell-mediated immunity was tested in all seronegative patients and in an equal number of randomly selected seropositive patients (50% with high Ab titer and 50% with low Ab titer). The anti-spike T-cell-mediated immune response was tested by multicolor fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and enzymelinked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay. Detailed methods are described in Supplemental Information. Univariate logistic regression model was used to assess the association between negative serology testing and baseline characteristics such as age, sex, HM type, HM status, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), status of therapy, and type of last therapy. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The parameters with \u03b1 = 0.10 were tested in a multivariate logistic regression with stepwise selection to assess the independent risk factors for vaccination failure. Antibody titer was summarized using geometric mean concentration (GMC) together with 95% CI. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between pre-vaccination ALC and GMC. To explore differences between GMC and type of last therapy we applied the ANOVA model. Regarding cell-mediated immunity, we used an unpaired two-tailed t-test to compare FACS results between the seronegative and seropositive groups. All other statistics were descriptive. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 9.4, Cary, NC, USA.",

In our study, patients who underwent ASCT as last treatment largely seroconverted, even when vaccinated within 3 months from ASCT. On the other hand, the study showed a significant association between ongoing HM treatment and lower rate of post-vaccination seroconversion. Immunotherapy was associated with the highest risk of seroconversion failure. Furthermore, even in those who mounted a humoral response, immunotherapy appeared to negatively influence its magnitude. As evidence for this, the only patient who developed post-vaccination Covid-19 was on active Dara-RD treatment. These results are consistent with those reported by Maneikis et al. [12] .",
