            "text": "Lower perceived control (PC) is related to maladaptive psychological responses to stressful events, yet it is unclear whether longer-term situations are associated with PC change over time. This study examined PC change during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and whether trajectories varied by age and personality. Personality was assessed in 2455 U.S. adults (18-100 years) from an online study conducted January-February 2020. PC was assessed across three follow-ups (March-July 2020). Latent growth curves modeled PC change. In controlled models, PC decreased (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.107, p = .005). Older adults had higher PC than younger adults (\u03b2 = 0.012, p = .001), and experienced less PC decline (\u03b2 = 0.012, p < .001). All personality traits but Openness were related to PC at baseline (\u03b2s ranged from \u2212 0.912 to 0.543, ps < .001). Conscientiousness (\u03b2 = 0.155, p = .002), Extraversion (\u03b2 = 0.128, p = .008), and Agreeableness (\u03b2 = 0.099, p = .044) were associated with less PC decline. Employment (\u03b2 = 0.160, p = .022), health (\u03b2 = 0.133, p = .002), and disease burden (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.056, p = .014) were also associated with PC change. These results were largely driven by the financial dimension of PC. This study provides evidence for PC change during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies sociodemographic, personality, and health moderators of PC trajectory.",

During such unpredictable circumstances, a strong sense of perceived control (PC) over one's life is important for adaptive stress response and management (Ripp\u00e9 et al., 2021) . PC-the amount of control people believe they have over external events or outcomes-takes into account personal factors that affect situational demands (e.g., cognitive appraisal, coping) and self-regulation (e.g., emotion and motivation; Rotter, 1966) . Although PC is a valuable internal resource and indicator of resilient (or susceptible) psychological states during stress (Yeo & Yap, 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) , it is also malleable over time and reactive to stressful events, including infectious disease outbreaks (Phillips et al., 2021) . Stressful situations may erode PC (Skinner, 2016) , particularly situations that are unpredictable and unprecedented, like the coronavirus pandemic.",

Taylor, 1983) and health protective and infection management behaviors during the H1N1 pandemic (Karademas et al., 2013) . During the coronavirus pandemic, higher PC helped mitigate the effect of lockdowns on mental health , whereas lower PC among health care workers was associated with more fear and distress (Marton et al., 2020) . Even during nonstressful times, higher PC is associated with better physical health and lower mortality (Lachman & Agrigoroaei, 2010; Turiano et al., 2014) , perhaps due to healthier behavioral, motivational, and cognitive responses to stress (Skinner, 2016; Volk et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "It is important to identify psychological factors that support PC during stressful situations. In particular, the five-factor model (FFM; Costa & McCrae, 1992) of personality has been associated previously with both average levels of PC (Kaiseler et al., 2012) and PC change over time (Kandler et al., 2015; Toyama et al., 2022) . The FFM operationalizes enduring pattern of actions, behaviors, and thoughts along five dimensions: Neuroticism (e.g., anxious, self-conscious, impulsive, vulnerable), Extraversion (e.g., warm, gregarious, assertive), Openness (e.g., fantasy, aesthetics, feelings), Agreeableness (e.g., trusting, straightforward, compliant) , and Conscientiousness (e.g., competent, orderly, achievement-oriented). Two traits in particular-Neuroticism and Conscientiousness-are associated with psychological and behavioral responses to stressful events Sutin et al., 2020) and inform stress-minimizing strategies (Kaiseler et al., 2012) . And, indeed, higher Neuroticism and lower Conscientiousness are associated with lower PC (Caci et al., 2020; Kaiseler et al., 2012; Kandler et al., 2015) , and Conscientiousness in particular is related to less declines in PC over time (Kandler et al., 2015; Toyama et al., 2022) . Theoretical models of Neuroticism highlight vulnerability to stress as a key trait component (Costa & McCrae, 1992) , empirically expressed as perceiving less control over one's current circumstances (Kaiseler et al., 2012) . Theoretical models of Conscientiousness, in contrast, highlight competence as a core component of this trait (Costa & McCrae, 1992) , empirically expressed as greater feelings of control (Toyama et al., 2022) ; in this way, personality may affect PC via appraisal and coping processes (Kaiseler et al., 2012) . During the pandemic, higher Neuroticism and lower Conscientiousness, Openness, and Agreeableness have been associated with lower PC measured crosssectionally (Bogg & Milad, 2020) . The present study extends this literature by examining change in PC and how personality associates with this trajectory.",

Only the hypothesized association between Neuroticism and greater declines in PC was not supported. This study thus suggests that PC was reactive to the pandemic, and that personality was one psychological factor associated with its trajectory. Effect sizes were generally small (median d = 0.16) and goodness-of-fit for PC was adequate in the controlled models, suggesting that these findings were sufficiently powered but may reflect lower sensitivity to detect slope variance in PC. Overall, the effect sizes were modest for PC change and for associations between personality and PC change.",

This decline makes sense given the unpredictability of COVID-19, especially at the beginning of the pandemic when it was less understood. Somewhat surprising was that the decline was significant for finance and not the other two PC domains, which includes health. Adults may have experienced more economic difficulties during the early months of the pandemic (e.g., job loss), resulting in declines in financial PC. This slope, however, was only significant when covariates were in the model, which is most likely due to the inclusion of age because there tends to be age differences in PC (Infurna & Okun, 2015) . The age range in this study spanned all of adulthood, and, given the known age differences in PC (Villarreal & Heckhausen, 2016) , age likely contributed to the shift in significance between models 1 and 2. The exploratory age interactions further suggests PC declined less among older adults; this complements previous report of higher PC among older adults during normal (Infurna & Okun, 2015; Villarreal & Heckhausen, 2016) and COVID-19-contexts (Bogg & Milad, 2020; Caci et al., 2020) COVID-19. Older adults may have more stable relationships, housing, and working situations that were less susceptible to pandemic-related disruptions. Such stability may have better supported their feelings of control. Younger adults reported more stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the pandemic (Rossi et al., 2020; Yeo & Yap, 2020) , suggesting they may be more susceptible to psychological distress during low-control situations. The steepest decline was found for financial PC, which may have contributed to the age difference.",

We found partial support for hypothesis 2: Higher Neuroticism was associated with lower PC (expected) but was unrelated to PC over time (unexpected) . This result somewhat contradicts findings by Kandler et al. (2015) , who reported cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations between Neuroticism and PC. However, the directionality of the effects in the pre-pandemic study is less clear and the results do not consider uncontrollable events like pandemics. Neuroticism may be closely associated (but does not necessarily predict) PC change over time, or perhaps these trajectories should be observed over longer periods. Regression to the mean might have also attenuated any effect of the pandemic. Since PC is informed and updated by learned experiences, adults with higher Neuroticism may already experience higher stress arousal and anticipate less control over their environment. Thus, for individuals high in Neuroticism, PC may have started and remained low across the pandemic.",

The association between Conscientiousness and the intercept replicates previous cross-sectional associations reported during the pandemic (Bogg & Milad, 2020) . It also extends these findings to show that Conscientiousness helps support maintaining PC over time, which is consistent with the positive association between Conscientiousness and PC change in longitudinal studies prior to COVID-19 (Kaiseler et al., 2012; Toyama et al., 2022) . Adults higher in Conscientiousness tend to engage in behavioral and psychological strategies that minimize stress Kaiseler et al., 2012 ) and thus may have been able to better adapt to the unforeseen impediments caused by COVID-19. Higher, sustained PC-even in uncontrollable situations-may be one pathway by which Conscientiousness contributes to better longterm outcomes. Our findings are consistent with theoretical models that implicate higher Conscientiousness and PC with qualities that protect against psychological distress during stressful events (Infurna & Okun, 2015; Villarreal & Heckhausen, 2016) .",

There are, however, some limitations: First, attrition occurred between waves 1-4, which may have affected sample distribution. Second, although the online-based approach was more feasible than an in-person approach and allowed us to reach more participants across the country, it does not represent the broader population (e.g., adults with lower digital literacy). Third, our PC measure was brief and domain-specific; a longer scale may provide more nuanced explanations of PC change. Future research would also benefit from additional timepoints to monitor PC over longer intervals. Finally, analyses were focused on personality and did not include additional variables accounting for PC change-like perceived stress or home environment (Brown et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) . Although we incorporated exploratory covariates to represent additional contexts, other sociodemographic markers of advantage and disadvantage might also affect PC. Replication is necessary to confirm our observations. While our study used longitudinal data beyond the early pandemic, no further data collection took place after July 2020. Hence, it is unclear whether PC changes occurred beyond this point. The data were also limited to the U.S., and the pattern may vary across cultures.",
