We investigated the psychological effects of this measure among Saudi families in the Jazan province to assess its impact on children during this period. Methods: This study was a cross-section investigation conducted in the Jazan province that is located in the southwest part of the country. Data collection was conducted during May 2020 during the country-wise curfew in Saudi Arabia and targeted parents living in Jazan with a minimum of one child above the age of 5 years using a self-administered web-based questionnaire. Results: In total, 408 valid questionnaires were collected. About 50.5% (n = 206) of the parents reported their children as having abnormal psychological observation at the time of their social isolation, which is significantly associated with living status, the number of children (especially when the family has fewer than two children <5 years old), and if any relatives or friends got COVID-19 or quarantined. The psychological effects ranged from anxiety, sleeping disturbance, fear of death, feeling frustrated or bored and violence. Conclusion: Our findings, although limited to observations of parents concerning their children, suggest that social isolation could be a possible risk factor for the development of more serious psychological ramifications in the future such as depression and anxiety.",

            "text": "In January 2020, the World health organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a global pandemic. [1] This announcement was followed by the application of preventive measures in several countries, among which social distancing was one of the main applied preventive measures. [2] Social distancing included measures related to the closure of schools and public commercial and governmental establishments where this closure impacted the overall lifestyle of adults and children. The government of Saudi Arabia announced strict policies for social isolation and suspension of most workplaces opening such as schools, college, sports, and religious gatherings. [3] Additionally, Saudi Arabia was one of the countries that applied a curfew in response to the pandemic by the last week of March 2020 where no one was allowed to be in public places without official permission. [4] As the curfew was lasted for more than 2 months, [5] it was expected that this prolonged and unprecedented curfew and closure of schools is likely to have a psychological impact on children. This notion is supported by several reports indicating that these preventive measures are likely to have a harmful influence on children's and adolescents' mental health and may lead to domestic violence. [6] [7] [8] Unlike other American or European communities, families in Saudi Arabia are relatively large, and children are socially close to their extended family members and senior relatives. This curfew has impacted the cultural norms related to the gatherings of large families and relatives in multiple events such as the Holy Month of Ramadan and the yearly celebrated Eid-Al-Fitr. Therefore, it can be postulated that these strict social distancing measures can be very challenging to Saudi families, including their children. In this study, we aimed to explore the psychological observations of the parents on their children during the COVID-19 pandemic social distancing in the Jazan province in the southwest of Saudi Arabia. Assessment of psychological observations of children is relevant to the practice of family physicians and primary healthcare physicians, given their roles in the initial assessment and management of psychological conditions before referral to specialized psychiatric clinics.",

The developed questionnaire was self-administered and composed of multiple-choice questions designed to measure family demographics such as subjects' age, sex, social status, marital status, educational level, occupation, living status, family income, and presence of psychological observations during the curfew. Variables that measure these psychological observations were: if the parents noticed at least one of the following changes: sleeping difficulty, fear of hearing the name of coronavirus, repeating the fear expression of death, not wanting to eat, feeling frustrated or bored, violence against self or others, involuntary urination or defecation, or demonstrate some symptoms of disease in its absence.",

Our investigation was able to detect a potential influence of residence location on observing psychological observations where living nearby a hospital can be associated with the development of psychological issues in comparison to those who are living in villages far from hospitals. The evidence concerning the influence of living nearby hospitals on the development of psychological issues in children is lacking and can be an area for further investigation. The strongest factor that was associated with observing psychological issues on children detected in our investigation was having a relative affected with the disease or being subjected to isolation. This finding was similar to another similar investigation conducted in Bangladesh involving 384 parents, where having a relative affected with COVID-19 was associated with the presence of mental health disturbances among children. [11] Limitations Our investigation had limitations related to the nature of the data collection process conducted during the curfew and based on a web-based survey.
