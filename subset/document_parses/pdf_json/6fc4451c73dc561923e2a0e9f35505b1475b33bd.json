Extensions of classical fuzzy set theory, intuitionistic fuzzy sets [3] and interval-valued fuzzy sets [22, 25] are very useful in dealing with imprecision and uncertainty (cf. [5] for more details). In this setting, different proposals for comparability relations between interval-valued fuzzy sets have been proposed (e.g. [23, 30] ). However, the motivation of the present paper is to propose a new methods to comparability between interval-valued fuzzy sets (and their special type which are interval-valued fuzzy cardinal numbers) taking into account the widths of the intervals. We assume that the precise membership degree of an element in a given set is a number included in the membership interval. For such interpretation, the width of the membership interval of an element reflects the lack of precise membership degree of that element. Hence, the fact that two elements have the same membership intervals does not necessarily mean that their corresponding membership values are the same. This is why we have taken into account the importance of the notion of width of intervals while proposing new algorithms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 132, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 203, "end": 206, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 238, "end": 242, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 243, "end": 246, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 312, "end": 315, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 460, "end": 464, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 465, "end": 468, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Additionally, these developments are made according to the standard partial order between intervals, but also with respect to admissible orders [6] , which are linear.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The paper is organized as follows.
