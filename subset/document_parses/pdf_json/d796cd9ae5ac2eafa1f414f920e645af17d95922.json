Here, we analyzed two 4-weeks periods during the Spring preparation by kayakers and canoeists (usually lasting from the beginning of February to the end of April). Our findings indicate that the German strategy for the containment of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (which allowed individual activities outdoors) reduced the overall time during which elite kayakers trained each week by \u223c25%, with an average of 15.4% decrease in the duration of each training session. Among our athletes, this reduction was probably related to changes in training due to the lockdown. The coaches immediately altered training schedules so that underage athletes did not train onwater alone, and all boat houses were closed in order to avoid group gatherings, which meant that some athletes had no access to their boats at the beginning of the lockdown. At this point in the season, a reduction in overall training time is unusual. Nonetheless, it is clear that our German kayakers and canoeists did not reduce their training stimulus significantly during the initial period of lockdown, as suspected earlier (Sarto et al., 2020) , still averaging 693 \u00b1 158 min of training per week. It would be interesting to compare this result to the impact of stricter containment of Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., remaining indoors with no specific endurance training) enforced by certain other countries on the training of elite athletes. In contrast, other countries such as Sweden enforced less strict measures to contain Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and we might hypothesize that in these countries the seasonal preparation (besides international traveling) was not heavily influenced.",

Previous reports indicate that Olympic athletes sleep less (6.5-6.8 h) than the 8 h recommended daily (Leeder et al., 2012; Lastella et al., 2015) . There are a number of possible explanations as to why our athletes slept more during the lockdown: (i) they may have adopted less rigorous morning training schedules (Sargent et al., 2014; Gupta et al., 2017) ; (ii) the German containment strategy significantly reduced international travel obligations and opportunities; (iii) they engaged to a greater extent in home-schooling and -office; (iv) the stress and anxiety related to upcoming qualification events were no longer present (Erlacher et al., 2011; Juliff et al., 2015) , or (v) some athletes may have developed some forms of depression due to social distancing and lack of prospects.
