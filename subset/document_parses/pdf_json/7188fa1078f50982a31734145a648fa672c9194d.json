In this study, we designed an integrative in silico drug repurposing approach for rapid selection of potential candidates against SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (M pro ). To screen FDA-approved drugs, we implemented structure-based molecular modelling techniques, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling of drugs disposition and data mining analysis of drug-gene-COVID-19 association. Through presented approach, we selected the most promising FDA approved drugs for further COVID-19 drug development campaigns and analysed them in context of available experimental data. To the best of our knowledge, this is unique in silico study which integrates structure-based molecular modeling of M pro inhibitors with predictions of their tissue disposition, drug-gene-COVID-19 associations and prediction of pleiotropic effects of selected candidates.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory disease with rapidly progressive lung injury was detected in Wuhan, China and reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in December 2019. In January 2020 a novel \u03b2-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had been identified. In February 2020, WHO announced a name for the new coronavirus disease -COVID-19. As of January 15 th 2021 there is almost 94 million confirmed cases, more than 2.0 milion confirmed deaths in 196 countries, areas or territories, and this number is rapidly growing. [1] Recent research indicated that COVID-19 disease affects not only lung tissues, but also other organs such as brain, heart and kidneys, [2] [3] [4] implying that an efficient anti-COVID-19 agent should possess a tendency toward these target organs. Several months after the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus was published, the global race for development of novel vaccine has started. By the end of 2020, two vaccines become available for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 . [5, 6] Since there is an urgent need for novel anti-COVID-19 therapy, useful and quick approach would be to identify compounds, which show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, by repurposing the existing drugs. Drug repurposing approach implies identification of novel use for approved drugs which are different from their original medical indication. [7, 8] Many features of drug repurposing approach (reduced failure rates in early preclinical studies, demonstrated safety profiles of the rediscovered drugs and reduced costs) could accelerate drug development projects during pandemics. Findings observed from drug repurposing studies could also lead to developing innovative hypotheses for de novo design of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. [7, 8] Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been brought to the market, chemotherapeutic approaches still represent attractive strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2. [8] Numerous small molecule drug discovery projects and clinical trials are in progress. [9, 10] Clinical studies investigating efficacy and safety of the initially repurposed drugs (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir) reported conflicting results which justify further efforts in the field of drug repurposing. [11] [12] [13] [14] One of the most attractive protein targets in COVID-19 repurposing is SARS-CoV-2's main protease (M pro ). M pro is the key enzyme in viral life cycle involved in the most of the cleavage events on precursor polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). This three-domain (domains I to III) cysteine protease releases functional non-structural proteins with pivotal role in viral replication and transcription. The substrate binding site of M pro is located in cleft between domains I and II and consists of four subsites (S1', S1, S2, and S4). [15] Although M pro was identified as attractive target for antiviral drug design, recent analyses revealed binding site plasticity and potential of mutations to directly affect plasticity, as major bottlenecks in rational design of M pro inhibitors. Therefore, structure-based drug design campaigns aimed to identify novel M pro inhibitors could greatly benefit from introducing information on binding site plasticity. [16] [17] [18] Considering the emergency of the situation, many drug repurposing studies on M pro have been reported so far, including the high throughput screening (HTS) campaign from The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). [19] [20] [21] Interestingly, some authors reported structure-based in silico screening protocols with in vitro profiling of M pro inhibitors resulting in discovery of additional inhibitors previously unseen by HTS campaign. [22] [23] [24] [25] This adds up to the value of additional in silico evaluation in order to facilitate discovery of potential candidates.",

            "text": "Despite the direct effects on viral proteins, another important aspect of possible repurposable candidates represents evaluation of the effects drug might have on disease mechanism. Regarding the COVID-19 disease particular emphasis should be paid on amplified immune response and cytokine storm which could lead to severe complications. [26] In this manner, examination of drug-genedisease associations could provide insights into the additional/pleiotropic effects of the candidate drugs and further aid selection of candidates for clinical trials. [27, 28] Additionally, when considering potential anti-COVID-19 drug candidates, drug affinity to distribute within certain organs/ tissues should be considered as well. Namely, COVID-19 treatment would benefit from favorable drug distribution within target tissues such as the lungs, brain, heart and kidneys to enrich local drug concentration and combat the infection. However, data of drug distribution in various organs/tissues are rarely accessible, and they mostly originate from animal studies. In this context, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, coupled with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) predictions, can provide useful information on the expected drug absorption and disposition in humans. [29, 30] The most of the in silico M pro repurposing studies reported so far, rely solely on structure-based predictions of drugs binding to the viral protein [20] , neglecting evaluation of additional effects drug could have on mechanism of disease. Herein we present general integrative protocol of drug repurposing of M pro inhibitors which integrates in silico screening of the FDA-approved drugs library encompassing structure-based drug discovery techniques, data mining of drug-gene-COVID-19 associations and QSPR-PBPK modeling. For the initial screening of the database, we used different structure-based virtual screening approaches. This was followed by ensemble docking where structural plasticity of studied SARS-CoV-2 M pro was taken into account. Candidates selected as potential SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors were subjected to in silico data mining analysis in order to find drug-gene-COVID-19 associations, construct gene interaction network, single out the most important molecular pathways affected by the investigated drugs and analyze it in the context of potential pleiotropic effects. In order to assess the affinity of each drug to reach the target organs, selected drugs were modeled in terms of their absorption and disposition in humans using PBPK modeling based on QSPR estimated drugs biopharmaceutical properties. Obtained results were used to identify drug candidates with the likelihood of successful COVID-19 treatment.",

The whole body PBPK model include additional organs/tissues i. e., lung, spleen, liver, adipose, muscle, heart, brain, kidney, skin, reproductive organs, red bone marrow, yellow bone marrow, and rest-of-body, and the necessary individual tissue properties (e. g., mass, perfusion rate, fraction unbound in tissue (Fut), drugspecific tissue-to-plasma partition coefficients (Kp)) for the selected human representative are generated by the software. Once dissolved and absorbed, the drug reaches the portal vein and the liver (where it may undergo first pass and/or systemic extraction), and eventually enters into systemic circulation and distributes throughout the body, followed by potential metabolism in individual tissues and concomitant elimination. Each of these processes is described by adequate differential equation, and numerical integration of all the equations enables simulation of the complex interactions among the various processes a drug undergoes in the body.",

In addition, default software values for particle radius (25 \u03bcm), particle density (1.2 g/ml), mean precipitation time (900 s), and volume of liquid taken with orally administered drug (240 ml) were used as inputs. The simulations were performed for single drug dose administered to 70 kg human adult representative in the fasted state. For orally taken drugs, solubility and diffusion coefficient were adjusted to bile salt effect using the software estimate for theoretical solubilization ratio, [44] drug dissolution was modeled using the default Johnson dissolution equation, and software default Opt logD Model SA/V 6.1 was used to scale the differences in drug absorption along the gut. Human intrinsic clearance values were calculated from in silico estimates for the overall intrinsic drug clearance in human liver microsomes (HLM) (Supp .

In addition, a fraction of drug distributed into kidneys was assumed to undergo passive renal filtration expressed as the product of fraction unbound in plasma (fup) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

[15] Our analysis performed on aligned ensemble of available X-ray structures used in this study (PDB IDs: 5R7Y, 5RYZ, 5R80, 5R81, 5R82, 5R83 and 6LU7) revealed that shape and surface area of the binding site are mainly influenced by following residues: HIS-41, SER-46, MET-49, ASN-142, MET-165 and GLN-189 ( Figure 2B ). The most of these residues directly shape structure of subsites S2 and S4, which make these subsites largely affected across used ensemble of structures. While the shape of subsite S1 is not affected with prominent changes in structure of surface area, different orientations of sidechain of ASN-142 bear potential for affecting positioning of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors in putative ligands. Subsite S1' is the least affected subsite.",

All of the selected candidates for repurposing are presented in the Table 2 and Supp. Figure S1. Accounting for the plasticity of substrate binding site in the virtual screening protocol, we were able to recover several ligands with potential SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity identified previously through cell-based screening (dipyridamole, lopinavir, velpatasvir, daclatasvir, lapatinib, bazedoxifene, atazanavir) ( Table 2 ). [21, 24, [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] For some of the selected drugs clinical data for COVID-19 supports antiviral activity (salvianolic acid B, thymopentin, atorvastatin, montelukast, dipyridamole, lopinavir, ritonavir, telmisartan, daclatasavir, atazanavir, nintedanib, darunavir and ramipril). [10, [70] [71] [72] Few identified ligands were already confirmed through bioassays on inhibition of M pro activity (venetoclax, montelukast, dipyridamole, lopinavir, lomitapide, lapatinib, telaprevir, atazanavir, pimozide, darunavir, eltrombopag) ( Table 2) .

We have further analyzed occurrence of interactions of selected substructures and identified that fragment representatives of clusters ID1 and ID2 interacts mostly with subsites S1 and S4 (Table 1 ). This finding is in agreement with the latest results from ongoing public fragment-based drug design (FBDD) campaign at XChem facility of UK's Diamond Light Source. [63, 74] Namely, low micromolar ligands (X2646 and X2581) identified through FBDD campaign share similar substructure (arylmethyl carbonylamino group) to represen-tative drugs from ID1 and ID2 cluster. Chemical probes from FBDD campaign as well as virtually clustered compounds interact with M pro in similar manner ( Figure 4A and 4B), primarily affecting S1 and S4 subsites. Additionally, some of the drugs grouped in different clusters, also share abovementioned structural features (e. g. repaglinide from cluster ID4; pimozide from ID3; all representatives of cluster ID5 share similar substructure locked inside flavan moiety). According to our results, moieties capable of interacting through van der Waals interactions with MET-49 in S2 subsite (S2-interacting fragment) should have central role in rational drug design. Innovative drug design on COVID-19 M pro inhibitors should be guided by introducing diverse Figure 2 -Residues MET165 and ASN142 border S1 subsite, MET165 and GLN189 border S4 subsite, S2 subsite is located in close proximity of MET49, while S1' subsite in this representation encompass resides right from ASN142.",

The predicted results referring to the ratio of drug exposure in plasma and target organs (expressed as AUC ratio) are presented in Table 2 and Supp. Figure S1 , whereas AUC ratio smaller than 1 indicates predominant drug distribution in target organ, AUC close to 1 indicates similar drug distribution in plasma and target organ, and AUC much higher than 1 negligible drug distribution in the organ of interest. According to the simulation results, pralmorelin, revefenacin, mitoxantrone, vilanterol, nintedanib, are expected to [72] distribute widely into human lungs, with mitoxantrone having the highest potential to reach high drug concentrations in lung tissues. More than a half of selected compounds (60 %) show a tendency to distribute and/or accumulate more widely into other organs/tissues. However, a dozen of selected candidates (e. g. Salvianolic acid B), remain primarily distributed in the circulatory system available to interact with the infected immune cells. [75] Some of the studied drugs show limited oral absorption [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] due to poor biopharmaceutical or pharmacokinetic properties. This means that alternative dosing routes or higher doses may be considered for future studies, in order to provide appropriate drug concentrations in target tissues. Predicted data regarding the distribution of selected drugs within certain organs/tissues are in agreement with available literature data e. g., published results indicate that dipyridamole is widely distributed into kidneys, heart and lungs [82] , while telmisartan and ritonavir show high partitioning into kidneys and lungs. [78, 80] These data support the value of in silico simulation results, and indicate that the predicted data may be useful in decisionmaking for suitable candidate compounds.",

The results revealed that the majority of the genes (70.84 %) were in co-expression -purple lines, which means that their expression levels are similar under the defined conditions in the gene expression study. 10.07 % of these genes were in co-localisation (blue lines), which means that they are expressed in the same tissue or their gene products are identified in the same cellular location, while 8.93 % where in physical interactions (red lines), which means that there is an interaction between the protein products of these genes.

Among them, IL-10 signalling could be viewed as particularly important, especially for the hub genes. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, produced by T helper 2 lymphocytes (Th2), and found to be increased in severe COVID-19 cases, along with IL-6, encoded by the top hub gene in our study, IL6. [86] The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway (JAK-STAT signalling pathway) was also found among the top 10 pathways connected with our set of genes, which is significant because this pathway plays critical roles in orchestrating of immune system, especially cytokine receptors. [87] As seen in the Supp. Table S3 , some of the candidate drugs were found to inhibit the expression or secretion of several inflammatory-connected molecules. For example, Naringin inhibited the expression of IL6 protein and IL1B activity. Salvianoic acid B inhibited protein expression of CRP, one of the main biomarkers of inflammation, while Atorvastatin inhibited not only protein expression of CRP, but also CXCL10, CXCL8 and IL6. Thus, our data mining of drug-gene-disease associations has shown that, apart from potentially acting as SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors, some of the selected drugs might have other potential pleiotropic effects. Taking into account that they were found to affect the cytokine signalling pathways and systemic inflammation, and inhibit inflammatory protein secretion and expression, they might also mitigate the severity of the clinical picture in pneumonia known to occur in the severe cases of COVID-19.

Predicted poses of all of the promising candidates were in agreement with experimental observations, as discussed above. Selected candidate drugs were found to affect cytokine signaling pathways important in systemic inflammation which could indicate their potential pleiotropic effects (Figures 5 and 6 ). However, additional analysis of currently available data on binary drug-gene interactions (Supp . Table S3 ) revealed that lopinavir, atazanavir and ritonavir could even aggravate cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 which should be considered as caveats in their future chemotherapeutic evaluation. Among the selected drugs with identified pleiotropic effects, atorvastatin, naturally occurring polyphenols (salvianolic acid B and naringin), bortezomib and ramipril show lower tendency to distribute in tissues of interest (Table 2) . However, alternative dosing routes or higher doses should be considered for future studies. Overall, the validity of integrated repurposing approach is supported by referred experimental data and clinical trials ( Table 2 ) and lays the foundations for future in silico antiviral drug repurposing studies.

Biological, clinical and structural data on COVID-19 and M pro reported so far were in agreement with obtained results, which validate used structure-based approaches as a practical tool for future screening of larger databases. Selected candidates were further analyzed in terms of their chemical nature and different patterns in M pro -ligand intermolecular interactions, which gave us detailed understandings in chemical space of interest for future anti-COVID-19 drug discovery protocols. In addition to structure-based modelling, QSPR-PBPK approach elicited the drugs with favorable disposition properties, but also indicated the key factors that may limit their systemic and tissue exposure. Complementary, data mining of drug-gene-COVID-19 association singled out candidates which modulate pro-inflammatory genes expression related to COVID-19 disease. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested potential pleiotropic effects of selected candidates that could modify severity of COVID-19 disease. Overall, we demonstrated that repurposing studies should not be based only on structure-based modeling; future chemotherapeutic repurposing studies should be evaluated in terms of drug-gene-disease considerations. Last but not least, adequate tissue distribution is of great importance to be examined for the virus infected tissues.",
