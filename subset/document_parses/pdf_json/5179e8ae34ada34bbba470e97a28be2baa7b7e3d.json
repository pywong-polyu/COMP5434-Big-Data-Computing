            "text": "Between 1966 and 1974, France conducted 41 atmospheric nuclear weapon tests in Polynesia. Radioactive fallout impacted downwind atolls and islands leading to the external and internal exposure of the local populations to ionizing radiation. By law, individuals who were exposed to radiation in the context of these tests can file compensation claims with the French government if they develop certain radiogenic cancers. A claimant who meets the basic eligibility criteria (place, time, and type of disease) automatically benefits from the presumption of a causal link between radiation exposure and the development of their illness, unless the exposure is deemed too low. Since 2017, an effective dose threshold of 1 mSv per year has been used in the claims adjudication process. Decisions as to whether claimants have met this 1 mSv threshold in a given year are often made on the basis of data from government dose reconstruction studies carried out in 2005 and 2006. Using new information available from recently declassified documents on the radiological impact of French atmospheric nuclear tests in Polynesia, as well as atmospheric transport modeling of radioactive fallout, this article shows that maximum doses to the public for key atmospheric tests may have been underestimated by factors of 2 to 10 and estimates that the total population exposed above the compensation threshold of 1 mSv/yr could be greater than ~110,000. This latter result corresponds to about 90% of the entire population of French Polynesia at the time of the atmospheric tests. Integrating these updated dose estimates into the claim adjudication process would enlarge the pool of eligible claimants by a factor of 10. Also discussed are the legal and policy implications of these findings.",

            "text": "Between 1966 and 1974, France conducted 41 nuclear tests on the Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls in French Polynesia. A combined yield of 10.1 Mt of TNT equivalent was detonated at or above ground level between July of 1966 and September of 1974 (see supplementary table S1). In several cases, tests produced significant radioactive fallout on communities downwind, including on the Gambier archipelago, the atoll of Tureia, and Tahiti, the most populated island of Polynesia. 1,2 Exposure to radioactive fallout from nuclear tests can lead to adverse health effects, including increased risks of developing radiation-induced cancers. 3,4,5 Compensation regimes are one way for victims of atomic testing to seek redress for health problems that may be related to their exposure to such fallout. 6 In January 2010, the French government created a single unified compensation mechanism for victims under the \"Law regarding the recognition and compensation of victims of French nuclear testing,\" colloquially known as the \"Loi Morin.\" 7 The Law established a committee, the Comit\u00e9 d'Indemnisation des Victimes des Essais Nucl\u00e9aires (CIVEN), for processing claims from veterans, former workers at the test sites, and members of the public. 8 The Loi Morin stipulates that individuals suffering from a designated list of 23 (originally 21) potentially radiationinduced cancers who lived or sojourned in specific geographic areas where France conducted nuclear tests in Algeria and French Polynesia during the period of testing should benefit from a presumption of causality between the tests and their illness. The original version of the law stated that this presumption of causality should be upheld unless CIVEN considers the probability of such a causal link to be \"negligible\" due to the nature of their disease and the level of exposure. 9",

            "text": "Between 2010 and 2017, the French Ministry of Defense and CIVEN received a total of 1039 applications and awarded compensation in only 31 cases -an overall rejection rate of 97%. 10 In light of these statistics, the French legislature amended the Loi Morin through the \"Loi EROM\" to eliminate the \"negligible risk\" exception in February 2017. 11 Shortly thereafter, in June 2017, the French Conseil d'Etat, France's highest court for matters of public administration, issued an opinion stating that the presumption of causality could only be overturned if the pathology in question resulted exclusively from a cause other than ionizing radiation, or if the claimant was not exposed to any amount of ionizing radiation. 12 This decision effectively mandated the compensation of all applicants meeting the Loi Morin's basic eligibility criteria-that is, all persons suffering from one of the enumerated cancers who were present in French Polynesia during the period of nuclear testing. The 2017 Loi EROM tasked a parliamentary commission with developing a new methodology designed to limit compensation to \"only those cancer cases which were caused by French nuclear tests.\" 13 Based on the commission's recommendations, CIVEN replaced the original \"negligible risk\" exception with an annual effective dose threshold requirement of 1 mSv in one year -the maximum annual level of ionizing radiation exposure set for the general public under the French Public Health Code. 14 Notably, this 1 mSv/yr threshold drew upon the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), which sets out acceptable bands of radiation exposure based on the level of individual and societal benefit associated with such exposures. The ICRP recommends a ceiling of 1 mSv/year in cases in which exposed individuals do not directly benefit from exposure to radiation, but in which such exposures \"may be of benefit to society\" 15 -a difficult case to make for exposure to nuclear weapon fallout. In June 2020, the French legislature extended this 1 mSv/year threshold retroactively, through an amendment to the COVID-19 health care crisis law, to govern the adjudication of all compensation applications. 16 In its most recent paper on its compensation mechanism, CIVEN claims that both the 2006 CEA/DAM data and the methodology through which they were obtained were \"validated\" by international experts commissioned by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 18 However, the 2009 IAEA report referred to by CIVEN made it clear that its review could not and did not assess the validity of any data or computations used to produce the retrospective dose estimates. Its authors simply assumed all data and computation were correct and only provided qualitative assessments of the dose reconstruction methodology. 19 Thus, more than ten years after the Loi Morin was enacted, an independent assessment of the dose tables used in adjudicating claims has still not been conducted.",

Bourges identified five test events for which consequences on inhabited locations were the most significant. 21 These were: the Aldebaran (7/2/1966) and Phoebe (8/8/1971) tests on the Gambier Islands; the Acturus (7/2/1967) and Encelade (6/12/1971) tests on the Tureia atoll; and the Centaure (7/17/1974) test on Tahiti, the most populated island of French Polynesia (See Table S1 for a list of all French atmospheric tests in the Pacific). For each test, effective doses (stochastic health risk to the whole body) from external exposure (sum of groundshine and cloudshine), inhalation, and ingestion were computed from historical measurements (See Table S2 ). The measurements included activity in the air, on the ground, dose rates, as well as contamination of water, milk and other foodstuffs, that were presented as \"annual maximum exposure.\" No detail about the calculations or references to source documents from which measurement data were derived was shared by the author at the time.",

The report is predicated on \"the analysis of existing documents to extract the most representative information on the subject from 1966 to this day [2006] ,\" and includes the results of new dose reconstruction studies from key atmospheric tests on the populations of the Gambier, Tureia, and Tahiti islands. The doses (reproduced in Table 1 ) include those published in 1997 (with a few additional tests), and new effective and thyroid dose estimates produced by the Military Application Directorate of the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA/DAM) in 2005 and 2006. Unfortunately, the report does not include or cite primary source material or the detail of dose computations, complicating the task of reviewing the dose estimates presented. Without access to original historical data and documents, the IAEA-commissioned experts concluded that actual population exposures could have been even lower than the official French government estimates. 32 In particular, the reviewers believed dose estimates were based on \"the highest measurement results and relatively conservative assumptions.\" 33 Yet, they also noted that uncertainties about dose estimates were particularly important and that it was impossible to quantify them, because of \"the absence of direct measurements of specific nuclides in all media, for all tests and all sites.\" 34 Despite the reviewers' admission that their study had serious limitations, official CIVEN documents currently state that for the period of atmospheric testing, doses for the public are available in \" ",

The test involved an experimental thermonuclear device consisting of a plutonium core surrounded by a thick shell of lithium deuteride. 51 While no significant fusion reaction took place, the device generated a 125 kT yield. The test lead to significant contamination at Fangataufa, which required a major clean up by military personnel. 52 After the explosion, the radioactive cloud head travelled eastwards over the uninhabited Acteon islands. Parts of the cloud stem, however, travelled northwards and landed on Mururoa and Tureia, a feature which our simulation reproduced (see figure 3 ). Both Tureia and the nearby Gambier islands also experienced radioactive rains two days after the test. Second, assumptions about the ratios of activities between rain contamination and collected rainwater underestimate maximum doses. Tureia had two kinds of rainwater collection systems: a shared communal cistern and individual household cisterns. For the Encelade test, the latter were contaminated up to ~7.4 times more than the communal cistern. 55 The ratios used for the RIGEL reconstruction, however, are based on measurements from two different type of cisterns (communal for Arcturus, and household for Encelade) that have different collection surfaces and capacities, leading to different dilution factors of the contaminated rain. In the case of Arcturus, no data is publicly available for the family cisterns. 56 This does not mean that they were not contaminated with higher levels of fission products. Taking this possibility into account raises the maximum effective and thyroid doses for the local population by at least a factor of ~7.",

Meanwhile the winds had shifted towards the west. 61 Our reconstruction of the cloud trajectory shows it travelling directly from Moruroa to Tahiti in a straight line (see figure 4 and the video in supplemental materials).

With regards to internal contamination, the CEA acknowledges the limited contamination data for foodstuffs, including the absence of radioactivity measurements for vegetables from the Papeete market in July 1974 (CEA 2006, p.22). As a proxy, activities for the Papeete/Pirae region were taken from the Paea market, which had the lowest contamination values on the Island (p. 31).

Using the latter values raises the maximum effective and thyroid doses from vegetable consumptions by a factor of 2.73 for Papeete.

The legal implications of this study are likely more numerically significant when considering future first-time claims, in light of our finding that virtually anyone residing on Tahiti in the summer of 1974 may well have been exposed to greater than 1 mSv of ionizing radiation after the Centaure test. In this study, we reviewed and reevaluated population-exposure estimates for six French atmospheric tests in light of publicly available data and recently declassified French government documents. Between 1966 and 1974, France conducted a full 41 above-ground tests. Our results are therefore far from comprehensive. They illustrate, however, some of the broader pitfalls of basing compensation decisions on dose reconstruction studies that are at best incomplete and uncertain, and at worst systematically under-representative of levels of external and internal radiation exposures.",

Per our above analyses, given that 110,000 individuals may have been exposed to 1mSv or more of ionizing radiation in the Society Islands in 1974, this pure presumption of causality would not dramatically enlarge the pool of eligible individuals and would provide for more equitable compensation in the absence of comprehensive exposure data over all islands at all times.",

The cloud particle sizes were assumed to be log-normally distributed with parameters (d=73.6\u00b5m, s=1.51) for barge tests and (d=0.15, s=2.5) for balloon tests. Particles were equally distributed in 100 diameter bins of equal activity (according to the 2.5 and 3 rd moment respectively) and summed to a unit release. Particle density was kept constant over time and was assumed to range from 1.30-2.16 to 4.8 g/cm 3 for barge and balloon tests respectively. The particle density for the CENTAURE test was obtained from a granulometric measurement of particles collected at the Tahiti Mahina radiological measurement station. 87 Hysplit calculations were run on a 12-core linux machine with MPI and involved the release of 3,000,000 3D particles each. Output data include particle air concentration between 0 and 500m and ground deposition. Air and ground activity were then computed assuming no fractionation of fission products using the con2rem Hysplit routine. The source code of con2rem was modified to allow for the use of more than 500 nuclides in the source term and to account for the beginning of decay at the time of the explosion and not at the beginning of the simulation. Different source terms were used for activity concentration maps or dose rate contour calculations normalized at H+1 using uranium-235 and plutonium-239 ENDF8 fission product yields at 500keV and 14 MeV. 88 Decay of the source term was conducted at different time interval with Onix, an open source depletion code developed at Princeton University. 89 Activity to dose ratios were obtained from the US FGR12 and ICRP Publication 72. 90,91 A python routine was written to generate relevant con2rem activity input files.",
