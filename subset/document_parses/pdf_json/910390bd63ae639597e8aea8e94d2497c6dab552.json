Consecutive patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who received COVID-19 vaccines in our dermatologic outpatient clinic between June 2021 and October 2021 were enrolled for analysis. Therapeutic inclusion criteria include patients under biologics and patients under remission after discontinuation of biologics, currently with/without traditional systemic treatment. The types of COVID-19 vaccine were documented, either Moderna mRNA-1273 or AstraZeneca-Oxford AZD1222. All patients were tested for human leukocyte antigen-C (HLA-C) genotypes. The baseline Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) was defined as the most severe PASI before the initiation of current biological treatment, while the pre-vaccination PASI was defined as the PASI before receiving COVID-19 vaccines. Worsening of vaccinated patients was defined as (1) worsening of 50% PASI from a prior visit, which was based on an interval of 4-12 weeks depending on the biological agents, or (2) morphologic change, for example, chronic plaque-type to guttate, pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis, without other identifiable aggravating factors within 14 days of vaccination. Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) was assessed at each clinic visit by the same physician. Aggravation of unvaccinated patients was defined as worsening 50% PASI compared to baseline PASI or morphological change. Possible precipitating factors, including upper respiratory tract infection, excess ultraviolet light exposure, alterations of medications, and psychological stress, are inquired orally.",

Besides worsening of pre-existing psoriatic lesions, a de novo generalized pustular psoriasis following administration of the first dose of AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine was also reported (10) . Recently, Ricardo et al. reported de novo nail psoriasis triggered by Pfizer-BioNTech in a 76-year-old woman (13) . Previously, psoriasis following Streptococcal infections is commonly reported, but its association with HLA-Cw6 is controversial (14) . The relationship between genetic factors and vaccination in psoriasis aggravation has not been studied. However, widespread and unstable diseases were found in HLA-C positive patients (14) . Whether worsening after COVID-19 vaccination results from the complex interplay between HLA and unstable disease remains to be clarified. A new insight provided by our report is that all patients received genetic testing for HLA-C. The relatively low HLA-Cw6 positivity in Chinese patients has been reported, especially in high need patients (biologic users) with moderate to severe psoriasis in which HLA-Cw1 was thought to play a more significant role (15) . However, there was no significant association between a specific HLA-C allele and aggravation of disease activity after COVID-19 vaccination.",

We suggest that changing clinical morphology should be regarded as a sign of disease exacerbation after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. It is consistent with the definition of adverse events of trials of biologics for psoriasis. Three patients in our cohort developed guttate psoriasis even though all of them were diagnosed with chronic plaque-type psoriasis for more than a decade. More than hundreds of guttate lesions erupted four days after vaccination in one of the chronic plaque-type psoriasis patients.",

In consistence with previous reports, no specific type of vaccine was associated with a significantly higher rate of exacerbation (8) . In our cohort, there is one patient who showed exacerbation of psoriasis after both doses of COVID-19 vaccination. She is a 50-year-old woman receiving AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines, showing surges of PASI scores 8 and 11 days after the first and second injections, respectively. Under regular ixekizumab administration, the disease severity was later controlled. The HLA-C serotyping showed she has HLA-Cw1/Cw10. Psoriasis in four patients worsened after the first dose but not after the second. Three of them received AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, and one of them received Moderna vaccine. In addition to the possible triggering effect of COVID-19 vaccines, psoriasis severity may be altered by the effect of biologics, for example, time of initiation of the treatment course, duration of therapy, and the interval between COVID-19 vaccination and clinic visit. In our patients, two of them initiated guselkumab within 3 months before the first shot of COVID-19 vaccination. PASI response of patients receiving guselkumab increases with the duration of treatment (19) . Another patient shifted from guselkumab to risankizumab after exacerbation following the first dose of Moderna. Since exacerbation are defined by physicianassessed PASI scores, mild attacks may occur between clinic visits but are not documented.",

Most of the currently used COVID-19 vaccines are based on adenovirus as vector or mRNA; thus, the immunologic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine may be distinct from the influenza vaccine, which is mediated by Thelper (Th)1 and Th17 responses (7) . Previous studies reported an increase in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production by CD4+ T cells after AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine (20) . TNF-\u03b1 is well-known as a potent proinflammatory cytokine in psoriatic skin lesions (21) , whereas IFN-\u03b3 has been recognized as one of the pathogenic cytokines that can trigger inflammatory cascades of psoriasis with the potential to become a severity marker (22, 23) . The critical role of the Th17 subset of CD4+ T cells, possibly IL-6induced, in COVID-19 immunopathology and vaccine-induced immune enhancement was highlighted by recent studies (24) (25) (26) . Interwoven with Th17, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN may be the link between psoriasis exacerbation and COVID-19 vaccines, yet further investigations are required to unravel the immunologic reactions. Further investigations and large controlled studies are warranted to elucidate the relationship between psoriasis and COVID-19 vaccines.",

Although we only included psoriasis patients who aggravated in 2 weeks after vaccination to avoid recollection bias, this may result in over-estimation of the incidence of vaccine-induced psoriasis aggravation, based on the possibility that aggravation may urge the patients to seek medical attention before the scheduled visit. However, the proportion of patients with an unscheduled return to the clinic is low, at 6.3%.",
