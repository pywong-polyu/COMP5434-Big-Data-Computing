In this experimental pilot study, we aimed to boost middle schoolers' reading comprehension outcomes by providing schoolwide professional development (PD) on integrating reading comprehension practices within content instruction for English language arts, social studies, and science teachers. Six schools were matched into pairs and randomized to the schoolwide PD or a business-as-usual (BAU) condition. Content area teachers in schools assigned to the PD condition received distributed PD resources to support implementation, and coaching in one reading comprehension practice in the fall (i.e., get the gist) and one in the spring (i.e., asking and answering questions). Contrary to traditional PD, this PD was implemented across three content areas, was narrow in scope but long in duration (one practice per semester), focused on practices that could feasibly be integrated into content area instruction, and included ongoing coaching in content area teams. Students in schools assigned to the PD condition significantly outperformed those in the BaU condition on a measure of main idea generation (ES = 0.29) but not on measures of asking and answering questions (ES = 0.11) and general reading comprehension (ES = \u2212 0.09). Findings suggest promise for implementing schoolwide approaches embedded within content area instruction to improve reading comprehension performance for middle school students.",

The Institute of Education Sciences, through the Reading for Understanding Initiative, invested more than $100 million to improve knowledge about instructional practices associated with improved reading comprehension for students of all grade levels. The focus of the Reading for Understanding Initiative was to address three areas: (a) underlying processes that contribute to reading comprehension, (b) the development and evaluation of intervention and professional development (PD) programs to improve reading comprehension, and (c) the development of reading comprehension assessments (Institute of Education Sciences, n.d.) . This effort resulted in an extensive, interdisciplinary, and collaborative network of institutions and scholars working to better understand reading comprehension for different populations of students across content areas (Institute of Education Sciences, 2016). These studies provided many insights about reading comprehension across grade and achievement levels, but all sites expressed challenges with actually improving students' reading comprehension outcomes (e.g., Connor et al., 2018; Goldman et al., 2016; Pearson et al., 2020; Scammacca et al., 2016; Vaughn et al, 2013; Wanzek et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "There are several possible explanations for the limited improvement in middle grade students' reading comprehension outcomes. First, the literacy expectations increase in the middle grades. Students learn new content knowledge in multiple ways, including by reading text. Readers' background knowledge may be limited because the content is less familiar, resulting in difficulty making inferences and connections (Goldman et al., 2016) . Another possible explanation is that observation studies have demonstrated middle school teachers' limited integration of reading comprehension practices within content area reading (Greenleaf & Valencia, 2017; Swanson et al., 2016) . Classes devoted to reading instruction are rare or nonexistent in middle school, so there may be advantages for content teachers integrating reading comprehension instruction into their teaching routines. However, many teachers assume that middle school students have the necessary skills to comprehend grade-level text and thus do not embed reading comprehension practices when using reading selections (Boardman et al., 2015; Swanson et al., 2015) . Finally, many content area teachers (i.e., social studies and science) do not use text reading as a vehicle for teaching content (Murray et al., 2021; Swanson et al., 2016) ; instead, teachers use other instructional delivery formats (e.g., lecture). When teachers use text reading, they may provide key information orally to students so that students bypass reading the text altogether (Greenleaf & Valencia, 2017) . This approach results in limited practice opportunities for students to engage with text and to develop advanced literacy skills.",

We started with PD and implementation of get the gist (Klingner et al., 1998) to generate main ideas in the beginning of the academic year and then added asking and answering questions in the middle of the year (Palincsar & Brown, 1984; Rosenblatt, 1978) . The rationale for using one practice per semester was that we wanted teachers to have adequate time to acquire proficiency with one practice before introducing the second practice. We selected get the gist and asking and answering questions because these practices are theoretically grounded and associated with improved reading comprehension outcomes for adolescent readers (e.g.., Goldman, 2012; Kamil et al., 2008; Palincsar & Brown, 1984; Rosenblatt, 1978; Stevens et al., 2019; Vaughn et al., 2011) . Additionally, these practices can be integrated in teachers' existing instruction and used across a variety of content-area texts. Both practices promote active engagement during reading, support monitoring for meaning, and provide opportunities for students to think critically and integrate information across sections of text. We discuss these practices in more detail in the Method section.",

We randomly assigned schools to the treatment condition (i.e., MSM PD; n = 3) or the BaU condition (n = 3). Randomization occurred at the school level because the MSM PD is designed to be delivered schoolwide across all core content areas (i.e., ELA, science, and social studies). Because no prior experimental research on the MSM PD model existed, an adequately powered CRT was cost prohibitive due to the number of schools needed. Promising results from this pilot study would support the need for a fully powered efficacy study in the future. Prior to randomization, we matched the six schools into pairs to improve the likelihood of a balanced randomization with baseline equivalence on all pretest measures. We paired the schools based on the available school-level information on variables likely to affect baseline equivalence for reading comprehension: percentage of English learners; percentage of economically disadvantaged; and percentage of students who mastered gradelevel standards, met grade-level standards, or approached grade-level standards on the state-mandated reading assessment from the prior school year. In MSM PD and BaU schools, all teachers who taught the same content area had the same content coverage expectations and standards. Treatment classes differed only in the integration of the reading comprehension practices targeted in the MSM PD (i.e., main idea generation and asking and answering questions). Thus, the focus of this study was the delivery of these reading comprehension practices embedded within teachers' existing content area instruction and materials; we did not provide teachers with content area curricula, texts, or lessons to be used throughout the study other than the initial model lesson. Table 1 provides the demographic data for the six participating schools.",

Students stop at predetermined points during reading and use a three-step process to write their gist (main idea): (1) Who or what is this section about?

During reading, students pause to write questions about important information in the text and answer those questions, citing textual evidence. Students generate two types of questions (i.e., specific and wide) and record the questions, answers, and evidence on question logs. Specific questions can be answered in one word or sentence; wide questions can be answered using information from (a) multiple places in the text, (b) the text and the reader's prior knowledge, or (c) the text and another text (Stevens et al., 2020a) .

Access to schools and study implementation was not impacted by the pandemic because, by design, we completed the spring PD, implementation, and ongoing coaching sessions before school closures occurred. However, we were unable to collect posttest data on the asking and answering questions subtest for the seventh graders at one school (See the Missing Data section for further explanation). We asked participating teachers to provide main idea instruction for 10 weeks during the fall semester and questioning instruction for 9 weeks during the spring semester. During Week 1, following the initial PD, teachers observed the MSM coach deliver a get the gist lesson in teachers' classrooms across content areas. The lesson modeled how to (a) set a purpose for learning (i.e., reasons using get the gist is important and helpful), (b) introduce get the gist, and (c) demonstrate get the gist with a text while thinking aloud. Debriefing occurred after the lessons so that teachers could ask follow-up questions. During Week 2, teachers delivered their own get the gist model lesson to students. Beginning in Week 3, teachers were asked to provide at least two practice opportunities using get the gist each week. Teachers did not receive scripted lessons or specific texts to use when teaching these practices; researchers asked teachers to integrate the practice within their existing content area instruction twice per week, meaning a given middle school student would have at least six opportunities weekly to practice main idea generation across social studies, science, and ELA classes. To support teachers with embedding the practice within their own lessons rather than relying on scripted lessons, we provided teachers with a \"menu\" of practice activities. For example, science teachers might ask students to write gist statements at points during a science lab that focus on the hypothesis, procedures, and results of the experiment. Teachers participated in a similar PD and implementation schedule with asking and answering questions in the spring semester.",

The sample was stratified on school and grade level to ensure that a balanced sample was selected. As a result, no students were missing scores on the main idea generation subtest and missing data for the students whose protocols were not sampled were missing by design. It was our intention to score the SUM-MS asking and answering questions subtest for the same sample of 780 students.

To preserve our sample size and have adequate representation of seventh-grade students, additional seventh-graders were randomly selected from the remaining sample across the other participating schools. The middle school that did not collect end-of-year data for seventh-grade students was the smallest of the schools that participated in the study.

There was no \"set-aside time or class\" to teach these comprehension practices. Further, classroom teachers provided these comprehension practices without the benefit of scripted lessons or researcher-selected texts. Teachers received PD on the comprehension practices with guidance on how they might be integrated within their existing content instruction and received ongoing support via coaching throughout the semester.

Posttest scores from the SUM-MS asking and answering questions subtest revealed no statistically significant difference between students in schools where teachers did and did not participate in MSM PD (ES = 0.11). However, teachers' self-reported use of the practice increased from the previous school year and their reported dosage was greater than that of get the gist. There are several possible explanations for these findings. First, the implementation cycle for asking and answering questions was slightly shorter than for main idea generation (9 versus 10 weeks), meaning students had less exposure and practice opportunities with the various question types. The shortened implementation cycle was due to the need to schedule data collection prior to spring break. It may be that students simply did not have enough practice with asking and answering both question types. Additionally, the asking and answering questions subtest of the SUM-MS contained multiple-choice items, unlike the written responses generated on the main idea subtest. It may be that the multiple-choice format was not sensitive enough to detect improvement in students' questioning understanding. Future research of the MSM PD model might include an open-ended assessment of asking and answering questions; this format may be more sensitive to detecting students' change in questioning understanding.",

As has been pointed out in previous research (Fuchs et al., 2018; Stevens et al., 2020b) , it may be that the GMRT-RC is a measure of other constructs (e.g., vocabulary and knowledge) and not apt for measuring students' growth in main idea generation and questioning.

            "text": "Though the findings from this study align with prior research, the MSM PD model differs from previous PD models in several important ways that position the findings as promising. First, in spite of the challenges with improving the reading comprehension of middle grade readers, the MSM PD model resulted in significant growth in main idea understanding through PD that was feasible for teachers, narrow in scope (i.e., one reading comprehension practice per semester), and easy to implement within existing school settings. We recognize the many demands on middle school teachers, so our intent was to design a PD approach that was feasible for teachers to apply and also integrate within their instruction. We did not ask middle school teachers to substantially change their instruction but instead to use one practice several times each week during content area text reading. Second, the MSM PD model differs from previous studies in that we provided relatively minimal support to these teachers (e.g., initial PD and coaching every other week of implementation). The MSM PD model provided teachers with practices guides to assist with initial understanding of the practice, but teachers were not given specific texts, lesson plans, or scripted lessons to use during implementation. Third, the MSM PD is unique in that it was implemented schoolwide, targeting science, social studies, and ELA teachers versus occurring within one content area (e.g., social studies; Swanson et al., 2021; Vaughn et al., 2013) . This implementation ensured that students had sufficient practice opportunities with the reading comprehension practices across content areas, across text types, and throughout the school week.",

            "text": "We collected implementation fidelity data via dosage and self-report surveys. In the dosage survey, teachers reported how often they used the practice during a two-week time period (Table 4 ). In the self-report survey, teachers reported how often they used the practice last year versus in the current year (Table 5 ). In the latter survey, teachers rated their usage on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being never and 5 being routinely. We recognize the limitations to collecting implementation fidelity data using selfreport measures and conducting observations would have been preferable; however, we were unable to do so for several reasons. First, it was not feasible to conduct classroom observations, given the large number of teachers in this study. Second, we did not collect audio recordings because teachers had the flexibility to integrate the practices within their existing instruction, rather than using researcher-provided, scripted lessons on specific days or at specific times. As a result, coding audio-recording data was not feasible because it would require the research staff to sift through hours of audio recordings to locate teachers' use of the target practice. In addition, we felt that asking teachers to audio record their use of the practice once or twice per week would not be successful, as teachers would likely forget to turn on their devices, resulting in missing data. We recognize social desirability may have influenced teachers' responses, but we also position our findings and the implementation fidelity data within the context of an experimental pilot study; our aim was to examine the MSM PD model for initial promise. In future studies examining schoolwide PD models across content areas, it would be important for researchers to collect more extensive implementation fidelity data using in-person observations. In addition, observations would provide useful information on how teachers implement the practices within each content area (i.e., number of practice opportunities, gradual release of responsibility, type of texts used, frequency and quality of teacher feedback). This information would be useful in making additional changes, as needed, to the MSM PD model to address teachers' needs based on the information gleaned from the observations. A second limitation of this initial experimental study of the MSM PD was that while the sample of student participants was quite large, the sample of schools was only 6. We were unable to analyze the data in a way that reflected that students were nested in schools and cross-classified across content area teachers, which is a limitation of our findings. Given that MSM PD students outperformed BaU students on the measure of main idea, a full-scale CRT is warranted with a larger sample of schools to allow the data to be modeled as nested and cross-classified with sufficient statistical power. The estimates of effect size for both practices from the present study can be used in a future power analysis to determine the number of schools, teachers, and students that would be required for a fully powered efficacy study.",

These findings warrant alternative, schoolwide approaches that suggest promise to move the needle for middle schoolers' reading comprehension outcomes. This study indicates that schoolwide, targeted, and ongoing PD woven into content area instruction may hold promise for improving text comprehension (i.e., main idea generation) of middle grade students. The impact of this study might be considered much more promising in light of the feasibility for teachers, especially because many teachers resist \"layering practices\" onto what they are already doing. We are interested in further pursuing the extent to which schoolwide approaches to improving reading comprehension might be integrated into content area instruction in ways that could be associated with meaningful impact for students.",
