It has been previously shown that the production and release of LT by human-derived ETEC strains are variable. Although the natural genetic polymorphisms of regulatory sequences of LT-encoding (eltAB) genes may explain the variable production of LT, the knowledge of the transcriptional and posttranscriptional aspects affecting LT expression among ETEC strains is not clear. To further understand the factors affecting LT expression, we evaluated the impact of the natural polymorphism in noncoding regulatory sequences of eltAB among clinically derived ETEC strains. Sequence analyses of seven clinically derived strains and the reference strain H10407 revealed polymorphic sites at both the promoter and upstream regions of the eltAB operon. Operon fusion assays with GFP revealed that specific nucleotide changes in the Pribnow box reduce eltAB transcription. Nonetheless, the total amounts of LT produced by the tested ETEC strains did not strictly correspond to the detected LTspecific mRNA levels. Indeed, the stability of LT varied according to the tested strain, indicating the presence of posttranscriptional mechanisms affecting LT expression. Taken together, our results indicate that the production of LT is a strain-specific process and involves transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms that regulate the final amount of toxin produced and released by specific strains.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Diarrhea represents the third leading cause of child morbidity and mortality in the world, with serious impacts on public health policies and economies, particularly of lower-income countries [1] .
