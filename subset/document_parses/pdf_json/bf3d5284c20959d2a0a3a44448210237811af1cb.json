We focus on a challenge related to the phase in a pandemic when vaccines have become available, but the initially short supply cannot yet meet the vast demand, and not every willing person has had the chance to get inoculated yet. During this period, policymakers face special pressure to restore basic civil liberties for the immunized population while ensuring that the health care system will not be overburdened due to an overhasty return to normalcy and rapidly rising infection numbers. A common approach is to issue immunity certification to immunized individuals and ease their restrictions.",

The Covid-19 pandemic illustrates this challenge: In order to protect the health of their citizens, prevent them from infecting each other, and keep national health systems from being overburdened governments worldwide have to enact freedom-restricting public health policies [2] . This challenge continues until the first vaccines that could effectively prevent transmission were approved for general use and governments began vaccinating their citizens. This marks the entry of the pandemic into a new phase, during which vaccinations are still scarce and not everyone has had the opportunity to get vaccinated. We call it, referring to the WHO [3] a transition phase.",

First, while high-and middle-income countries have already overcome this phase, there are still many countries in the midst of it [4] . And despite all efforts to achieve global immunization equity (COVAX), some models show that especially poorer countries will have to wait a long time for sufficient vaccination coverage [4, 5] . Second, there is a risk that the emergence of new virus variants could render current vaccines ineffective or drastically reduce their effectiveness [6] , so that new vaccines would be needed-which would set the Covid-19 pandemic back to the stage of a global vaccine scarcity. Third, this transitional phase of vaccine scarcity can be viewed as a typical part of a pandemic. Given the prediction that pandemics may become more frequent in the future [7] , fundamental considerations about policy options during this phase are important.",

The existing restrictions are intended to prevent individuals from transmitting Covid-19 and spreading the infectionand can be considered, legally, morally, and medically suitable, as long as they affect individuals who are able to transmit Covid-19. Further, vaccination against and recent recovery from Covid-19 significantly lower the probability to infect others [13] especially if the basic preventive measures of wearing a medical mask in public and maintaining physical distance remain in place.

The distribution of a good is only just if all persons have equal and fair access to it [14] . But as long as vaccine scarcity limits the number of people who can get vaccinated, there will be an unequal distribution of vaccinations, and some will have to wait longer than others. Where this unequal distribution follows vaccine prioritization, for which there are good reasonse.g., higher risk of severe courses of Covid-19, higher exposure risks to the virus, or higher likelihood of transmission [15] -, and which follows moral values [16] it is fair and morally legitimate. However, where the restrictions are additionally eased for vaccinated as well as for recovered individuals it is no longer fair [17] . Instead, this would be tantamount to illegitimately withholding freedoms from people who want to get vaccinated but can'twhich would be unfair and also place an enormous burden on them [11] . This moral problem of unfair access to scarce vaccinations and subsequent easing of restrictions is further exacerbated when there are no good reasons for the intra-societally or globally unequal distribution of vaccines [4, 17] .",

As is evident by now, the risk associated with a Covid-19 infection is already linked to socioeconomic factors. Individuals with lower income and education levels are at higher risk of contracting Covid-19 [22] and suffering from a severe course of disease or death [23] . Even with the financial cost of vaccinations borne by the state, individual access to vaccines is, again, related to socioeconomic status [24] , e.g., through differences in technological skills, internet access, personal networks, mistrust of the health care system, and susceptibility to misinformation [25] . Therefore, easing restrictions for the vaccinated could contribute to reinforcing pre-existent inequalities [26, 27] , resulting in persons with higher income and better education facing lower medical risks and enjoying more freedoms. This problem exacerbates whenever immunization is required to access specific jobs [26] , e.g., in care work or hospitality. In such cases, not only are pre-existing inequalities reinforced, but there is a threat of marginalizationof individuals being excluded from public, social, and working life.",

However, first, as the remaining residual risks are not sufficient to justify the maintenance of restrictions for vaccinated and recovered individuals, it would be inconsistent to use them as an argument against temporarily restoring equal freedoms to negativetested individuals. Plus, if tests are performed regularly and in clusters, their false-negative rate is significantly lower [34] .
