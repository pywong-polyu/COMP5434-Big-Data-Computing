            "text": "In December 2019, COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan and spread rapidly across the globe, becoming a major public health challenge for countries around the world. 1 The COVID-19 pandemic led to a high case fatality rate up to 2.12% in WHO region-wise till February 2021. 2 3 A novel highly infectious corona RNA virus (named SARS-CoV-2) was responsible for the COVID-19, which could transmit via droplets or direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. 4 Due to the transmission routes of COVID-19, many high-contact professions including dentistry were severely affected. 5 Dental healthcare professionals worked in close proximity to patients. And most dental procedures were aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) which caused a large number of droplets and aerosols, such as use of a high-speed or low-speed handpieces, ultrasonic instruments and water-air syringes. [6] [7] [8] [9] The standard protective measures were not sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 because of the unique characteristics of dentistry, especially when patients were in the incubation period, or unaware they had been infected. 7 Therefore, among healthcare personnel, dentists were at an elevated risk of exposure to COVID-19. This risk was even more serious in paediatric dentistry, because affected children frequently presented asymptomatic, mild or moderate clinical manifestations. [10] [11] [12] To prevent and control transmission of COVID-19, Wuhan city was locked down on 23 January 2020. On the second day, Hubei province activated level 1 response to public health emergencies. Then all elective treatments to dental patients in Wuhan city were postponed and only emergency dental care was reserved. 13 14 Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba Based on large sample size, the study explored the influence caused by COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric dentistry. \u25ba Our measures and experience to prevent and control the COVID-19 transmission at the paediatric dental clinic were shared. \u25ba The short-term impact of COVID-19 on paediatric dental care in Wuhan was explored. \u25ba The study only analysed the situation in our hospital, which might not be applicable to some countries or areas. \u25ba Due to the limited time, further research is needed to discuss the medium-term and long-term impact of the COVID-19 on paediatric dental clinic.",

This department provided dental care to around 36 000 children in 2019. From 24 January to 19 April 2020, clinical procedures of this department were completely stopped. During this period, online consultations and oral health instructions were provided, and severe dental emergencies were recommended to the Department of General and Emergency in WHUSS, which was the only available department in WHUSS special for emergency dental services. 14 Although it was important to provide treatment for children who presented with urgent or emergency dental complaints, dental non-emergencies that failed to receive immediate intervention were at an increased risk to exacerbate and even developed urgent or emergent complications. Therefore, the contradiction between the huge paediatric demands and the limited dental service worsened after the closure of the Department of Paediatric Dentistry. 6 9 13 After being imposed a lockdown for as long as 76 days, Wuhan city successfully contained the spread of the virus. On 8 April 2020, all travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan was removed. 15 On 20 April, the Paediatric Department of WHUSS was reopened and aimed to improve children's dental healthcare.",

The collection of COVID-19 exposure history as well as the checking for body temperature were completed only on patient arrival. 20 21 But if the patient or the accompany person was a potential COVID-19 infected person or had been contacted with an infected person, the spread of COVID-19 was hard to be avoided on the way to the hospital. Judson et al proposed self-triage and selfscheduling based on the phone, which was being rapidly adopted on health systems around the world. 22 So this kind of system for patient triage, both on the phone and on patient arrival, which had the potential to greatly improve triage efficiency and prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, was a valuable measure for risk assessment of COVID-19 for patients. 22 23 The regular dental healthcare in Wuhan was influenced by COVID-19 pandemic, including paediatric patients and dentists. The COVID-19 pandemic had affected children's dental healthcare in Wuhan, and the short-term changes in children caused by COVID-19 pandemic were mainly due to community closure and delayed treatment. A significant increase was observed in the children at younger ages (0-6 years old), which might be attributed to the closure of the community. During this period, children were required to stay at home all day, feeling upset by losing outdoor activities, and daily dental care was sometimes ignored. 24 Coupled with poor self-control and poor oral cleaning, young children were more prone to dental diseases. At the same time, due to the closure, children were unable to visit the hospital to receive regular oral examination and the fluoride anti-caries treatment, which made the incidence of dental caries further increased. 25 At present, the impact of delayed treatment on children mainly lead to the change of the reasons for these children's visit, which was mainly reflected in the change of disease distribution in our study. A significant decrease for dental trauma was found in 2020 (April to June), which may be attributed to reduced outdoor activities. Although community closure was cancelled at the end of March, educational institutions especially kindergartens and elementary schools did not return to work at that time.",

In addition, some parents or caregivers were also worried about the risk of COVID-19 infection by AGPs, so they refused to receive any treatment for their children but dental health consultation.

The only fluctuation came from the summer vacation in July as discussed above. However, in 2020, a large amount of changes happened. When dentists just returned to work on April, most of them tried to avoid AGPs operations while parents also refused to take their children to hospital when it was not urgent enough regarding the danger of hospital environment. In this exploratory period, the attitudes of dentists and patients were relatively conservative. At the end of May, Wuhan city carried out nucleic acid tests on all citizens, which gave both dentists and patients incentives. The numbers of dentists at work, visited patients, patients treated and patients receiving AGPs also increased. This phenomenon was more significant from May to June. When entering July, after the first 3 months of exploration, the concepts of both dentists and patients have become stable.
