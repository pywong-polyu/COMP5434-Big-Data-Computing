Until recently, the role of gastrointestinal ora in human health was under-appreciated.

Therefore, it follows that preservation of the normal ora, rather than its deletion, can provide the greatest clinical bene t.\" 3 Although the bene ts of the normal ora are being acknowledged, the importance of probiotics extends further, because the application of exogenous microbes can also bene t the host. This concept is largely credited to Elie Metchnikoff, an early 20th century Russian scientist awarded the Nobel Prize for his innovative work in immunology.

The gastrointestinal tract and its resident microbes have far-reaching implications for health. The normal microora limits the ability of potential pathogens to infect. Boosting the body's ability to resist infection prevents morbidity, decreases antibiotic use (and possibly the spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens), and decreases the sequelae from some primary infections, which are rare, but nonetheless can be serious. A breakdown of tolerance to the intestinal ora is thought to be a key step in the development of in ammatory disorders of the intestine (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) for which there is no cure and for which treatment can be as severe as surgical removal of the colon. Errant activities of some intestinal bacteria are thought to contribute to the generation of carcinogens, which may play a role in the genesis of colon cancer. Exposure of the immune cells of the intestinal tract to the right types of microbes in infancy may be important to the prevention of allergy development later in life.

However, many species of lactobacilli are integral to the production of fermented foods and have been consumed safely as part of these foods for millennia. In addition, both bi dobacteria and some species of lactobacilli are normal, nonpathogenic inhabitants of the human intestinal tract. Intestinal lactobacilli (some species not normally associated with fermented foods) and bi dobacte- ria have been used in dietary supplements for decades, with an overwhelming record of safe consumption. The conclusion of a recent review of safety of lactobacilli and bi dobacteria is that there is essentially no risk with the oral consumption of lactobacilli or bi dobacteria by healthy people. 9 In patients with certain underlying diseases or conditions, however, some caution should be exerted. In fact, native lactobacilli and bi dobacteria have been documented as causative agents of infections in patients with compromised health. [43] [44] [45] Some metabolic end products may be a concern. Speci cally, Dlactic acidosis can result in people with short bowel syndrome if the probiotic produces D-lactic acid from sugar metabolism. 46 This situation can be avoided by choosing probiotics that exclusively produce the L-isomer of lactic acid. There are only two documented cases of association between probiotic Lactobacillus consumption and infection, and this association was correlative, not causal. Two different probiotic preparations containing L rhamnosus were involved with adverse effects: a liver abscess in a 74-year-old diabetic woman with hypertension 47 and endocarditis in a 67-year-old undergoing tooth extraction with a history of mitral valve prolapse. 48 These reports suggest that lactobacilli can behave opportunistically, albeit extremely rarely. In a discussion of safety of probiotics, however, one must consider the broad range of microbes beyond the lactobacilli and bi dobacteria that are used as probiotics. Strains of Enterococcus, Bacillus, and Escherichia should be evaluated comprehensively for safety. Even the yeast, Saccharomyces, can be problematic under certain circumstances. Hennequin et al. 49 documented 13 cases of fungemia owing to vascular catheter contamination in hospitalized patients consuming Saccharomyces as a probiotic; this was likely due to cross contami-nation of catheters when the probiotic was administered. Enterococcus species are a leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide and are an important reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance genes.
