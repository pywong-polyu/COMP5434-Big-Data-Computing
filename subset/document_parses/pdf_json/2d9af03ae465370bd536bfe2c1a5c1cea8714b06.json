Observations: Case: A 67-year-old Japanese female presented with central visual field loss and photopsia in the right eye (OD) for 5 days. She was complaining blurred vision with bright spots in vision in OD, but denied any ocular symptoms in left eye (OS). She had received the second dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) one day before the onset of visual symptoms; flu-like symptoms such as mild fever and general fatigue also developed along with ocular symptoms such as decreased vision and hypersensitivity to light in OD following the second COVID-19 vaccine. The first dose of vaccine was administrated followed three weeks later by the second dose and was not associated with any ocular or systemic symptoms besides mild pain at the injection site. She had not been followed by any ophthalmologist before the initial visit. At the initial visit, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in decimal points was 0.2 in OD and 1.0 in OS. Ophthalmic examination showed multifocal white dots in the posterior retina with moderate vitritis (1+ haze and 2+ cells) in OD. Multimodal imaging in OD showed diffuse disruption of ellipsoid zone with variable punctate hyperreflective lesions at macula on optical coherence tomography, punctate hyperfluorescence in a wreath-like pattern and late staining on fluorescein angiography, and multiple hypofluorescent spots of various sizes in the late phases on indocyanine green angiography. Both multiple hypofluorescent spots and scattered hyperfluorescent spots corresponding to white dots in OD were also seen on fundus autofluorescence. Her laboratory and systemic evaluations were negative for syphilis, tuberculosis, or toxoplasma, and selected autoimmune diseases like sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. No active intraocular inflammation or abnormality were seen in OS. One week later, the multifocal white dots disappeared in OD, and were almost invisible on fundus photography. At that time, multifocal electroretinogram showed decreased response with low amplitude density across the entire field in OD. The BCVA in OD spontaneously improved to 0.8 without any treatment. Collectively, these clinical course and findings were suggestive of a diagnosis of MEWDS after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.",

As various COVID-19 vaccines have shown their efficacy in clinical trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also expected that safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine can be a game-changer. 1, 2 However, these expectations has placed tremendous pressure on vaccine-makers to supply vaccine as soon as possible and to allow them to accept safety testing to be performed in less than one year, which is significantly shorter than the 12-15 years typically required for the commercialization of a vaccine. 3 Therefore, COVID-19 vaccine may have potential pitfalls secondary to the lack of formal phase II and III clinical trials due to acute high demand of supply.",

Recently, 21 cases with anterior uveitis and two cases with MEWDS after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination have been reported. 7 Since posterior uveitis such as MEWDS can cause visual impairment, it is important to evaluate in detail for ocular inflammation after COVID-19 vaccination as possible adverse effect related to COVID-19 vaccine. We herein describe a case of MEWDS with significant vitritis following the second dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). On FP, concentrated multifocal white small dots (arrows) and larger spots (arrow heads) with sparing fovea itself (star), around posterior pole and optic disc were shown in the right eye (A) and there was unremarkable finding in the left eye besides artifacts looking small dots(B). On FAF, there were mixed multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by small hyperfluorescent circles (arrows) and scattered hyperfluorescent lesions (arrow heads) corresponding to white dots in the right eye (C) and no abnormal fluorescence in the left eye (D). On FA, the early-middle phase at 1 minute (E left) and the late phase at 20 minutes (F left), punctate hyperfluorescence in a wreath-like pattern (arrows) and late multiple staining spots (arrow heads) were seen in the right eye. On ICGA, in the late phase at 20 minutes (F right), multiple hypofluorescence spots (stars) with various sizes were prominently seen. The blocked fluorescence due to vitreous opacities were seen on the bottom of images on FA and ICGA (E,F). On horizontal OCT scan through the fovea, there were variable hyperreflective lesions spots in the outer retina (arrows), diffuse disruption in the ellipsoid zone (between same color stars), and some hyperreflective dots (arrow heads) in the vitreous were seen in the right eye (G) and normal structure at macula in the left eye (H). Multifocal ERGs showed decreased retinal response with low-amplitude density at the entire field in the right eye (I) and normal retinal response amplitude density in the left eye (J). .

Given the negative results of infectious etiologies including syphilis, tuberculosis, and toxoplasma, the differential diagnoses included MEWDS, acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (AMPPE), multifocal choroiditis (MFC), and birdshot chorioretinopathy, among others. Multimodal imaging of the affected eye showed typical findings as MEWDS in the present case. Wide angle fundus photo showed time-course changes of disappearance of multifocal white dots in the retina of OD ( Fig. 2A, 2C, 2E) . Although scattered white dots were seen at the initial visit, those dots started to disappear one week later. However, moderate vitritis and RPE changes at macula remained at that time. Diffuse disruption of the EZ at the macula and punctate hyperreflective lesions of variable size in the outer retina on OCT were consistent with MEWDS. Classic signs of MEWDS in angiography, early punctate hyperfluorescence in a wreath-like pattern, late staining on FA, and late hypofluorescent dots and spots on ICGA in OD corresponded to the grey-white dots. The findings on ocular imaging indicated that the main inflammation was located on outer retina and RPE/Bruch membrane.",

One of the possible mechanisms was that ocular inflammation following vaccine could be directly induced by live, attenuated vaccines, such as MMR vaccine, because there might still be active, viral strain in the vaccines. It was reported that varicella zoster virus was detected from the eye with active inflammation after attenuated varicella vaccine, although that is rare. 18 As another mechanism, it was proposed that post-vaccinated ocular inflammation could be led by the similarity between adjuvants of vaccine and uveal self-antigen as antibody-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. In the case of the hepatitis A vaccine, aluminum salt as the adjuvant used in the inactivated vaccine was reported as a possible cause of vaccine-associated uveitis. [19] [20] [21] When a patient has a genetic background which includes a family or personal history of autoimmune disease, the patient can be regarded as autoinflammatory, and is susceptible to autoimmune conditions induced by adjuvants (ASIA), known collectively as Shoenfeld syndrome. 22 However, the index patient did not have any apparent genetic predisposition to autoimmune diseases.",

Uveitis was not reported as an adverse event in registration studies; however, a case of anterior uveitis in a 23-year-old male, with onset 14 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine has been reported recently. 9 In terms of the concept of vaccine, mRNA vaccine is quite different from the inactivated vaccine and live attenuated vaccines and does not contain aluminum salts as adjuvants in its formulation. 9 Therefore, newer theory about vaccine-associated inflammation has been proposed instead of the aluminum salts adjuvant hypothesis. In the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine, mRNA is encapsulated in two novel lipid nanoparticles, one of which is polyethylene glycol (PEG). The possibility that PEG can induce allergic reactions are reported in the literature, which showed IgE antibodies in patients with a history of PEG induced anaphylaxis 24 and PEG induced complement activation. 25 Although the PEG allergy is uncommon, PEG may be a potential trigger to immunoreaction after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Recently, Rabinovitch et al., reported 19 cases with anterior uveitis including two cases of bilateral inflammation and two cases with unilateral MEWDS following BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. According to the report, most cases of COVID-19 vaccine-associated uveitis had unilateral inflammation like the present case. 7 In contrast to the cases with unilateral MEWDS associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccination that have been described, our case showed relatively more severe ocular inflammation. Her visual acuity decreased to 0.2 (20/100) OD in the present case, which was quite worse than 20/32 in both cases with MEWDS in the recent report. Although they did not show any sign of ocular inflammation like most cases with MEWDS except retinal changes, the present case had moderate vitritis with scattered vitreous opacities with small white balls in OD. In addition, the present case had a shorter time period interval between vaccination and the onset of symptoms, which was 1 day after the second dose of vaccination, compared to 5 days and 30 days in the two cases with MEWDS. The index patient was 67-year-old, which was older compared to middle age, younger-than-50 years of age in most cases of MEWDS. 26 Although the present case showed visual recovery without any treatment as commonly described, the case indicates that MEWDS following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination may have atypical demographic characteristics or clinical findings.",

            "text": "It was reported that most of the symptoms could be as a result of much production of a cytokine that is crucial in potentiating early stages of the immune response like type I interferon (IFN-I) by macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). 31 Discussions in some reports were also focusing on a role of vaccine-induced IFN-1 between BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and uveitis following vaccination. The mRNA vaccine-induced IFN-I through RNA sensors including RIG-I promotes differentiation of CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells associated with inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators, and CD4 + helper T cells promoting B cell differentiation into plasma cells with the ability of antibody-secretion. 7, 11 IFN-I -producing DCs and other cells that have taken up the vaccinederived nucleic acids encoding the S protein can deliver both an antigenic and inflammatory signal to T cells in lymph nodes draining the injection site. This process activates S protein-specific T cells and induces adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2. 32 Moreover, IFN-1 has been shown to amplify T cell memory and promote B cell differentiation and survival, suggesting vaccine-associated inflammation in the booster can further promote generation and perpetuation of long-term immunological memory. 32 This secondary enhancement of the inflammatory adverse response due to the second dose of mRNA vaccine which require two doses spaced 3-4 weeks apart to promote optimal protection can be explained by immunological memory formation of trained immunity by effector T cell via IFN-1 production and/or by activation of memory T cells and B cells generated from the initial injection. 33 In addition, it was reported that the activation of IFN response via RIG-I induced expression of cell death effectors and caused barrier function loss in RPE cells. 34 Therefore, this mechanism may explain why MEWDS whose inflammation was located at the outer retina, the choriocapillaris/inner choroid, or both could develop after the second dose.",

Fortunately, BCVA in OD in the present case spontaneously improved to 0.8 without any treatment. However, it is hoped that our report would alert physicians to the potential risk of ocular inflammation which might temporarily cause vision loss and MEWDS-like entity, following COVID-19 vaccination.",
