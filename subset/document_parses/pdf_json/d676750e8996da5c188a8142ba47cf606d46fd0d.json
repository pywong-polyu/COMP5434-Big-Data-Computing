By accounting for the mobility of the population, measures of ambient population better reflect the momentary presence of people. They have therefore become an alternative indicator of exposure to the risk of crime. This study considers the heterogeneity of the ambient population by distinguishing residents, employees and visitors as different categories, and explores their differential impact on thefts, both on weekdays and weekends. Methods We analyze one-year of police recorded thefts across 2104 1 km 2 grid cells in a central area in Beijing, China. Controlling for the effects of attractiveness, accessibility, and guardianship, we estimate a series of negative binominal models to investigate the differential effects of the three groups (residents, employees and visitors) in the ambient population on crime frequencies, both on weekdays and during weekends and holidays. Results Overall, larger ambient populations imply larger theft frequencies. The effect of visitors is stronger than the effects of residents and employees. The effects of residents and employees vary over the course of the week. On weekdays, the presence of residents is more important, while the reverse holds true during weekends and holidays. Discussion The effects of ambient population on thefts vary by its composition in terms of social roles. The larger role of visitors is presumably because in addition to being potential victims, residents and employees may also exercise informal social control. In addition, they spend more time indoors than where risk of theft is lower, while visitors might spend more time outdoors and may also bring about greater anonymity and weaken informal social control.",

For spatial units, such as cities or neighborhoods, it has traditionally been assumed that the residential population, the number of people who live in an area, are the population at risk, although this assumption is problematic (Boggs 1965 ). An alternative indicator of exposure to crime risk is the ambient population: the number of people who are present in the during a specific time period (Andresen 2007; Hipp et al. 2019) . These people might be the residents of the area, but they could also include people who visit the area but live elsewhere. Measuring the true ambient population at risk has been a key focus in recent studies in criminology (Andresen 2006; Haberman and Ratcliffe 2015; Hipp et al. 2019) . The frequency of occurrence of crime depends on an understanding of the population for whom crime is a threat; that is the total number of people who are at the risk of criminal victimization (i.e., the denominator of the crime rate). Traditionally, researchers have used the residential population as the denominator of the crime rate or, in the context of multivariate regression, as one of the predictors of crime frequencies.",

Most people continuously move beyond their residential area for pursuing important activities (Cagney et al. 2020) , and are thus at risk elsewhere (Roman 2005) . The activity patterns of residents vary considerably between weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, for example, in many areas large proportions of the resident population work, attend school or pursue other activities away from their homes. During these times, they are not exposed to victimization risk in their own residential area. During weekends, however, large percentages of the population spend much more time at home. At the same time, city centers, generally home to a small proportion of urban residents, are visited by numbers of people that dwarf the number of local residents, in particular on weekends. The residential population thus reflects only part of the population that makes use of the local area, because at predictable days of the week and times of the day they are joined by others who visit the local area for a variety of purposes. Therefore, the size of the local residential population may not necessarily bear a strong relation to the local crime rate, and calculations of crime risk exposure based on residential population may lead to bias (Boggs 1965) .",

One is to approximate population by the presence of facilities that are known to bring together large crowds, and thereby an increased volume of potential targets and motived offenders. These facilities have been labeled 'crime generators' and 'crime attractors' (Brantingham and Brantingham 1995; Kinney et al. 2008) . The distinction between both categories is rooted in the nature of the offender's intention to visit the location. Crime generators are usually visited without a premediated criminal intention, whereas crime attractors are locations that are often visited with a premediated criminal intention. Different types of facilities attract different categories of the population who visit the facilities with varying purposes. Studies following this approach often measure the ambient population by the number of such population-attracting facilities (Bernasco and Block 2011) , the co-location of facilities (mixed land use) (Kinney et al. 2008) , and the number of employees registered to the facilities (Kim 2018; Wo et al. 2016) . By increasing the temporal resolution, recent scholarship finds that facilities exhibit varied magnitudes in its relation to crime in different time periods of a day, thus shedding light on the dynamic nature of the population at risk (Haberman and Ratcliffe 2015) .",

Big location data also hold promise for measuring ambient populations at more fine-grained spatial-temporal granularities (Hipp et al. 2019; Malleson and Andresen 2015) .

However, a limitation of these studies is that they do not distinguish amongst the people that make up the ambient population, and thereby ignore the internal heterogeneity of ambient population. For example, the knowledge of and the strength of attachment to a location will usually vary within the ambient population (Boivin and Felson 2017) . Outsiders (who visit the location infrequently for occasional activities) may be less knowledgeable and less attached to the location than employees (who work at the location), and employees may be less knowledgeable and attached than residents (who live at the location). A place with a large proportion of outsiders often features high mobility and anonymity, thereby decreasing local informal social control and potentially increasing crime (Tillyer and Walter 2019) . On the contrary, if a place is mainly used by residents or employees, there will be more social control, and potentially less social disorder and less crime (Yu and Maxfield 2014) . Few studies have paid attention to the internal heterogeneity of ambient population. As an exception, He et al. (2020) use mobile phone data to distinguish between local and non-local phone users. But they do not make further differentiations based on their activities and attachments, such as between residents, employees, and visitors.",

To explain these variations, opportunity theories assert that the distribution of crimes is a function of the criminal opportunities. Opportunity theories of crime include routine activity theory, rational choice theory, and crime pattern theory. In the routine activity perspective, the convergence in time and place of suitable targets, motivated offenders, and a lack of capable guardianship leads to the emergence of crime (Cohen and Felson 1979) . This perspective highlights the importance of routine activities and the interactions between different stakeholders. The crime pattern perspective suggests that offenders gain their spatial knowledge and awareness of crime opportunities through daily activities. As a result, they often offend in places that they also visit for legal routines activities, such as work, school, shopping or leisure (Brantingham and Brantingham 1995) . Rational choice theory argues that offenders take a rational approach to making decisions by balancing the potential benefits, costs, and risks of alternatives when committing crime (Cornish and Clarke 1987) . It suggests that offenders prefer to commit crimes where suitable targets are present and capable guardians are absent.",

Crime generators are \"particular areas to which large numbers of people are attracted for reasons unrelated to any particular level of criminal motivation they might have or to any particular crime they might end up committing\" (Brantingham and Brantingham 1995: 7) , while crime attractors are \"particular places, areas, neighborhoods, districts which create well-known criminal opportunities to which strongly motivated, intending criminal offenders are attracted because of the known opportunities for particular types of crime.\" (Brantingham and Brantingham 1995: 8) . Thus, the main distinction between crime generators and crime attractors is the intention with which potential offenders visit them. Crime generators are visited without a premediated criminal intention, while crime attractors are visited with a criminal purpose in mind.",

In practice, however, or in large-scale research, it is difficult to distinguish crime generators from crime attractors. For example, without personal knowledge about the offenders, it is impossible to know whether they committed premediated thefts or visited the crime location without the intention to steal. For example, retail businesses are crime generators if many people come there without any particular criminal motivation, but some potential offenders visit there purposively because there are many easy crime opportunities. In the latter case, retail businesses can also be regarded as crime attractors (Steenbeek et al. 2012; Wilcox et al. 2004) . Thus, it is too simple to argue that some types of locations (e.g. bars, or youth hangout places) are attractors and that others (e.g. shopping malls, or stadiums) are crime generators.",

For example, Mburu and Helbich (2016) combine residential population census data and the number of daily commuters to calculate the number of residents in administrative units at any given time as a measure of ambient population. Felson and Boivin (2015) show with a transportation survey of 506 neighborhoods in Canada that the volumes of both violent and property crime in a neighborhood are strongly correlated with the number of trips leading to that neighborhood. Using the same data, Boivin and Felson (2017) further demonstrate that the number of non-crime trips between each pair of neighborhoods positively predicts the volume of crime trips between them.",

For example, the mobility of the general population measured by mobile phone trajectories can help predict offenders' crime location choices , and aggregated and anonymized human location data derived from mobile network activity can be used to predict crime levels (Bogomolov et al. 2014 ). Based on spatially referenced mobile phone data from Xi'an, a large city in China, with demographic characteristics of anonymized users, He et al. (2020) take into account variations in the ambient population by distinguishing between local and non-local phone users and find that besides crime attractors, generators and detractors, the proportion of nonlocal ambient population is significantly correlated with increased risk of larceny-theft. Another recent advance that emerges as a preferable alternative to static census population data stems from location-based social media platforms such as Twitter. In a study by Lan et al. (2019) , counts of Twitter messages ('tweets') are used to analyze the spatial pattern of theft. They find that tweet counts, interpreted as a measure of ambient population, show a significant spillover effect on thefts, and that the total effect based on tweets counts outperforms that by Census population measure. Also using Twitter data from Southern California, Hipp et al. (2019) reveal that the temporal population estimated from social media help explain the level of crime in blocks during corresponding time periods.",

Both LBS measures may not reliably capture what people do and where they go between observed activities (Cagney et al. 2020 ). In addition, big location data are produced by a sample that is not necessarily representative of the population of interest. The LBS traces might also vary between persons, between locations, and between different timeframes in phone and application use. Furthermore, their spatial resolution varies between urban and rural areas for mobile phone traces as a result of the uneven distribution of cell towers (De Montjoye et al. 2013) . Consequently, these big location data may produce biased estimations of ambient population.",

Social disorganization theory contends that mobile populations will inhibit the development of local social cohesion and mutual trust, which consequently limits the informal social control against crime (Taylor 1997) . According to both theories, the increased presence of transient visitors would lead to decreased guardianship and increased crime. The non-resident ambient population, i.e. visitors, arguably offer more anonymity for offenders, are more vulnerable traces from all applications that use the platform location services Has not been used in criminology research for victimization and have less incentive to contribute to collective social control efforts (Tillyer et al. 2021) .

Therefore, it is often hard to tell crime attractors from crime generators. Instead of using a specific POI as a crime attractor or generator, following a prior study (Sung et al. 2015) , we use the entropy index (EI) of urban function to measure the degree of urban diversity. The higher the entropy index, the more mixed the urban functions, which is found to produce elevated crime levels, exceeding those that would be predicted from population size alone (MacDonald 2015) . This effect is presumed to exist because mixed land use, especially in metropolitan cities, often has a higher accessibility and wider service area than the local community, so that clustered facilities attract not only local residents but also visitors who live elsewhere. The anonymity and a lack of surveillance in such busy locations often facilitate offenders' crime decision making and elevate local crime rates (Boivin 2018) .",

Females are usually considered as the more vulnerable group than males (Augustine et al. 2002) . Therefore, based on the census data, female percentage are also regarded as an important aspect of attractiveness for thieves. Accessibility Public transportation is often considered a rational choice by offenders to lower mobility costs (Oliveira, Natarajan and da Silva 2019) and ease escape after committing crimes. As such, communities with high accessibility attract high volumes of outsiders, involving potential offenders (Liu et al. 2020a ). Empirically, the number of public transportation stations (e.g., bus stops and subway stations) is used to measure public transportation convenience. Studies confirm that crime rates increase with the presence of bus stops and subway stations (Bernasco and Block 2011; Haberman and Ratcliffe 2015; Liu et al. 2020a ). Additionally, the presence of through traffic as well as high walkability may increase crime by increasing street traffic and the presence of strangers (Lee and Contreras 2021). Davies and Johnson (2015) found that road structure, measured by betweenness, influences burglary risk, with burglary risk higher on street segments with higher usage potential. Other studies use the total length of roads to capture usage potential. For example, Stucky and Ottensmann (2009) show that the total length of major streets in a grid cell is significantly positively associated with violent crime in Indianapolis. For accessibility, therefore, we control three variables: the number of bus stops, the number of subway stations, and the total length of streets in the grid cell. Road network data of Beijing was crawled from Baidu Map API in December 2018. It contains urban roads of all levels including main roads, secondary roads and branch roads but not the roads within the gated communities. In general, more public transportation facilities and higher density road networks represent better accessibility.",

The presence of strong guardianship can protect attractive victims from falling prey to motivated offenders. In empirical studies, distance to the closest police station as a proxy for accessibility to formal social control is commonly used. The presumed mechanism is that offenders are aware of an increased presence of police on streets near a police station, and therefore avoid offending in the proximity of police stations. Helbich and Jokar Arsanjani (2015) and Song et al. (2018a) found that the distance to police stations significantly impacts nonviolent crime. We, therefore, calculate the shortest road network distance from the grid cell center to the nearest police station as a measure of the level of guardianship. Moreover, we consider the percentage of natives as well as the percentage of highly-educated population as indicators of informal social control (Song et al. 2018b) .",

Moran's I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation that indicates whether characteristics of nearby areas are correlated. Like Pearson's correlation coefficient, it ranges between -1 (perfect negative) and 1 (perfect positive) and in large sample has an expected value of 0 in the absence of any correlation. The overall level of spatial autocorrelation in theft provides a measure of the extent to which theft frequencies are spatially clustered. In addition, we present Pearson correlation coefficients between all independent variables. The second step in the analysis is to model the relationship between annual crime frequencies per grid cell as the dependent variable, and three different ambient population measures as the key independent variables, in addition to control variables. Like in other recent crime studies (e.g., Kim and Hipp 2020; Kurland and Johnson 2021) , the distribution of theft in our data is over-dispersed: it has a larger variance than mean. To account for this overdispersion, as suggested by (Osgood 2000) and in line with most recent studies on sparse crime frequencies (e.g., Bernasco and Block 2011; Kim and Hipp 2020; Kurland and Johnson 2021), we use negative binomial regression models. Controlling for the effects of attractiveness, accessibility, and guardianship, four alternative indicators of ambient population-number of residents, number of employees, number of visitors, and the sum of these three categories-are included in separate models. In addition, and to determine the relative roles of ambient resident, employee and visitor populations, a model is estimated that contains these three ambient population categories simultaneously. Further, each of these models is estimated for weekdays only, for weekends only, and for complete weeks. Moreover, to ensure that results aren't sensitive to the assumptions of the Negative binomial model, with reference on Wooldridge (2010) and Berk and MacDonald (2008) , we also present the results of corresponding Poisson regression models with robust standard errors in the appendix.",

These bootstrap results offer a more robust assessment of the relative performance of models than a simple comparison of the AIC values of the five models.",

Ridgeway et al. (2019) and Bester et al. (2011) suggest that clustering the covariance matrix by larger geographical units (i.e. districts in our study) can allow for arbitrary dependence among the analysis units (grid cells) within these larger units. Moreover, as the number of grid cells within districts grows large, dependence among grid cells on the boundaries becomes negligible, so accounting for spatial dependence within districts becomes comparable to accounting for arbitrary spatial dependence. In line with this argument, we cluster standard errors at district level, 2104 grid cells in 12 districts, and compare the results of the negative binominal models with and without cluster robust standard errors. If the differences are not substantial, then spatial autocorrelation is not a concern. Between both models, the values of the key variables of ambient population are stable, and only the proportion of female residents turns from significant to non-significant. Therefore, spatial autocorrelation does not pose concern to the conclusions drawn from the analysis. In this study, we present only the model results of the negative binominal regressions with cluster robust standard errors.",

In terms of the model performance based on AIC values, as well as the percentages in the bootstrap procedure, the overall ambient population models (Model 5) has the strongest relation with the volume of thefts. This implies that our distinction between residents, employees and visitors in the ambient population supports their differential effect on theft rates, but that the distinction itself does not seem to add to the prediction.

            "text": "The key conclusion of the study is that our findings show that the ambient population is not a homogeneous group, and that the composition of the ambient population affects its influence on thefts. Generally speaking, for the full week, visitors have the largest effect on thefts, followed by residents and employees. Because visitors are outsiders, they may be more likely to fall victim to crimes, given their unfamiliarity with the local area. Moreover, according to social disorganization theory, high population mobility is detrimental for local social cohesion and mutual trust. Large volumes of visitors bring anonymity to the local area (Boivin and Felson 2017) , reduce informal social control, and create more criminal opportunities. Possession of valuable belongings, unfamiliarity, and high anonymity all contribute to visitors' elevated risk of theft victimization. In contrast, although residents and employees can also be potential targets, in light of Jacobs' notion of \"eyes on the street\" (Jacobs, 1961) , they may be better surveillants and more likely to intervene for the public good than others (Tillyer et al. 2021) . These findings may inform policy makers who may be advised to focus their crime prevention strategies on places that attract large numbers of visitors, rather than places that attract large ambient populations more generally. Another important finding is that the effects of residents and employees vary between weekdays and weekends. Whereas visitors have the largest effect on thefts both on weekdays and weekends, on weekdays the effect of residents is larger than the effect of employees, and on weekends the effect of employees is larger than the effect of residents. A possible explanation is on weekdays residents tend to stay around their residence and have a more flexible schedule. They may carry out outdoor activities, such as grocery shopping and exercising, exposing themselves to motivated offenders to a greater extent. Moreover, some residents, especially the old and the children, a relative vulnerable group to victimization, travel shorter distances during their daily activities, and are more likely to stay close to where they live (Yuan and Raubal 2016) . By contrast, employees are predominantly involved in indoor activities in the workspace (e.g., office buildings and factories), making them less likely to fall victim to theft (Song et al. 2018b) . Therefore, compared to employees who have to work indoors, residents have a stronger effect on thefts due to their longer stay, higher vulnerability, and greater exposure to risk on weekdays.",

This generates stronger guardianship and reduces vulnerability among residents. Although some employees work overtime on weekends, they have a more flexible time budget than on weekdays and might just spend part of the day on working (Sun et al. 2014) . For the rest of the time, they can have more outdoor activities around, which increases their exposure to thefts. To summarize, as a result of their distinctive activity patterns-the activity space (i.e. outdoor or indoor) and the way they spend time in a grid cell-different groups of ambient population have varied effects on crime. Consequently, on weekends the presence of employees has a stronger effect on thefts than the presence of residents. The implication of our findings is that for an improved understanding of how ambient populations affect crime rates, it is important to take into account both the different roles of the people that make up the ambient population (e.g. resident, employee or visitor) and the different phases in the weekly time cycle (e.g. weekday and weekend). In the application of these findings, one should generally not favor one ambient population category or one temporal phase over the other, but rather measure and apply them simultaneously.",

As for accessibility, the longer the street is, the more thefts there will be. However, unlike the findings of Liu et al. (2020a) , we do not find any effect of the presence of bus stops or subway stations in the models considering ambient population. This suggests that these indicators of accessibility (how convenient it is for people to visit the location) do not add to the information already included in the indicators of ambient population (how many people are actually present in the location). Another possible reason is that in Beijing, the bus stops quite evenly distribute around the city, therefore having no significant impact on thefts. The proportion of female residents presents no impact on thefts, indicating that the gender of victims makes no difference to offenders.",

(2018a) , distance to nearest police station, potentially indicative of guardianship, has a negative relation with theft when ambient population is not accounted for. A possible explanation is that that proximity to police stations may increase the willingness of victims to report their victimization to the police, resulting in more rather than less thefts being reported closer to police stations. In addition, police stations may be intentionally located in crowded places and in high crime areas to improve accessibility and response to calls for service. Any inhibitive effect of formal guardianship on theft may thus be offset by these two factors. In terms of informal social control, the natives feature strong informal social control and can prevent thefts. Though the highly educated population is not significant in many models, it presents a negative effect, which also indicates their informal social control on thefts, especially on weekends.",

First, in terms of the identification of ambient population subgroups, although we are able to differentiate between residents, employees, and visitors, we are unable to further discern the type of activities individuals are engaged in during the study period. The type of employees observed on weekdays and weekends may be different. As argued above, the employee population is likely involved in the public and semi-public domains on weekends than weekdays, which may contribute to the differential effect size of employees on theft on the two timeframes. Relatedly, the population subgroup labels are mutually exclusive, which may bias our estimation of individuals' trip purposes. In our dataset, a person carrying out non-working activities, such as shopping, in the grid cells where one works on the weekend, he or she is still regarded as an employee rather than a visitor. At the same time, different types of employees, such as employees by retail vs. nonretail, are found to have different effects on crimes in the literature. However, this distinction cannot be made in this study because the resident, employee and visitor categories are part of the data made accessible by the Baidu Company, which cannot be further subdivided by us. Another limitation is that the algorithms underlying the distinctions between residents, employees and visitors have been developed, implemented and described by the Baidu company, and are not openly available. Because these data are unique (that is why we are using them to further our understanding of how ambient population affects crime) we have no way of comparing the data with reliable external sources.",

These issues may bias our interpretation of employees, residents and visitors, but only marginally because these groups of city residents probably only constitute a small fraction of the whole population.",

Different crimes may have different kinds of crime targets. For example, the ambient population can be a target of thefts, but not burglary which targets on a specific dwelling instead of a person. The effects of visitors, residents, and visitors in the ambient population may be different with respect to other types of crime than thefts.",

If the differences between results of the negative binominal models with and without cluster robust standard errors are substantial, the technique is not appropriate and other techniques for analyzing spatially autocorrelated count data are needed, such as spatial filtering (Chun 2014; Haining et al. 2009 ), generalized cross entropy (Roman et al. 2008) and Bayesian methods (Liu and Zhu 2016) .
