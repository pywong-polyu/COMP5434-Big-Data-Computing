This paper examines the influence of COVID-19 vaccination on the death rate and the performance of stock market in India. For this study, COVID-19 vaccination and death rate data is gathered from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) portal, and the data for the stock index is taken from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India. In order to achieve a precise representation of feature significance and distribution, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is utilized in this study. The impact of COVID-19 immunization on the mortality rate and stock market index is investigated using both statistical analysis and Machine Learning Regression-based models. The models are remarkably accurate in reproducing actual result. The empirical study suggests that vaccination has a strong positive impact on the stock market and reducing the death rate. Furthermore, the policies recommended by government and monetary authorities coupled with COVID-19 vaccine supported the stock market recovery in pandemic.",

As a result, on 11 March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease as a pandemic. After the Spanish Flu, the Coronavirus pandemic is represented as the most devastating health crisis in the world. Thus for the communicable COVID-19, several countries have imposed restrictions on their economic agents' ability to move from one country to another or even inside the same country. It is having a rising influence on the global economy, and due to stress on supply chains, decrease in government income, labor movement restrictions, stock market volatility, and reduced consumer activity the global health crisis has sadly turned into a global economic disaster (Du et al., 2021) .",

The COVID-19 has sparked worldwide concern and fear since numerous fatalities have been recorded (Wang et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020) . Recent research has produced a number of countylevel studies on the COVID-19 death rate. The researcher Wang et al. (2020b) used the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA) to estimate the death rate based on patient data in Wuhan and later in other Chinese cities in which he has demonstrated that PIBA can be used to forecast future fatalities and estimate the death rate of a new infectious illness in real-time. Possible explanatory variables for mortality rates at the state and county levels, including geography, demographics, socioeconomic, health conditions, hospital features, and politics, have been examined by Feinhandler et al. (2020) .",

As India is the country with the second largest population in the world, the pandemic hit the stock market as well as the Indian economy drastically. Pegu (2020) examined the future probability of GDP in the Indian economy as well as analyzed different sectors which are affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the significant effect of COVID-19 cases on twelve sectors, an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression model was developed by Yadav et al. (2021) . The study found that at the initial stage of the pandemic, the stock market responded negatively, but after some days, the indices are in their recovery mode. Barbate et al. (2021) have shown the long-term and short-term effects of lockdown by taking a decision tree approach for making the projections on COVID-19. Using a multivariate econometric model, Baber and Rao (2021) examined the impact of lockdown and social distancing on the Indian economy. In this study, the authors compare the economy for the period before and after lockdown and analyzed the economic activity, stock market, and exchange rate in India. In addition to that, Alam et al. (2020) used the Market Model Event study methodology to check the Indian Stock market before and after the lockdown period in India. As a result, a positive average return has been found in the lockdown period, which proves that until the improved situation in India, the stock market performance was affected positively.",

An asset pricing perspective is developed by Acharya et al. (2020) , which examines the value of a cure by creating a novel \"vaccine progress indicator\". They estimated the level of exposure within each industry and studied the vaccine progress impact in the cross-section of the industries. Moreover, they found that the return of the stock market can be possible by the decrease in the expected vaccine deployment time in a year. The reactions of the stock market to COVID-19 vaccine human clinical trial has been analyzed by Chan et al. (2021) . As a result, it is concluded that the investor's sentiment, as well as the return of the stock market of 49 countries, rises after the first day of the clinical trial. In other words, after the consecutive phases of the clinical trial, the equity market started to react positively. Rouatbi et al. (2021) explored the impact of vaccination on the volatility of the international equity market. In which, they have shown that the impact of vaccination in the developed market is relatively stronger than emerging one.",

In this regard, pharmaceutical companies around the world have developed COVID-19 vaccines, which have received regulatory approval for emergency use. Countries have begun major immunization campaigns. It is seen that vaccination in India has a great impact on the mortality rate and the stock market.

It is called linear regression because it depicts the linear relationship between the independent variable (X-axis) and the dependent variable (Y-axis). Simple linear regression is defined as linear regression with only one input variable (x). When there are multiple input variables, the linear regression is referred to as multiple linear regression. The mathematical equation of linear regression is where X is independent variables (predictor variables) , Y is dependent variables (target variables), and a and b are constants (Noi et al., 2017) . Linear regression assumes that the dependent and independent variables have a linear relationship, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. This is when you should use non-linear regression techniques. Furthermore, if the independent variables are related to one another, or if there is muulticollinearness, Linear Regression will fail. To avoid this, only keep one of the correlated independent variables.",

            "text": "-Support Vector Regression The Support Vector Regression algorithm is a continuous-variable regression algorithm. In SVR, we always try to find a hyperplane with the largest possible margin, so that the maximum number of datapoints are covered. SVR's main goal is to consider as many datapoints as possible within the boundary lines, and the hyperplane (best-fit line) must contain as many datapoints as possible (Smola & Sch\u00f6lkopf, 2004) . SVR outperforms the linear regression model in high-dimensional space while being more robust to outliers. In support vector regression analysis, it is also very simple to accommodate new data points. However, training takes a long time and is not suitable for large datasets. If the number of samples is less than the number of features, SVR will perform poorly. The predictions do not have any probabilistic explanations. -Random Forest Regression Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm for regression that employs an ensemble learning method. The ensemble learning method combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to produce a more accurate prediction than a single model. During training, a Random Forest builds several decision trees and outputs the mean of the classes as the prediction of all the trees (Shataee et al., 2012) . Random Forest Regression model is both effective and precise. It usually works well on a wide range of issues, including those involving non-linear relationships. However, there are some drawbacks, such as lack of interpretability, the possibility of overfitting, and the need to choose the number of trees to include in the model. -KNN Regression KNN regression is a non-parametric method that approximates the relationship between independent variables and continuous outcomes by averaging observations in the same neighborhood in an intuitive manner. The analyst must set the size of the neighborhood, or it can be chosen using crossvalidation to find the size that minimizes the mean-squared error (Franco-Lopez et al., 2001) . While the method is appealing, it quickly becomes impractical as the dimension grows, i.e. when there are a large number of independent variables.",

It also illuminates the dataset's key properties and statistical characteristics, such as the existence of missing values, distribution types such as skewness and kurtosis, class disproportion, and so on. However, if EDA is not performed properly, it can misguide a problem. Also, when EDA is dealt with highdimensional data, it is not effective. Descriptive statistics is a summary of a dataset using either the full dataset or a selection of the dataset. Measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), measures of variability (spread), and skewness and kurtosis may all be used to do descriptive statistics. The mean, median, and mode are calculated using central tendency measurements. The standard deviation, variance, minimum and maximum values are determined by the measures of variability, while the skewness and kurtosis define the data distribution.

Moreover, Machine Learning algorithms are good at dealing with multidimensional and multivariate data, and they can do it in dynamic or uncertain environments. Also, as the amount of data increases, algorithms learn to make more accurate predictions in less time. However, Machine learning requires large dataset for training, which must be inclusive, unbiased, and of high quality. In addition to that, running models with different algorithms and determining the most accurate algorithm based on the results is a manual and time-consuming task. Also, it is highly susceptible to errors. To predict the status of the Indian stock market and death rate with concern to COVID-19 vaccination, Machine Learning models like Linear regression, Support Vector Regression, KNN Regression, and Random Forest Regression are used in this research.

This study has two purposes; one is to predict the stock market response to the vaccination process, and the second is to find the relationship between the mortality rate and vaccination in India. EDA has been employed to analyze the key features of the dataset with visual methods. Moreover, statistical data analysis has been used to demonstrate the relationship of vaccination with the stock market and death rate. As a result, it is found in vaccination and stock market part that total vaccinated people and closing price of the stock market are positively correlated, since r value is positive. In addition to that, as the value of r > 0.5 , vaccination and stock market are strongly correlated.

The link of immunization with the stock market and the death rate has been demonstrated using statistical data analysis. For the Machine Learning process, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression, and KNN Regression model has been implemented in this work. It is found that the stock market becomes stable after the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccination process. Furthermore, daily vaccination in the country also decreases the mortality rate. From the experiment, it is concluded that if the vaccination process goes on accordingly, better improvement can be seen in the stock market with a lower death rate. The limitation of our work is the relatively fresh and short data set.",

            "text": "In future studies, researchers may consider other indicators like the number of tests and the number of patients who recover. Also, a micro-level (i.e. companybased) analysis, as well as a macro-level (i.e. main stock exchange indices) analysis, could be used to examine the reaction to the vaccination process. Other statistical or econometric methods, such as Deep Learning Algorithms, Markov Switch Regression, Neural Networks, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Wavelet Coherence Approach, could be used in future research. In addition, the effect of vaccination on the stock market in other countries could be investigated. Moreover, new analyses of the stock market's reaction to the vaccination process, based on full data from the beginning to the end of the vaccination, could add to the existing literature. The findings of these studies could be helpful in formulating policies to mitigate the pandemic's negative effects on economies, financial markets, stock exchanges, and major indices. Furthermore, future research on this topic could also look into the effects of vaccines on other asset classes, such as currencies, commodities, and corporate bonds.",
