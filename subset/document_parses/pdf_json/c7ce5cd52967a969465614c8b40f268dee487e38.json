This real-world study provides evidence of high VE of 2 doses of mRNA-1273 against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta. Although prior studies of BNT162b2 and other COVID-19 vaccines have examined VE against Delta, 13,29-33 few studies of mRNA-1273 have reported variant-specific VE. 31,33 Our study addresses this gap, finding that mRNA-1273 was protective against infection with Delta and other identified SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Epsilon, Gamma, Iota, Mu, and others). VE against Delta infection was moderately lower than VE against identified non-Delta variants (86.7% vs. 90.4-98.4%), as observed in several other studies.",

Despite the lower VE against infection, VE against hospitalization with unidentified variants remained high (96.6%). Our study identified modest waning of mRNA-1273 VE against Delta infection; VE decreased from 94.1% in the 14-60 days after vaccination to 80.0% in the 151-180 days after vaccination. Similar reductions were observed among individuals aged 18-64 years, but among those aged \u226565 years, 95% CIs for VE by time since vaccination were wide. Other observational studies have found reduced VE of mRNA-based vaccines against infection in periods before and after Delta became predominant, some of which identified steeper declines than observed in our study.",
