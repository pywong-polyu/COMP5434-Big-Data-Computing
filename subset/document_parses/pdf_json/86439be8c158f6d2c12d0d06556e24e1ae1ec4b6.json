For the dynamics of COVID-19, we propose a stochastic epidemic model, with time-delays, Susceptible-Infected-Asymptomatic-Quarantined-Recovered (SIAQR). One global positive solution exists with probability one in the model. As a threshold condition of persistence and existence of an ergodic stationary distribution, we deduce a generalized stochastic threshold \ue23e 0 < \ue23e 0 . To estimate the percentages of people who must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, least-squares approaches were used to estimate \ue23e 0 from real observations in the UAE. Our results suggest that when \ue23e 0 > 1, a proportion max(1 \u2212 1\u2215\ue23e 0 ) of the population needs to be immunized/vaccinated during the pandemic wave. Numerical simulations show that the proposed stochastic delay differential model is consistent with the physical sensitivity and fluctuation of the real observations.",

            "text": "Since the confirmation of the first cases of COVID-19 in the UAE on 29 January 2020, when an infected family of four members: mother, father, nine-year-old girl and grandmother visited the Emirates on January 16th. The first sought treatment on January 23rd after the grandmother developed flu-like symptoms. The rest members of the family subsequently developed the disease. Since then, various preventive measures and techniques to ensure prompt identification and follow up of confirmed cases and their contacts to control the spread of diseases have been imposed by the UAE [1] . In this paper, we propose a new compartmental stochastic epidemic model with time-delays describing the transmission of COVID-19 in the UAE. It takes account on the asymptomatic people and the strategies involving hospital isolation of the confirmed infected person, quarantine of people contacting them, and home containment of all population to restrict mobility. The model also takes into account the potential environmental factors such as temperature and humidity along with international travel and lack of proper social consciousness for isolation as causes of the spread of COVID 19. Numerical modeling of infectious and transmission diseases has an essential role in the epidemiological aspect of disease control [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Several useful papers have been formulated to develop mathematical models in various countries to analyze the complex transmission pattern for COVID-19. In [8] , the authors provided age-structured compartmental SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered) * Corresponding author.",

These variants appear to be spread more efficiently and speedily than other variants, which may cause to more cases of COVID-19.

Vaccination is then operated by reducing the pool of susceptible individuals, and when this is reduced sufficiently, an infectious disease cannot spread within the population. It is not, of course, necessary to vaccinate everyone to prevent an epidemic: immunizing someone not only protects that person but confers some protection to the population in general.

In this work, we proposed a stochastic delay differential model (SIAQR) to investigate the dynamics of the ongoing COVID-19, taking into account the classification of different phases of its spread in population. We proved the unique and global positive solution of the system with probability one. Persistence and existence of an ergodic stationary distribution is also investigated. Estimates \ue23e 0 < \ue23e 0 can give better insights about the transmissibility of infection in a certain country. Real observations of infected cases, during and after the lock down from the UAE (for the spread of COVID-19 during a period of six months) have been considered to fit such data with the suggested models.",

We stochastically perturbed the COVID-19 model parameters using a normal distribution in order to account for the uncertainty in estimates and simulate the difficulties in detecting patients, various isolation measures taken by different countries, and changes in virus characteristics. Periodicity of the outbreaks is likely to occur as a result of the presence of time-delay in the transmission terms.",

The values of \ue23e 0 are estimated from real observations in order to determine the percentages that must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. Our results suggest that when \ue23e 0 = 3.882, The numerical simulations show that the proposed stochastic delay differential model is consistent with the physical sensitivity and fluctuation the real observations, and gives an extra degree of realism, compared with its corresponding deterministic model. The authors conclude that the stochastic SIAQR model is a procedure to figure out epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our proposed model adds new understandings into epidemiological situations under the effect of the environmental noise in the COVID-19 epidemic models. The consolidation of environmental perturbations and time-lag, in the epidemic model, has a significant impact on the persistence and possible extinction of the disease and improves the dynamics of the system.",
