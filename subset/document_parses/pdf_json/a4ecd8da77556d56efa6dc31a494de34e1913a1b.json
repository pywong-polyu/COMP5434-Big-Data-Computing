This paper describes COVID-19 dynamics based on a novel version of the susceptibleexposed-infectious-removed model. Removed population is split into recovered and death populations allowing a better comprehension of real situations. Besides, the total population is reduced based on the number of deaths. Hospital infrastructure is also included into the mathematical description allowing the consideration of collapse scenarios. Initially, a model verification is carried out calibrating system parameters with data from China outbreak that is considered a benchmark due the availability of data for the entire cycle. Afterward, Brazil outbreak is of concern, calibrating the model and developing numerical simulations. Results show several scenarios highlighting the importance of social isolation and hospital infrastructure. System dynamics has a strong sensitivity to transmission rate showing the importance of numerical simulations to guide public health decision strategies. Results also show that complex dynamical responses can emerge due to the oscillations of the transmission rate, being associated with distinct infection subsequent waves.",

            "text": "In principle, reality can be considered indescribable, and therefore, it cannot be represented by mathematical models. Nevertheless, mathematical models can be understood as a reality caricature that can be useful to achieve specific goals and therefore being able to describe reality. In this regard, it can help for either qualitative understanding, establishing dynamical patterns, or quantitative predictions. Based on this idea, mathematical modeling is an art in the Picasso's sense, expressed by his remarkable sentence: ''art is a lie that makes us realize truth.'' Different kinds of models can be employed for the COVID-19 dynamics. Rihan et al. [19] described the dynamics of coronavirus infection in human, establishing interaction among human cells and the virus. Chen et al. [8] developed a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus considering a simplified version of the bats-hosts-reservoirpeople transmission model, defined as a reservoirpeople model. Li et al. [14] estimated characteristics of the epidemiologic time distribution, exploiting some pattern trends of transmission propagation. Riou and Althaus [20] exploited the pattern of human-tohuman transmission of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. Two key parameters are considered: basic reproduction number that defines the infectious propagation, and the individual variation in the number of secondary cases. Uncertainty quantification tools were employed to define the transmission patterns. Zuo et al. [26] proposed a statistical model comparing the COVID-19 dynamics in several Asian countries. Car et al. [5] investigated COVID-19 dynamics from time series, building a dataset for training a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network and showing that artificial intelligence could have a good agreement with real data. Susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) models are an interesting approach to deal with the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, especially coronavirus transmission. Wu et al. [25] investigated Wuhan, China case, evaluating domestic and international spread outbreak. Lin et al. [15] proposed a model considering individual reaction, governmental action and emigration. The model is based on the original work of He et al. [10] that proposed a model to describe the 1918 influenza. Savi et al. [21] investigated the SEIR model applied to different countries, exploiting some aspects of Brazilian scenarios.",

Since it is possible that this general scenario is persisting for an unknown period of time or new coronavirus variants appears, it is required that governments need to implement alternative strategies, known as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), to contain the spread of coronavirus infection in the population. These strategies include governmental interventions related to the close of education system, induce social isolation and voluntary quarantine.

In the sequence, numerical simulations are carried out investigating different scenarios. All simulations consider a population of N = 209.3 million and an initial state with 1 infected (I 0 = 1) and 250 exposed persons (E 0 = 250), relative to February 25, 2020. Parameters listed in Tables 1 and 3 are employed in all the simulations [9, 17] . An average value of fatality rate C D C I \u00bc 0:05 is adopted based on Brazil actual data. Values adopted for a i consider three moments associated with governmental action (0, 15 and 45 days), representing that the effect of two events that occurred from the moment of the first infected person was identified and the present moment when the paper is being written. In the first event, which occurred after 15 days, some regions of the country implemented actions of social isolation, such as closing the schools/universities and adopting remote work. One month after, there was a relaxation of the social isolation, which has been maintained until May 2020. Figure 4a presents the infected population and cumulative deaths evolution obtained from numerical simulations and real data obtained from Worldometer [23] , showing that the same trend of the other cases is followed, being enough to have a general scenario. Figure 4b presents the evolution of other variables of the model. which characterizes distinct scenarios. The following parameter values are adopted: 0.00, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80 and 0.90. These scenarios represent different conditions associated with fixed governmental actions adopted at the end of the first 90 days that are maintained until the end of the year. It should be noticed that the curves have dramatic different values, and therefore, the number of infected and deaths presents huge differences. There is a huge reduction in both numbers with the increase in social isolation. In addition, there is an important qualitative change related to the infectious population. The social isolation produces an infectious dynamics with a peak followed by a decrease to small numbers, called peakvanish case, as shown in Fig. 5b for a between 0.60 and 0.90. On the other hand, the lack of social isolation produces a curve with a plateau characteristic observed in Fig. 5b for a between 0.00 and 0.50, which means that the critical period is spread over the time. Figure 6 presents the detailed views of the dynamics of populations of current infected and cumulative deaths highlighting some characteristic behaviors. Once again, it is evident that the number of involved populations is dramatically different for each kind of governmental action. The difference of the two possible behaviors, characterized by the peak-vanish and plateau behaviors for the current infected populations, is also observed.",

Figure 7 shows the evolution of the population that needs hospital assistance and does not receive it considering different scenarios defined for the distinct governmental actions treated on the previous simulations. Figure 8 presents the evolution of all populations involved on COVID-19 dynamics. In general, it is noticeable the same qualitative behavior observed for the populations in the previous simulations for all The decrease in the social isolation is associated with the increase in the infected and death populations. In addition, infectious population presents an important plateau behavior that is related to an increase in deaths. Once again, it can be observed that different governmental actions result in dramatically different numbers of infected and cumulative deaths. Figure 9 highlights some characteristic behaviors of the dynamics. The left panel shows the populations of current infected and cumulative deaths, whereas the right panel shows the population that needs hospital assistance and does not receive it. As for the previous cases, the number of involved populations is dramatically different for each kind of governmental action, and two possible behaviors, characterized by the peak-vanish and plateau behaviors for the current infected populations, are also observed. Table 5 summarizes the results showing a worst scenario of 2.5 million deaths (close to 1.2% of the Brazilian population) and a best scenario of 43,331 deaths, an even more dramatic difference when the hospital infrastructure is incorporated into the analysis. Results show that the limitations of the hospital infrastructure cause more than 30,000 infected individuals inside the group that needs hospital assistance maybe left without access, a condition associated with a high fatality rate. Figure 10 shows a comparison between numerical results considering two situations relative to the specific hospital infrastructure required to deal with the COVID-19. The first set of results (Unlimited Hosp. Infrastructure) considers an ideal condition where there is no restriction of the hospital infrastructure to assist part of the infectious that needs hospital assistance, whereas the second one (Limited Hosp. Infrastructure) considers situations where restrictions are defined by the total number of available intensive care units (ICUs). Numerical results confirm that the absence of this infrastructure largely increases the number of deaths since the population that needs assistance does not receive it. This increase in the deaths from 846,833 to 2,498,629 (for a = 0.00 after 90 days) is an emblematic situation associated with an increase of more than 200%.",

Current infected, cumulative deaths and the part of the infectious that needs hospital assistance but does not have access due to the lack of infrastructure, I H , are shown illustrating how the reduction in the hospital infrastructure impacts the disease dynamics. The presented scenarios show a persistent crisis on the hospital infrastructure characterized by the plateaus pattern.",

            "text": "Several possibilities for the social isolation have been discussed worldwide. One promising scenario involves the combination of triggering hardening/softening actions [9] . Figure 14 shows the population evolutions considering Cases 1-6. Cases 1-5 are associated with cyclic governmental actions. These actions result in multiple subsequent infection waves. Case 6 represents a condition where a governmental hardening action is implemented after 90 days, followed by a progressive softening action. For this situation, the increase in the infectious population during the second wave, together with the limitations of the available hospital infrastructure, results in more than 8000 infected individuals within the group who needs hospital assistance. This contributes to a larger number of deaths that could be avoided. These scenarios show that social isolation combined with proper hospital infrastructure can drastically reduce the number of deaths. Table 7 summarizes these results, showing a worst scenario of 340,934 deaths and a best scenario of 58,831 deaths, indicating that a reduction in the number of deaths is possible with a proper isolation strategy controlled by governmental action. Figure 15 highlights some characteristic behaviors of the population dynamics of the current infected and cumulative deaths for some cases associated with cyclic governmental actions, whereas Fig. 16 presents results for a hardening action followed by a progressive softening action. The left panel shows the populations of the current infected and cumulative deaths, whereas the right panel shows the population that needs hospital assistance and does not receive it. Results show multi-peak behavior followed by vanish or plateau behaviors for the current infected populations. As a highly contagious disease, COVID-19 requires the implementation of governmental actions in the very beginning. Previous analysis has shown the difficulties to control or reduce the number of infectious and deaths if nothing is done at early stages. With the objective to analyze the importance of the implementation of a rapid response, three approaches involving early governmental actions are considered: Constant, Progressive and Cyclic. In the first one, a constant action is adopted from the beginning of the intervention; the second considers a progressive reduction in the action until a value of 0.50 is reached; and the third one considers a cyclic variation between two levels of action with a period of two months. For all the cases, the governmental action begins in the 15th day. Table 8 presents the cases description, and  Table 9 summarizes results for the three approaches. Due to the early actions taken, none of the 9 cases presented a condition of lack of hospital infrastructure for the part of the infectious population requiring specific assistance. Figure 17 presents the evolution of the current infected (left panel) and the cumulative deaths (right panel).",

There is also no shortage of hospital infrastructure for the part of the infectious population requiring assistance. Overall, the Constant approach presents the best results associated with a smaller number of cumulative deaths at the end of the period, but with the cost of maintaining a severe level of social isolation during a long period of time. The use of an initial a value of 0.90 results in a similar behavior for the three approaches, with a number of cumulative deaths lower than 200. For initial values of a of 0.70 and 0.80, the Progressive approach reveals the effect of a second wave (as in Case 6 of the previous analysis), resulting in a large number of deaths. A similar behavior is observed considering the Cyclic approach for a = 0.70, where many deaths are observed due to a second and a third infectious waves. However, for a = 0.80 the Cyclic approach furnishes lower values of cumulative deaths, similar to the constant approach. Therefore, it can be an interesting alternative to replace the constant approach with the advantage of imposing a less severe governmental action and, therefore, a condition of less severe social isolation over the whole period.",

The proposed model considers the following novel aspects: The removed populations are composed of recovered and death populations; population that needs hospital assistance is incorporated allowing the analysis of the lack of hospital infrastructure. A benchmark case is treated considering available data from China. Afterward, Brazilian case is analyzed. Initially, a verification case is performed for both cases with available data showing the capability of the model to describe real data. Afterward, different scenarios are of concern investigating governmental actions and hospital infrastructure, evaluating their evolution until the end of 2020. Numerical simulations clearly show that social isolation, guided by governmental and individual actions, is essential to reduce the infected populations and the total period of the crisis. Results based on actual data show that the number of deaths can vary from 40 thousand to 2.5 million depending on the social isolation level and the hospital infrastructure. In addition, early governmental actions are essential to ensure smaller population infectious and the absence of shortage of hospital infrastructure for the part of the infectious population requiring assistance, for which numerical simulations indicate a total number of deaths below 200. Therefore, simulations present differences from 200 to 2.5 million deaths, showing that a central coordination is essential to save a huge number of lives. Different qualitative behaviors can be expected depending on social isolation levels. On the one hand, it is possible to observe a peak-vanish infectious curve representing a rapid dramatic crisis. On the other hand, COVID-19 dynamics can present a plateau behavior, spreading the crisis for a long period of time, being even more dramatic in terms of the number of deaths. Subsequent waves are also possible, establishing even more dramatic scenarios. Although the mathematical model can be improved in order to include more phenomenological information that can increase its capability to describe different scenarios, it should be pointed out that numerical simulations seem to be coherent with available data, being an important tool that can be useful for public health planning.",
