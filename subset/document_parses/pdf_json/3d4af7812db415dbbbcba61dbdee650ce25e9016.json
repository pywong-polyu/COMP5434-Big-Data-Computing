The within-host model represents the innate immune response, and the between-hosts model signifies the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered) epidemic model. The major contribution of this paper is to break the chain of infectious disease transmission by reducing the number of susceptible and infected people via transferring them to the recovered people group with vaccination and antiviral treatment, respectively. Both transfers are considered with time delay. In the first step, optimal control theory is applied to calculate the optimal final time to control the disease within a host's body with a cost function. To this end, the vaccination that represents the effort that converts healthy cells into resistant-to-infection cells in the susceptible individual's body is used as the first control input to vaccinate the susceptible individual against the disease. Moreover, the next control input (antiviral treatment) is applied to eradicate the concentrations of the virus and convert healthy cells into resistant-toinfection cells simultaneously in the infected person's body to treat the infected individual. The calculated optimal time in the first step is considered as the delay of vaccination and antiviral treatment in the SEIR dynamic model. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle in the second step, an optimal control strategy is also applied to an SEIR mathematical model with a nonlinear transmission rate and time delay, which is computed as optimal time in the first step. Numerical results are consistent with the analytical ones and corroborate our theoretical results.",

There are many drugs to treat influenza, but the immune system is naturally the first defensive line against the disease. Therefore, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that trigger the immune system response and how this response affects the overall spread of the disease. The innate immune response plays an important role in the control and clearance of pathogens following viral infection inside an individ-ual's body. However, in the majority of virus-infected individuals, the innate immune response is insufficient because viruses use different evasion strategies to escape the immune response. Innate immunity plays a critical role in the control of viral infection because most infectious pathogens are eliminated through innate immune response without necessarily requiring the activation of adaptive immunity [2] .",

Differential equation models are the most popular methods to simulate critical diseases' immunological and epidemiological dynamics [3] . In addition, the use of mathematical modeling of the innate immune response interpreting experimental results has made a significant contribution to this field. Many mathematical models of the immune response to IAV infection have been introduced that considered both different aspects of the immune system and different detail levels. The first mathematical model to illustrate the within-host dynamic of IAV in infected mice was developed in 1976 by Larson et al. [4] . The proposed compartmental model includes seven compartments with five associated rate parameters. Also, the virus population dynamic was introduced in mathematical terms. Another model introduced by Bocharov and Romanyukha [5] studied immune responses to viral infections in human infections, such as the influenza A virus, and considered 12 immune populations. Also, Baccam et al. [6] described the viral kinetics of influenza A during infection in the human body, including target cell and the innate interferon response with delayed virus production through infected cells. However, as opposed to previous papers, which did not consider a complete model of the innate immune system, we used a more comprehensive one adapted from [7] .",

            "text": "However, the disease's impact within the community and the relationship between people in society also need to be examined. Mathematical models are instrumental in explaining and quantifying epidemic dynamics. Hence, various mathematical models have been proposed in the following for between-hosts epidemic models to provide a general overview of strategies to be employed in the period of influenza virus infection. Kermack and McKendrick created one of the simplest types to explain epidemic dynamics that is called SIR (susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, respectively). The proposed model was described in three papers in 1927 [8] , 1932 [9] , and 1933 [10] . Moreover, in [11] , another type of epidemic model (SIS) is considered with a nonlinear incidence rate and time delay. In addition, four different control strategies are investigated and compared, including optimal control to decrease the density of infected individuals, increase that of susceptible ones, and reduce relevant costs. Besides these, in [12] , a model of the relationship between two types of systems is formulated and analyzed. The first dynamic is the within-host model dynamic and focuses on cellular interactions. The second is the between-hosts model dynamic that focuses on transmission and infection statuses that are governed by the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. Likewise, in this study, motivated by the previous paper, a combined model with different relationships is presented that will be discussed in detail in the following sections. The authors in [13] have used the sliding mode control on the SEIAR dynamic to overcome the uncertainty of parameters. However, they have not considered the optimal time to eradicate the infection in society, and they only refer to the betweenhosts dynamic. For this reason, since time is one of the priorities in order to control disease, we use an optimal control strategy to get the optimal time to cure the infected person and recover the susceptible person.",

In [16] , an optimal control method is applied to a generic model of a pathogenic attack on the innate immune system. The minimization of a quadratic cost function is generated by numerical optimization. Terminal optimal time control is also investigated. For further studies, the readers are referred to [2] , and the references therein introduce an optimal control model based on an ordinary differential equation system. Some studies have investigated the optimal control of SIR and SEIR models, but we mention just some of them in the following. The authors in [17] used an optimal control approach to an SIR epidemic model with a time delay to minimize the spread of infected individuals and maximize the number of susceptible and recovered individuals. Likewise, in [18, 19] , optimal control is considered to minimize the level of infection at the terminal time for an SIR and SEIR model, respectively, where the incidence rate is an unspecified nonlinear function, while their models only consider one aspect of the impact of the disease that affects the community and the relationship between susceptible, infected, and recovered people.

Also, the authors in [35] have considered an optimal control strategy in the age-structured SEIRQ model for the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil, where the quarantine entrance parameters are the control efforts of the system. In the same way, to explore the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, the necessary optimality conditions are introduced in [36] using the optimal control theory in a mathematical model. Some optimal control strategies with application to COVID-19 are also introduced in [37] , for further study. This paper investigates the correlation between two modeling aspects: the effect of the disease on society and inside the individual's body, which is an important issue. The community includes four groups (SEIR), all of which relate to each other in a community. All communications occur only in the community and among individuals. In contrast, there are some interactions among the cells inside an individual's body. Recovering the susceptible by vaccination takes time that is considered as delay caused by the length of converting the healthy cells into resistant-to-infectious cells. Also, the infected people need to be treated with antiviral treatment to recover, which is also considered as a delay (the length of time to kill the infected and partially infected cells and viruses and convert the healthy cells into resistant-to-infection cells simultaneously).",

This paper introduces a multiscale model in which both innate immune responses (within-host model) and the SEIR dynamic (between-hosts model) are used simultaneously to define a single system. A multiscale-type model has already been presented in [12] , with the difference that the proposed model in the present study is more comprehensive and concisely describes the relationships between the virus, cells, and the immune system. The model is also more realistic and closer to the real world. Moreover, a nonlinear sinusoidal transmission rate (contact rate) is considered, which varies in time according to changes in contacts between people throughout day and night. In this study, the optimal control is used to eradicate the infection at the optimal time in the community. As discussed in Introduction, different papers have been published on the subject of optimal control. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, an optimal control approach that simultaneously tackles both types of dynamics (within-host and between-hosts) for epidemic models has never been considered in the literature before.",

According to Figures 1 and 2, our multiscale model considers two scales: the first is the interaction of the virus and innate immune response within a host (inside the body), and the second is the contact between susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals in society. The dynamic of the innate immune response and relationship between cells and other components are now described in detail. The within-host model dynamic is the innate immune response to the influenza virus using a mathematical model. This model is based on interferon-induced resistance to infection of respiratory epithelial cells and the clearance of infected cells by natural killers with seven state variables (the numbers of healthy (U H ), partially infected (U E ), infected (U I ), and resistantto-infection cells (U R ) and IFN-I molecules ([IFN]), natural killer cells \u00f0K\u00de, and virus particles \u00f0V\u00de). Also, a nonlinear SEIR epidemiological model for influenza is given where the nonnegative state variables S\u00f0t\u00de, E\u00f0t\u00de, I\u00f0t\u00de, and R\u00f0t\u00de are the susceptible, exposed, infected (symptomatic), and recovered compartments, respectively. Here, S\u00f0t\u00de represents the number of people that are susceptible but not infected with influenza, E\u00f0t\u00de denotes the number of people exposed to influenza (infected but not yet infectious), I\u00f0t\u00de denotes the population of infected humans with infectious influenza symptoms, R\u00f0t\u00de is the number of recovered people from influenza, and N is the total population size. The relationship between the two epidemic models is shown in Figures 1 and 2 . The dynamics of the innate immune response and SEIR epidemiological model is described further in the following sections.",

Thus, in the next sections, the model in the presence of vaccination and antiviral treatment is simulated compared to the model without the controller. Consequently, the susceptible individual, which includes healthy cells, will be recovered against the infection. Converting the healthy cells into the resistant-to-infection cells takes time, which is considered as delay in recovering process of susceptible individuals in the SEIR model. In Section 4, initially, the optimal time of healthy cells converting into resistant-to-infection cells in the susceptible individual's body has been obtained. Numerical simulations suggest eight days as the optimal time to convert the healthy cells into the resistant ones in a susceptible person's body (see Figure 9 ). The proposed optimal time will be considered as a delay of moving susceptible people to the recovered people group in the SEIR model in the next section. Figures 10(a) and 10(b) show the effect of control input (vaccination) on the number of healthy and resistant-toinfection cells. There is a surge in the number of resistantto-infection cells during vaccination in eight days. After vaccination, it can be deduced that rising in the resistant-toinfection cell numbers is associated with the reduction in the healthy cell numbers, indicating the controller efficacy. As mentioned, as the number of resistant-to-infection cells increases moment by moment, the susceptible person eventually becomes immune to the disease after eight days because the healthy cells in his/her body have all become resistant.",

Eventually, it remains stationary at a constant value (less than 2,000 people). Besides, the number of recovered people without any controller is greater than their number in the control-based strategy. The number of recovered people has reached more than 10,000 because in the absence of effective treatment, more people become infected, and as a result, more people will be recovered.

This section is aimed at conducting the sensitivity analysis to identify the factors that noticeably affect the number of people engaged in influenza. Therefore, the changes in the value of parameters \u03b2\u00f0t\u00de, g, and k are investigated, respectively. The tremendous influence of contact rate cannot be neglected. The susceptible people get infected if they have more contact with infected people; as a result, the epidemic widely spreads. Thus, the contact rate has to be considered as a critical parameter in the epidemic containment process. To this end, the value of the contact rate is changed from 0:6 \u03b2\u00f0t\u00de to 1:4 \u03b2\u00f0t\u00de to observe its impact on the population size in each engaged group.
