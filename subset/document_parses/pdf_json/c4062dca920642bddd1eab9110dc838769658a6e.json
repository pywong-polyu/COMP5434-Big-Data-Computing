In the later stages of the pandemic, these rates rose continuously, especially as vaccination rates are lower in some groups of minors [3, 4] . Similar to other countries, both Austria and Turkey later decided to implement different forms of restrictions (\"lockdowns\") on the population's interactions and movement, with the goal of slowing or stopping the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions such as school closures or curfew could be expected to cause some distress among children and young adults, leading to personal crises [5, 6] but might affect different groups to different degrees.",

School closures may be especially difficult for youths, as social contact plays an important role in their psychological development and well-being. Therefore, pandemic restrictions may have a negative impact on the well-being of younger individuals [7, 8] . During the pandemic, psychological stress, violence, aggression, and poverty increased in many families due to a number of factors [9] [10] [11] , potentially including the need for home-schooling [7] . Furthermore, the pandemic has led to a severe reduction in the provision of child mental health care, child welfare, and child protection resources [9] . A number of studies consequently reported that psychological problems among children and adolescents have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [12] [13] [14] . During the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the rate of child labor, sexual abuse, neglect, and pregnancies among adolescents was relatively high, indicating that pandemics might create severe risks besides the deterioration of mental health for children [15] .",

Subjects were recruited via different social media channels and by reaching out to institutions such as youth centers, which work with adolescents and young adults. The inclusion criteria for both Austria and Turkey were (a) age between 15 and 25 years, (b) residence in either country, and (c) sufficient German or Turkish language skills to understand the survey and provide informed consent. In total, 3665 individuals participated in the study, though we only included complete responses. While the first survey was conducted at the height of the pandemic (T1), the second survey was conducted at the beginning of the second wave (T2). We compared data from both waves, examining mental health, psychological well-being, and experiences, as well as subjective fears and cognitions related to the pandemic, between migrants and non-migrant (native) populations in both countries. Participants were split into four groups based on their selfreported backgrounds (Austrian natives, migrants living in Austria who are independent of citizenship status (Austrian migrants), Turkish natives, and migrants living in Turkey who are independent of citizenship status (Turkish migrants) which were first assessed separately (cross sectionally) at the two time points, as due to data safety restrictions, it was not possible to provide follow-up of the same (identical) individuals in both T1 to T2. We did not distinguish by time living in the country or by participants being a member of the first or second generation in the migrant groups, as we expected these additional factors to overburden the already complex structure of the groups included. For T2, the same recruitment methods were used, and our results confirmed a similar group composition to T1 was obtained, as expected.",

(1984) [30] , which consists of 22 items on 6-point Likert scales, divided into 6 subscales: anxiety, depressed mood, positive wellbeing, self-control, general health, and vitality. The PGWB captures the general well-being during the last month, but for this study, we extended the query to refer to the last two months to cover the quarantine time at the outset of the pandemic. Importantly, and in line with the manual, all subscales of the PGWB are scored in a way that higher values indicate greater well-being (i.e., a higher score in the anxiety and depression subscales means fewer indications of anxiety and depression). The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was further measured using items to assess sociodemographic data and individual experiences and changes during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine periods. These items included the deterioration of mental health because of the COVID-19 pandemic (response options: 1 = improved, 2 = deteriorated, 3 = unchanged), a proxy item for socioeconomic status (financial problems because of COVID-19 pandemic (1 = yes, 0 = no), and COVID-19-related conditions: ruminations about COVID-19, fear of being infected, fear relating to infection of a family member, belief that pandemic restriction measures were exaggerated, and estimated severity of COVID-19 risks (all on 5-point Likert scales, ranging from 1 = never to 5 = always). The same questionnaires were used at both time points. All study participants provided electronic informed consent with the agreement of their parents before starting the online survey. The structured online survey took approximately 10 min to complete, while only data with a complete set of responses were included.",

The main effects of time (i.e., wave 2 compared with wave 1) clearly showed that as the pandemic progressed, the estimated severity of COVID-19 infection (b = 0.18, p = 0.003), the fear of the individual being infected (b = 0.30, p < 0.001), and the fear of the infection of a family member (b = 0.15, p = 0.011) were rated higher across all four groups. Ruminations about COVID-19 also increased across all four groups (b = 0.49, p < 0.001).

Previous studies [34] [35] [36] have demonstrated that females are more vulnerable to developing mental disorders during this pandemic, as well as more commonly having depressive symptoms [36] [37] [38] and anxiety [39, 40] when compared with males. As in many other countries, migrants in Turkey generally have a lower socioeconomic status and face poverty more frequently when compared with native (non-migrant) populations [41, 42] , therefore, the financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected them more severely. The outbreak of COVID-19 also affected economic activities such as foreign trade and tourism, which were greatly restricted during the pandemic for several months, with a disproportionate impact on economically weaker groups in Turkey, compared with Austria. Unfortunately, the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have led to an economic crisis in Turkey [43] . The comparison of PGWB from wave 1 to wave 2 showed a decrease in all subscales (depression, personal well-being, self-control, general health, and vitality). However, among migrants living in Austria, anxiety levels increased from wave 1 to the early part of wave 2. We suppose that the increased risk of infection and the more common adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in minority groups, compared with the native population, may have led to increased anxiety in migrants [18, 19] . In the Turkish sample, natives and migrants had a more pronounced deterioration in all subscales of the PWGB from T1 (wave 1) to T2 (onset of wave 2) when compared with Austrian natives. On the contrary, Austrian natives reported quite similar symptoms in the subscales of PGWB from wave 1 to wave 2, even though their personal well-being improved. While female Austrian migrants reported a worsening in the subscales of personal well-being, self-control, and general health, females in the Turkish sample showed a deterioration in all subscales of the PGWB. Similarly, in all study groups, financial problems were associated with lower values in all subscales of the PGWB. In line with our results, diverse studies have demonstrated that females, migrants, and people with low socio-economic status are especially vulnerable to the adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic [21, 35, 44] , which may probably have led to decreased well-being among these groups.",

In contrast, female migrants living in Austria showed lower values in only three subscales (estimated severity of COVID-19 infection, fear of infection of a family member, and ruminations). During the course of the pandemic and the resulting lockdown measures, all four study groups were significantly more apprehensive about COVID-19, as their attitudes toward the severity of COVID-19 infection, fear of being infected themselves, or of a family member were higher during wave 2, compared with wave 1. Similarly, in all four study groups, ruminations about COVID-19 significantly increased between the two waves. Our results, therefore, indicate a higher risk of psychological problems and need of support during wave 2 instead of increased resilience and coping.",

In Turkey, the measures that were set to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic were relatively stringent when compared with those in Austria. In Turkey, youths up to 20 years had a mandatory 24 h curfew for several months, as well as a general ban on people going out during the weekend. In Austria, stringent curfew measures limiting people to their houses were not effectively implemented and controlled, even during the strictest regulatory periods. Though the measures were not as strict as those in Turkey, Austrian natives were still the only group to report that the measures addressing COVID-19 were exaggerated. In contrast to the native Austrians, migrants in Austria did not view the measures as excessive. We suppose that migrants living in Austria mostly originate from low-and middle-income countries, where collectivism and respect for intervention by authorities in everyday life are more common (e.g., Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, etc.), than in Austria, where the culture is more individualistic (or particularistic). Therefore, they might be more open to unquestioningly accepting restrictions and consequently did not perceive the measures associated with the pandemic as excessive. Although in Turkey, the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic were much stricter, both natives and migrants did not assess the measures to be too harsh.",

Furthermore, due to privacy concerns, we could not follow up the same exact participants from T1 to T2 and could only use a similar group to explore the impact of the course of time and the pandemics on migrant and non-migrant populations. We further had to limit the definition of subgroups, not making a distinction between migrant groups from different cultures, or between first-and second-generation migrants. These factors will require further research and an even larger sample than the already sizeable one used in this study. Our results also could only reflect data from two countries, one with higher income and one with lower average income, as well as with different, more specific cultural, economic, and other social factors that could lead to different results in other countries. Still, we believe that our data can be used as a good indicator of possible risk factors and problems in both high-and low-economy countries. As similar groups, if not the same individuals, were used to compare T1 during the height of wave 1 and T2 early in wave 2, results and our conclusions might have been influenced by differences in group composition as to age, gender, or socioeconomic status and might also have to be followed up by further research.",

It is certain that some forms of restrictions were required to slow the COVID-19 pandemic, but we should also examine the potential adverse impact on the mental health of young individuals: \"collateral\" damage of both the pandemic and restrictions. Necessary restrictions must be justified and weighed against the negative impacts and limitations on individual freedoms. During the pandemic, young people were especially vulnerable to psychological problems [13, 14, 46] , especially those with preexisting mental health problems [21] . Consequently, these minors must be seen as more vulnerable, with an increased need for support and therapy [47] . This implies that in Europe a strong \"recovery plan\" for children and adolescents to cope with the mental health impact of current or future pandemics should be carefully prepared with consideration to minority needs and vulnerable groups and should be implemented as soon as possible. This recovery plan should be able to repair psychological problems among minors to avoid the further manifestation of mental health problems as well as other adverse consequences such as academic deficiency, unemployment, and poverty [47] .",
