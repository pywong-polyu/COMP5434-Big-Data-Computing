With ubiquitous Internet, connected sensors and actuators, networking and communication technology, and artificial intelligence (AI), smart cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide services rendering assistance to humans in their daily lives. However, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) pandemic has exposed and highlighted the limitations of current technological deployments to curtail this disease. IoT and smart connected technologies together with data-driven applications can play a crucial role not only in prevention, continuous monitoring, and mitigation of the disease, but also enable prompt enforcement of guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks. In this paper, we envision an IoT-enabled ecosystem for intelligent monitoring, proactive prevention and control, and mitigation of COVID-19. We propose different architectures, applications and technology systems for various smart infrastructures including E-health, smart home, smart supply chain management, smart locality, and smart city, to develop future connected communities to manage and mitigate similar outbreaks. Furthermore, we present research challenges together with future directions to enable and develop these smart communities and infrastructures to fight and prepare against such outbreaks. and identified 9,661 positive cases.

The prediction model can be biased towards elderly people if the number of patients in smart nursing home are more than smart child care.

In such scenario, sensor based partitions of each room will allow a gap among the kids and will allow only one or two kids in each partitioned area to maintain the distance among them.

Thus, we propose various case studies deploying novel smart devices and data driven applications to present a holistic view of IoT-enabled smart architectures for fighting COVID-19 outbreaks. We have divided our scenarios into five broader categories: E-Health, Smart Home, Smart Supply Chain, Smart Locality and Smart City, as described in the following subsections.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "discussed how UV Disinfection (UVD) robots are used to disinfect patient rooms and operating theaters in hospitals and trials are underway in Florida. Autonomous robots can also help in healthcare systems as virtual clinic, smart guard and food service. Similarly, smart cameras for continuous monitoring (patients, inventory, hospital resources, peak hours, etc.), and smart alarm and notification systems can be installed at various points in the hospital, for example, when a new patient arrives in hospital as new case or transfer from another hospital or areas. In addition, the patients should be able to remotely request assistance from hospital room/bed when they feel uncomfortable or need assistance. As such having these IoT sensors and devices connected through edge computing and Cloud platforms enabling an intelligent connected medical facility communication network of things as part of smart hospital are essential in such pandemic situations.Some COVID-19 patients have high-risk enough to warrant quarantine but not serious enough to warrant smart hospital care. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned that mild-symptom patients who are tested positive from COVID-19 should follow self-quarantine protocol.Hospital practitioners can monitor and track such patients remotely. All the vital data for the patient including body temperature, BP level, pulse rate, coughing frequency, ECG, etc. can be collected using wearable IoT sensors and the data collected is stored securely in a central cloud. Patient, family members and hospital practitioners can monitor and track the data and analyze through IoT applications in their smart phones but should be granted different levels of access control due to security and privacy concerns.In addition, machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches can be applied to this data to detect current and predicted critical conditions of a patient, and inform the hospital emergency staff members or autonomous smart ambulance regarding whether to bring the patient to the hospital. Patient can also receive in-build corrective recommendations regarding medicines and extra precautions at home. Family members can use IoT applications to monitor and communicate with the patient.Apart from the common wearable sensors, other smart devices including inhalers, insulin pen (only for diabetes patient), infrared body temperature, or connected indigestible sensors can be used in a E-Health scenario. The frequency of smart inhaler use by a patient can be monitored remotely through the cloud. If frequency exceeds a threshold, alert can be send to hospital practitioners. Similarly, family members of the patient can also be monitored by hospital practitioners to detect early symptoms of COVID-19. Local public health administration staff can only view the location of patient to monitor and enforce social distancing during self-quarantine. If patient violates the protocol of self-quarantine, smart applications can send alerts to local public health administration and hospital staff. Furthermore, if the person goes out during his quarantine time and breaks any guidelines, the wearable device can initiate a notifications that sound repeatedly and loudly to inform the others in the vicinity. Local workers can access the records of patient's history of movements to help them quickly identify the cross-infected areas and possibly infected coronavirus patients in a swift and timely manner. Boston hospital 30 developed an innovative coronavirus testing booth to keep healthcare workers safe while swabbing possibly infected patients and conserve PPEs. A smart testing booth can involve multiple sensors like infrared large scale body temperature sensor, no contact oxygen level sensors with red, green, and blue (RGB) camera, RFID scanners and AI based smart cameras. Single person at a time can enter one side of the glass-walled testing booth and identified through RFID tag based wearable device or face recognition camera. In-built sensors in the booth can record person's body temperature and oxygen level and store the data on cloud storage. An individual can receive the result of COVID-19 test through a phone application and also set an alert on his wearable device for test results.Some other IoT applications and services in the context of E-Health are discussed here. Smart ambulance can provide virtual on-board assistants to help patients and find optimal paths, using ML services to the Hospital, in case of emergency. Smart parking at hospital can tremendously reduce the parking search and wait time for the patients. IoT sensors and data can provide a smart parking management system.

High latency, response time, packet loss, and low bandwidth are various parameters in a network that affect the usability and feasibility of IoT systems. These devices generate large volumes of data which results in surge in data traffic that causes network congestion and latency.Due to high latency, it is not recommend to perform any computation on centralized cloud for critical healthcare services in an emergency situation. End-users and front line responders prefer computation on edge devices and cloudlets to lower the wait and offer real time analytics. Research and advancements in distributed edge computing technologies, and low latency networking and communication protocols are essential to enable continued success of IoT-enabled smart environments. Data can be stored on multiple edge devices to improve processing efficiency and response time as IoT devices become more widely used and consume bandwidth. Typically high energy consumption required by mobile communications is a serious hurdle to large scale IoT deployments of use case scenarios.

For example, there are several smart home assistants (e.g., Google Home, Alexa) that users can choose from, however, these devices use different communication protocols and are connected to vendor specific clouds. Interoperability among IoT devices has been an issue since the beginning of smart ecosystem deployments. The heterogeneity among billions of IoT devices adds to the challenge of developing smart connected communities. While in computer systems, TCP/IP is a standard suite of protocols that enable any system to communicate with other systems. In IoT, such developments are still lacking.Another critical issue is how to reduce redundant smart devices. An effective solution to this problem would be to develop federated IoT and cloud architectures that can communicate with any type of sensors and devices. For instance, in different smart domains, a user received multiple wearable smart bracelets in smart communities. It will be challenging to keep track all alerts through their corresponding IoT applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop federated IoT architectures to enable federation across multiple smart devices and applications which can allow access and data communication across multiple IoT platforms. The research[90] suggested that IoT cloud provider allowed all devices belonging to the same private/public owner to participate in the federation process. However, currently many devices do not support other manufacturer's application platforms. For instance, in a smart home, all sensors and devices are connected through home assistant, and AI assisted application sends notification to home assistant. Due to interoperability or compatibility issue, home assistant could not receive the notifications from all devices.
