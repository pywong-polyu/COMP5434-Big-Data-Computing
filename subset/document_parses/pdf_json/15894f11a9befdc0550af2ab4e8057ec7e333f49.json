Lingard advises that in this conversation, authors need to persuade the reader and reviewer of the strength, originality and contributions of their work [7] . In constructing a persuasive rationale, ECRs need to clearly distinguish between the qualitative research phenomenon (i.e. the broad research issue or concept under investigation) and the research context (i.e. the local setting or situation) [5] . The introduction section needs to culminate in a qualitative research question/s. It is important that ECRs are aware that qualitative research questions need to be fine-tuned from their original state to reflect gaps in the literature review, the researcher/s' philosophical stance, the theory used, or unexpected findings [8] .

            "text": "Also, in the introduction of a qualitative paper, ECRs need to explain the multiple \"lenses\" through which they have considered complex social phenomena; including the underpinning research paradigm and theory. A research paradigm reveals the researcher/s' values and assumptions about research and relates to axiology (what do you value?), ontology (what is out there to know?) epistemology (what and how can you know it?), and methodology (how do you go about acquiring that knowledge?) [9] ECRs are advised to explicitly state their research paradigm and its underpinning assumptions. For example, Ommering et al., state \"We established our research within an interpretivist paradigm, emphasizing the subjective nature in understanding human experiences and creation of reality.\" [10] Theory refers to a set of concepts or a conceptual framework that helps the writer to move beyond description to 'explaining, predicting, or prescribing responses, events, situations, conditions, or relationships.' [11] Theory can provide comprehensive understandings at multiple levels, including: the macro or grand level of how societies work, the mid-range level of how organisations operate; and the micro level of how people interact [12] . Qualitative studies can involve theory application or theory development [5] . ECRs are advised to briefly summarise their theoretical lens and identify what it means to consider the research phenomenon, process, or concept being studied with that specific lens. For example, Kumar and Greenhill explain how the lens of workplace affordances enabled Table 1 Five key criteria for the quality of qualitative research (adapted from Lincoln and Guba, 1995) Plausibility -relates to how congruent the findings are with reality and how believable and trustworthy the research is (i.e. is the research plausible?) Relevancyrelates to whether others can easily determine if the findings can be applied to other settings (i.e. is the research relevant to other situations and contexts?) Consistencyrelates to whether the study methods and procedures have been documented in a way that they can be adequately scrutinised and replicated and there is coherence between different parts of the research (i.e. is the process consistent and aligned?) Transparency -relates to whether the researchers have been open, explicit and clear about the methods and procedures, including changes to planned methods, and their own biases and preconceptions (i.e. is the process visible?) Currencyalthough not solely applicable to qualitative research, this relates to whether the research is appropriately situated in contemporary debate and discussion (i.e. is the research timely?)

In contrast, methods are specific research techniques and in qualitative research, data collection methods might include observation or interviewing, or photo elicitation methods, while data analysis methods may include content analysis, narrative analysis, or discourse analysis to mention a few [8] . ECRs will need to ensure the philosophical assumptions, methodology and methods follow from the introduction of a manuscript and the research question/s, [3] and this enhances the consistency and transparency elements. Moreover, triangulation or the combining of multiple observers, theories, methods, and data sources, is vital to overcome the limitation of singular methods, lone analysts, and single-perspective theories or models [8] . ECRs should report on not only what was triangulated but also how it was performed, thereby enhancing the elements of plausibility and consistency. For example, Touchie et al., describe using three researchers, three different focus groups, and representation of three different participant cohorts to ensure triangulation [14] . When it comes to the analysis of qualitative data, ECRs may claim they have used a specific methodological approach (e.g. interpretative phenomenological approach or a grounded theory approach) whereas the analytical steps are more congruent with a more generalist approach, such as thematic analysis [15] . ECRs are advised that such methodological approaches are founded on a number of philosophical considerations which need to inform the framing and conduct of a study, not just the analysis process. Alignment between the methodology and the methods informs the consistency, transparency and plausibility elements.",

This addresses the relevancy element. To further enhance plausibility and relevance, ECRs should situate their work clearly on the evaluation-research continuum. Although not a strictly qualitative research consideration, evaluation focuses mostly on understanding how specific local practices may have resulted in specific outcomes for learners. While evaluation is vital for quality assurance and improvement, research has a broader and strategic focus and rates more highly against the currency and relevancy criteria. ECRs are more likely to undertake evaluation studies aimed at demonstrating the impact and outcomes of an educational intervention in their local setting, consistent with level one of Kirkpatrick's criteria [16] . For example, Palmer and colleagues explain that they aimed to \"develop and evaluate a continuing medical education (CME) course aimed at improving healthcare provider knowledge\" [17] . To be competitive for publication, evaluation studies need to (measure and) report on at least level two and above of Kirkpatrick's criteria. Learning how to problematise and frame the investigation of a problem arising from practice as research, provides ECRs with an opportunity to adopt a more critical and scholarly stance.",

Unlike quantitative research which claims that knowledge is objective and seeks to remove subjective influences, qualitative research recognises that subjectivity is inherent and that the researcher is directly involved in interpreting and constructing meanings [8] . For example, Bindels and colleagues provide a clear and concise description about their own backgrounds making their 'lens' explicit and enabling the reader to understand the multiple perspectives that have informed their research process [18] . Therefore, a clear description of the researcher/s position and relationship to the research phenomenon, context and participants, is vital for transparency, relevance and plausibility. We three are all experienced qualitative researchers, writers, reviewers and are associate editors for BMC Medical Education. We are situated in this research landscape as consumers, architects, and arbiters and we engage in these roles in collaboration with others. This provides a useful vantage point from which to provide commentary on key elements which can cause frustration for would-be authors and reviewers of qualitative research papers [19] .",

As an example, Barratt et al., found important data to inform the training of medical interns in the use of personal protective equipment during the COVID 19 pandemic [21] . ECRs are also expected to address the \"so what\" question which relates to the the consequence of findings for policy, practice and theory. Authors will need to explicitly outline the practical, theoretical or methodological implications of the study findings in a way that is actionable, thereby enhancing relevance and plausibility. For example, Burgess et al., presented their discussion according to four themes and outlined associated implications for individuals and institutions [22] . A balanced view of the research can be presented by ensuring there is congruence between the data and the claims made and searching the data and/or literature for evidence that disconfirms the findings. ECRs will also need to put forward the sources of uncertainty (rather than limitations) in their research and argue what these may mean for the interpretations made and how the contributions to knowledge could be adopted by others in different contexts [23] .
