Virus immunology and its effects on the immune system have been studied in several studies [1] . Despite lots of trials for evaluating the effectiveness of different potential medications, therapeutic options for treating COVID-19 with promising effects are still lacking. There is still no general agreement on what protocols to apply for treatment of the disease [2] . In addition, since the disease is tremendously contagious, its clinical features are diverse. symptoms in the patients are highly severe, and successful handling of the conditions is a challenging effort [3] [4] [5] . Clinical trials are nowadays conducted to carry out experiments with medications such as antivirals, corticosteroids, immunomodulatory agents, and anti-helminthics. Despite this, there is still no optimal strategy for treatment and definite cure, specifically in dealing with severe cases [2, [6] [7] [8] Evidence indicates the contribution of the overactivity of the immune system, including cytokine release syndrome, to more severe symptoms and multiorgan failure of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 [9, 10] . Moreover, studies have found associations between the rise of TNF-\u03b1 and severe COVID-19 cases [11, 12] . Accordingly, TNF-\u03b1 blocking can possibly be a favorable intervention in modifying COVID-19 [12] .",

There may be a role for this medication in severe COVID-19 cases with increased TNF-\u03b1 levels. CRP levels were significantly lower in the adalimumab group after 3 days, which may indicate anti-inflammatory effects of adalimumab in this regard. Considering the inflammatory effects of COVID-19 in the lungs, TNF-\u03b1 levels might be higher in the lungs than the systemic levels and this could explain the rational for reduced CRP levels after 3 days in the adalimumab group. The number of white blood cells and TNF-\u03b1 levels were decreased after 3 days. However, this reduction was not statistically significant.
