Local, state or federal authorities require patients and/or health care personnel to be tested upon hospital admission or on a regular basis. Other applications include testing of visitors before entry into nursing homes or visiting public venues. Traditionally, these tests are performed by NAAT, e.g. RT-PCR or transcription-mediated amplification. However, NAAT-test resources are limited and a routinely performed NAAT-test requires several hours, professional laboratory equipment as well as laboratory skilled personal. Frequent und ubiquitous testing for SARS-CoV-2 poses one of the central elements of the German nationwide pandemic response-e.g. for school children or working environments without options for home office. In this context, the evaluation of various test systems and the implications of their (negative) results in terms of reliability, quality and usability is essential and has to take the above presented findings including limitations into account. Thus, there is a clear need to increase testing capacity with easy-to-perform tests that can be done by low-trained personal, do not require specialised equipment and provide quick results. One solution could be the increased use of antigen tests based on lateral flow immunochromatography and a large number of tests have been introduced in the market in recent months. Manufacturer-reported test characteristics are favourable: the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices lists 312 tests with sensitivities of > 80% and specificities > 97% as compared to PCR [6] . An independent comparative evaluation is underway under the auspices of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute [9] . In collaboration with WHO, the Foundation of Innovation for New Diagnostics (FIND) summarises data from independent evaluations of in-vitro diagnostics and diagnostic performance data including rapid point-of-care COVID-19 antigen tests [10] .",

            "text": "However, we could not confirm these favourable test characteristics in clinical practice. Analysing > 3000 samples with concurrently generated NAAT-results, which is by far the largest series to date, we find a low overall sensitivity of < 60%. Sensitivity was even lower (< 50%) in asymptomatic persons. Even in patients with suspected high viral loads (as determined by PCR testing with a Ct < 25), the test sensitivity of 74% is far from being optimal-or even in the manufacturer-reported range. This is well in line with earlier, much smaller series: Liotti et al. [11] report an overall sensitivity of 47%, and Paul et al. [12] report an overalls sensitivity of 71%, with slightly better results (sensitivity 86%) in symptomatic cases, but even worse performance (sensitivity 39%) in asymptomatic patients. Furthermore, FIND published clinical data from Brazil (n = 453) and Germany (n = 676) with equal or better test performance results (clinical sensitivity: 69.2% and 77.5%; clinical specificity: 96,9% and 97,9% respectively). For Ct-values under 25 the sensitivity even improved up to 87,9% and 100% [13] . These differences between the performance stated by the manufacturer and the actual performance are due to several factors. Firstly, manufacturer-reported data are generated on a well characterized sample set for which the results are known, and the test is performed by highly trained personnel, who often have been involved in test development. These personnel know how to read the tests and are well aware of potential pitfalls, e.g. how to interpret weak bands or other forms of ambiguous results. Secondly, pre-analytical factors are much less a concern in controlled laboratory settings than under real-life conditions. For example, in the busy and often turbulent environment of a large emergency department, the procedure of taking nasopharyngeal swabs may be performed differently by different people. Hence, the quality of the sample may vary widely. This may be much less a concern in highly sensitive tests like NAAT, who will probably give positive test results even in suboptimally generated samples. It may, however, seriously impact on results of less sensitive antigen tests. Of course, one may argue that medical staff should be obliged to respect preanalytical standards and perform sample collection as requiredbut as we all know, this is hardly possible under certain circumstances.",

In a clinical environment the combination of both concepts can facilitate the daily routine. For example, patients with negative Ag-testing can be transferred to a non-COVID ward but should be separated until the NAAT-result is available. Obviously, antigen-testing cannot replace standard hygiene precautions like distancing, hand hygiene or using face masks. However, one has to keep in mind that it is currently unclear how test positivity (by any test) translates into clinical infectiousness. It has been shown that infectiousness of samples in cell culture decreases with decreasing viral loads measured by PCR [14] .

This maximises the chance that patients are tested in the phase of high viral loads, where antigen tests have maximum sensitivity. Infected patients can then quickly be isolated and further transmissions from these patients can be prevented. Importantly, it does not matter if individual patients are overlookedeven when only half of the transmission chains are identified and index patients are isolated from the population, this effectively reduces transmission in the population as a whole and may be sufficient to reduce the reproduction rate to < 1, eventually leading to elimination of the virus from the population.
