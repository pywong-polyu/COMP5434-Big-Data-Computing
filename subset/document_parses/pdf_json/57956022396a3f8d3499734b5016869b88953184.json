Children have been found to have a far lower risk of developing acute respiratory disease requiring hospitalization and intensive care, with the exception of children with specific underlying medical conditions such as obesity [11, 12] . Nevertheless, children are at greater risk of the post-infectious hyperinflammatory disease 2-8 weeks following asymptomatic or symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 [13] . In accordance with the aforementioned case definitions, those with MIS-C have a persistent fever, at least two organ systems affected, and elevated inflammatory markers without alternate explanation [9, 10] , although most patients have at least 4 organ systems involved [14] .

Further, there were 99 reported cases of MIS-C by CDC criteria in the state [9, 16] . At our institution, we developed a multidisciplinary protocol developed to assist in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of MIS-C, modeled from American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines [13] . Patients suspected of having MIS-C are evaluated by pediatric infectious disease and pediatric rheumatology in addition to the pediatric hospitalist and/or intensivist teams. Initial labs and work-up were obtained in accordance with our institutional algorithm (see details in Methods section below and Additional file 1: Appendix A). During hospitalization, MIS-C patients are routinely monitored with daily inflammatory, cardiac, and coagulation labs. Additional subspecialty consults were provided as indicated. Our treatment consists of supportive care, anticoagulation with aspirin, low-molecular weight heparin, or heparin, and immunomodulatory agents including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), steroids, and anakinra, as determined by the multidisciplinary team. Here, we report the clinical aspects, patterns, and outcomes observed at our institution between April 2020 and February 2021 while caring for children with MIS-C.",

Urinalysis was obtained to evaluate for sterile pyuria and identify alternative causes for fever and inflammation. COVID-19 testing obtained included nasopharyngeal PCR and serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), which at first was a total antibody anti-nucleocapsid assay and later included anti-spike protein IgG. Brands and versions of the PCR and IgG tests used evolved over time based on test availability and performance. Any patients admitted to the hospital with suspicion for MIS-C underwent further laboratory evaluation, including coagulation studies (prothrombin time [PT] , internationalized normal ratio [INR] , and partial thromboplastin time [PTT]), procalcitonin, triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine kinase, and peripheral blood smear. If initial COVID-19 PCR testing was negative, a full respiratory pathogen panel (if not already performed), blood culture, and urine culture were performed to identify alternative etiologies.

One patient required readmission for recrudescent fevers and increase in inflammatory markers after completing a 6-week oral corticosteroid taper.

One unusual finding in comparing the PICU vs non-PICU group features is the lower incidence of a reported prior COVID-19 history in patients admitted to the PICU.

Mean hemoglobin was found to be lower in the PICU group; however, the interpretation of this finding is uncertain, especially given that normal ranges for hemoglobin vary by age. Anemia has been frequently described in critical care settings as well in inflammatory states, and the etiology of anemia in our cohort may be multifactorial: iatrogenic (more frequent blood draws, dilution from fluid resuscitation), anemia of acute inflammation, and possibly preexisting anemia of iron deficiency [21] . Our small cohort and retrospective study design do not allow us to delineate between these potential causes. On average, BNP was greater in the PICU group than the non-PICU group.

Elevations in ferritin are commonly associated with inflammatory and immune dysregulation states. This, in combination with the increased AST, is reminiscent of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS). These immune dysregulation disorders have previously been reported secondary to viral illness [22] and so it may follow that MIS-C may have a similar pathophysiological basis with SARS-CoV-2 as a trigger. Procalcitonin was also substantially elevated in the ICU patients; this may be a biomarker of multiorgan dysfunction, as excretion of procalcitonin is mediated by the kidneys. However, procalcitonin was elevated in patients who did not have documented renal dysfunction, and may therefore be a biomarker for disease severity in MIS-C.",

Pulse dose corticosteroids were used in patients with critical illness requiring inotropic medication and positive pressure ventilation, or extensive changes on echo including extensive coronary artery dilation or clinically significant effusion. Those with severe presentation, continued decline, or poor response to other therapies were additionally treated with anakinra. Statistically significant differences were found between the PICU and non-PICU groups with usage of inotropes and anakinra. Our institution restricts inotropes to the critical care or emergency department setting, and the majority of the patients cared for in the PICU required inotropic support. We followed the suggestion of early ACR guidelines for anakinra implementation in MIS-C. Our greater reliance on anakinra is likely attributable to the pediatric rheumatology department's familiarity with using anakinra in managing diseases like systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) [23] . Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist that is more commonly used to treat autoinflammatory diseases including systemic JIA, cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes and even HLH/MAS [24, 25] . A common pathogenesis of those diseases is an exaggerated innate immune response with the hallmark of an amplified IL-1 cytokine signaling [24, 25] .",

He additionally developed profound multiple organ dysfunction and required CRRT, with subsequent hemodialysis. Prior medical history was notable for autism, obesity, and mild intermittent asthma. Unfortunately, our cohort also included one patient death. This patient experienced severe shock with cardiogenic, septic, and distributive features. After a brief period of clinical stability, the patient experienced rapid deterioration and was found to have superimposed gram-negative septicemia. This subsequently led to ECMO due to catecholamine resistant shock. This was complicated by profound intracranial hemorrhage and the patient's family elected to withdraw technological support. The etiology of the patient's superimposed bloodstream infection is uncertain, although multiple mechanisms were proposed. It is possible that the patient's degree of shock led to microangiopathic ischemic changes to the intestinal mucosa that allowed for dissemination of enteric bacteria into the patient's bloodstream. Further, the patient was substantially immunosuppressed with both pulse and high dose corticosteroids, and anakinra, making her more susceptible to opportunistic infection.

However, the degree of inflammation was not as marked as is typically noted in HLH/ MAS, leading credence to MIS-C as a separate disease process with potentially overlapping pathogenesis. Outcomes in our patients were overall favorable while using anakinra which suggests it has a role in management of severe MIS-C when refractory to IVIG and corticosteroids.",
