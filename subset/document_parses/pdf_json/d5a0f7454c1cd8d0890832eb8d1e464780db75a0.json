Shih and Kaesberg found that RNAs 1, 2, and 4 are monocistronic while RNA3 is dicistronic. Although early infectivity studies showed that RNA3 encodes coat protein (CP), trypsin degradation analysis showed that the principal translation product of RNA3 was unrelated to CP, while RNA4 served as an excellent template for CP. Moreover, when mixtures of all BMV RNAs were added to wheat germ extracts in increasing amounts, RNA4 inhibited translation of genomic RNAs 1-3. These results showed that RNA4 is a subgenomic CP mRNA derived from RNA3, and implied an elegant system of gene regulation by translational competition: early in infection when viral RNA concentrations are low, all viral proteins including nonstructural RNA replication factors are translated, while after the virion RNAs are sufficiently amplified, CP is preferentially translated to encapsidate these RNAs.",

RNA sequencing (a challenging, chromatography-based process at the time) revealed that the two fragments were 5 0 -terminal, overlapping, and encoded the first 4 and 14 amino acids of CP, respectively. The most distinguishing feature was that the initiating AUG codon for CP began only 10 nucleotides (nt) from the m 7 G 5 0 ppp 5 0 Gp-capped RNA4 5 0 -end, presaging the now well-known mechanistic linkage between most eukaryotic translation initiation and 5 0 -mRNA caps.",

Using a transcribable BMV RNA3 cDNA clone, the CP open reading frame (ORF) was replaced with the ORF of the bacterial reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). When in vitro transcribed and inoculated onto barley protoplasts with RNA1 and RNA2 transcripts, this RNA3 derivative was replicated and produced CAT activity at higher levels than previously achieved by DNAbased transformation. This first demonstration that RNA viruses can be engineered at the cDNA level showed that the viral RNA genome functions in a sufficiently flexible and modular fashion to tolerate even large changes such as whole gene replacements without substantial optimization, which has significant implications for virus evolution, basic research and biotechnology applications such as development of additional gene expression vectors.",

In 1979, Hall and colleagues developed a virus-specific in vitro RdRp extract from BMV-infected barley leaves that synthesized full-length negative-strand RNAs using added BMV virion RNAs as templates. This was the first eukaryotic in vitro RdRp preparation exhibiting a high level of template specificity, with other viral RNAs having less than 20% of the template activity of BMV RNAs.

Immunogold labeling and electron microscopy localized 1a, 2a pol , and nascent BMV RNAs to the spherule interiors, which remain connected to the cytoplasm by a narrow neck. Protein 1a is sufficient to induce these spherules, and immunogold and biochemical studies show that each spherule contains from one to a few hundred 1a proteins and 25-fold fewer 2a pol proteins.

BMV RNA 3 0 -ends were also found to interact with (ATP, CTP):tRNA nucleotidyl transferase, which can add 3 0 -CCA OH ends to mature or maintain incomplete BMV RNAs, thus acting as a primitive telomerase. Beginning in the 1970s with work by Dasgupta and Kaesberg, further sequencing, enzymatic structure probing, and three-dimensional computer modeling showed that the 3 0 200 nt of all BMV RNAs were strongly conserved and folded into an extended, tRNA-like structure with at least two alternate forms that differed in pairing nt near the 3 0 with local or distal partners.

Deletion analysis revealed that, in addition to 3 0 -and 5 0 -sequences required for negative-and positive-strand RNA initiation, BMV RNA3 replication in vivo requires a segment of 150 nt in the 5 0 -half of the intergenic noncoding region between the 3a and CP ORFs (Figure 1) showed that this region is required for a step prior to negative-strand RNA synthesis, and is necessary and sufficient for 1a to recognize and recruit an RNA to a membrane-associated, translationally inaccessible, nuclease-resistant state that appears to be the spherule interior. Structure probing studies show that this intergenic RNA3 sequence folds into a long, bulged stem loop, which presents at its apex the invariant sequence and structure of tRNA TCC stem loops. In plant and yeast cells, the appropriate BMV residues in this consensus are modified to T and C, showing that, like the 3 0 -end, this sequence interacts in vivo with tRNA-specific enzymes. Moreover, any mutations to this TCC stemloop mimicry abolish 1amediated template recruitment. Similar stem loops with apical TCC stem loop regions are found at the extreme 5 0 -ends of BMV RNA1 and RNA2, where they similarly direct 1a-mediated template recruitment. As one important aspect of cis-signals in BMV replication, the Kao group in particular has defined and dissected minimal core promoters for negative-strand, positivestrand, and subgenomic RNA synthesis, using a variety of approaches. Among other results, their mutational studies imply that the BMV RdRp-promoter interaction has the characteristics of an induced fit, wherein the RdRp has some tolerance to adjust its binding to a range of promoter variants as long as some key sequence features remain. This model potentially reconciles the specificity of BMV RNA synthesis with the ability of the RdRp to synthesize different forms of viral RNA from separate promoters with distinct primary sequences and secondary structures. Kao and associates further found that DNA or DNA/RNA hybrid templates containing the key BMV promoter sequences can be recognized in vitro by BMV RdRp extracts and copied into RNA. Although the efficiency of copying DNA templates is 15-fold lower than for BMV RNA templates, these results have significant potential implications for virus evolution.",

In 1984, Miller, Hall, and colleagues showed that a BMV RdRp extract produced subgenomic RNA4 in vitro when supplied with negativestrand RNA3 templates, and that the product RNA4 could be labeled by g-32 P-GTP incorporation, demonstrating de novo initiation. This first elucidation of a pathway for subgenomic mRNA synthesis appears to provide a meaningful precedent for similar subgenomic mRNA synthesis by many positive-strand RNA viruses, and an important foundation for understanding the diversity of alternate mechanisms that has begun to emerge with the demonstration of distinctly different subgenomic mRNA synthesis pathways used by coronaviruses, nodaviruses, and some other positive-strand RNA viruses.",

Cryoelectron microscope reconstructions by Baker and collaborators and subsequently X-ray crystallography by McPherson and co-workers showed that the BMV capsid structure is extremely similar to that of the related bromovirus, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), whose capsid structure was solved by Johnson and colleagues in 1995. Intriguingly, some features of these capsids are dissimilar from other known isometric RNA virus capsids, but similar to capsids of the DNA-containing papovaviruses. These features include orientation of the core b-barrel nearly perpendicular to the capsid surface to form distinctively prominent hexameric and pentameric capsomeres, and linking of adjacent capsomere clusters by exchange of invading C-terminal arms. These shared features suggest that BMV CP and the CPs of polyoma-and papillomaviruses likely share a common ancestor. BMV virion RNA is arranged as an interior subshell inside the capsid, leaving a hollow virion center. The N-terminal 26 amino acids of the CP, which are highly basic and required for RNA packaging, interact with the RNA to neutralize its charge.",

This assembly polymorphism is controlled in vivo by the RNA packaged, with BMV RNA2 packaged in 180-subunit capsids, while a small chimeric mRNA containing the CP ORF as its only BMV sequence is packaged in 120-subunit capsids. Structural features shared by 120-and 180-subunit capsids imply that a common pentamer of CP dimers is an important intermediate in BMV virion assembly.",

Host adaptation of 3a generally exerts the predominant effects on infection spread, and only a few amino acid changes in 3a are required to extend BMV host range from monocotyledonous to dicotyledonous plants. However, changes modulating the efficiency of systemic spread also map to 1a and 2a pol . Such changes may alter systemic spread through host-specific effects on RNA replication, as by influencing the ability of the virus to replicate and spread faster than host defense responses. Alternatively, 1a and 2a pol may possess additional functions, as for some C-terminal 2a pol sequences that are dispensable for RNA replication but required for efficient systemic infection.",
