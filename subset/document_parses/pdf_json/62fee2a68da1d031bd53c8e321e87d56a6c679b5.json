Immune infiltration analyses suggested that the scores of macrophages, monocytes, DC, Th1, Treg, and plasma cells in the HCM group were significantly decreased, while CD8 + T cells, basophils, fibroblasts, and platelets were significantly enriched. Module analyses revealed that STAT3, as the hub genes in HCM together with LYVE1 + CD163 + macrophages, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCM while there were no obvious gender differences in the HCM samples from selected datasets. Verification analyses performed on GSE130036 and clinical samples showed a strong positive correlation (Spearman correlation = 0.7646) and a good co-localization relationship between LYVE1 and CD163, suggesting the potential function of LYVE1 + CD163 + macrophages in maintaining the homeostasis of cardiac tissue.

A wide range of opinions have suggested that the focus of HCM research should be shifted from singlegene hypotheses to alternative and complementary mechanisms, and novel determinants of HCM should be reviewed and identified in a comprehensive manner from the perspective of network medicine (5). The immune system can not only play the role of immune surveillance, maintaining normal physiological functions in the steady-state heart, but also mediate adverse inflammatory reactions and myocardial remodeling after injury (6) (7) (8) . Studies have shown that the myocardium of HCM patients shows inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis (9) . From the mechanism point of view, cardiac hypertrophy, as a pathological stimulus, will, in turn, cause inflammatory signal transduction and immune cell activation, thereby affecting heart function (7) . It is still unclear whether this process will be independent or coordinated with the main pathogenic sarcomere mutation genes and thus interfere with the clinical course and prognosis of HCM patients. Above all, more extensive identification of key pathways and non-sarcomeric mutationrelated pathophysiological mechanisms in HCM is very necessary and urgent.",

Also, to examine the co-localization relationship between key gene and target immune cells in cardiac tissue, we conducted immunofluorescence staining on cardiac tissue harvested from multi-organ donors whose hearts were refused because of incipient coronary plaque formation in the left descending coronary artery. Heart tissues were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 \u2022 C for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-\u00b5m sections. A section from each heart was blocked with 1% BSA PBS buffer and stained with target fluorescent antibody. Finally, these sections were stained with DAPI to visualize the nuclei and viewed with confocal fluorescence microscopy. The protocol of the study was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (METC number: 2016S124).",

Exploring the mechanism of the key immune cells and pathways in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy can clarify the specific role of the immune system in the maintenance and imbalance of cardiac function to a certain extent, so as to provide potential therapeutic targets on future cardiovascular immunotherapy. It is well-known that macrophages have strong plasticity and will be polarized in response to different environmental stimuli during development (22) . A widely used paradigm is defined as \"classical\" activated macrophages M1 and \"alternative\" activated macrophages M2 based on their function (23) . Macrophages M1 are usually pro-inflammatory cells involved in the initial inflammatory reaction, while macrophages M2 have anti-inflammatory effects and are closer to the characteristics of steady-state resident tissue macrophages (RTM) (24, 25) .",

In the healthy heart of adult mice, macrophage accounts for about 5-10% of the total number of non-cardiomyocytes, while in the resident CD45 + immune cells, it accounts for up to 80% (26) . With the deepening of research, the biological functions of cardiac RTM continue to expand. In a healthy heart, cardiac RTM is involved in promoting the development and maturation of coronary arteries in the embryonic stage (27) , promoting atrioventricular node electrical conduction (28) , and maintaining myocardial mitochondrial homeostasis (29) . After the heart of newborn mice is injured, the RTM in it inhibits bad ventricular remodeling by promoting the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and the formation of blood vessels (30) . In adult MI model mice, removal of cardiac RTM resulted in worsening of heart function and bad ventricular remodeling (31) . Therefore, cardiac RTM not only participates in the maintenance of healthy heart tissue homeostasis but also participates in the repair of the heart after injury. Considering the significant number of macrophages in cardiac tissue together with its important organ-specific functions, it is necessary to further explore their phenotypes, functions, and dynamic changes between steady-state cardiac with disease-state. LYVE1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1) is one of the main receptors of hyaluronic acid in the body. Previous studies have found that LYVE1 is highly expressed on the basal surface and inner surface of lymphatic endothelial cells, and it participates in regulating the entry of immune cells from tissues into lymphatic vessels by combining with the hyaluronic acid coating on the surface of inflammatory cells (32) . Deletion of Lyve1 in mice will prevent entering and traffic of leukocytes through the lymphatic endothelium, causing worsening of chronic inflammation and long-term deterioration of cardiac function (32) . Recently, based on single-cell transcriptome analysis, Chakarov et al. found two cardiac RTM subgroups in mice identified by LYVE1 low and LYVE1 high . LYVE1 low cardiac RTM is mainly distributed around nerve fibers with the strong ability of antigen presentation, while LYVE1 high cardiac RTM is mainly distributed around capillaries with possible anti-fibrosis function (33) . Together, the existing research results have already hinted to us the possibility that LYVE1 + macrophages may serve as homeostatic markers in cardiac tissue. Our results further suggest that the reduction of CD163 + LYVE1 + macrophages may be an important process for the pathogenesis of HCM; it may act as a bridge between the heart's immune system and the lymphatic system to maintain the steady-state function of the heart. The process of pathological myocardial hypertrophy could mediate cardiac dysfunction and long-term damage by interfering with this connection, thereby affecting the clinical symptoms and prognosis of HCM patients. STAT3 is one of the members of the STAT family and can be expressed in various tissues and organs, including myocardium (34) . In recent years, a number of studies have found that STAT3 and its related signaling pathways play a key regulatory role in the pathophysiological processes of cardiovascular system, such as myocardial hypertrophy (35) , ischemia-reperfusion injury (36) , and myocardial fibrosis (37) . Several lines of evidence have indicated that members of the IL-6 family are able to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via gp130-mediated STAT3 activation while deletion of IL-6 weakened transverse aortic constrictioninduced ventricle hypertrophy together with marked attenuation of STAT3 activation (35) . Our analysis results suggest that more in-depth research is needed to explore the relationship between STAT3-related pathways and the pathogenesis of HCM, so as to provide ideas to further search for related treatment strategies.",

Studies have shown that female HCM patients are generally older, have more severe obstructive symptoms than male, and are at higher risk of progression to heart failure or death (38) . However, the specific mechanism of this phenomenon is still unclear. We grouped HCM samples by gender and performed differential expression analysis and found that DEGs were mainly related or linked to sex chromosomes, while MYL4 and VIT were found to be slightly upregulated in the cardiac tissue of male patients, and NPPA was upregulated in female. It is reported that the percentage of MYL4-positive cells in male ventricular myocardium is higher, and it is also moderately related to HCM (39) . However, there is still no evidence to prove the specific mechanism of gender regulating MYL4 expression in ventricular tissues. NPPA is often considered to be a marker of cardiac hypertrophy, and its elevated levels may be related to worsening cardiac function (40) . The level of NPPA in the ventricular tissue of female HCM patients was significantly higher than that of males, suggesting that the female patients analyzed had a higher degree of deterioration of cardiac function, which was similar to the aforementioned clinical statistical results. VIT (vitrin) encodes an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein and its connection with HCM and gender has not yet been reported, and further exploration is needed. We also explored whether there is a difference in the expression of CD163 and LYVE1 in HCM patients of different genders, and the results showed that there is no significant difference in the expression of the two genes between male and female. Based on the above analysis, we temporarily believe that the differences in the clinical manifestations and prognosis of HCM between male and female may be more related to differences in diagnosis and clinical pathways caused by social, genetic, and endocrine factors, but still, more in-depth research on gender differences in HCM patients is needed.",

A total of 339 samples are included to comprehensively analyze the state of immune cell infiltration in HCM and the correlation between immune cells. In addition, we built a network to screen for genes that play a key role in HCM and validated the results by verifying the dataset GSE130036 and the collected clinical samples for immunofluorescence analysis, which made our research results more reliable. In addition, the impact of gender differences in HCM was also explored, but we have not obtained any novel findings. In all, our results indicate the potential important roles of STAT3-related signaling pathway and LYVE1 + CD163 + macrophages in the pathogenesis of HCM. It is worth noting that CD163, as a typical marker of macrophages M2, exhibits a good co-localization and a strong positive correlation with LYVE1. We speculate that the decrease in the proliferation of CD163 + LYVE1 + macrophages or the decrease in the number caused by phenotypic conversion is a key part of the pathogenesis of HCM. It is necessary to study the specific mechanism of the role of this macrophage subset in cardiac hypertrophy, and the development of immunotherapy targeting RTM may help to alleviate heart injury and promote the recovery of heart function.",
