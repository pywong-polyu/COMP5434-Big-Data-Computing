Demographic inference based on coalescent theory has been used to reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary history of several species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an important human pathogen causing tuberculosis. One key assumption of the Kingman coalescent is that the number of descendants of different individuals 35 does not vary strongly, and violating this assumption could lead to severe biases caused by model misspecification. Individual lineages of MTB are expected to vary strongly in reproductive success because 1) MTB is potentially under constant selection due to the pressure of the host immune system and of antibiotic treatment, 2) MTB undergoes repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits from one host to the next, and 3) some hosts show much higher transmission rates compared to the average 40 (\"super-spreaders\").",

MMC have been developed to model scenarios in which the variance in reproductive success is large enough to cause the coalescence of more than two lineages at the same time point on the coalescent time scale (M\u00f6hle and Sagitov 2001, see Tellier and Lemaire 2014 for a review). Some of 80 the underlying discrete generations models leading to MMC allow for very large offspring numbers of one or more individuals in a single generation (Schweinsberg 2003, Eldon and Wakeley 2006) . However, MMC genealogies can also arise if one individual has many descendants in a relatively small number of generations, so that this family leads to multiple mergers after collapsing discrete generations to arrive at the timescale of the continuous time coalescent. In this manuscript, we will 85 refer to \"skewed offspring distribution\" to indicate variation in reproductive success that lead to multiple merger genealogies. For details on how coalescent models arise from discrete generation models we refer to the relevant mathematical literature (Kingman 1982b , Griffith and Tavar\u00e9 1994 , M\u00f6hle and Sagitov 2001 , Freund 2020 .",

Therefore, the MTB genome can be considered as a single genetic locus, and one single genealogy describes the relationships among all MTB strains in any data set. The shape of the genealogy of a sample is influenced by many factors, such as the 155 underlying offspring distribution, sampling scheme, population subdivision, geographic population structure, migration and changes in population size. To avoid these confounding effects, we considered only populations that were unlikely to be affected by population structure, sampling biases, population subdivision and migration. We searched the literature for whole genome sequence (WGS) data sets of MTB where all strains were sampled from a single phylogenetic clade that was restricted to a particular 160 geographic region, and identified eleven studies. Most of these data sets represent single outbreaks (Methods). For each data set, we downloaded the raw Illumina sequences (Sup . Table 1 ) and used a bioinformatic pipeline described in the Methods to identify high confidence SNPs (Table 1) . To test the robustness of our analyses to different SNP call procedures, we performed an additional SNP call altering one key parameter: the minimum proportion of reads supporting a SNP call (from 90% to 75%, 165 see Methods). We found that the allele frequency spectrum (one of the most important statistics, see below) was robust to the different SNP call settings (Sup. Figs. 1-2) . We performed the main analyses (see below) on both data set variants. Since the results were similar, and we consider the SNP call with the 75% threshold less stringent, in the manuscript we report the results for the data sets based on the 90% threshold. The results for the data sets based on the 75% threshold and the comparison between 170 the two different sets are reported in Sup. Table 2 .",

The Beta coalescent was originally introduced to model populations with sweepstakes reproduction (Schweinsberg 2003) , but it was also proposed to capture the genealogies of populations undergoing 180 recurrent bottlenecks and of epidemics characterized by super-spreaders (Tellier and Lemaire 2014, Hoscheit and Pybus 2019) . Lower values of \u03b1 (closer to one) correspond to larger multiple mergers events, and for \u03b1=1 the Beta coalescent corresponds to the Bolthausen-Sznitman (BSZ) coalescent. The BSZ coalescent is an explicit model for genealogies of populations evolving under rapid positive selection, which lead certain families of selected genotypes to have strongly increased sizes compared 185 to the average (Bolthausen and Sznitman 1998 , Brunet and Derrida 2013 , Neher and Hallatschek 2013 .",

            "text": "In our analysis, we focused on local data sets to control for the confounding effect of complex population dynamics and population structure. However, in one case (Lee 2015) , it is possible that some degree of population structure was still present. Lee 2015 is a data set sampled from an epidemic in Inuit villages in Nunavik, Quebec, Canada (Lee et al. 2015b ). Lee et al. (2015b) showed that transmission of MTB among patients was more frequent within a village than between villages, and 265 that related strains tended to be present in the same village. This was supported by the reconstructed phylogenetic tree, which showed three clades separating at the root that could represent distinct subpopulations (Sup. Fig. 14 ; see also Fig. 2 in Lee et al. 2015b) . This data suggests the existence of some degree of geographic population structure. Therefore, we tested whether this might influence the results of our model selection. To do this, we ran two analyses: 1) we repeated the ABC-RF analysis on three 270 subsets of Lee 2015, which represent the three main clades described above (Sup. Fig. 14) . Under the assumptions that the separate branches of the phylogeny reflect different sub-populations, and that migration does not alter the coalescent rates within the sub-populations, the genealogy of each subclade should then follow one of the coalescent models that we are fitting. We found that BETA was the best fitting model for two of the sub-clades, while Dirac was the best fitting model for the third (Table  275 3). The posterior predictive checks showed that the best model could reproduce the data of these three subsets . However, the posterior probabilities were low compared to the complete data set, and the misclassification probabilities were larger. This was probably due to the smaller sample size of the individual subsets compared to the full data set (Table 3) . 2) We performed an additional model selection analysis between three competing models, BETA, Dirac and a third 280 scenario, in which we modeled a structured population with migration and with standard offspring distribution and exponential growth (KM+exp). Also in this case, BETA resulted to be the most likely model (Table 3 , see Methods for details). Overall, our findings indicate that it is unlikely that the MMC signal in the Nunavik MTB population is an artifact caused by population structure.",

In the last few years (since 2013), at least 16 studies applied the BSP to MTB data sets (cited in the 390 Introduction). It was shown before that the BSP can be biased by unaccounted population structure (Heller et al. 2013) , recombination, and non-random sampling (Lapierre et al. 2016) . Hence, we next assessed the impact of skewed offspring distribution on demographic reconstruction with the BSP. To do this, we simulated 50 data sets under the BETA coalescent with constant population size. We used different values of \u03b1 corresponding to the range of values estimated for the observed MTB data sets (\u03b1 395 = 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5; 10 replicates each, see Methods). We then performed an extended Bayesian skyline plot analysis on the simulated data using BEAST2 (Bouckaert et al. 2019) . For 49 of the 50 simulated data sets we found that the 95% Highest Posterior Distribution interval of the number of population size changes did not include zero, thus rejecting the constant population size model (Heled and Drummond 2008) . The inferred skyline plots showed different patterns of fluctuation of the 400 effective population size (Fig. 3, Sup. Figs. 36-40) . These results demonstrate that skewed offspring distribution alone can bias the outcome of the BSP, leading to the inference of complex population dynamics that are entirely due to the violation of the assumption on the offspring distribution.",

In any case, these models are not appropriate for MTB outbreaks, because they model bottlenecks affecting the whole population. Transmission bottlenecks in a MTB population can be thought as multiple serial founder events. To model such processes, one would need 485 to account for both intra-host dynamics within multiple hosts, and between-hosts transmission. Such a model is currently not available, and it is not clear to which coalescent process it would lead. It is possible that the Beta or the Dirac coalescent capture well the main features of the genealogies generated by such a mechanism. However, without an explicit model a formal test is impossible.",

The better fit of MMC models only indicates that one or more processes leading to skewed offspring distribution (on the coalescent time scale) play an 525 important role in shaping the diversity of MTB populations. Moreover, our estimates of \u03b1, the inference of the best fitting MMC models (Beta or Dirac), and whether the best fitting model included an exponential growth component, differed distinctively across data sets. This suggests that different processes, or different magnitudes of the same process, produced multiple merger genealogies in different populations. For example, two of the data sets that had an estimate of \u03b1 lower than 1 530 (corresponding to larger multiple merger events, see Appendix 1) were sampled from different outbreaks with important super-spreading events (Stucki 2015 , Lee 2015 Clade A). Stucki 2015 is a data set representing an outbreak characterized by one key patient that had two distinct disease episodes, separated by three years, both of which resulted in a large number of secondary infections (Stucki et al. 2015) . The data set Lee 2015 Clade A is a sample of an outbreak occurred in an Inuit 535 village in Quebec (Canada), in this case two patients were responsible for 75% of all secondary infections (Lee et al. 2015a , Lee et al. 2020 . This data strongly suggests that for these data sets, the mechanism generating large multiple mergers was the super-spreading behavior of one or few patients.",

While estimation procedures coming from phylogenetics are available in the case of Kingman's coalescent (e.g. Drummond and Rodrigo 2000) , they cannot be applied directly to the case of multiple merger coalescents.

We used different time (re)scaling factors c, such as c 785 determines the time ct at which an individual sampled at real time -t (0 corresponds to the latest sampling time) is added as a new lineage to the coalescent tree (so ct is in coalescent time units). Here, we assessed c by setting the earliest sampling time (highest t) to a fraction c'\u22650 of the expected height of the coalescent tree if there was no serial sampling (so keeping all other parameters, but assuming c=0). For each c' in {0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.75,1,1.5}, we simulated 1,000 simulations under each 790 parameter set (g in {1,10,50,100,250,500,1000,2000}, \u03b1 in {1,1.2,1.4,1.6,1.8,2}, \u03c8 in {0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9] ) and then performed ABC model selection for each simulation (as described above), recording how often the serial coalescent simulations were sorted to which non-serial model class.
