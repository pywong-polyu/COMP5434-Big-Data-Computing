SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share an otherwise non-conserved part of nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3), therefore named as \"SARS-unique domain\" (SUD). We previously found a yeast-2-hybrid screen interaction of the SARS-CoV SUD with human poly(A)-binding protein (PABP)-interacting protein 1 (Paip1), a stimulator of protein translation. Here, we validate SARS-CoV SUD:Paip1 interaction by sizeexclusion chromatography, split-yellow fluorescent protein, and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and confirm such interaction also between the corresponding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and Paip1. The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV SUD (\"macrodomain II\", Mac2) in complex with the middle domain of Paip1, determined by X-ray crystallography and smallangle X-ray scattering, provides insights into the structural determinants of the complex formation. In cellulo, SUD enhances synthesis of viral but not host proteins via binding to Paip1 in pBAC-SARS-CoV replicon-transfected cells. We propose a possible mechanism for stimulation of viral translation by the SUD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses belonging to the subfamily Coronavirinae within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. They comprise four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronavirus (Adams & Carstens, 2012) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), from the genus betacoronavirus, cause severe pneumonia in humans. Both connect with high case/fatality rates. In December 2019, another beta-CoV (SARS-CoV-2, GenBank: MN908947) emerged and spread globally . SARS-CoV-2 leads to the disease called COVID-19. The whole-genome identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is about 80% . In the case of SARS-CoV, it is generally agreed that the 2003 epidemic was caused by a zoonotic transmission of a bat CoV to humans, via an intermediate host such as the civet cat . In case of MERS-CoV, dromedary camels have been shown to act as a reservoir (Reusken et al, 2013) , whereas the relation to similar bat CoVs (e.g., HKU4, HKU5) remains enigmatic at this point. However, the exact zoonotic pathway is still unclear for SARS-CoV-2. The host range of zoonotic RNA viruses is not exclusively determined by the affinity to specific receptors on the cell surface, but also by the ability of the viruses to counteract the antiviral response exerted by the innate immune system of the host. Hijacking essential host-cell functions such as protein synthesis and using them for their benefit also pose intriguing capabilities of the viruses. To assess the zoonotic potential of animal RNA viruses, it is important to characterize such virus-host interactions at molecular detail. In the current study, we investigate the association between a portion of SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3), i.e., the \"SARS-unique domain\" (SUD), and components of the translation initiation complex including poly(A)-binding protein (PABP)-interacting protein 1 (Paip1), PABP, and ribosomes of the host cell.",

            "text": "The SUD was proposed to only exist in SARS-CoV when the first SARS-CoV genome sequences were analyzed (Snijder et al, 2003) . It contains three subdomains: the N-terminal, the middle, and the Cterminal domain, for short SUD-N, SUD-M, and SUD-C. The former two domains each adopt a macrodomain fold, and the latter one has a frataxin-like fold (Tan et al, 2009; Johnson et al, 2010) . Regions similar to the middle and C-terminal subdomains of SUD were found in MERS-CoV, and the C-terminal subdomain also exists in MHV (Chen et al, 2015; Kusov et al, 2015; Ma-Lauer et al, 2016; Lei et al, 2018) . In addition, SUD-like domains occur in bat CoVs related to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, e.g., WIV16 (Yang et al, 2016) or As6526 (Hu et al, 2017) . Therefore, this region is not entirely unique for SARS-CoV, and SUD-N, SUD-M, and SUD-C have now been renamed as macrodomain II (Mac2), macrodomain III (Mac3), and domain preceding Ubl2 and PL pro (DPUP), respectively (Lei et al, 2018) . All these three regions exist in SARS-CoV-2 sharing an amino-acid sequence identity of~75% with SARS-CoV SUD. Hilgenfeld and colleagues have previously shown by reverse genetics that deletion of Mac2 leads to a 65-70% reduction in SARS-CoV replication, whereas Mac3 is absolutely essential for the activity of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (Kusov et al, 2015) . The two-domain protein Mac2-3 interacts with oligo(G) stretches in nucleic acids, sequences which can form G-quadruplexes (Tan et al, 2007; Tan et al, 2009 ). In addition, Mac3 (and Mac3-DPUP) has been reported to bind oligo(A) (Johnson et al, 2010) . Furthermore, Mac2-3 binds to the host E3 ligase, ring-finger, and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1) and promotes RCHY1-mediated degradation of the antiviral protein p53. This, in turn, leads to increased replication of SARS-CoV (Ma-Lauer et al, 2016) .",

            "text": "Using a high-throughput yeast-2-hybrid approach to screen the human proteome with SUD as a bait (Pfefferle et al, 2011) , we have previously identified Paip1, a component of the host translation machinery, as an interacting partner of SUD. Paip1 acts as a positive translation stimulator to regulate the key translation factor PABP in the host translation system (Derry et al, 2006) . Human Paip1 has three isoforms (Martineau et al, 2008) . The N-terminal 112 residues of isoform 1 are partly absent in isoform 2 and completely lost in isoform 3. However, the N-terminal PAM2 motif (PABP-binding motif 2), the middle HEAT repeat domain (Paip1M; HEAT: Huntingtin, elongation factor 3 (EF3), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and yeast TOR1), and the C-terminal PAM1 motif are absolutely conserved between these three isoforms. The PAM2 (including a conserved region of~15 amino-acid residues) and PAM1 (containing an acidic region of~25 amino-acid residues) interact with the C-terminal domain (PABC) and the N-terminal RNA-recognition motif 1 and 2 (RRM1 and 2) of PABP, respectively (Kozlov et al, 2001; Roy et al, 2002; Derry et al, 2006) . The central HEAT repeat domain, Paip1M (219 residues), is not involved in binding to PABP; it adopts a crescent-like shape with 10 a-helices forming five HEAT repeats, which are interrupted by two antiparallel b-strands forming a b-hairpin protruding from the center of the molecule (Lei et al, 2011) . Furthermore, Paip1 interacts with eIF-4A (Craig et al, 1998) . The Paip1:eIF-4A interaction may ensure that only intact mRNAs are selected as translation templates (Craig et al, 1998) . Paip1 also binds to eIF-3 and further stimulates translation (Martineau et al, 2008 (Martineau et al, , 2014 .",

Using SUD (Fig 1A; amino-acid residues 389-720 of SARS-CoV Nsp3; strain: Frankfurt; GenBank: AY291315) as a bait to screen the host proteome, Paip1 (NCBI accession no. NP_877590.1) was identified as a binding partner. In order to confirm this interaction, we performed split-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) assays (Walter et al, 2004) in human cells . In this assay, bait and prey proteins were fused to the N-terminal (YFP N ) and C-terminal (YPF C ) YFP fragments (or vice versa), respectively. If bait and prey proteins interact with each other, the YFP N and YFP C fragments will form the complete fluorescent protein and emit a yellow fluorescence when irradiated at 514 nm. When YFP N -Paip1 and YFP C -SUD were cotransfected into HEK-293 cells, the YFP signal was observed indicating binding of SUD to Paip1 in the cytosol of HEK-293 cells (Fig 1B) . For negative controls, YFP N -Paip1 together with YFP C or YFP C -SUD together with YFP N were co-transfected. In addition to split-YFP, the SUD:Paip1 interaction was also confirmed by a fluorescence-3-hybrid (F3H) assay (Herce et al, 2013 ) (Appendix Fig S1A) . These results demonstrate an interaction between SUD and Paip1 in vivo.",

As described in the introduction, Paip1 contains the Nterminal PAM2, the middle domain (Paip1M), and the C-terminal PAM1 (Fig 1C) . The small PAM2 (about 15 residues) and PAM1 (about 25 residues) domains interact with the C-terminal PABC domain of PABP and the N-terminal RRM1/2 of PABP, respectively ( Fig 1C; Roy et al, 2002; Derry et al, 2006) . As PAM2 is also involved in binding eIF-3 (Martineau et al, 2008) ; it is less likely that SUD interacts with Paip1 through these two small regions as well. The middle domain of Paip1 (Paip1M; residues Thr78-Ser296) contains five HEAT repeats (Lei et al, 2011) . Such motifs are often involved in protein--protein interactions (Yoshimura & Hirano, 2016) . Therefore, we hypothesized that Paip1M is the most likely binding site for SUD. The split-YFP assay confirmed this assumption ( Fig 1D) . Furthermore, quantification of the split-YFP signal showed that the intensities of the signal for Paip1:SUD and Paip1M:SUD are almost identical (Fig 1E) , suggesting that other parts of Paip1 do not contribute to binding SUD. Moreover, an F3H assay also confirmed that Paip1M interacts with SUD in BHK cells (Appendix Fig S1) .",

These results demonstrate that Mac2 is essential for binding Paip1M. We further confirmed the interaction results by gel filtration. Paip1M and SUD were purified separately. Subsequently, these two proteins were mixed with a molar ratio of about 1.2:1 (overnight incubation). The mixture was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography. The peak of this mixture was clearly shifted compared to the peak position of each Paip1M or SUD ( Fig 1G) . Next, we investigated the peak shift in size-exclusion chromatography when Mac2, Mac2-3, Mac3, or Mac3-DPUP was mixed with Paip1M. The gel filtration results showed that Mac2 and Mac2-3 but not Mac3 or Mac3-DPUP with Paip1M displayed a peak shift when compared to the corresponding peak of each single protein (Appendix Fig S2) .

After trying many optimization methods and testing over 240 crystals at the synchrotron, we managed to collect a 3.5-A dataset. Determination of the structure of this complex by molecular replacement failed (search models: Mac2 [PDB entry: 2W2G, Tan et al, 2009] or Paip1M [PDB entry: 3RK6, Lei et al, 2011] ). Next, we prepared SeMet-Mac2 and grew crystals of its complex with native Paip1M. The diffraction from these crystals was even worse; after testing more than 40 crystals, 5.3-A single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data were collected. However,~5-A diffraction data contain, in principle, sufficient information to determine the true structure (Schr\u00f6der et al, 2010) . The structure of the Mac2:Paip1M complex was finally determined by first using the SAD data to position Mac2 in the asymmetric unit and then employing molecular replacement to locate Paip1M.

In case of Mac2, the overall shape of the SAXSderived model fitted well to the crystal structure of the Mac2 domain in Mac2-3 (Tan et al, 2009 ; Fig 2C) . However, the SAXS-derived model exhibited an extra region when compared to the crystal structures of Paip1M and Mac2:Paip1M (Fig 2D and E) . This extension seen in the SAXS-derived model is very likely due to the 17 residues GSHMASMTGGQQMGRGS that remained attached to the N-terminus of Paip1M from the cloning vector pET-28a. This artificial N-terminal extension of Paip1M had not been included in the crystallographic model due to lack of electron density (Lei et al, 2011) . The length of the 17 additional residues was estimated by comparison to the extended region Glu203 to Arg213 of Paip1M. In addition, the R g value of Paip1M is 24 AE 1 A in solution, whereas it is 19 A when calculated from the crystal structure (program CRYSOL; Svergun et al, 1995) (Appendix Table S2 ). The 5 A difference in R g also indicates the larger size of Paip1M in solution compared to the crystal structure. In contrast, only four artificial residues (GSHM) had been added by the cloning procedure to the N-terminus of Mac2.",

In order to further confirm whether this region is essential for the interaction between the two proteins, we deleted the N-terminal 16 amino-acid residues of Mac2 (Lys389-Thr404; this region is shown in green in Fig 2A and contains the segment from the N-terminus to the end of the first a-helix). Named D16-Mac2, this protein failed to form a complex with Paip1M according to the gel filtration assay ( Fig 3A) . Furthermore, we determined the binding affinity and stoichiometry between Paip1M and Mac2 or D16-Mac2 by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments ( Fig 3B and C) . The dissociation constant (K d ) between Mac2 and Paip1M was determined as 15.5 AE 1.5 lM, and the binding stoichiometry was 0.94 AE 0.01 with a single-site interaction between the two proteins. A similar range of K d values between other host and coronavirus proteins (such as human ISG15 and papain-like protease, K d is about 8.6 lM) was reported before (Shin et al, 2020) . On the other hand, D16-Mac2 showed no interaction with Paip1M ( Fig 3C) . The split-YFP and F3H assays confirmed that neither D16-SUD nor D16-Mac2 bind Paip1M in HEK-293 and BHK cells, respectively ( Fig 3E and Appendix Fig S3A) . Taken together, the N-terminal Lys389-Thr404 region of Mac2 is indispensable for the interaction with Paip1M.",

The Mac1-2:Paip1M complex was subjected to the gel filtration (S200 column) assay, and a peak shift relative to Mac1-Mac2 and Paip1M alone was observed (Appendix Fig S3B) .

Therefore, SUD and D16-SUD were planned to be examined for their ability to rescue pBAC-DSUD-REP-Rluc replicon expression. However, for an unknown reason, all of our different D16-SUD constructs (here we only show D16-SUD-RFP and YFP c -D16-SUD as examples) exhibit very little expression (Fig 5B, left image and S4B , middle image) although the mRNA level is normal (Fig 5B, right  image) . It could be speculated that the SUD:Paip1 interaction somehow stabilizes the SUD protein. Alternatively, a rescue assay using the pBAC-DMac2-REP-Rluc replicon together with the Mac2 or D16-Mac2 constructs was carried out in order to find out the function of the SUD:Paip1 interaction for viral expression (Fig 5C) , as Mac2 and D16-Mac2 always have reasonable and comparable expression levels (e.g., Appendix Fig S4B middle image) . The results showed that loss of Mac2, which interrupts the SUD:Paip1 interaction, leads to a~10-fold reduction of SARS replicon expression (Fig 5C, left , lane I vs II). Co-transfection of Mac2 results in about one-third recovery of replicon expression (Lane III vs I), while co-expression of D16-Mac2 cannot rescue the replicon expression at all (Lane IV). In this rescue assay, the RNA levels of the replicons were obviously not regulated (Fig 5C, right) , suggesting that translation instead of transcription caused the difference of luciferase activity in Fig 5C \u25c0 Figure 5 .

Not surprisingly, SARS2-SUD and SARS2-Mac2 interact with Paip1 (Fig 6B and C) . In addition, SARS2-Mac2 but not D16-SARS2-Mac2 bind to Paip1M (Fig 6C) (Fig 6D) . We did not detect interactions of either region with Paip1. . Hence, an outbreak of a SARS-like coronavirus (such as SARS-CoV-2) can occur any time. In addition to receptor usage, the potential of a zoonotic virus to establish itself in a new host will depend on its ability to cope with the innate immune system of this host and possibly with its capability to use the host's protein synthesis machinery for its own benefit. Our study provides new insight on the latter aspect for SARS-CoV by demonstrating that the SUD-N (Mac2) domain interacts with the host cell translation apparatus via Paip1 and increases viral translation. This interaction may offer a new antiviral target. Importantly, the domain corresponding to SARS-CoV SUD exists in SARS-CoV-2 and is identical to 75% at the amino-acid sequence level. The N-terminal 16 residues are almost identical between these two viruses ( Fig 6A) . They are required for binding to Paip1 (Fig 6C) . Fig 6D) ; therefore, the Mac2: Paip1 interaction is involved in the unique regulation of translation in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 but not in MERS-CoV. Our results help better understand the novel SARS-CoV-2 and other new SARSlike CoVs that will possibly enter the human population through future zoonotic events. RNA viruses always seek to stimulate viral RNA translation but inhibit host protein synthesis because of the limited cellular resources as well as a means to block antiviral factor (e.g., interferon) production. However, different viruses utilize distinct strategies owing to the individual features of their mRNAs. For example, rotavirus mRNA is only 5 0 -capped but not 3 0 -polyadenylated ( Fig 7A) . Its NSP3 protein binds to the 3 0 end of the viral mRNA, instead of PABP interacting with eIF-4G, to maintain the closed-loop RNA for the initiation of viral RNA translation and to block host mRNA circularization (Fig 7A, Piron et al, 1998) . Differently, picornavirus RNA lacks the 5 0 -cap but has a RNA stem-loop structure in the 5 0 -untranslated region (5 0 -UTR). The initiation of viral RNA translation is mediated in a cap-independent way by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) located in the 5 0 -UTR (Fig 7B, Mart A Rotavirus RNAs have a 5 0 cap but not a 3 0 poly(A) tail. Its NSP3 protein (instead of PABP) binds to the 3 0 end of the viral mRNA and interacts with eIF-4G directly to maintain the closed-loop RNA for the initiation of viral RNA translation and to block host mRNA circularization (Piron et al, 1998) . B Picornavirus RNA has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 0 untranslated region and a 3 0 poly(A) tail. Viral protease (2A or leader) digests eIF-4G. The truncated eIF-4G shows higher efficiency in the IRESdriven translation than the cap-dependent translation (Ohlmann et al, 1995; Ali et al, 2001) . C Coronavirus RNAs have a 5 0 cap and a 3 0 poly(A) tail. In our model, SUD associates with the 40S/80S ribosome and enhances the PABP:Paip1 interaction to stimulate the host translation machinery. Meanwhile, coronaviral Nsp1 specifically cleaves host mRNAs (green) but not viral RNAs (Kamitani et al, 2006; Huang et al, 2011) . Also, viral Nsp1 blocks host mRNA binding to the 40S ribosome. As a result, SARS-CoV could increase the viral RNA translation but inhibit host mRNA translation. Lei & Hilgenfeld, 2017) , and the truncated eIF-4G works more efficiently on the viral IRES-driven translation than on the host cap-dependent translation (Ohlmann et al, 1995; Ali et al, 2001) , thereby supporting picornavirus protein synthesis. However, coronavirus RNAs have both the 5 0 -cap and the 3 0 -poly(A) tail (Fig 7C) , and are thus similar to the host mRNAs. Coronavirus protein synthesis involves the cap-dependent translation machinery similar to the host (Nakagawa et al, 2016) . Therefore, CoVs cannot use strategies similar to rotavirus or picornaviruses.",

            "text": "In the present study, we confirmed that SARS-CoV Mac2 binds to the host translation stimulator, Paip1 (Fig 1F, Appendix Figs S1B and S2B). We also found that SUD (Mac2-Mac3-DPUP) regulates the mRNA translation level (Fig 5A) . Like host mRNAs, the genomic and sub-genomic RNAs of CoVs are translated in a cap-dependent manner with the RNA cap-to-tail \"closed-loop\" structure Derry et al, 2006; Nakagawa et al, 2016) . The formation of this circular mRNA topology is the rate-limiting initiation step of the host translation process Derry et al, 2006; Sonenberg & Hinnebusch, 2009; Jackson et al, 2010) . The host elements that are involved in the initiation step are important for CoV replication. For example, Cencic et al (2011) reported that replication of human CoV 229E is significantly reduced by blocking the interaction between eIF-4E and eIF-4G. Silencing the PABP gene reduces the production of transmissible gastroenteritis CoV (TGEV) (Gal an et al, 2009) . Binding of PABP to the 3 0 poly(A) of bovine CoV or mouse hepatitis CoV (MHV) is required for virus replication (Spagnolo & Hogue, 2000) . PABP is a key factor by interacting with the 3 0 -poly(A) tail as well as eIF-4G to form \"closed-loop\" mRNA . The Paip1:PABP interaction facilitates this process and enhances the efficiency of PABP (Craig et al, 1998; Derry et al, 2006) . As we mentioned above, SUD generally stimulates the mRNA translation level in HEK-293 cells (Fig 5A, left) but only stimulates the viral translation level in the replicon-transfected cells (Fig 5A, right) . However, three questions should still be answered: (i) How does SUD enhance the translation? As we know, a strengthened Paip1:PABP interaction enhances the translation efficiency (Craig et al, 1998; Derry et al, 2006) . We found that SUD enhances the binding affinity of PABP to Paip1 by about 4.4-fold (Fig EV1) , which potentially stimulates the translational level. It can be speculated that upon binding to SUD, Paip1 adopts a more favorable conformation when forming a complex with PABP. To answer this, it will be interesting to investigate the structure of SUD:Paip1: PABP in the future. (ii) Is SUD associated with the host translational apparatus and does this interaction make SUD-N (Mac2) essential for SARS-CoV? First, we tested the interactions between SUD and ribosomes by a polysome gradient analysis assay (Fig EV2) . We find that SUD co-elutes with a 40S ribosomal subunit marker protein (rps6) in 40S and 80S ribosomes. Initiation factors bind to this complex and facilitate scanning of messenger RNAs and initiation of protein synthesis. We hypothesize that SUD plays a major role for expression of viral mRNAs within the ternary complex with PABP and Paip1. Furthermore, we have previously answered this question in the context of a SARS-CoV replicon where we showed that upon deletion of this domain, SARS-CoV replication was reduced by 65-70% (Kusov et al, 2015) . Here, we further confirmed that loss of the SUD:Paip1 interaction via Mac2 deletion leads to an about 10-fold reduction of viral replicon activity (Fig 5C Lane II vs I) , indicating that the interaction of the domain with Paip1 is critical for viral replication. (iii) The higher activity of the translation system should also increase the production of host proteins. How does SARS-CoV manage to avoid this situation, which would be unfavorable for virus replication? SARS-CoV Nsp1 was reported to specifically promote host but not viral mRNA degradation (Kamitani et al, 2006; Huang et al, 2011) . In addition, recent studies have shown that the C-terminus of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 blocks the mRNA channel of 40S ribosomes (Schubert et al, 2020; Thoms et al, 2020) , therefore blocking the translation of host mRNA. But mRNA carrying the corresponding viral 5 0 UTR can escape from translation suppression caused by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 (Tanaka et al, 2012; Schubert et al, 2020) . Therefore, during infection, the host mRNA gets degraded due to Nsp1 and host translation is blocked by the binding of Nsp1 to the mRNA channel of 40S ribosomes. However, viral RNA with viral 5 0 -UTR can escape the suppression caused by Nsp1. As a final result, although SUD unselectively stimulates translation, only viral but not host translation is enhanced. This also supports our observations that SUD increases viral RNA (replicon) translation but not host gene expression in pBAC-REP-Rluc-transfected cells despite the enhanced activity of the translation machinery ( Fig 5A) .",

SUD binds to 40S/80S ribosome and enhances the interaction between Paip1 and PABP to stimulate the general translation level. Then, viral protein Nps1 not only specifically degrades the host mRNAs but also blocks host mRNA binding to the 40S ribosome, leading to the inhibition of host protein synthesis (Fig 7C) . Considering that the host ribosomes interact with both viral Nsp1 (Schubert et al, 2020; Thoms et al, 2020) and SUD, it will be interesting to investigate further whether these two proteins might regulate the activity of each other.",

            "text": "In the past 17 years, various proteins of SARS-CoV have been used as targets for inhibitor design (Hilgenfeld & Peiris, 2013; Hilgenfeld, 2014; Zumla et al, 2016) , and recently, this has been expanded to SARS-CoV-2 , but only Remdesivir has received limited approval for the treatment of COVID-19. In view of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it should be generally acknowledged now that newly emerging CoVs constitute a great threat to public health and novel approaches to drug discovery are necessary. Identification of new virus-host protein complexes as antiviral targets is a good strategy. However, we should notice that since structures of such complexes are extremely scarce, the development of antiviral approaches targeting such interactions is seriously hampered. To our knowledge, three types of structures of viral and host protein complexes are mainly available for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. One of these is connected with the viral entry step: Structures of the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein in complex with the host receptor ACE2 have been reported (Li et al, 2005; Yuan et al, 2017; Lan et al, 2020; Shang et al, 2020; Wang et al, 2020; Wrapp et al, 2020) . The second type is the structure of the spike protein interacting with a human antibody (Hwang et al, 2006; Prabakaran et al, 2006; Yuan et al, 2020) . The last type is related to the host-cell innate immune response regulated by ubiquitin (Ub) or Ub-like proteins, such as the structures of SARS-CoV papain-like protease interacting with Ub, di-Ub, or ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15; see Lei et al, 2018, for a review). Recently, the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease in complex with murine ISG15 has been reported (Shin et al, 2020) . In addition, the cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 with ribosomes (40S/80S) were reported (Schubert et al, 2020; Thoms et al, 2020) . Here, we present the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV Mac2:host Paip1M complex involved in the regulation of viral and host mRNA translation. More structural information on virus:host protein complexes in this field is necessary to arrive at a better understanding.",

It is divided into three subdomains, namely Mac2 (SUD-N), Mac3 (SUD-M), and DPUP (SUD-C) (Tan et al, 2009; see Lei et al, 2018 for the new names of the three subdomains). SUD, Mac2, Mac2-3 (SUD-NM), Mac3, and Mac3-DPUP (SUD-MC) constructs of SARS-CoV correspond to residues Lys389 to Ser720, Lys389 to Leu526, Lys389 to Ser652, Gly527 to Ser652, and Gly527 to Ser720 of Nsp3, respectively. Mac2 with the N-terminal 16 residues deleted (D16-Mac2) comprises residues Lys405 to Leu526. All the corresponding DNA constructs mentioned above were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the oligonucleotide primers specified in Appendix Table S2 . The primers for all the constructs contain NdeI and XhoI cleavage sites. The digested SUD, Mac2-3 (SUD-NM), Mac3, and Mac3-DPUP (SUD-MC) PCR products were ligated into pET-15b (Novagen), respectively; Mac2 (SUD-N) and D16-Mac2 were ligated into pET-28a (Novagen). Both vectors contain an N-terminal hexa-histidine (His 6 ) tag and a thrombin cleavage site; also, these two vectors give rise to 4 extra residues (GSHM) at the N-terminus of the target protein after using thrombin to remove the His-tag.",

The following commercially available screens were used: Diffraction of X-rays by these crystals was poor and anisotropic. We tried many optimization methods (e.g., various crystallization temperatures, additives, and dehydration of the crystals); different cryo-protectants were also tested. Over 240 crystals were tested at beamline 14.2 of the BESSY II synchrotron (Berlin, Germany) and beamline P11 of PETRA III, DESY (Hamburg, Germany).

Plasmids pDEST-c-myc-YFP N -Paip1 and pDEST-HA-YFP C -PABP, pDEST-RFP-SUD, pDEST-RFP were transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher) following the manufacturer's protocol and HEK-293T cells were grown for additional 40 h after transfection. Before harvesting, cycloheximide (100 \u00b5g/ml) was added to the media for 15 min at 37\u00b0C to prevent ribosome run-off. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/ml cycloheximide and detached from the cell culture dishes through scraping. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes-KOH [pH 7.5], 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40, 100 \u00b5g/ml cycloheximide, 20 U/ml RNase inhibitor, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor) and incubated for 5 min on ice. The lysate was passed six times through a 23-gauge needle and cleared by centrifugation twice at 20,000 g for 10 min. Equivalent amounts of each sample (according to absorption at 260 nm) were loaded on linear 10-50% sucrose gradients (20 mM Hepes-KOH [pH 7.5], 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor), and samples were separated at 202,048 g for 2.5 h using a SW40 Ti rotor (Beckmann Coulter). The gradients were fractionated with a Biocomp piston gradient fractionator, and the absorption at 260 nm was measured with a Biocomp Triax flow cell. The fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and used for subsequent Western blot analysis.",

The measured values are as follows: N = 0.94 AE 0.01 (binding stoichiometry); K d = 15.5 AE 1.5 lM (dissociation constant); DH = \u00c06,778 AE 149 cal/mol (standard molar enthalpy change for binding); DS = \u00c00.716 cal/mol/K (standard molar entropy change). C D16-Mac2 lost all binding affinity to Paip1M in the ITC experiment. D ITC result of Mac1-2 interacting with Paip1M. The experimental results are as follows: N = 1.14 AE 0.02; K d = 18.6 AE 2.5 lM; DH = \u00c03,730 AE 100 cal/mol; DS = 9.14 cal/mol/K. E, F D16-Mac2 cannot bind Paip1M, Mac1-2 binds to Paip1M in the split-YFP assay. Scale bars represent 50 \u00b5m.6 of 19The EMBO Journal 40: e102277 | 2021 \u00aa 2021 The Authors",
