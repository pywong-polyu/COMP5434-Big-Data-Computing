We will perform the comparison by solving numerically the ground and the lumped system, thus comparing the probability of each state in each point in time. In practical applications of our method, exact transient or steady state solutions may not be feasible, but in this case we can still rely to approximation methods for MPM [5, 41] . Determining which of those techniques performs best in this context is a direction of future exploration.",

We expect also that these reduction methods can provide a good starting point for deriving advanced mean-field equations, similar to ones in [10] . Moreover, literature is very rich in proposed moment-closure-based approximation techniques for MPMs, which can now be utilized [19, 44] .
