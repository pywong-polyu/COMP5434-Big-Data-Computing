            "text": "Purpose The study's aim is to analyse the diagnostic performance of chest radiography (CXR) in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 19 . Methods We retrospectively considered 826 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 presenting to our emergency department (ED) from February 21 to March 31, 2020, in a high disease prevalence setting. We enrolled patients who underwent CXR and rhino-oropharyngeal swab for real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). CXRs were evaluated by an expert radiologist; a second independent analysis was performed by two residents in consensus. All readers, blinded to rRT-PCR results, classified CXRs positive/negative depending on presence/absence of typical findings of COVID-19, using rRT-PCR as reference standard. Results We finally analysed 680 patients (median age 58); 547 (80%) tested positive for COVID-19. The diagnostic performance of CXR, interpreted by the expert reader, was as follows: sensitivity (79.0%; 95% CI: 75.3-82.3), specificity (81.2%; 95% CI: 73.5-87.5), PPV (94.5%;95% CI: 92.0-96.4), NPV (48.4%; 95% CI: 41.7-55.2), and accuracy (79.3%; 95% CI: 76.0-82.2). For the residents: sensitivity (75.1%; 95% CI: 71.2-78.7), specificity (57.9%; 95% CI: 49.9-66.4), PPV (88.0%; 95% CI: 84.7-90.8), NPV (36.2%; 95% CI: 29.7-43.0), and accuracy (71.6%; 95% CI: 68.1-75.0). We found a significant difference between the reporting sensitivity (p = 0.013) and specificity (p < 0.0001) of expert radiologist vs residents. CXR sensitivity was higher in patients with symptom onset > 5 days before ED presentation compared to \u2264 5 days (84.4% vs 70.7%). Conclusions CXR showed a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 81% in diagnosing viral pneumonia in symptomatic patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19. Further studies in lower prevalence settings are needed.",

European and US imaging societies have issued statements advising against a routine use of CT scan as a screening tool [8, 9] ; at ED, chest radiography (CXR) and lung ultrasound (LUS) [10] represent alternative imaging modalities with significant advantages, such as lower radiation doses, lower risk of contamination, lower costs, and more widespread availability.",

Indeed, employing CT as a screening test entails a high contamination risk of the scanner during examination of infected patients, therefore increasing the risk of virus transmission to both hospital staff and other patients, who might later undergo examinations in the same CT scanner. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of CXR instead of CT to triage symptomatic patients would also have notable implications for countries with fewer resources and for centres with limited CT availability. Our study was conducted in a high prevalence population, which could reduce the applicability of estimates to lower prevalence settings; dynamic changes of disease spectrum should also be considered when evaluating the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia [20, 21] . Therefore, in other scenarios (i.e., low prevalence disease; future pandemic waves), chest CT could be useful in suspected patients with negative or uncertain CXR findings [18, 22] .",

Secondly, the gold standard diagnostic test we used as reference (rRT-PCR) is known to have a sensitivity ranging from 60 to 70%, and this constitutes a potential bias for diagnostic accuracy estimates. Thirdly, the retrospective nature of our study did not allow us to make a comparison with alternative diagnostic pathways. Finally, we did not investigate the prognostic value of CXR for clinical outcomes such as mortality, hospitalization length, or risk of intubation; this investigation is the main objective of a further article.",
