Similarly, the prevalence of maternal mental health varies significantly by ethnic groups. For example, 29.3% of African and Caribbean women are more likely to suffer from mental health problems compared to 20.9% of White British women [3] . Evidence suggests that women from White family background have better access to culturally appropriate mental healthcare for maternal depression compared to the women of African and Caribbean origins [4, 5] , who are most likely to be ignored, not followed up about their current or past maternal health distress, and not offered any form of treatment for postnatal depression compared with their white counterparts [6] .",

Maternal depression has potential risks and fatal implications for the mother, child and the entire family [5, 8, 9] . The attachment between a mother and child is critical for the child's physical and cognitive development at both present and later life [10, 11] .

A systematic review has shown that women from ethnic minority groups are at a higher risk of developing maternal depression [12] . This may be due to racial discrimination, social deprivation and lack of culturally sensitive interventions [13, 14] . Risk factors for maternal depression in ethnic minority women could be explained by the critical race theory which explores the unequal distribution of resources, diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions, and societal and political manifestations as the result of racial stratification [15] . The current mental healthcare systems do not serve the needs of depressed African and Caribbean women effectively [12] . In the UK, mental health professionals predominantly from the white British background have reported a lack of confidence and inadequate cultural competence training and their inability to detect perinatal depression in women of African origin [16] . Thus, there are so few practitioners of African origin, and therefore, lack 'insider knowledge' relating to Black, African and Caribbean cultures [16] .",

An MB course is a manualised skill-development training material blended with core elements of cognitive behavioural therapy to prevent the risk of perinatal depression among ethnically diverse and low-income mothers [37] . This was delivered by trained facilitators who taught mothers how to harness and utilise enjoyable and supportive contacts, modulate their negative automatic thoughts and increase pleasant activities. Findings showed 16% greater prevention of depression over time and more effective mood regulation from baseline to 6 months follow up in the intervention group compared to the control group. These findings have been supported in previous research on the effectiveness of the MB course and its ability to prevent depressive symptoms and other risks of mental health problems in mothers [37, 38] .

For instance, Holditch-Davis et al. [32] examined the mother-infant relationship and its effects on maternal mental distress using a maternally administered intervention designed explicitly for preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Two interventions were compared; (1) Kangaroo Care and (2) Auditory, Tactile, Visual, and Vestibular (ATVV) interventions. The effectiveness of these two interventions on the mother-infant relationship and maternal mental distress were evaluated and compared with an attention control group. Findings showed a rapid decline in maternal depressive symptoms and lower parenting stress across all intervention groups with higher scores on the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) inventory. HOME is a scale that measures the quality and quantity of support available in the child's home environment [39] . ATVV is an intervention that involves a series of activities with an infant such as moderate stroking, talking, rocking and keeping eyecontact [40] . Whereas, Kangaroo intervention entailed a process of holding an infant to ensure skin-to-skin contact around the mother's breasts [32] .",

A similar study, Boyd et al. [27] conducted a pilot RCT using social media for postpartum intervention for depressed low-income mothers. Groups were compared using social media (Facebook) and inperson interventions for African American mothers who screened positive with postpartum depression from paediatric clinics. Both interventions employed the parents interacting with infants (PIWI) which involved eight weekly sessions including behaviour activation and depression psychoeducation, parent-child interaction such as play, laughter and safety.

However, the review outputs were limited to a few studies (N = 13) that met the inclusion criteria and captured various North America interventions only. This implies that women of African and Caribbean origins are disproportionately affected by maternal depression and distress [1, [3] [4] [5] . Yet, there are limited evidence-based interventions for maternal distress that are specifically designed and made culturally appropriate for African and Caribbean mothers. Culturally relevant psychological interventions are essential for maternal depression [8, 41] . Therefore, the present review recommends culturally adapted interventions for mothers of African and Caribbean origin living in HICs. In-person contact and online intervention studies are required to establish a nexus of evidencebased resources for usability in maternal health-related policies and clinical practice for these mothers.",

LTP + CaCBT intervention package is manualised and piloted in Kilifi, Kenya and can be delivered by community health trained workers not requiring mental health experts [51] . The programme enables mothers to improve their children psychosocial development by engaging in mother-child play. The theoretical underpinnings of LTP are found in Piaget's theory of cognitive development [52] and Bowlby's attachment theory [53, 54] . The SickKids Centre for community mental health (CCMH) Learning Institute illustrated LTP as a low-cost intervention with culturally appropriate homemade toys, books, and materials commonly found in the homes and used to promote cultural relevance and keep costs to the minimum [55] . The CaCBT instructions for each session are organised into modules that focus on feelings, thoughts, and behaviours with specific interventions focusing on psychoeducation, problem-solving, managing negative thoughts, behaviour activation, and relaxation [34, 56] .",

GL, AR and DEJ performed the preliminary search, abstract screening, piloting of the study selection process and the formal screening of search results against eligibility criteria. MM, DEJ and TJI cross-checked databases against inclusion and exclusion criteria. GL, AR, and DEJ performed data extraction. MM completed the risk of bias and quality assessment. DEJ, AR and TJI conducted data analyse and themes' development. DEJ and NH provided methodological expertise for the review and monitored the research progression at every stage from protocol development to review completion. FC, SBM and PPN reviewed and revalidated data extracted from selected studies. MSP, AG, HK, ZKD, and PJY completed an updated review of the full-text article. DEJ and NH performed final edits and proofread the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.",
