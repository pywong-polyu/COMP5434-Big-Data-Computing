Mobile health clinics (MHC) are an innovative, cost-effective health care delivery approach that increases healthcare access to vulnerable populations and medically underserved areas. There is limited understanding, however, of how PWUD perceive and experience MHCs. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 PWUD -16 who had received care (clients) on an MHC (The Spot) and 15 who had not (non-clients)to explore their perceptions and utilization of an MHC partnered with a mobile syringe services program in Baltimore, Maryland. Data analysis of the text was conducted using an iterative thematic constant comparison process informed by grounded theory. Results: Clients and non-clients, once aware of the MHC, had positive perceptions of The Spot and its benefits for their individual health as well as for the wellbeing of their community. These sentiments among clients were largely driven by access to low-barrier buprenorphine and service delivery without stigma around drug use. However, lack of general awareness of the spot and specific service offering were barriers to its use among non-clients. Discussion: MHCs provide an important opportunity to engage PWUD in healthcare and to expand buprenorphine use; however, even with accessibility near where PWUD access injection equipment, barriers to its use remain. Peer dissemination may be able to facilitate program information sharing and recruitment.",

People who use drugs (PWUD) experience acute complications of overdose and injection-related skin and soft tissue infections (i.e. abscesses, cellulitis), and, compared to the general population, are more likely to have a higher burden of chronic comorbid medical conditions, including mental health conditions [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Importantly, polysubstance use is now common among persons who use opioids, and the U.S. is now experiencing a \"fourth wave\" of the opioid overdose crises [10] . Polysubstance use contributes to increased morbidity and mortality [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] due to pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions [12] and/or increased behavioural risk behaviours such as more frequent injecting and syringe sharing [16, 17] .",

These barriers occur at the individual -(e.g. low healthcare prioritization), interpersonal -(e.g. drug-use stigma among providers), healthcare systems -(e.g. difficulty navigating healthcare systems, lack of identification, the burden of appointment), and structural -(e.g. homelessness and housing instability, lack of insurance) level [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . As a result, PWUD has low primary care utilization [23] [24] [25] , delays seeking medical care [22, 26, 27] , and more frequently utilizes emergency medical care than the general population [28] [29] [30] [31] . While these barriers exist for other marginalized populations, the high prevalence and oftentimes co-occurrence results in a complexity that creates a need for tailored efforts to engage them in healthcare. The impacts of these barriers are amplified in the context of illegality [21, 22, 32] .",

MOUD, specifically methadone or buprenorphine, is the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and has been shown to reduce opioid use and risk of overdose [32, 33] , increase treatment retention [34, 35] , decrease use of emergency medical care [36] , decrease transmission of HIV and hepatitis [37] [38] [39] , and improve quality of life and overall health status [33, 34] . Patients utilizing methadone must receive their medication at opioid treatment programs (OTPs), which are closely regulated at the federal and state level. Buprenorphine can be accessed through OTPs or from a qualified provider [40, 41] . Providers, however, are limited in the number of patients they may treat with buprenorphine, and numerous provider barriers exist that contribute to the limited number of providers seeking qualification and the underuse of buprenorphine among those qualified (e.g. regulatory hurdles, lack of time and clinic resources, lack of available mental health or psychosocial support services) [41] [42] [43] [44] . These federal regulations and the structural barriers they create contribute to the significant gaps observed between treatment needs and capacity [45, 46] . This service gap remains a critical barrier to health equity for this population in need of accessible and tailored services.",

Due to the small space, the availability of specific services and/or quality of certain services may be impacted as all machines must be portable [63] . Patient confidentiality may also be difficult to maintain in this small space, requiring MHC to develop creative strategies to work around the spatial limitations to privacy [64, 65] .

Like much of the U.S., Baltimore, Maryland is experiencing an opioid crisis. Opioid-related overdose mortality increased 140% from 354 in 2015 to 851 in 2019; 95% of this mortality in 2019 was due to fentanyl [76] . The Spot provides clinical care in five specific sites selected from established BCHD's mobile Syringe Services Program (SSP) sites; each site has high drug traffic and use. At some locations, the two vans are parked next to each other. At other sites, however, the vans are separated by time or space depending on the logistics and the surrounding community's request. The Spot van includes two patient exam rooms, a waiting space, a phlebotomy/laboratory area, and a bathroom, and electricity is provided by an on-board generator. The Spot offers an array of services including buprenorphine-based MOUD, HIV/ STI/HCV testing and treatment on-site, wound care, overdose prevention and response training, and case management. The Spot is staffed by two clinicians (nurse practitioner and MD), a dedicated case manager, and a phlebotomist. The case manager, a licenced social worker, assists clients with various social service needs and facilitates health insurance enrolment for those who are uninsured. Through offering an integrated package of services for PWUD, The Spot aims to normalise the concept of biomedical services to maintain and improve health among this population.",

We recruited PWUD from The Spot and SSP vans at four sites in Baltimore, Maryland between March and October 2019. Recruitment site selection (four sites out of six total) was based on the larger study's recruitment and/or the days The Spot was able to have recruitment occur based on staffing and client flow. Persons were eligible to participate in an interview if they were 18 years or older and a current client at The Spot and/or the SSP. We aimed to interview approximately equal numbers of participants that had and had not used services on The Spot. By interviewing clients and non-clients, we hoped to better understand the range of perceptions of The Spot and barriers to its utilization by PWUD, and identify potential unique barriers faced by those who had not used the services offered. The number of interviews conducted was determined by the scope and nature of the study (e.g. narrow scope) [77] , recommendations in the literature [78] [79] [80] , and data saturation, defined as the point where no new information relevant to the research questions is obtained from additional interviews [81] . All participants provided oral consent prior to participation, and participant consent date and time were documented by the interviewer. Oral consent was obtained due to the stigmatization of drug use and the minimal risk of participation in the interview. Through the consent, participants were informed that the interviews were confidential and findings shared with The Spot and SSP staff would not be linked to any individual participant. The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved all protocols (IRB-5; IRB00147873).",

The initial codebook was developed by collapsing codes from the open coding list based on similarities and differences. Multiple iterations of the codebook were created through coding of additional transcripts and subsequent reflection and discussion by three researchers (SG, SW, SS). Using the constant comparison method, codes were compared within a single interview and between interviews, and variability was considered based on gender and client type (The Spot client vs. non-client). This iterative method facilitated the refinement of existing codes and the identification of emergent codes and illuminated potential relationships between codes [82, 84, 85] . Two coders (SG, SW) then independently applied the final 84 codes systematically to each of the transcripts in Atlas.ti software; the lead qualitative researcher resolved any discrepancies. When coding was complete, codes were aggregated into thematic categories based on how the codes related to one another.

Since The Spot was colocated with the SSP, non-clients trusted that The Spot staff would treat them the same as the SSP staff dowithout any judgement. For example, a 42-yearold female non-client explained: \"They're coming in this neighborhood so they pretty much know what to expect \u2026 Yeah, so I'm thinking they know what to expect so they'll be a little bit more sympathetic\". Non-clients shared an expectation that The Spot staff would be caring and non-judgmental, and the clients described this as true. When discussing their experiences using services at The Spot, participants overwhelmingly focussed on the van staff: \"I think they're great. I think they help people, they care, they're nice, I couldn't imagine it being anything better than that, what they are now. I think they're doing a good job\". The staff was described as being welcoming, positive, caring, considerate, non-judgemental, encouraging, and supportive. Talking about the support he felt from his provider, a 32-year-old male client discussed being open about drug use: Participant: Yeah, I tell them [about recent drug use], yeah, I'm always honest, that's the one thing the lady told me was, \"Just be honest with me upfront.\" And I have, and I have.",

I would probably avoid that because it's just a longer, drawn-out process. This is, I feel, more secluded and-you know what I mean? Just more one-on-one, like not-to go in front of a hospital and everybody's around and stuff. (39-yearold female non-client) Although small, clients were comfortable receiving services in the mobile clinic. This partially was influenced by the social space created by the staff. Clients spoke, for example, of the positive environment on the van: \"[The] people are very kind and they sincerely care, they really do and they're down to earth. You can just feel the aura, it's definitely a positive feeling as soon as you step on that van\" (32-year-old male client). Similarly, a 53-year-old female client said, \"They're cool. <laughs> \u2026 You come in there with your face down and they make you laugh before you leave\". Physically, the space allowed for a confidential conversation, and clients did not have concerns regarding the security of their privacy: \"Everybody still has their own personal space [to be seen]\" (32-yearold male client). Similarly, a 63-year-old female client felt comfortable, saying, \"They [people waiting on the van to be seen] can't hear you. Well, I can't hear nobody when they're in there\".

(53- year-old female client) Barriers to using the spot Lack of awareness Overall, participants did not feel there were many barriers to receiving healthcare services through The Spot. The most important barrier was simply that the participants did not know it existed: \"I had no clue what they did, you know?\" A 42-year-old male non-client commented, \"I don't see a reason why nobody wouldn't want to utilise something that's free that could help them. I'm going to let people know now that I know because I'm figuring that the people I know don't know\". This lack of awareness similarly created a barrier to use, initially, among clients. Several clients noted that they made assumptions about the services or were provided wrong information about The Spot. A 46-year-old male explained, for example, \"I didn't know it had nothing to do with drug abuse. I just thought it was a needle exchange. That's what I thought just by seeing it every day at first\". Another client, a 57-year-old male, was provided inaccurate information: \"I had met this guy. He had told me about it \u2026 He said as long as you got insurance you was cool\". Importantly, many of the clients were not aware of the additional services provided by the van, thus creating a barrier to utilizing other services: \"I really don't know what all the services that they can provide, you know what I mean?\" (59-year-old male).",

Despite being safe and effective, buprenorphine continues to be inaccessible and underutilized in the U.S. partially because of barriers to access [41] [42] [43] [44] 50] . Low barrier programs aim to remove barriers to program utilization, including requiring admissions processes with multiple visits, discontinuation of MOUD for relapse on drug testing, and requiring counselling or participation in 12-step programs [86, 87] . Removing these barriers, low-threshold programs generally provide treatment in non-traditional settings, allow people to start treatment the day of entry, utilize a harm reduction approach, and offer flexibility. Providers work with their patients based on their individual needs and desires, offering a non-judgmental approach [55, 88] . The Spot clients identified the ease of access, reduced barriers to retention, and lack of drug use stigma from a caring and supportive staff as highly beneficial to themselves as well as to their community. Low barrier MOUD programs have demonstrated feasibility in engaging and retaining marginalized populations in treatment [57, 89, 90] , and emerging data from program adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced toxicology screening and use of telemedicine, reinforce this [91] . Importantly, low barrier MOUD programs may facilitate reduced overdose and all-cause mortality [92, 93] . Additionally, buprenorphine treatment disparities have been observed, with treatment concentrated among white persons [94, 95] . The Spot's client base is largely Black [75] , suggesting that low barrier buprenorphine access via MHCs may improve equitable access to this life-saving medication.",

For patients in underserved and/or stigmatized communities, the patient-provider relationship has a critical impact for engagement in care, retention in care, and health outcomes, including for people with low-income, people who are homeless [96] , people living with HIV [97, 98] , and people who inject drugs [99] . Research suggests that many MHCs demonstrate an ability to foster trusting relationships between provider and patient [64, 65, 70, 100, 101] . Qualitative research exploring experiences with MHC demonstrates that people value the ways in which the providers make people feel welcomed, are easy to talk to, engage without judgement, and understand their community [65, 70, 100] . In a survey of homeless persons who use drugs attending an MHC in Boston, Massachusetts, Fine and colleagues found that 98.8% of respondents trusted and felt respected by the program staff [101] . Through the descriptions of client experiences on The Spot, our findings further demonstrate the ability of MHC, and importantly those serving PWUD, to promote trusting and respectful provider-patient relationships. PWUD often encounter interpersonal barriers (e.g. stigma from healthcare providers) in traditional health settings, which negatively impact their engagement in care and, ultimately, the health and wellbeing of PWUD [18, 19, 22, 102] . By addressing this barrier as well as others (e.g. difficulty navigating the healthcare system, lack of insurance, burden of appointment), MHC may have an important role in addressing health disparities experienced among this population.",

            "text": "Despite the achievements of The Spot van, the positive feedback from clients, and its co-location with a mobile syringe service program van, barriers exist with respect to awareness of the MHC, generally, and the specific services provided. Clients and non-clients aware of The Spot overwhelmingly learned about The Spot through word of mouth. Although The Spot offers a range of services, clients typically learned about The Spot through social contacts who informed them of its buprenorphine dispensation, and many referred to The Spot as the \"bup van\". As a result, PWUD who are not interested in receiving buprenorphine, and especially those in methadone programs, may be excluded from peer communications about The Spot van. Previous research has documented the importance of peer-to-peer information sharing among PWUD, however, which has been linked to healthcare utilization within populations of PWUD [103] [104] [105] . In addition to sharing flyers or pamphlets with other service organizations for PWUD and having greater information dissemination by the SSP staff, awareness of The Spot and its services could be aided through the use of formalized peer dissemination and recruitment strategies that ensure diverse messages about The Spot services [106] [107] [108] . This study provides further support for the role of MHC in providing healthcare services to vulnerable populations, generally, and people with OUD specifically. This research, though, is not without limitations. This study recruited MHC clients from one mobile clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. It is possible that the perceptions and experiences of MHC use by clients and non-clients could vary geographically and/or by the specifics of the MHC. Although client and non-client participants were recruited from each of the four recruitment locations, the racial distribution of clients and non-clients differed greatly. This is not unexpected, as 77% of The Spot clients were Black at the time of data collection [75] , and up to 70% of SSP clients are white at some locations (unpublished data). However, as a result, we were unable to explore possible differences in perceptions and utilization of The Spot based on race and ethnicity. The Spot clients were introduced to the study by their provider in The Spot, and non-clients were approached by study staff outside of the SSP; participants were interviewed immediately after their clinic or SSP visit. While participants were informed that their providers and/or SSP staff would not have access to the specific information shared in the interview and that what they shared would not impact their current or future service at The Spot or SSP, it is possible that participants may have felt uncomfortable providing criticisms or critiques. Only current clients of The Spot were interviewed. It is possible that individuals who received services at The Spot at one time and then stopped may have different perspectives of The Spot and their experience. Finally, interviews occurred prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the loosening of regulations on buprenorphine and methadone prescribing.",
