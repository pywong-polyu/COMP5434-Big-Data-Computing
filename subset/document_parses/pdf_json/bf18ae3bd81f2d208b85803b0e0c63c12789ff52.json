We conducted a single-meal study to evaluate the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance of milk containing different concentrations of A1 and A2 \u03b2-casein proteins. This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial in 25 LI subjects with maldigestion and an additional eight lactose maldigesters who did not meet the QLCSS criteria. Subjects received each of four types of milk (milk containing A2 \u03b2-casein protein only, Jersey milk, conventional milk, and lactose-free milk) after overnight fasting. Symptoms of GI intolerance and breath hydrogen concentrations were analyzed for 6 h after ingestion of each type of milk. In an analysis of the 25 LI subjects, total symptom score for abdominal pain was lower following consumption of milk containing A2 \u03b2-casein only, compared with conventional milk (p = 0.004). Post hoc analysis with lactose maldigesters revealed statistically significantly improved symptom scores (p = 0.04) and lower hydrogen production (p = 0.04) following consumption of milk containing A2 \u03b2-casein only compared with conventional milk. Consumption of milk containing A2 \u03b2-casein only is associated with fewer GI symptoms than consumption of conventional milk in lactose maldigesters.

A1 \u03b2-casein includes histidine at the 67th position in the peptide chain, whereas A2 \u03b2-casein includes proline at this position [3] . Although some cattle breeds maintain the A2 \u03b2-casein variant, a single nucleotide polymorphism in modern western cattle breeds means that they exhibit mixed A1 and A2 \u03b2-casein variants [3] [4] [5] . Digestive enzymes act on A1 \u03b2-casein and hydrolyze it, releasing beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The histidine residue in A1 \u03b2-casein allows cleavage to form BCM-7, whereas the proline residue in A2 \u03b2-casein limits such cleavage and BCM-7 formation [11] .",

However, these studies were conducted in subjects with self-reported LI, and no relevant blinded studies have been reported in verified LI individuals; this is a notable omission, given that self-reported LI can be unreliable [19] . Moreover, only one study to date has examined the effects of the administration of variable ratios of A1 and A2 \u03b2-casein [20] . Manifestations of LI can be both acute and chronic: they can be long-term due to epigenetic changes or genetic mutation [21] ; they also appear to be a single-meal event, with symptoms occurring between 30 min and 6 h after exposure [22, 23] . These symptoms and their cause are distinct from milk allergy, which results from an immune reaction to milk proteins.",

The principal study objective was to determine, via a hydrogen breath test (HBT) in lactose maldigester individuals living in the Midwest United States and who had verified LI following a blinded milk challenge, if lactose digestion and GI tolerance were affected by the four different milk types within 6 h after ingestion. We hypothesized that a single meal of milk containing A2 \u03b2-casein only would be better tolerated, producing fewer GI symptoms and less maldigestion during the 6 h study, than conventional milk containing both A1 and A2 \u03b2-casein. We also hypothesized that Jersey milk would produce an intermediate response regarding the HBT and occurrence of GI symptoms as a result of its higher level of A2 \u03b2-casein and lower level of A1 \u03b2-casein.",

We queried all interested subjects regarding demographic information, current medication use, and height and weight for calculating body mass index (BMI). Participants were assigned an identification number upon signing the informed consent form. Identification numbers were block pre-randomized using randomization.com. Staff performed the randomization, enrolled participants, and provided milk type information to our Clinical Research Center (CRC) kitchen via sealed security envelopes.

This was followed by protein alkylation with 400 \u00b5L of 8 M urea and 10 mM DTT, and then digestion with pepsin using a 1:20 enzyme to substrate ratio for 1 h at room temperature. The peptides, which were cleaned/desalted via a C18 Silica MicroSpin column (The Nest Group Inc., Southborough, MA, USA) after digestion, were analyzed with the Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano System combined with the Q-Exactive High-Field Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Peptides were then re-suspended in 3% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid/96.9% Milli-Q water, and 5 \u00b5L (1 \u00b5g) were used for liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS analysis. A trap (300 \u00b5m internal diameter (ID) \u00d7 5 mm packed with 5 \u00b5m 100 \u00c5 PepMap C18 medium; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to separate peptides and a 120 min gradient method with a flow rate of 300 nL/min was used for the analytical columns (75 \u00b5m ID \u00d7 15 cm long packed with 3 \u00b5m of 100 \u00c5 PepMap C18 medium). Mobile phase A contained 0.1% formic acid in water and Nutrients 2020, 12, 3855 4 of 15 mobile phase B contained 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. The linear gradient started at 5% B and reached 30% B in 80 min, 45% B in 91 min, and 100% B in 93 min. The column was held at 100% B for 5 min and then brought back to 5% B. The column was held at 5% B for 20 min to equilibrate at 37 \u2022 C. The top 20 data-dependent MS/MS scan method was used to acquire MS data with a maximum injection time of 100 ms and a resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z. High-energy C-trap dissociation with the normalized collision energy of 27 eV was used to fragment precursor ions. MS/MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 15,000 at 200 m/z.

Total breath hydrogen produced by LI subjects was not significantly different from that after the consumption of conventional milk, possibly because our sample size was too small to detect differences in breath hydrogen production. The reduction in abdominal pain after the consumption of milk containing A2 \u03b2-casein only, compared with the consumption of conventional milk, was consistent with the results of another clinical trial [15] . Among the eight maldigesters tested since June 2019, none met the LI criteria during screening or intervention. In the post hoc analysis, symptoms of intolerance were not reduced after the consumption of Jersey milk compared with conventional milk, potentially because of the presence of some A1 \u03b2-casein in Jersey milk. However, there was a significant reduction in symptoms among these 25 individuals and eight additional lactose maldigesters following the consumption of milk containing only A2 \u03b2-casein. These findings warrant confirmation in larger study populations.",
