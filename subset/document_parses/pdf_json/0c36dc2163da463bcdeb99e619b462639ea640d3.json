Any adults that had assisted with the medication management of such adults were also eligible for participation [10] . Those under 18 years, unable to consent to interview, or without access to telephone or internet, were excluded [10] . Participants were recruited through the researchers' own personal and professional networks, patient and carer charities and organisations, and engagement with patient and public involvement partners [10] . Both social media and word-of-mouth were used to support recruitment. Interviews were conducted by telephone or video conferencing between June and August 2020 and were led by two research pharmacists (SG, BDF) and a health services researcher (CW) who had previous experience conducting qualitative interviews. Participants were asked, using open questions, about their usual home medication practices and how these had changed during the pandemic, including any challenges relating to taking their medicines. Medication adherence was not measured quantitatively. ",

For example, patients with diabetes reported that their medication taking was linked to their meals. Despite changes to their normal routine, they ate their meals at the same times of day. Some patients built resilience into medication adherence during the pandemic by linking their medication-taking to a different aspect of their routine that had not been disrupted, although this was not always completely successful. For example, one participant reported using brushing their teeth in the morning as a prompt to take their medicine, after they were no longer going out to work. However, the participant stated that sometimes this did not help them remember whether they have taken their medication or not. Some participants reported that during normal times they used visual cues, linked to their routine, where their medication was stored strategically so that it would be visible at the time they needed to take their medication.

This system may not have been something participants had been using before or were able to use before, but since they had been staying at home, some were with family members for a much larger part of the day. This meant receiving helpful reminders from family members was possibly more viable as an adherence practice than it was before. In addition, for some participants who had been using this method prior to the pandemic, the effectiveness of this adherence strategy had remained the same during the pandemic.",

Two participants discussed a re-evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio of their medication as it was taking the medication that had put them at higher risk from COVID-19 and required them to shield. While neither of these participants reported that they had decided to stop taking their medication at the time of interview, they reported that they were continually evaluating the situation, and the length of time that they were going to be required to shield was reported to be one of the factors that they described as being relevant. In addition, one participant described making a decision to stop one of her medicines because she was no longer experiencing symptoms, and did this without consulting a healthcare professional. She was of the view that she would have consulted a pharmacist during normal times, but she knew that they were extremely busy and therefore found relevant information to support her on the internet. Another participant described feeling more negative about her illness and less motivated during the pandemic, making it more difficult to adhere to her medication. In contrast, other participants reported increasing their adherence during the pandemic to ensure their long-term conditions were fully under control, potentially making them less susceptible to more serious illness. In contrast to unintentional nonadherence, participants did not identify specific strategies that they used to deal with intentional nonadherence. Rather, there was potential for their intentions to change and then affect their medication behaviour. Figure 2 summarises the themes identified in relation to changes to challenges in adherence experienced during the pandemic. ",

Mikelson and Holden [4] also found that other disruptions to routine, such as being out of the home, could lead to more challenges with adherence. Our findings are supported by those of Musiimenta et al. [13] , who found that after withdrawal of text reminders, some participants were unaffected, some adopted a new strategy, and some returned to finding adherence challenging. Our study suggests that this can also be applied to medication adherence strategies that patients put in place themselves. Furthermore, it provides additional information on which strategies are more likely to be susceptible to changes in life circumstances and how these may need to be adapted.",

Healthcare professionals may be aware of major disruption or life changes that may make adherence more challenging, such as an admission to hospital or a bereavement, and thereby provide appropriate support. However, in other cases, healthcare professionals may be unaware of changes, thus regularly reviewing adherence with the patient could be beneficial. In addition, proactively building resilience into the system, even while patients are adherent, may make this susceptible to change as circumstances become more challenging. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, when patients make an intentional decision to not adhere to their medicines, they do not seem to build strategies to overcome this. Proactively discussing patients' motivation and beliefs about medicines and any changes taking place over time is therefore also important.",
