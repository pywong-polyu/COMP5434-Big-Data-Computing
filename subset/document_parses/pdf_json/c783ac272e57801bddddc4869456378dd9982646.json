The laboratory results of patients with COVID-19 between December 2019 and May 2020 were assembled from the Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. A meta-analysis was conducted, calculating the individual and pooled odds ratios (ORs) with relative 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using Review Manager 5.3. The available data of 1,534 patients from 6 studies were included in this analysis. The results demonstrated that the incidence of leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, increased procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels was associated with a nearly 3-fold (OR=3.44; 95% CI: 2.15-5.49), 4-fold (OR=4.39; 95% CI: 1.82-10.60), 5-fold (OR=5.28; 95% CI: 3.42-8.15), 4-fold (OR=3.99; 95% CI: 2.61-6.12), 3-fold (OR=3.02; 95% CI: 2.13-4.26) and 8-fold (OR=8.33; 95% CI: 1.75-39.69) higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, respectively. These findings indicated that serial white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, CRP, PCT, LDH and AST measurements may be useful for predicting progression towards a more severe form of COVID-19.",

SARS and MERS are also notable exceptions among coronaviruses, as those that are pathogenic to humans are generally associated with mild clinical symptoms (17) . Between December 2019 and May 2020, there was a near exponential growth in the number of new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reaching numerous countries globally. The outbreak of COVID-19 has put health authorities worldwide on high alert. At present, all confirmed cases of COVID-19 are diagnosed based on i) clinical manifestations and abnormal findings of chest X-ray or computed tomography and ii) a positive result on the reverse transcription-PCR assay on nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens (3, 15) . Different clinical characteristics have been reported between patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 (10); however, characteristic differential laboratory abnormalities have yet to be identified. Laboratory diagnostics may contribute to assessing disease severity or predicting prognosis (18) . In the present study, laboratory results were collected to investigate the differences that may help distinguish patients with moderate from those with severe COVID-19.",

            "text": "The present meta-analysis revealed that, when compared with patients with moderate disease severity, the presence of leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, increased PCT and CRP levels was associated with a 3-, 4-, 5-and 4-fold higher risk of severe COVID-19, respectively. Lippi and Plebani (19) revealed that the white blood cell count, CRP and PCT levels increased, whereas the lymphocyte count decreased Items are scored as 0 (not reported), 1 (reported but inadequate), or 2 (reported and adequate). The global ideal score was 16 for non-comparative studies. in patients with COVID-19. A further meta-analysis demonstrated that lymphocytopenia and an increase in CRP levels were more common among patients with COVID-19 (6). Rodriguez-Morales et al (20) also reported elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as CRP and LDH, in patients with COVID-19. The results of the present study demonstrated that the incidence of elevated inflammatory markers also differed between moderate and severe COVID-19 cases. Thus, a higher risk of occurrence of leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, and increased PCT and CRP levels in this study was correlated with the severity of COVID-19. There remains a question whether the leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, increased PCT and increased CRP levels are the results or causative factors of the COVID-19 infection, which cannot be determined from our results. These factors may be essential severity criteria, similar to a biomarker, as well as possible targets for intervention to minimize the risk of severe cases. The mechanisms underlying leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, and increased PCT and CRP levels in severe cases remain undetermined, but they may be associated with host immune responses during virus infection. Airborne SARS-CoV-2 may enter the peripheral blood from the lungs, leading to infection of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-expressing target cells, such as in the lungs, heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and other unknown target organs (21) . Stimulating the innate immune system by pathogen-associated molecular patterns may trigger an antiviral response, leading to activation of several signaling pathways and, ultimately, transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-\u03baB, activator protein 1, interferon response factor (IRF)3 and IRF7, accompanied by their nuclear translocation. Simultaneously, the humoral immune response also plays a protective role, as B cells or plasma cells produce specific antibodies to help neutralize viruses, whereas the T-cell responses are aimed at the recognition and killing of infected cells (22, 23) . During the host immune responses, the recruitment of neutrophils occurs through chemotaxis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and lymphocyte reduction occurs via different mechanisms, including i) apoptosis or impairment of lymphocytes and ii) bone marrow suppression during a cytokine storm (22, 23) . Accumulating evidence suggests that the immune system is impaired during the period of disease that allows the development of viral hyperinflammation (10, 24) . A limited number of studies revealed that severe COVID-19 cases had a relatively distinct profile of decreased memory T cells and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells (24) . It was also demonstrated that severe COVID-19 may induce a cytokine storm and lymphocyte damage, as well as suppression of interferon-\u03b3 production (24) . The numbers of T cells and B cells were further reduced, while the levels of inflammatory cytokines continued to increase in patients with severe disease (21) . Based on the aforementioned results, leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, and increased PCT and CRP levels may serve as predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 severity.",
