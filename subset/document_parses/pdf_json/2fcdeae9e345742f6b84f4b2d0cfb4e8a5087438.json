            "text": "Statistical and epidemiological data imply temperature sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. However, the molecular level understanding of the virus structure at different temperature is still not clear. Spike protein is the outermost structural protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which interacts with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a human receptor, and enters the respiratory system. In this study, we performed an all atom molecular dynamics simulation to study the effect of temperature on the structure of the Spike protein. After 200ns of simulation at different temperatures, we came across some interesting phenomena exhibited by the protein. We found that the solvent exposed domain of Spike protein, namely S1, is more mobile than the transmembrane domain, S2. Structural studies implied the presence of several charged residues on the surface of N-terminal Domain of S1 which are optimally oriented at 10-C. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that it is capable of binding to other human receptors and should not be disregarded. Additionally, we found that receptor binding motif (RBM), present on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1, begins to close around temperature of 40 C and attains a completely closed conformation at 50 C. The closed conformation disables its ability to bind to ACE2, due to the burying of its receptor binding residues. Our results clearly show that there are active and inactive states of the protein at different temperatures. This would not only prove beneficial for understanding the fundamental nature of the virus, but would be also useful in the development of vaccines and therapeutics.",

Moreover, it can be clearly seen that the NTD loops host a large number of polar residues ( Figure 5) . These residues form a stable motif at temperatures 10-30 C, primarily due to the stability between the loops. At 40 C and 50 C, hydrophobic patch from N-terminal \u03b2 strand is exposed towards the solvent. The polar residues from \u03b2 -\u03b21 and \u03b21 -\u03b21 move away from the N-terminal \u03b2 strand and the \u03b2 -\u03b2 loop, reducing the possibility of protein-protein interaction. Hence, a strong possibility exists for the NTD to act as a protein binding site at lower temperature ranges.",

The figures suggest that although residue wise movements in RBD were not visible in RMSF (Figure 2 ), the RBD domains and motifs show intrinsic flexibility along particular temperature ranges. Previous studies have indicated that the RBD domain can adopt either an open or a closed conformation in the virus [18] . We compared the conformation of the Spikeprotein-ACE2 crystal structure and found that in the open conformation, the RBD exposes its RBM residues Phe456, Ala475, Phe486, Asn487, Tyr489, Gln493, Gly496, Gln498, Thr500, Asn501, Gly502 and Tyr505 to fa ilitate the inding of the re eptors t is fas inating to see that at C and more interestingly at C, the RBM motif is in a closed loop conformation and very compact which hinders its association with the partner proteins. 15 To validate the findings, we ran another simulation of the Spike protein at a higher temperature of 70 C. After 100ns of simulation, we found that significant similarity between the closed conformation observed at 50 C and the conformation at 70 C. The RBM residues, specifically Phe456, Ala475, Phe486, Asn487, Tyr489, Gln493, Gly496, Gln498, Thr500, Asn501, Gly502 and Tyr505 were found to be clearly buried between the interchain subunits at 70 C (Figure 7 , of the coronaviruses inside the host cells.

Each plot shows the RMSF of each individual chain at different temperatures. The RMSF of individual chains of S1 domain at different temperatures show that the residues ranging from 1-333 which constitute the N-Terminal 10 Domain (NTD) of S1, show more fluctuations compared to the Receptor binding Domain (RBD) ranging from residues 334-680. In the NTD, three distinct peaks could be seen, viz:-residues 85-90, 100-200 and 240-260. The first peak in the NTD was observed around residues 85-90 \u03b2\u03b2 whi h is a loop dire ted inwards to the S domain igure S The peak was found to e highest in hain at nm however at other temperatures all the hains have approximately 0.5 nm RMS fluctuation of its CA atoms.

The residues 240-260 are solvent exposed loop around \u03b21 -\u03b21 No gly an inding sites were o served in the rystal structure. The RBD domain consists of a receptor binding motif (RBM) ranging from residues 458-that show flexi ility in all the systems The lowest flexi ility was o served at 1 C t the peaks were found for a wider range of residues. This indicates differential flexibility of the RBM at different temperatures.

The tree was constructed from the results of protein Blast (Blastp) where the maximum allowed difference was 0.85 (details discussed in Materials and Methods). Results show similarity between the NTD and Briakunumab antibodies, anti-TSLP antibodies, Ephrin receptors, GABAA receptor, Leucine rich repeat containing Protein 4c, Kremen A receptor protein and N-galactosaminyltransferase. The remarkable similarity of the NTD with several human antibodies and receptor proteins indicate the possibility of the domain to be able to bind to different proteins in human. For instance, the Ephrin receptors are one of the largest proteins of receptor tyrosine kinases which are involved in angiogenesis, retinogenic signaling, axon guiding and in the migration of the epithelial cells of the intestines[1]. The possibility of the NTD acting as a receptor binding domain cannot be ruled out completely. There is also an uncanny correlation between the prevailing literature where scientists claim the virus affecting different parts of the human body and the similarity of NTD with human proteins[1,35].",

The unavailability of RBM residues to bind to ACE2 receptor would nonetheless destabilize virusprotein interactions at higher temperatures. Thus, although the RBM stays largely in open conformation state, surprisingly, from around the temperature of C a losed onformation of the motif was o served n this onformation the RBM from the three chains come very close to each other sealing the visibility of the trimeric pore t temperatures C, the Spike RBM is completely closed (Figure 7). The closing of the RBM buries the receptor binding residues inside trimer abolishing the possibility of contacts with the ACE2 receptor and making the Spike protein inactive. Our results clearly show that the activity of the Spike protein is dependent on the external temperatures where a higher temperature renders it completely inactive. 16 CONCLUSION The SARS-CoV-2 has severely affected the human population with large number of infected individuals around world. The propensity of virus to survive in cold and dry climatic conditions have been speculated by researchers and supported by the statistical evidence from earlier SARS epidemic of 2002. However, it is still unclear how the virus undergoes changes at the structural level in different environments. The Spike protein of the virus helps in the attachment and entry",

In this conformation, the RBM from the three chains come very close to ea h other sealing the visi ility of the trimeri pore t temperatures C, the Spike RBM is completely closed. The closing of the RBM buries the receptor binding residues inside trimer abolishing the possibility of contacts with the ACE2 receptor and making the Spike protein inactive. Our results have shown for the first time that the Spike protein has the possibility to stay in an active and inactive state based on the external temperature. Since no visible loss of secondary structure was observed at higher temperatures, it would be interesting to know if the conformational change is reversible in nature. Nevertheless, this work would prove very beneficial in the development of vaccines as well as development of therapeutic strategies that target not only the receptor binding domain but also the N-Terminal Domain of the Spike protein. 18 MATERIALS AND METHODS The complete model of the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2 was obtained from Zhang lab (GenBank: QHD43416.1). This model was considered because it had modeled the missing 871 residues that were missing in the crystal structure 6VXX. It had a Template Modeling (TM) score of 0.6 [27]. The initial Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between the model and the closed crystal structure of Spike glycoprotein (PDB ID 6VXX) was found to be 1.54 \u00c5. The model was devoid of N-acetyl glycosamine (NAG) glycan residues and consisted of the glycoprotein trimer where each monomer had aminoacids ranging from 1 to 1273. The structure was initially solvated with a water box having a cubic box of size 17.9 x 17.9 x 17.9 nm and 569293 atoms with water and ions. The minimum distance between the protein and the edge of the water box was fixed at 13 \u00c5. Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) method was used for electrostatic interactions using a grids pacing of 0.16nm and a 1.0 nm cutoff. After energy minimization and",
