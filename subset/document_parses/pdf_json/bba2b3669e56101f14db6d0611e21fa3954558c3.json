            "text": "Obesity continues to be a global issue. In recent years, researchers have started to question the role of our novel yet ubiquitous use of digital media in the development of obesity. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak affecting almost all aspects of society, many people have moved their social eating activities into the digital space, making the question as relevant as ever. The bombardment of appetizing food images and photographycolloquially referred to as \"food porn\" -has become a significant aspect of the digital food experience. This review presents an overview of whether and how the (1) viewing, (2) creating, and (3) online sharing of digital food photography can influence consumer eating behavior. Moreover, this review provides an outlook of future research opportunities, both to close the gaps in our scientific understanding of the physiological and psychological interaction between digital food photography and actual eating behavior, and, from a practical viewpoint, to optimize our digital food media habits to support an obesitypreventive lifestyle. We do not want to rest on the idea that food imagery's current prevalence is a core negative influence per se. Instead, we offer the view that active participation in food photography, in conjunction with a selective use of food-related digital media, might contribute to healthy body weight management and enhanced meal pleasure.",

In Europe, the obesity rate has been linearly increasing ever since the 1970s, without any indication of slowing down (WHO, 2016) . Observational studies have shown that watching TV is associated with being overweight (e.g., Gore et al., 2003; Halford et al., 2004 ; for a review, see Boulos et al., 2012) . Simultaneously, food is becoming an increasingly popular topic both in classical forms of media, such as cooking books and TV, as well as in new digital media formats on the internet, such as YouTube, Instagram, and other social media platforms Spence et al., 2016) .

Conversely, the share of 10th graders who read print every day has declined from 60% in the 1970s to 16% in 2016. Similarly, daily TV consumption has declined by an hour from the early 1990s to 2016.

Among the chief restrictions caused by the pandemic have been limitations on people's social lives. A recent survey during the first wave of the pandemic around April 2020 found that social activities had decreased between 46.7 and 58%, and overall life satisfaction had decreased by 30.5% (Ammar et al., 2020b) . Eating behavior and physical activity levels were also adversely affected, with a reported decrease in total weekly activity minutes by 33%, higher reported meal frequency, snacking, \"out-of-control\" eating, and more unhealthy food choices (Ammar et al., 2020a) . Somewhat expected, the number of individuals who used digital technology for social purposes had increased by 24.8% (Ammar et al., 2020b) . Eating is, in large part, a social affair (cf. Herman, 2017) , therefore, it seems natural to assume that a non-trivial share of newly-digitized social interaction involved food. Indeed, a recent survey of people's motivations and experiences of lockdown-related online dining found that people gathered mainly for social reasons (Ceccaldi et al., 2020) . The experience itself was reported as rather insufficient. We have possibly witnessed the largest experiment in digital commensality to date (cf. Spence et al., 2019) . Hence, the question of how digital media affect eating seems more relevant than ever.",

In other words, food images become pornographic when they showcase a visual decadence that is entirely removed from food's primary function -nourishment. The term has caught on and is nowadays used more generally for online viewing and sharing of appetizing food images (see Petit et al., 2016) . However, not all scholars agree on this definition or even the notion that food photography could be pornographic in principle. Tooming (2021) conceptualizes pornography as a means to obtain sexual release. According to this definition, then, food images cannot be pornographic because they cannot afford the release, i.e., satiation. 1 On the question of motivation, Tooming questions the precise source of pleasure when viewing food photography. The author, at least in part, dismisses anticipation as the source of pleasure in viewing food photography, as desiring the literally depicted food is both irrational (it is neither accessible and probably does not even exist anymore) and the activity does not seem to cause people to replicate the food, either (Prince, 2014) . Neither is the pleasure purely visual. In his estimation, the pleasure in viewing food images is best described as \"reality-independent [gustatory] imaginings. \" These \"imaginings\" are independent from reality insofar as they are not entirely bound to the actually depicted food (which might be a stylized mixture of inedible substances, see Chapin, 2016) . We will return to these notions when discussing relevant experimental evidence.",

Regarding social media more generally, it is important to note that food companies invest heavily into the platforms and content to either influence consumers directly or gain detailed behavioral insight (Lewis, 2018) .

However, it can be controversial. Multiple restaurants, including well-known fine dining establishments, restrict food photography (Ensor, 2013; Stapinski, 2013; Willis, 2017) . The restrictions vary and can include anything from a ban on flash-usage to disallowing any food or restaurant interior photography. There seem to be multiple issues. First, food photography causes an interruption in meal procedure and leaves the food to cool down, diminishing the experience of the diner herself. Second, photographing with a flash disrupts other's meal experience. Third, photos provide only a partial representation of the food -\"a picture on a phone cannot possibly capture the flavors\" (Willis, 2017 ) -resulting in inferior marketing for the restaurant. High-end chefs' critical stance toward food photography has not changed in recent years (Rawlinson, 2020) .",

Investigating a group of healthy students (18-30 years old) at the University of Singapore under free-living conditions, the researchers report an average meal-time photography rate of about 5%, measured across a total of about 7,000 recorded meals. Meanwhile, only 23% of all study participants partook in any meal-time photography, who, in turn, photographed 16% of their meals. These findings seem to suggest that a minority of power-users capture most of the photographic content, at a rate of about one out of six meals. The employed Experience Sampling methodology reached a response rate of 76%, lending credibility to the results. Unfortunately, the study did not report the context of meal photography. Thus, it is impossible to draw any conclusions on whether the widespread reports of food photography's ubiquity are an overestimation or merely a matter of context.",

This fact makes food universally relatable and, consequently, a good vehicle for cross-cultural empathy (cf. Woolley and Fishbach, 2017) . For example, people living away from their childhood region or country may feel nostalgic in relationship to specific food posted online (Connolly, 2015) . While people from other cultures may not have any particular memories tied to the same food, they nevertheless can recognize the sentiment and empathize with the person posting about the nostalgic food experience. More generally, food is associated with and implied in all aspects of the human experience (Ibrahim, 2015) . By publicly sharing everyday food images, people allow for a deep and intimate look into their private lives, juxtaposing the private and public spaces. In this private and public hybrid space, cultural exchange is enhanced (Ibrahim, 2015) . It seems not surprising, then, that these authors emphasize that \"food is more than just fuel for bodies\" (see also Connolly, 2015; Ibrahim, 2015) .",

This means that the \"brain areas representing Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org knowledge for a particular category are those typically used to process its physical instances\" (Simmons et al., 2005) . Especially in this point grounded theories stand in opposition to classical theories of cognition, which claim that cognition works mainly on amodal, abstract symbols, with embodied and cross-modal effects only being peripheral or epiphenomenal (Barsalou, 2008 ). There appears to be no central \"simulation area\" in the brain; instead, multiple areas jointly produce these mental images. The activation of these brain areas can lead to subsequent physiological responses downstream, including desire to consume and satiation (for a review, see, e.g., Krishna and Schwarz, 2014; more recently, Papies et al., 2020) . To quote Christian et al. (2016, p. 85) : \"The pathway from simulation to consumption rests on the fact that mental imagery is facilitated by reactivation of the sensorimotor systems that support perception and action. \" It might be worth pointing out that, while very much related, mental simulation and imagery are not the same. The former is an automatic and implicit process, while the latter is deliberate and conscious (Simmons et al., 2005) . Either way, we see mental simulation and imagery as essential cognitive mechanisms in understanding the effect of viewing, creating, and sharing food photography.",

This is also the case for food. Thinking about and seeing food depictions activates the same gustatory system as seeing real food (Simmons et al., 2005) . The brain essentially infers taste as well as taste and consumption reward -including energy content (Toepel et al., 2009; van der Laan et al., 2011 ) -based on the visual food cues. Accordingly, hunger is modulated on at the neural level (van der Laan et al., 2011) .",

In fact, a dedicated neural network for eating has been identified (Chen et al., 2016) and recent evidence suggests that attention is biased toward food compared to non-food cues (see Spetter et al., 2020) . This bias has been demonstrated both behaviorally (Higgs et al., 2012 Rutters et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2016; Kaisari et al., 2019) and at the neurological level (Spetter et al., 2020) . The cognitive basis for the effect is 2-fold. Firstly, while thinking of anythingi.e., holding representations in working memory -guides perceptual awareness toward similar environmental stimuli, this effect is more pronounced for food stimuli, especially when high in energy content (Toepel et al., 2009 ), due to their higher affective value (cf. generally Zeelenberg et al., 2006) . Secondly, food representations are held more efficiently in working memory than those of non-food items. Therefore, more working memory will be available to process new environmental stimuli. In combination, these findings indicate that thinking about food further primes attention for food cues.",

The connection between circulating ghrelin levels and food intake may, at least in part, be a learned response linking interoception and behavior (Hsu et al., 2016) . More generally, ghrelin plays an important role in the regulation of food reward in the brain, via interaction with dopaminergic neurons (for a review, see Perello and Dickson, 2015) .

The researchers concluded that real food and depictions elicit significantly different responses, based on the findings that participants expected real food to be statistically significantly more satiating (+0.55 on a 5-point satiety scale) and were willing to pay 6% more. However, despite the statistical significance, one may say that the absolute differences were relatively small. More to the latter point, a meta-analysis of a total of 3,300 study participants found equal outcome effect sizes in downstream eating behavior in response to viewing real food and food depictions (Boswell and Kober, 2016) .

Madzharov and Block (2010) replicated the portion size effect by showing how the quantity of food printed on the packaging positively correlates with actual consumption. This would suggest that images that depict larger food quantities elicit stronger cravings. However, two other studies suggest that the effect of portion size is not so straightforward. In one study, by reducing the size of the serving plate while keeping the depicted food portion constant, participants rated the food more appetizing, were willing to pay more for it, yet served themselves less of the actual food . In another study, images of meals judged \"too big\" lead to lower activation in brain areas relevant in reward processing (Toepel et al., 2015) . It seems, then, that the perception of portion sizes depends both on the depicted food quantity and the presentation, and that greater depicted portions lead to increased food intake only up to a point.",

However, given that healthiness evaluations affect both food choice (Nikolova and Inman, 2015) and portion size (Suher et al., 2016) , how do consumers determine the healthiness of depicted food? One common way is for consumers to simply categorize food as either \"good\" or \"bad\" (Rozin et al., 1996) . A more subtle way is by how pretty the food looks. According to earlier research, food naturalness is heuristically linked to healthiness (Rozin, 2005) . Following up on these results, Hagen (2020) conducted a series of experiments showing that consumers consider prettier images of the same food as more natural and, hence, more healthy, with an increased willing-to-pay. However, only images depicting food arranged according to classic esthetics, e.g., in symmetry and regular, induced the perception of naturalness. Also more generally, consumers seem to prefer symmetrically arranged of food depictions (Velasco et al., 2016) .",

On a general note, the engineers found that food photos had an approximately 30% higher engagement-likelihood, compared to non-food photos. Filter-edited food images were 16% more likely to be viewed, compared to raw images. It is important to remark that this was a correlational study and, while accounting for a multitude of variables, the authors emphasize that their analysis does not prove causality. To empirically study the impact of color on food image attractiveness, Paakki et al. (2019) asked consumers to rate the attractiveness of 10 different salads, five pale and five colorful. The color of each salad was measured with a colorimeter, and consumers ranked the photos of the salads according to attractiveness, and provided their reasoning as free text. The quantitative analysis showed that consumers preferred the colorful salads with high color contrast and saturation, as well as salads with the complementary colors red and green. Furthermore, text analysis suggested that the colorful salads signaled freshness and ingredient diversity. At least for fruit and vegetables, we may, therefore, conclude that higher contrast and deeper color saturation make for more attractive food photos.",

Indulging in unhealthy food typically causes a cognitive conflict between short-term indulgence and longterm health maintenance. This conflict reduces available cognitive resources and leads to reduced taste evaluations (Poor et al., 2013) . Images of others eating (so-called \"consummatory\" images) unhealthy food serve as evidence for indulgence's social acceptability. This evidence resolves the cognitive conflict and increases taste evaluations (Poor et al., 2013) . Interestingly, this need not even be images of others eatingself-reflections and statics self-portraits during eating also increase taste evaluation and consumption (Nakata and Kawai, 2017) . Hence, images of unhealthy food cueing the consumption's social acceptability seem to promote unhealthy eating behavior more than depicting the food without any social cues.",

Apart from orientation, the perspective of the image also seems to influence eating behavioral outcomes. Christian et al. (2016) found that imagining the consumption of indulgent food from a firstperson perspective increased consumption and willingness-to-pay more than imagining it from a third-person perspective. The authors concluded that the ease of mental simulation makes the first-person perspective more affectively stimulating. In contrast, the simulation difficulty in the third-person perspective and the concomitant reduction in affect allows for more cognitive and deliberate decision making. These results were replicated in a neuroimaging study by Basso et al. (2018) in the context of food videos.

            "text": "Like any other behavior (cf. Gibson, 1979) , eating is goaldirected. One of the implicit consumption goals is eating pleasure (cf. Poor et al., 2013) . We suspect that the effects of photography on eating behavior depend on the congruence between the salient consumption goal and behavior (for a review on goal-priming, see Papies, 2016) . Incongruence can lead to a cognitive conflict, which reduces the intensity of experienced pleasure (cf. Poor et al., 2013) . Coary and Poor (2016) have shown that food photography can increase the taste evaluation of indulgent but not healthy food. The researchers provide evidence illustrating how photography both (1) directs attention to the food, i.e., increasing awareness of its properties, and (2) delays consumption, leading to an increased savoring of the indulgent experience. Healthy food is inherently less tasty than unhealthy food (Raghunathan et al., 2006) , so healthy eating is incongruent with the consumption goal of pleasure. However, when Coary and Poor made descriptive healthy (vs. unhealthy) eating social norms salient, photographing healthy food before consumption lead to the same increase in taste evaluations seen previously for indulgent food. The awareness of the healthy eating social norm changed the consumption goal from indulgence to healthy eating, thus aligning goal and behavior. Photography becomes an amplifier for goal-dependent reward. One might ask, if being on a diet would shift the consumption goal toward healthy eating and enable photography's pleasure-enhancing effect by default? (cf. Papies and Hamstra, 2010) .",

Customers that photographed their meal reported higher engagement and consequently increased meal enjoyment. The researchers also provide evidence for the claim that photography generally amplifies the inherent valence of experiences -positive experiences become more positive and negative experiences more negative. The intention to photograph directs attention toward valuable visual aspects of an experience -no need to actually photograph anything. Especially in the context of food, it might be worth noting that directing attention toward the visual aspects also means directing it away from other sensory aspects (cf. Barasch et al., 2017) .",

However, all of the experimental conditions were at least as enjoyable as the no-photography control condition. In the context of food photography sharing, this might mean that using the phone to take a photo of the dish adds to the meal experience, whereas navigating to the Instagram app, editing the image, and posting it detracts from the experience.

The researchers employed a within-participants design across two sessions separated by 1 week. In the first session, participants took photos before starting to eat, either of their food or of non-food objects, with the whole session lasting 12 min. The second session was an exact replication of the first, yet without any photography. The results showed no difference between the two photography conditions in any outcome measures, including ad-libitum food consumption, meal enjoyment, liking, wanting, or willingnessto-pay. Ad-libitum consumption in the first session was lower than in the second session. Due to the study design, it is impossible to say whether the fixed session order affected the results. Moreover, the lack of a comparable control group also raises the question, whether the similarity of the photography conditions is due to a general null finding or their actual equivalence. Furthermore, the study at hand took place in a laboratory setting, compared with the previous study's food market. In the former, baseline attention might have already been optimal, whereas, in the latter, the distracting environment made photography beneficial. The authors justify their study design referencing previous literature (i.e., Coary and Poor, 2016; Diehl et al., 2016 ), yet the lack of a proper control group or session randomization seem like a missed opportunity.",

These results illustrate the social component of food. Therefore, it seems appropriate to investigate how interacting socially with and through food photography affects eating behavior. However, to our knowledge, the interaction of sharing food images and eating behavior has yet to be studied quantitatively. A potential explanation for the dearth of direct research on food photography sharing could be that researchers may consider observer effects more interesting based on the assumption that more people view food images than create and share them. In this section, we will, therefore, draw mostly on sociological research, as well as media reports, to outline what kind of food photography is shared, why it is shared, and how it might influence the sharer herself. In later parts of this review, we will expand on the topic by relating analogous scientific research to hypothesize about the impact of food photography sharing on eating behavior. Social support is one reason to share food photography. People are known to use their Instagram profiles to track eating behavior, i.e., as food diaries (Connolly, 2015; Chung et al., 2017) . People also use Instagram to supplement the recovery from eating disorders (Mirhashem, 2015; Benveniste, 2016) . Using the platform as a food journal and recovery report, people can digitally receive emotional support from peers. However, Instagram supposedly invites and amplifies the natural tendency for social comparison and, as such, the maintenance of a favorable public presence can overtake the original intended purpose of supporting recovery.",

Furthermore, the habit of sharing food photography proposedly changes what people eat, and changes even the primary motivation behind eating (see generally Turner, 2020; Turner and Gilmore, 2020) . According to these authors, some people have come to choose food solely based on visual appeal and eat for social recognition instead of for taste and nourishment. In other words, the commentators lament precisely the fact that food \"has moved beyond simply fuel\" (Kingkade, 2013) .",

Some researchers have used the fact that viewing a high number of food images can induce sensory-specific satiety (as reviewed in previous sections) to suggest that food porn viewing may be a potentially health-promoting habit (e.g., Petit et al., 2016) . Other researchers question this optimism (Missbach et al., 2014) . First, these researchers replicated previous findings of mental imagery-induced sensory-specific satiety, whereby imagining eating gummy bears, compared to inserting coins into a laundry machine, decreased subsequent actual consumption of gummy bears. The authors went on to show that mental imagery-induced satiation does not occur when self-regulatory resources are depleted (e.g., when people are tired). The result of this study dramatically diminishes the practical utility of viewing food images to induce satiety, as it would be in precisely these situations of mental fatigue, and thereby impaired selfregulation (cf. Baumeister and Vohs, 2003) , where external tools would be most beneficial.",

The previous section on viewing food photography has established that type of food and the presented portion sizes are problematic, as they encourage overconsumption. Variety in a meal has a similar effect on food intake. Early research has established that within-meal food variety increases overall energy intake (Rolls et al., 1981a; see, e.g., McCrory et al., 2012 for a more recent review). This effect is closely related to sensory-specific satiety (see Remick et al., 2009) . Moreover, the effect of variety also applies to mental imagery. Galak et al. (2009) instructed study participants to eat until satiated and subsequently recall the variety of past eating experiences. The recall \"recovered\" participants from satiation, thus, they would continue eating. While the effect of food image variety on food intake has yet to be studied, it seems natural to assume that the same overall effect would be seen, given the established connection of visual food cues and mental simulation. In combination, the effects of depicted food type, variety, and portion size suggest that food image platforms such as Instagram provide optimal appetite stimulation, which may sabotage any individual's best effort to control their food intake.",

            "text": "Agency is the sense of being in control of one's action, and is, therefore, an important motivator of goal-directed behavior (Bandura, 2010) . Expenditure of effort is known to increase agency (Demanet et al., 2013) . In a series of experiments, Hagen et al. (2017) have shown that low physical involvement when obtaining food decreases the sense of responsibility and concomitantly leads to less healthy food choices. The authors propose that the mechanism behind this result is due to selfserving (re)attribution -the psychological tendency to interpret behavior so that the most beneficial self-conception can be maintained (e.g., Heider, 1958) . Thus, it is common for people to assume agency for their own positive behavior and reject agency, i.e., point at external factors, for negative behavior. Facts only loosely constrain such interpretations of personal responsibility. However, as these interpretations need to be socially believable, they hinge on the availability -or absenceof \"reasonable\" evidence. The studies of Hagen et al. (2017) show that comparatively minor physical actions are sufficient evidence to change the sense of agency and, consequently, behavior. For example, in a waiting room setting, having participants serve themselves unhealthy snacks from a big jar, compared with having pre-filled cups available, was sufficient to reduce sweets consumption dramatically. Follow-up investigations showed that choosing unhealthy food in low physical involvement conditions impacts positive self-regard less negatively than high physical involvement conditions. In contrast, when serving healthy food, there were no differences in amount consumed or feelings of positive self-regard between physical involvement conditions. We hypothesize that photographing food represents reasonable evidence of responsibility for the food choice and portion size, comparable to increasing physical involvement as reported by Hagen et al. (2017) . As such, food photography could enhance the negative impact that unhealthy eating has on self-regard and, therefore, increase the likelihood of making healthier eating decisions long-term. The sense of agency also influences people's value perception. Norton et al. (2012) have shown that, mediated by an increased sense of agency, physical involvement increases the valuation of creations -the so-called \"IKEA effect. \" Selfcooked food also tastes better, yet also leads to increased consumption (Dohle et al., 2014) . These results are congruent with the digital photography-mediated increase in meal enjoyment reported by Diehl et al. (2016) . By analogy, the congruence between these findings from the \"physical\" and the \"digital\" world suggests that food photography could lead to similarly increased healthy eating choices as seen in Hagen et al. (2017) . In sum, we propose food photography as a promising method to increase people's sense of responsibility and, thereby, make healthier food choices.",

Food photography could be a more objective way to record eating behavior. The practice has been validated as a very accurate food intake measurement method in multiple settings and populations (for a review, see Martin et al., 2014) . The Rapid Food Photography Method (RFPM) is a well-defined clinical methodology for measuring food intake under free-living conditions. Under 6 days of free-living conditions, the RFPM underestimated daily energy intake by an average of 150 calories, compared to the gold-standard method of Doubly Labeled Water (Martin et al., 2012) .

To provide some perspective, food labels in the European Union only need to be +/\u221220% accurate. 6 Participants of studies in free-living conditions scored the method highly in terms of practical viability. While the RFPM is more intricate than presented here, the point is that photography can provide accurate information of both food quality and quantity. Carter et al. (2013) have shown that weight loss assistance apps on smartphones are superior in terms of adherence compared to implementations on websites on paper. Given the ubiquity of camera-quipped smartphones in the developed world (Pew Research Center, 2019), food photography thus shows the potential to be a practical and non-intrusive food intake management method.",

For example, amnesiacs may experience satiation, yet eat almost an entire second meal only a few minutes later (Higgs et al., 2008) . In a systematic review on attentive eating, Robinson et al. (2013) showed that (1) reduced attention and visual cues during eating moderately affect immediate food intake, yet (2) reduced attention had a large effect on later food intake, and (3) episodic memory formation was linked to later food intake. In a follow-up experimental study, eating attentively led to a 30% reduction in later food intake in obese women (Robinson et al., 2014) . However, contrary to the result of an earlier study (Higgs and Donohoe, 2011) , the reduction in food intake was not mediated through improved memory. In the 2014 study, the authors noted that both the experimental and control groups had achieved high memory scores, presumably reaching a ceiling. In their review, the authors call to investigate practical methods that facilitate attentive eating, meal memory formation, and before-meal recall of prior consumption (Robinson et al., 2013) .",

To further illustrate the point of photography's general effect on cognition, the memory of not-photographed objects was also improved. Here, we would like to reiterate that food photography needs to introduce as little distraction as possible during the meal itself. Not only does distraction impair the experience, but it also impairs memory formation (see Robinson et al., 2013) -quite the opposite of what we are trying to promote.",

One approach could be to influence how satiated one ought to be. According to the concept of expected satiety, satiety does not depend only on the actual nutritional content of food but also on how satiating it is believed or expected to be . For example, in one study post-ingestive satiety of identical smoothies depended on whether the researchers told participants that the smoothie contained small or large amounts of fruit . Based on the information given, the participants reflexively imagined how satiated they would be after the meal, affecting also their subsequent physiological response. While the effect studied by Brunstrom et al. (2011) was prospective, i.e., the information came before the sensation, under certain circumstances, it might be possible to trigger a similar effect in the reversed order (cf. Loftus and Pickrell, 1995) . In the context of a photographic food diary, reviewing computationally enlarged images of the most recent meals might lead to compensation at subsequent eating occasions. This hypothesis is based on the assumption, that people would expect to be full more quickly, believing that previous meals were larger than they actually have been. AR applications that enlarge food sizes in real-time have already been proven to decrease consumption (Narumi et al., 2012) , thus partly validating the concept.",

Increased selfpresentational concerns mediate this effect. The self-presentational concerns raise anxiety and shift the focus away from the experience and toward the self, subsequently reducing people's engagement with, and enjoyment of, the eating experience. For the same reason, audience size affects what is shared in the first place (Barasch and Berger, 2014) . According to the Barasch and Berger (2014) , audiences larger than one trigger self-presentational concerns, resulting in the sharing of less useful and more self-promotional content. In contrast, during one-to-one communication, people focus more on each other and share more useful information. These findings seem similar to those of Kozinets et al. (2016) levels of social network participation in a food context, discussed earlier. Therefore, we suspect that taking images intended for sharing might raise self-presentational concerns and thus reduce the subsequent meal enjoyment.",

Therefore, we hypothesize that sharing, e.g., healthy food might fulfill the need to portray oneself as a healthy person and consequently decrease the need for actually eating healthily. However, the reverse might be equally true: sharing photos of one's indulgences might trigger the drive to make more healthy eating decisions. Digital confession, so to speak.",

Firstly, the subject of viewing food photography has accumulated the most direct research. On the one hand, viewing indulgent food images triggers mental simulations and thereby stimulates appetite (van der Laan et al., 2011; Boswell and Kober, 2016) . On the other hand, viewing many food images could also induce sensory-specific satiety (Larson et al., 2014) . However, we suggest that this approach is unlikely to be of practical benefit for two reasons. One, food variation in meals opposes the effect of sensory-specific satiety (Rolls et al., 1981a) , and online image feeds tend to show a wide food variety. Two, the imagery-induced satiety effect depends on cognitive selfcontrol resources (Missbach et al., 2014) , which often are the limiting factor limiting self-control in the first place (cf. Baumeister and Vohs, 2003) . Interestingly, viewing healthy food photos does not appear to have much of a beneficial effect (Poor et al., 2013; cf. Christian et al., 2016) .",

Research suggests that photography per se, irrespectively of the photographed object, increases (visual) attention (Barasch et al., 2017) and the overall enjoyment of experiences . These general effects also seem to apply to food and increase meal enjoyment and taste evaluation (Coary and Poor, 2016; Diehl et al., 2016; contra Yong et al., 2020) . However, the photography should interfere as little as possible with the eating experience  cf. da Mata Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2019) -photo editing and uploading might best be delayed until after the meal. Further, we hypothesize that, by going through the effort of taking a photograph of the food, people will feel more responsible for their food choices, leading to greater satisfaction in the moment and healthier eating behavior over time (Norton et al., 2012; Dohle et al., 2014; cf. Hagen et al., 2017) . The photography-induced increase in attention might improve memory (Barasch et al., 2017) , which could be exploited to improve long-term bodyweight management (cf. Robinson et al., 2013) . In this context, we see it as critical to review previous meals' photos before subsequent meals (Robinson et al., 2013; cf. Henkel, 2014) .",
