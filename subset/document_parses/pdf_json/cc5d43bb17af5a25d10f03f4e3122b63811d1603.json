            "text": "Turbulent gas motions are observed in the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM is densitystratified, with the gas density being highest at the centre of the cluster and decreasing radially outwards. As a result of this, Kolmogorov (homogeneous, isotropic) turbulence theory does not apply to the ICM. The gas motions are instead explained by anisotropic stratified turbulence, with the stratification quantified by the perpendicular Froude number (Fr \u22a5 ). These turbulent motions are associated with density and pressure fluctuations, which manifest as perturbations in X-ray surface brightness maps of the ICM and as thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ) fluctuations, respectively. In order to advance our understanding of the relations between these fluctuations and the turbulent gas velocities, we have conducted 100 high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of stratified turbulence (256 2 \u00d7 384-1024 2 \u00d7 1536 resolution elements), in which we scan the parameter space of subsonic rms Mach number (M), Fr \u22a5 , and the ratio of entropy and pressure scale heights ( = / ), relevant to the ICM. We develop a new scaling relation between the standard deviation of logarithmic density fluctuations ( , where = ln( / )), M, and Fr \u22a5 , which covers both the strongly stratified (Fr \u22a5 1) and weakly stratified (Fr \u22a5 1) turbulence regimes: 2 = ln 1 + 2 M 4 + 0.10/(Fr \u22a5 + 0.25/ \u221a Fr \u22a5 ) 2 M 2 , where \u223c 1/3 for solenoidal turbulence driving studied here. We further find that logarithmic pressure fluctuations (ln / ) are independent of stratification and scale according to the relation 2 (ln\u00af) = ln 1 + 2 2 M 4 , where\u00af= / and is the adiabatic index of the gas. We have tested these scaling relations to be valid over the parameter ranges M = 0.01-0.40, Fr \u22a5 = 0.04-10.0, and = 0.33-2.33.",

It is mostly composed of the hot X-ray emitting gas, \u2605 E-mail: rajsekhar.mohapatra@anu.edu.au \u2020 E-mail: christoph.federrath@anu.edu.au \u2021 E-mail: prateek@iisc.ac.in with temperatures ranging from 10 7 -10 8 K, although a filamentary colder phase has also been detected in many clusters (Cowie et al. 1983; McDonald et al. 2010; Simionescu et al. 2018; Vantyghem et al. 2019; Olivares et al. 2019) . It is moderately stratified (with Richardson number Ri 10 or Froude number Fr \u22a5 0.1, refer to figure 1 in Mohapatra et al. 2020 ) and the gas is in rough hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational profile set by the dark matter halo. Turbulence in the ICM plays an important role in the gas dynamics and evolution. Turbulent energy dissipation on viscous scales and subsequent heating of the ICM, turbulent mixing of hot and cold phases of gas (Kim & Narayan 2003; Banerjee & Sharma 2014; Hillel & Soker 2020 ) may also play a key role in the gas thermodynamics, by preventing the runaway cooling of the ICM core (Zhuravleva et al. 2014a) . Anisotropy in turbulent eddies may be used to probe the orientation of ICM magnetic fields (Hu et al. 2020) . In cluster outskirts, estimating the turbulent pressure support of the gas is important to get an unbiased estimate of the halo mass that is required for cosmology with clusters (Schuecker et al. 2004 ; George et al. 2009; Bautz et al. 2009; Cavaliere et al. 2011; Nelson et al. 2014; Biffi et al. 2016; Angelinelli et al. 2020 ). However, direct measurements of the ICM turbulent gas velocities (Hitomi Collaboration 2016) are still a few years away (XRISM 1 and Athena 2 ), after the early mission end of the Hitomi satellite. Recently, observers have relied on several indirect methods to estimate gas velocities in the hot phase, such as relating X-ray surface brightness fluctuations to turbulent velocity fluctuations (Zhuravleva et al. 2014a (Zhuravleva et al. , 2015 (Zhuravleva et al. , 2019 , relating Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ) observations to turbulent pressure fluctuations (Zeldovich & Sunyaev 1969; Khatri & Gaspari 2016; Mroczkowski et al. 2019) , measuring cold-gas velocities (e.g., using the H line) and relating this to the hot phase velocity . Simionescu et al. (2019) provide a detailed review of all these different methods of measuring gas velocities in the ICM. It is important to develop accurate and robust scaling relations between the ICM hot-gas velocities and these observables.",

We also proposed a scaling relation between density fluctuations, Richardson number (Ri) and M for this regime. We found that density fluctuations also depended on a third parameter, namely the ratio between pressure and entropy scale heights ( = / ). We found that for Ri 10 (only moderately stratified), these numbers are sensitive to the turbulent driving length scale , as Ri \u221d 2 . Here we scan the parameter space of these three parameters: M, the transverse Froude number Fr \u22a5 (Fr \u22a5 \u2248 1/ \u221a Ri for Fr \u22a5 1) and through 100 simulations, extending into the strongly stratified regime (Fr \u22a5 1). The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we briefly describe our setup and methods, present our results and their interpretations in section 3, compare our results with the literature and discuss the caveats of our work in section 4, and conclude in section 5. 1 https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sas/xrism/ 2 https://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu/",

Along the direction, we use reflective boundary conditions for velocity and Dirichlet boundary conditions for pressure and density with the guard cells filled according to eq.

In MFS20, we used reflective boundary conditions along the direction, which led to a hydrostatic instability at the direction boundaries (due to an inverted pressure gradient at these boundaries). This instability was stronger for strongly stratified turbulence simulations and led to anomalous sound waves moving in the direction, starting from the boundaries (also seen in Shi & Zhang 2019, hereafter SZ19). The Dirichlet boundary conditions used here let us avoid this instability and allow us to extend our study to include the strongly stratified turbulence limit (down to Fr \u22a5 \u223c 0.05). We restrict our analyses to a cube of size 1 centred at (0, 0, 0), with boundaries at (\u00b10.5, \u00b10.5, \u00b10.5), to avoid any other anomalous effects near the direction boundaries.

This is valid for log-normal distributions of\u00afbut it also holds approximately for non-log-normal distributions with small 2 (see Appendix 6). Thus, we find that introducing stratification has two main effects. For Fr \u22a5 0.5, due to the existing density gradient, the turbulent motions in the direction produce higher density fluctuations. This happens simply because when a gas parcel moves along the direction, it only attains pressure equilibrium at that height, but still has a density contrast with respect to its surroundings.On assuming isotropic gas velocities, which is roughly valid for Fr 0.5 (see fig. 2 ), we obtain\u00af2 buoy = 2 M 2 /Fr 2 \u22a5 (eq. 13b). However, on further increasing the stratification (Fr \u22a5 0.5), the turbulence becomes anisotropic as gas motions along the direction are suppressed, with the kinetic energy along the direction being converted into buoyancy potential energy. The turbulent eddies flatten along the direction and become pancake-like (see lower panels of fig. 1 ). In this limit, the motion along the direction is best described by BV oscillations. The amplitude of these oscillations is proportional to , which decreases with decreasing Fr \u22a5 for constant M (see fig. 6 ). Substituting the Fr \u22a5 dependence of the ratio / \u22a5 , we obtain\u00af2 buoy = 2 M 2 Fr \u22a5 (eq. 13c). The general expression for the dependence of\u00af2 buoy (eq. 13d) is thus an interpolation between these two forms. For even stronger stratification (Fr \u22a5 0.001), we expect the amplitude of\u00af2 buoy to decrease below\u00af2 turb , and the net density fluctuations would again be given by\u00af2 \u223c 2 M 4 , similar to the unstratified subsonic turbulence scaling. One can interpret this limit as 2D subsonic turbulence, with M representing the 2D Mach number, since \u22a5 .",

Firstly, the box heats up in larger M bin simulations (especially M bin = 0.25 and 0.4), which leads to an increased speed of sound and a decreased Mach number.

This effect is known as the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect (see Mroczkowski et al. 2019 , for a review). Although it is possible to recover turbulent gas velocities from the resolved observations of the tSZ effect (Khatri & Gaspari 2016) , the present observations suffer from a lack of angular resolution (e.g., up to a few 100 kpc for the Coma cluster). The tSZ observations also suffer from projection effects (more than X-ray surface brightness which is proportional to 2 ), which makes the measured pressure fluctuations even smoother than the density fluctuations. Many of these limitations are expected to be addressed by future facilities (see section 6.2 of Mroczkowski et al. 2019) . The relative robustness of the relation between pressure fluctuations and turbulent velocities (unlike density fluctuations which depend on stratification and thermodynamic parameters) provides a strong motivation for high angular resolution SZ observations. simulation parameters.

However, as we showed in figure 1 of MFS20 (also in figure 2 of SZ19), the ICM can have Fr \u22a5 between 0.1-100. Thus, we suggest that observational studies use eq. (17) to obtain a more accurate estimate of turbulent velocities from density (surface brightness) fluctuations. Since Fr \u22a5 1 also marks the onset of large-scale density anisotropy (see lower panels of fig. 1 and also  fig. 10 in MFS20), one could use the peak value of 2 , where it varies slowly with Fr \u22a5 for relating the ICM density and velocity fluctuations",

This happens because for the steepest pressure profiles with \u2248 0.1, the initial pressure varies by more than a factor of 10 6 across the entire domain. These steep gradients could possibly make the code numerically unstable near the low-pressure positive boundary. Using smaller box sizes (so that pressure values at the positive box boundary are higher) and/or higher resolution along the direction is a possible solution to this problem.
