Two pharmacovigilance studies reported cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia after a second ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose, but because of lack of clinical data, none of these could be classified as VITT. [7] [8] [9] Knowledge on whether VITT can occur after a second ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose is relevant for clinicians and policymakers, especially in low-and middleincome countries, which are currently the main users of adenovirus-based vaccines. 10 We used data from the \"CVT after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination\" registry 4,11 to identify VITT-related CVT cases occurring after a second ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose.",

            "text": "In patient 3 with symptom onset on day 1, the rapid onset could be explained if circulating anti-PF4 antibodies were present after the first vaccination, suggesting immunological preconditioning similar to that described in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 12 Of note, no specific events were observed after the first dose of this vaccine, suggesting that the development of VITT after the second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 cannot be predicted on clinical grounds. Although the numbers are small, the clinical severity appears comparable to CVT-VITT after a first ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose, as 2 patients had an intracerebral hemorrhage, 1 had a concurrent venous thrombosis, and 2 patients died during admission. 4, 5, 13 Based on reported CVT cases to the registry, VITT appears to be much less common after a second ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose than after a first. However, since many countries, especially in Europe, restricted the use of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine after the emergence of VITT, the lower frequency of reported VITT after a second dose could partly be explained by the fact that fewer people received a second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than a first dose. Even so, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show that, until week 33 of 2021, 39 million first doses and 29 million second doses were administered in the European Economic Area. 14 Therefore, this imbalance cannot fully explain the difference in the incidence of VITT. Still, due to the risk of reporting bias, data from our registry must be interpreted cautiously when concluding that VITT is much less common after a second than after a first dose.",
