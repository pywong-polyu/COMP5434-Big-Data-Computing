Patients who survived had lower median viral genome copies than those who did not (p=0.021). Compared to uninfected controls, COVID-19 patients had higher median fecal levels of IL-8 (166.5 vs 286.5 pg/mg; p=0.05) and lower levels of fecal IL-10 (678 vs 194 pg/mg; p<0.001) compared to uninfected controls.

Intestinal inflammation in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea has been suggested by elevated levels of stool calprotectin, a protein released by neutrophils and used as a stool biomarker in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 6 . Furthermore, distinct alterations in the fecal microbiota are observed in COVID-19 patients 7 , suggestive of immune dysregulation in the gut mucosa. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the putative receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is highly expressed on the small intestinal epithelium 8, 9 and viral RNA has been detected in the stools of patients with COVID-19 for prolonged periods of time 10, 11 . If virus can actively replicate in the gut and be transmitted by this route is unknown, with conflicting reports in the literature [12] [13] [14] . SARS-CoV-2 can infect human-derived gut organoids (enteroids), supporting plausibility for infection of the gastrointestinal epithelium and a direct mucosal pathology that results in GI symptoms [15] [16] [17] . However, the exact pathophysiology of GI manifestations in COVID-19 is to be determined.",

Ten (32.2%) of patients with and 6 (46.2%) without GI symptoms presented with severe disease. Overall distribution of disease severity on admission was similar in patients presenting with or without GI symptoms (p=0.60) as was peak severity during admission (p=0.75) ( Table 1) . Similar rates of mortality were observed in patients presenting with GI symptoms (n=5; 16.1%) compared to those without GI symptoms (n=2; 15.4%) (p > 0.99); however, significantly lower proportion of patients with GI symptoms (n=6; 19.4%) were admitted to the ICU compared with those without GI symptoms (n=7; 53.8%, p=0.03; Fisher's exact test) ( Table 2) . As expected, more severe disease at presentation (p=0.09) and more severe disease during admission (p=0.02), were associated with higher frequencies of ICU admission or death (Supplementary Table 3 ). When looking at inflammatory markers in serum, there were no significant differences observed between those with GI symptoms and those without, although those with GI symptoms tended to have lower serum IL-6 and IL-8 ( Figure 1B) . Additionally, no differences were observed in white blood cell count (WBC), absolute lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin, or liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase; AST, alanine aminotransferase; ALT, alkaline phosphatase; ALKP) in those with GI symptoms compared to those without ( Figure 1B , Supplementary Figure S1A ). Peak disease severity was associated with significantly higher serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 consistent with prior reports 19, 20, 23 ( Figure 1C ). Additionally, severe disease was associated with higher serum CRP, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin and procalcitonin ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1B ). There were no significant differences in liver enzymes in those with severe disease compared to those with mild or moderate disease (Supplementary Figure S1B) . No other notable differences in serum inflammatory markers or laboratory values were noted in patients with GI symptoms or with severe disease (Supplementary Figure S1A and B).",

We first examined differences in fecal cytokines between COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Levels of fecal IL-8 were significantly elevated while levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared to uninfected controls ( Figure 3A ), while the remaining tested cytokines were not significantly different. Although we observed elevated levels of IL-1b and TNF\u03b1 in some COVID-19 patients, this was not consistent across the cohort ( Figure 3A ). Next, we analyzed fecal cytokines in COVID-19 patients stratified by disease severity. IL-23 was the only cytokine that was significantly different between groups with higher a concentration in patients with severe COVID-19 disease ( Figure 3B ). The remainder of fecal cytokines analyzed (IL-1b, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, TNFa) were not significantly different in COVID-19 patients compared to controls nor associated with severity of disease ( Figure 3A and B). We found no difference in the concentration of any fecal cytokine between those patients reporting diarrhea compared to those without diarrhea ( Figure S3A ). Fecal concentrations of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFa were not associated with concentrations of these cytokines measured in serum at the time of admission, although it is important to note that these samples were collected on different study days (median 16 days, range 2-66 days between samples; Figure S3B ). Fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation, was not associated with COVID-19 disease severity (p=0.12; Figure 3C ) nor stool viral genome load (p=0.22; Figure 3D ).",

We evaluated the fecal microbiome of the COVID-19 patient cohort by both metagenomic shotgun and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Analysis of both datasets revealed no features of composition, structure or diversity that associated with disease severity ( Figure 4A ). Furthermore, we found no consistent changes in gut microbiome composition or richness in samples from patients reporting diarrhea, although the Shannon entropy, a metric of community richness and evenness, was slightly lower in samples with higher Bristol scores (p=0.034; Figure 4B ). Patients currently or recently treated with antibiotics, particularly vancomycin and/or ceftriaxone showed significant compositional disruption and reduced diversity as measured by both 16S (p=0.03) and metagenomic (p=0.0079) sequencing ( Figure 4C ). These data further support a relative lack of severe inflammation, which would be expected to skew the composition of the microbiota, and suggests that antibiotic therapy, common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, has a greater impact on the gut microbiome than SARS-CoV-2 infection itself, regardless of GI symptoms or clinical course.",

In approximately 40% of individuals, we detected SARS-CoV-2 genome in feces by qPCR, with higher levels of viral RNA among donors with diarrhea, consistent with a recent report of hospitalized patients in Hong Kong 5 . Although detection of viral RNA does not prove infectivity, these results point towards productive SARS-CoV-2 infection of the intestines. This is supported by expression of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the intestines 14, 39, 40 and by data showing that human gut enteroids support SARS-CoV-2 infection 17 .

Severe disease was further subclassified as with or without evidence of end organ damage defined as: need for vasopressors support, creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 5 times the upper limit of normal. Disease severity was recorded at the time of admission. Subjects were classified based on their symptoms at presentation in patients with and without GI symptoms. Qualifying GI symptoms were diarrhea, nausea or vomiting (at least one episode of self-reported symptom per day prior to presentation). Date of overall symptoms and of GI symptoms were also recorded. Clinical outcomes were collected as maximum level of oxygenation required during hospitalization (room air, nasal cannula, non-rebreather mask, high flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation), need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and death or discharge from the hospital.",

Briefly, DNA (extracted as for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) was sonicated and Illumina sequencing libraries generated using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit. Ligation products of 500-600 base pairs were purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter) and enrichment PCR performed. Samples were pooled in equal proportions and size-selected using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) before sequencing with an Illumina HiSeq (paired-end 150 bp). One sample yielding less than 100,000 reads was excluded from further analysis. Remaining samples were sequenced to an average depth of 1.52 x 10 6 reads (SD 3.73 x 10 5 ) per sample.",

Assembly was performed as described 24 using a custom pipeline (https://github.com/mjsull/COVID_pipe). To infer the divergence and phylogenetic relationships of the three genomes sequenced from stool samples relative to other global isolates, we used 403 viral genomes from nasopharyngeal samples from the Mount Sinai Hospital collected between February 29 and July 15, and a global background of 4,644 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in GISAID EpiCov database 54 . Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Nextstrain build for SARS-CoV-2 genomes with default parameters 55 . The mutation profiles were analyzed with the tool NextClade v0.3.6 (https://clades.nextstrain.org/). Data is deposited to GISAID and Genbank.",
