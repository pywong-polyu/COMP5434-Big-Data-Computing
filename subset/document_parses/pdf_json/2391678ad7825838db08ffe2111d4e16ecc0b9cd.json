In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations.

The VOBN has two main limitations. First, the dataset has to contain relatively large amount of data in order to construct the initial network structure. Second, the features introduced into the model should be discretized in a preprocess stage. In this study we used a large HR dataset, in which most of the features contain discrete values, hence yielding high performance of the VOBN.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 587, "end": 591, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 592, "end": 595, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 784, "end": 788, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 789, "end": 792, "text": "62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 793, "end": 796, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 840, "end": 844, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 845, "end": 848, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 849, "end": 852, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Stage 4: patterns identifications"}, {"text": "It is worth noticing that this machine learning model has two main distinctions from traditional hypothesis-testing and regression models. First, the latter focuses on features that are highly correlated with trends across the entire aggregated sample, whereas the analysis by the VOBN model allows for identifying patterns in specific sub-groups. This notion is also closely related to Simpson's Paradox [55] , which shows that an observed trend in subgroups may behave quite differently when these subgroups are aggregated and analyzed together. Second, hypothesis-testing requires inadvance assumptions about the interactions among features, whereas machine learning models do not require such assumptions, and allow for discovering insights that were not assumed ahead.
