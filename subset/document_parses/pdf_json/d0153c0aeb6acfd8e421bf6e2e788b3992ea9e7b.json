This included a curfew, shutdown of shops (except for shops necessary for daily needs), and canceling of all cultural events. In addition, major restrictions of social interactions were in place. The nationwide lockdown was put into effect on March 22 and was released in a stepwise fashion from April 20 until the end of May 2020. As hospitals and private practices tried to prepare for COVID-19 emergencies, routine and elective visits and procedures appeared to be reduced to a minimum, with an inevitable impact on health care for patients with chronic diseases such as epilepsy. Hospital-based activities related to epilepsy care were reportedly cut by more than 90% [1] . It is unclear how physicians in private practices and persons with epilepsy (PWE) were able to cope with this chronic disease under these unique circumstances. Moreover, there were concerns regarding a possible drop in medication adherence among PWE during the pandemic, as observed during previous infectious disease outbreaks. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan, a worsening of seizure control was observed in patients with epilepsy due to ASM withdrawal [2] . Moreover, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, many PWE reported problems with ASM availability, raising the risk for non-adherence [3] .",
