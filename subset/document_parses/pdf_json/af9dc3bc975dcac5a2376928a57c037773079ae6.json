Specifically, the seven prefectures of the treatment group signified 43.1% of the Japanese population. In the sample used in this survey, eight prefectures had megacities of over one million people, \uff17 with the exception of \uff17 Chiba prefecture included Chiba city which has 0.97 million people.B. Features of the dataObservations for the treatment and control groups were 5,492 and 1,269, respectively. Therefore, total observations were 6,761. The survey questionnaire contained basic questions about demographics such as age, gender, educational background, household income, job status, marital status, and number of children. These data were constant in the first, second and third waves because the three waves were conducted within a month. In addition, respondents were asked questions concerning preventive behaviors, which are", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "In this formula, Y itp represents the dependent variable for individual i, wave t, and group g. For the estimation of preventive behaviors, Y is preventive behaviors such as Stay indoors, Do not work, Wear mask, and Washing hands.Treatment is a dummy variable for the treatment group. Key variable was, Wave3 \uf0b4Treatment, cross terms for Wave3 and Treatment. When preventive behaviors were dependent variables, their coefficients were expected to be positive if the declaration promoted citizens to achieve preventive behaviors. On the other hand, when mental conditions were dependent variables, their coefficients were expected to be positive if the declaration deteriorated the mental conditions of the population.The time-invariant individual-level fixed effects are represented by ki. Because of short-term panel data, most of the individual level demographic variables were considered as time-invariant features, which were completely described by ki.
