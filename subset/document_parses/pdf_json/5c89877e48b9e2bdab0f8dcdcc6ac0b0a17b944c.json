            "text": "reliable, or safe. It is generally considered that official agencies are a more reliable source of information than those circulating online. For example, it is better to source information from the World Health Organisation (WHO), or the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as government public health departments of various countries. 2 Unfortunately, different agencies, both health and nonhealth related have become a source of information that is not backed up by scientific evidence, which have resulted in unnecessary stress, anxiety and uncertainty among the general population. 3 However, it has been observed in early literature that when people are faced with the threat of misinformation, there is a possibility that the general population would seek out the truth from trusted and reliable sources for persuasive knowledge with the desire to influence a change in behavior for the better. 4 People intend to recirculate information from a feeling of uncertainty, lack of scientific background, and the lack of intention to check the factual evidence behind a shared piece. 5 The rapid disseminating nature of social media has threated misinformation to become prevalent in nature. With already an overabundance of information, prevalence of misinformation can feed into the cyberchondria and mental stress for the users with a possible negative impact on their cognitive, logical, and decision-making abilities. 1, 6 During the peak of the COVID-19 disease, online searches were the only method for many people to get information on how to protect themselves and their loved ones from this disease. 7 Information found online were quickly shared without confirming their accuracy or truthfulness. The psychological explanation behind the drive to unknowingly spreading potential misinformation is an underlying sense of threat, triggering the self-defense mechanism, causing people to grasp at the earliest, easiest, and most achievable remedy for a concern. 8 This was observed for the use of natural remedies as a means of protection against COVID- 19. There is a significant body of literature regarding COVID-19. Notable studies were conducted where it was found that COVID-19 misinformation spread was prevalent in the UK and USA, especially in their social media platforms. [9] [10] [11] A study conducted in China, 12 and a global metal analysis of existing studies 13 both concluded that misinformation spreading via social media is a large concern. The social media platforms most commonly found to have recirculating misinformation are WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook. 14, 15 A large body of literature support that the general population are willing to share information on social media sans evidence. 10, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Previous studies investigate the effect of the recirculation of misinformation during COVID-19 which for example, the abuse and misuse of chlorine to wrongfully prevent against COVID-19. 3 Among natural remedies, herbal remedies was one of the rumors which was highly recirculated on social media and on different platforms, as well as having published research articles, from the idea that natural remedies would be harmless and its use would be without side effects [22] [23] [24] .While herbal remedies and herbal products are not discouraged to be taken, they should not be considered a sole cure for COVID-19, as the management of COVID-19 does not exist, except for reducing the chances of transmission through vaccination. The concern is that if more people believed in unverified claims of natural remedies, 25 and did not proactively stop the recirculation of the information regarding the use of natural remedies to protect against COVID-19, then actual actionable steps would go unprioritized. 26, 27 This was significantly observed in Saudi Arabia. Ever since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of internet users increased to 95.7%, including in Saudi Arabia, and social media become an environment for rumors and misinformation during this critical period. 28 Despite the recommendation of the Ministry of Health (MOH) for the general population to reach COVID 19 information from official sources a noticeable increase in rumors were still persistent. 29, 30 It is important to understand this phenomenon, the cultural behavior and perception of receiving or distributing health information as the first step towards COVID-19 long-term management.",

The second section included three questions which were used to estimate the prevalence of circulating information about natural remedies' uses as protective measures, the preferred social media platforms used to circulate the information, and the participants' perception regarding sharing and circulating the information with others. Some possible answers to the perceptionrelated question about recirculation of information pertaining to natural remedies used as protective measures during the COVID-19 pandemic were inspired by previous studies. 24, 34, 35 In addition, all the possible answers to the perception-related question were reviewed by four individuals expert in medical immunology, family medicine, preventive medicine, and clinical nutrition so as to evaluate their appropriateness and adequacy. The reliability of the questions was tested using Cronbach's test.

The third significant social media platform, according to the survey response, was Snapchat, with Regarding the participants' perception of recirculating the information about the use of natural remedies as protective measures against the COVID-19 infection, the survey response shows that participants believed they did not share medical information until they were sure that it was correct (23.6%). Among HCWs, the distribution of this particular perception was at 25.1% while for NHCWs, the distribution was at 23.2%. The survey response also suggests that 10.2% of people who share information think that sharing the information without evidence is harmless and may be beneficial. This observation was seen for 7.3% of the HCW respondents and 11.1% of NHCW respondents. Regarding the belief that the information is correct based on participants' experience, this was mentioned by 10.2% of respondents of whom, 8.7% were HCWs and 10.6% were NHCWs).

For instance, the majority portion of survey respondents did not participate in recirculating the information related to the use of natural remedies as protective measures against COVID-19. Compared to the findings of similar studies conducted in other countries, Saudi Arabia differs from the US and UK where social media platforms were commonly used for, and were often the sources of COVID-19 related information for several of the general population. [9] [10] [11] Early studies of social media activities in China also indicate the role of social media platforms in spreading and circulating both information and misinformation, 12 which was also confirmed to be the overall global case through a large-scale study of 87 countries. 13 The study results showed that 59.7% of participants shared information on social media, with 22.5% doing it at all times, 8.2% sharing it usually, 5.7% sharing it often, and 23.3% doing it sometimes. About 40.3% of the population never shared information. The overall statistic of 59.7% was less than the worldwide prevalence, which was 87.0%. 27 Thus, this study's findings might indicate that the general population of Saudi Arabia has been more vigilant about sharing information on social media, which corresponds to previous findings made during the COVID-19 pandemic. 36 ",

According to the data from the survey of this study, the three most common social media platforms in Saudi Arabia are WhatsApp, Twitter, and Snapchat. Globally, WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook are three of the more common social media platforms where COVID-19 related information and misinformation are circulating. 14, 15 Based on the current study's findings, the prevalence showed lesser recirculation of social media compared to worldwide data (59.7% vs 87.0%). 27 This might indicate that social media has not been heavily abused in Saudi Arabia by the general population when it comes to circulation of COVID-19 related information. The apparently docile nature of COVID-19 related information recirculation in Saudi Arabian social media platforms is a positive indicator that the general population are aware of the necessary sources, such as the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia for getting their information. 36, 37 However, consistent with the findings of other studies regarding judging the validity of information on social media platforms, the Saudi Arabian general population are more likely to judge the validity of information based on their own experience, and deem it beneficial for the public to share COVID-19 related information sans evidence. 10, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Thus, it can be posited that Saudi Arabian general population's perception of COVID-19 related information circulating on social media platforms is of a neutral disposition. While the Saudi Arabian general are less likely to contribute and share medical information with others, and are less likely to share the information without first confirming that it is correct, there are still a small portion of Saudi Arabians who deem it okay to share any COVID-19 related information on social media platforms.",

While having a bachelor's degree is not necessarily an indicator of susceptibility to information or misinformation online, the probability of someone sharing misinformation decreases with increasing education levels. 38 Thus, the Saudi Arabian general population displays an unconventional trend, where people with a higher education level are more likely to recirculate information. This observation is significantly different than those made for the general population of Ireland, Mexico, Spain, UK and USA. 38 It is important to consider why Saudi Arabians might have recirculated information. A possible explanation is due to an effect termed \"cyberchondria\", where people with the lack of knowledge, skills and time to conduct extensive research, but are obsessed with looking for evidence are susceptible to sharing as much information as possible for validity 1,30 cyberchondria means the obsessive looking for online health information. The overabundance of information, and the lack of guidance to know which information to look for is also a significant perpetrator for the spread of misinformation. The correct information is usually not able to be filtered out by the layperson, and therefore, it is more than likely that someone would believe the information found online to be valid. 39 Anxiety and panic can also induce the recirculation of misinformation online, especially regarding preventive measures against COVID-19, which includes natural remedies. 39 It is possible that some information on natural remedies were presented as medical information and were wrongly perceived as actual information. The general public might have considered that performing these suggestions would not yield a negative result, and would not be detrimental. On the contrary, whatever small percentage of a chance existed by undertaking natural remedies as precautions against COVID-19 would be worth the action. 1 An abundance of exposure to misinformation also potentially affects the cognitive ability of a layperson to continue to question their validity, and could serve as an inhibiting agent for actually seeking out the correct information from the proper source. 3 The difference between NHCWs and HCWs in recirculating information, and looking for evidential information was not significant in the current study, but this could be accounted for due to differing cultural and education background which could serve as another potential factor that affects the recirculation of misinformation, especially the lack of evidential information. 3",

Fortunately, Saudi Arabia's attitude towards COVID-19 related misinformation differs vastly from the rest of the world.
