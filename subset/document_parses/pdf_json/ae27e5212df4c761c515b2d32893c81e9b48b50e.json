Whilst pharmacotherapies for T2D have largely focussed on glycaemic control, there is growing clinical and regulatory interest in optimising modifiable risk factors for complications of T2D. The importance of dietary and pharmacological interventions on cardiovascular outcomes in persons with T2D is highlighted by the benefits of risk factor modification [3, 4] and adverse cardiovascular consequences of some previous pharmacological therapies for T2D [5] . Pharmacological interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease will reduce the financial burden associated with T2D treatment, since the cost of treating the complications of T2D is greater than treating the disease itself [6] . Hence diabetes therapies which have a multifactorial approach to reduce complications (e.g. glucose, weight, blood pressure, lipids) are of major interest.",

Indeed, there is strong rationale for the use of GLP-1RAs in people with T2D and obesity, and these drugs are generally recommended in a subgroup of people with poorly controlled T2D and obesity as a second-or third-line therapy [8, 9] . These agents enhance the incretin effect to augment glucose-mediated insulin release from the pancreatic b-cells and to diminish glucagon release from the a-cells, thereby reducing blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1RAs delay gastric emptying and enhance centrally mediated hypothalamic satiety, two factors which may account for the observed weight loss associated with these agents. The once-weekly GLP-1RA semaglutide is the most recently licenced injectable GLP-1RA and is associated with clinically significant improvements in metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors [10] . In the SUSTAIN-6 trial, these benefits included a reduction in body weight (2.9-4.4 kg), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (3.4-5.4 mmHg) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; 11.9--15.4 mmol/mol [1.1-1.4%]), along with reductions in total cholesterol and serum triglycerides [11] . Whilst semaglutide is sometimes associated with gastrointestinal disturbance, it is generally well tolerated [11, 12] .",

In the glycaemic control groups, we compared patients with baseline poor control versus moderate control using a HbA1c C 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) cutoff to define patients with poor glycaemic control. The HbA1c cutoff of 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) was used because this is a level above which physicians would usually consider insulin therapy rather than additional oral agents. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK recommend considering insulin therapy if HbA1c is C 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) [9] . In the BMI groups, we compared patients with a baseline BMI \\ 35.0 kg/m 2 with those with a baseline BMI C 35.0 kg/m 2 .

One study of 107 American patients with T2D found that semaglutide improved HbA1c by 14 mmol/mol (1.3%), with the greatest improvements in those with no previous GLP-1RA use or worse glycaemic control [25] . A more recent and larger study of 937 Canadian patients with T2D observed an improvement of 11.3 mmol/mol (1.03%) and a weight loss of 3.9 kg over 6 months [26] . Similarly, the findings in this analysis found greater improvements in HbA1c in people na\u00efve to GLP-1RA and in those with worse baseline glycaemic control. However, these results also demonstrate that clinically significant reductions in HbA1c and body weight were noted in people who switched from other GLP-1RAs and with relatively well-controlled HbA1c. Interestingly, we observed important reductions in HbA1c in those with baseline BMI C 35.0 kg/m 2 or \\ 35.0 kg/m 2 , although there was not a significant difference in HbA1c reduction between the groups. As expected, those with baseline BMI C 35.0 kg/m 2 demonstrated a greater reduction in BMI, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06). Consistent with previous studies [14] , these results demonstrate that semaglutide initiation in those with poorer baseline HbA1c C 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) resulted in a greater HbA1c reduction, in a population who would have traditionally required insulin therapy. However, a clinically important reduction in HbA1c of 8.4 mmol/mol (0.7%) was noted in those even with relatively well-controlled HbA1c \\ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%). Our findings therefore support the initiation of semaglutide in people who have used other GLP-1RAs, have a BMI \\ 35.0 kg/m 2 and have HbA1c \\ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) in addition to the already known benefits in those with poorly controlled HbA1c, significant obesity or naivety to GLP-1RA therapy. In the UK, this finding challenges current NICE guidance which generally recommends the use of GLP-1RAs in those with a BMI [ 35.0 kg/m 2 or obesity-related comorbidity and initiation of insulin when HbA1c [ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) [9] .
