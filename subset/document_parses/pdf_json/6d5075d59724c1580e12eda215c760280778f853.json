Previous studies in the tumor necrosis factortransgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse model of inflammatory-erosive arthritis have demonstrated reduced joint-draining CLV contractility that correlates with arthritic severity. Clinically, RA patients with active hand arthritis exhibit significantly reduced lymphatic clearance of the web spaces adjacent to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and a reduction in total and basilic-associated CLVs on the dorsal surface of the hand by dynamic near-infrared (NIR) imaging of indocyanine green (ICG). In this pilot study, we assessed direct lymphatic drainage from MCP joints, and aimed to visualize the total lymphatic anatomy using novel dual-agent relaxation contrast magnetic resonance lymphography (DARC-MRL) in the upper extremity of healthy human subjects.",

To study MCP joint-draining lymphatics in RA, we must first evaluate the feasibility of directly assessing MCP joint-draining CLVs in longitudinal imaging studies.

The primary disadvantage of NIR-ICG imaging is the shallow depth in tissue penetration, which limits visualization of CLVs to those within 1 -2 centimeters below the skin surface. 18 Thus, in order to interrogate the deep CLVs that may drain the web space and/or MCP joints, we performed magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) in these same subjects. We performed MRL using a combination of gadolinium contrast concurrent with intravenous iron administration to nullify the contrast signal in the blood vessels and perform isolated lymphatic imaging. We evaluated dual-agent contrast enhanced MRL in imaging healthy lymphatic vessels using a conventional fast spoiled gradient-echo (FSPGR) sequence or the application of the Dixon method of uniform fat suppression, with which satisfying success has been established and termed dual-agent relaxation contrast (DARC)-MRL. 19, 20 The DARC-MRL method has successfully visualized the tortuous and dilated CLVs in patients with lymphedema. 20 In this study, we are the first to attempt DARC-MRL imaging of healthy CLVs to determine if current DARC-MRL parameters are sufficient for this population and to validate CLV anatomy as imaged with NIR-ICG techniques.",

Web space injections were performed in both hands, while the MCP joint injections were administered in the non-dominant hand to limit the potential for pain with the intra-articular injections (although both subjects reported reduced pain with the intra-articular injections compared to the web space injections). The NIR-ICG imaging was performed on a custom-built FDA approved system, and the details for the hand imaging are described previously. 17 Briefly, after the hand imaging was complete, antecubital fossa imaging was performed while the patient was sitting with the arm supinated and the elbow in slight flexion. Since the elbow is flexed, we did not perform the imaging using a standard distance from the lip of the camera to the antecubital fossa, as was previously described for the hand (60 \u00b1 1cm to 3 rd MCP joint). For the antecubital fossa, the height of the camera was not adjusted from the distance determined for the hand. The delivered intensity was assessed by a power meter (ThorLabs USB Power Meter, Cat# PM16-121) held at the center of the antecubital fossa prior to imaging as to not exceed the FDA approved excitation intensity threshold of 1.8mW/cm 2 , although a standard illumination intensity was not used as in the hand (950 \u00b1 20\u03bcW/cm 2 ). The hands and antecubital fossas were imaged for 11 minutes each with the following imaging parameters: 500ms camera shutter speed, no binning, 400 gain, and f/4-5.6",

This method subtracts the initial time point from later time points to assess changes in MRI signal in the vasculature. Since the iron is administered intravenously and is homogenously distributed through the blood stream, the iron signal should not substantially change for the duration of the imaging and thus not register post-subtraction assuming very little subject motion during imaging.

In addition, at the antecubital fossa, CLVs draining the web space were more prominently localized to the cephalic aspect of the forearm, while those CLVs draining the MCP joints were localized to the basilic aspect of the forearm. Interestingly, we also identified retrograde flow of ICG from the MCP to the PIP in the 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th digits and the DIP in the 3 rd digit on the palmar surface of the hand following MCP joint injections in Subject 1 (Fig. 3) .

Single 2D images from the conventional MRL dataset were extracted, and an inverted image (note white background) representing a standard clinical T1-weighted colormap of the hand (Fig. 4A) and forearm (Fig. 4A`) are shown for anatomical orientation. Iron contrast in the blood vessels was visualized in the hand (Fig. 4B) and forearm (Fig. 4B`) . Since iron contrast is distributed homogenously throughout the blood vasculature and given its relatively longer half-life, subtraction sequences from the initial time point would exclude all iron contrast and only include Gd contrast injected into the web space that is continuously being drained via the lymphatic vasculature. Using subtraction sequences from the initial time point imaged at TR 12.1 and TE 5.7, all Gd + vessels were visualized in the hand (Fig. 4C) and forearm (Fig. 4C`) . We noted the presence of a large BV in the forearm that was filled with both iron (Fig. 4B`) and Gd (Fig. 4C`) , indicating limited nullification of the MRI signal in the blood vessels using conventional MRL imaging. Similarly, with the DARC-MRL imaging, we did not achieve nullification of the blood vasculature as demonstrated by unmodified (non-subtraction) imaging sequences of the vessels in the forearm of Subject 2 at TR 11.2 and TEs 7.8/9.0 ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ).",

In fact, there were no CLVs captured on the dorsal surface of the hand for Subject 1 using NIR-ICG imaging after intra-articular ICG administration into the MCPs. At the antecubital fossa, CLVs draining the web space were visualized predominantly on the cephalic side of the forearm, while CLVs from the MCP joints tended to localize to the basilic side of the forearm. This discovery generates interesting questions about the previously noted reduction in basilic-associated CLVs on the dorsal surface of the hand in RA patients with active disease 17 because lymphatic dysfunction in RA may be related specifically to joint-draining CLVs. In support of this hypothesis, the TNF-Tg mouse model has demonstrated \"expansion\" and pathologic \"collapse\" specifically of lymph nodes efferent to joint-draining CLVs. 5, 6, 11, 12, 21, 22 Similar lymph node volumetric changes are reported in RA patients. 5, 16, [23] [24] [25] Interestingly, All rights reserved.

While quantification of ICG clearance will be necessary to formally assess the rates of lymphatic absorption, this alternative hypothesis is unlikely to explain the lack of notable ICG + CLVs on the dorsal surface of the hand given the successful transit of ICG to CLVs in the forearm at sufficient rates to be visualized by NIR-ICG imaging. Nonetheless, we attempted to image the total lymphatic vasculature in the hand and forearm using conventional or DARC-MRL. We concluded that the methods we used were insufficient for imaging the CLVs in healthy subjects. Future studies should consider safely titrating the dose of iron to achieve more efficient nullification of the Gd that is inevitably drained into the blood vasculature from the lymphatic system. While we presume the dose of iron was too low in our study to properly nullify the MRI signal in the blood vessels, we could not rule out the possibility that the dose of iron was too high and instead provided undesired contrast enhancement to the blood vasculature.",

However, in order to validate NIR imaging following intra-dermal ICG administration as an effective biomarker of total lymphatics, we must first confirm that 1) NIR-ICG captures a majority (i.e. > 80%) of CLVs and 2) the remainder (i.e. < 20%) of deep CLVs do not demonstrate specific changes compared to those superficial CLVs identified by NIR-ICG imaging in certain diseases. While the gold-standard clinical approach of lymphoscintography is effective for assessing lymphatic drainage in certain disorders, such as lymphedema, 16 it does not provide adequate resolution to monitor more subtle changes in CLV numbers and contractile function that have been noted by NIR-ICG imaging in both RA animal models and human subjects. 5, 6, 11-17, 28, 29 Thus, future work continuing to utilize and validate NIR-ICG imaging as a biomarker of lymphatic dysfunction has the potential to provide major advances in clinically screening and monitoring diseases with lymphatic pathology.

Dynamic NIR-ICG imaging confirms distinct CLVs draining the MCP joints versus the adjacent web spaces in Subject 2. NIR-ICG imaging shows ICG + CLVs (white vessels, green arrows) and adjacent superficial BVs (dark vessels, red arrows) in the hand (A) and antecubital fossa (A`, region defined by dashed white lines) following intra-dermal ICG web space injections (A, 4 green arrowheads). Notably in the antecubital fossa following web space injections, ICG + CLVs are present on the cephalic side of the forearm (A`, green arrows). In contrast, intra-articular MCP joint injections of ICG (B, 5 green arrowheads) show relatively limited identifiable ICG + CLVs (white arrow) in the hand, yet a couple ICG + CLVs are present that are potentially common to those draining the web space (A, B, dashed green arrows). As in Subject 1, there were distinct draining CLVs noted in the antecubital fossa (B`, dashed white lines) of the same subject. While no ICG + CLVs were identified on the cephalic side of the forearm following MCP joint injections (white arrow), an ICG + CLV was present on the basilic side of the forearm (B`, green arrow) that was absent following web space injections (A`, white arrow). However, there was also a cluster of basilic-associated CLVs present following web space injections (A`, green arrow) that was not identified after MCP joint injections (B`, white arrow). As in Subject 1, a potential common CLV (dashed green arrows) from both the web spaces and MCP joints is noted running near the center of the antecubital fossa at the divergence of the cephalic and basilic veins (red arrows) (A` web space; B` MCP joints).

Intravenous iron contrast (ferumoxytol) was administered, and Gd (gadobutrol) was injected into the web spaces of the hand. Inverted representative images of the hand (A) and of the forearm (A`) in a healthy subject are shown for orientation. The initial time point shows blood vessels containing iron contrast (white) in the hand (B) and forearm (B`) before subtraction. The subtracted image partly identified the same vessels (white arrow) in the hand (C) and forearm (C`) as in the initial time point (B, B`) . Understand that both iron and Gd are present in a large blood vessel (BV, white arrow in B` and C`), indicating that improvements are needed to nullify iron contrast and Gd contamination in BVs using dual-contrast administration. For 3D images, volume rendering of the MRI sequences was performed using Amira software. 3D images of the iron MRI sequence demonstrating BVs (white) in the hand (D) and forearm (D`) are shown, with volume rendering of the iron subtraction sequence representing Gd filled vessels (white) in the hand (E) and forearm (E`). Manual segmentation of the volume rendered iron filled BVs (red) in the hand (F) and forearm (F`) adjacent to segmentation of the iron subtracted and Gd-filled vessels (red in G and G`) allow for identification of a Gd filled vessel that is absent in the iron sequences (dashed black arrows in D` and F`), and present in the iron subtracted sequences that image Gd (green arrows in E` and G`).

Prior to the joint injections, intravenous iron was administered and utilized as contrast enhancement to generate a scout image of the blood vasculature. Following the gadolinium joint injections, additional image sequences were captured at TE 1 /TE 2 = 7.8/9.0; under these conditions, the iron infused blood should nullify, while the lymphatic vessels are enhanced by the gadolinium. Inverted representative images of the hand (A) and of the forearm (A`) in a healthy subject are shown for orientation. Note that the background is white, demonstrating that the sequence was inverted instead of imaged initially as a T1-weighted MRI. 3D renderings of the iron scout sequence showing the hand (B) and forearm (B`) demonstrate contrast enhanced blood vessels (red arrows). The images following the gadolinium joint injections indicate successful administration of the gadolinium into the MCP joint space (arrow heads) with contrast enhanced lymphatic vessels draining directly from the joint (green arrows) that are not visualized thereafter in the hand (C) or forearm (C`). In addition, the blood vessels remain partially enhanced in this sequence (red arrows) demonstrating incomplete nullification using this method (C, C`). Segmentation using thresholding of the contrast enhanced vasculature before (D, D`) and after (E, E`) gadolinium administration to the MCP joints shows the similar blood vessels (red arrows) and the unique lymphatic vessels (green arrows).

In the intra-articular MCP joint injections for Subject 1, we similarly used 1:15 dilution of Gd : saline for consistency with the web space visit in this subject, but this time demonstrated robust contrast signal in the MCP joints using the Dixon method (Fig. 5; DARC-MRL).

In the NIR-ICG imaging, note the bright white ICG + CLVs (green arrows) adjacent to dark blood vessels (red arrows, same vessels identified for orientation) (Figs. 1 & 2). CLVs were validated by assessing bolus flow of ICG through the vessels in dynamic videos generated from the NIR-ICG imaging (SupplementaryVideos 1 -7). ICG + CLVs draining the web space visualized on the dorsal surface of the hand of Subject 1(Fig. 1A, green arrows) were completely absent following direct MCP joint injections as no CLVs were noted on the dorsal surface of the hand in Subject 1(Fig. 1B, white arrows). Similarly, Subject 2 demonstrated a considerable number of CLVs in the hand following web space injections (Fig. 2A, green arrows), and a majority of these CLVs were absent after MCP joint injections(Fig. 2B, white arrow). However, unlike Subject 1, there were a couple ICG + CLVs noted on the surface of the hand in Subject 2 that were potentially common between the web space (Fig. 2A)and MCP(Fig. 2B) lymphatic drainage (dashed green arrows).",

NIR-ICG imaging shows ICG + CLVs (white vessels, green arrows) and adjacent superficial BVs (dark vessels, red arrows) in the hand (A) and antecubital fossa (A`, region defined by dashed white lines) following intra-dermal ICG web space injections (A, 4 green arrowheads). Notably in the antecubital fossa following web space injections, ICG + CLVs are present on the cephalic side of the forearm (A`, green arrow). In contrast, intra-articular MCP joint injections of ICG (B, 5 green arrowheads) show no identifiable CLVs (white arrows) in the hand (B) and different draining CLVs in the antecubital fossa (B`, dashed lines) of the same subject. While no ICG + CLVs were identified on the cephalic side of the forearm following MCP joint injections (white arrow), the ICG + CLVs were localized to the basilic side of the forearm (B`, green arrow) that were absent following web space injections (A`, white arrow). A potential common CLV (dashed green arrows) from both the web space and MCP joints is noted running near the center of the antecubital fossa at the divergence of the cephalic and basilic veins (red arrows) (A` web space; B` MCP joints).",

A rainbow RGB lookup table was used to visualize subtle changes in fluorescent intensity, and ICG signal was detected in the 2 nd PIP, 3 rd PIP, 3 rd DIP, and 4 th PIP (green/red signal), while the other joints did not show increased fluorescent intensity (blue) (B).",
