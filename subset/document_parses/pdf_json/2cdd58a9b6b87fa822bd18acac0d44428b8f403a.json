Vitally, and absent from many standard corpora such as books and news archives, Twitter also encodes popularity and spreading through retweets. Here, we describe Storywrangler, an ongoing curation of over 100 billion tweets containing 1 trillion 1-grams from 2008 to 2021. For each day, we break tweets into 1-, 2-, and 3-grams across 100+ languages, generating frequencies for words, hashtags, handles, numerals, symbols, and emojis. We make the dataset available through an interactive time series viewer and as downloadable time series and daily distributions. Although Storywrangler leverages Twitter data, our method of tracking dynamic changes in n-grams can be extended to any temporally evolving corpus. Illustrating the instrument's potential, we present example use cases including social amplification, the sociotechnical dynamics of famous individuals, box office success, and social unrest.",

The relatively recent digitization of historical texts, from books (1-4) to news (5) (6) (7) (8) to folklore (9) (10) (11) (12) to governmental records (13) , has enabled compelling computational analyses across many fields (10, 14, 15) , but books, news, and other formal records only constitute a specific type of text-carefully edited to deliver a deliberate message to a target audience. Large-scale constructions of historical corpora also often fail to encode a fundamental characteristic: popularity (i.e., social amplification). How many people have read a text? How many have retold a news story to others?",

            "text": "For text-based corpora, we are confronted with the challenge of sorting through different aspects of popularity of n-gramssequences of n \"words\" in a text that are formed by contiguous characters, numerals, symbols, emojis, etc. An n-gram may or may not be part of a text's lexicon, as the vocabulary of a text gives a base sense of what that text may span meaningwise (16) . For texts, it is well established that n-gram frequency-of-usage (or Zipf) distributions are heavy tailed (17) . Problematically, this essential character of natural language is readily misinterpreted as indicating cultural popularity. For a prominent example, the Google Books n-gram corpus (1) , which, in part, provides inspiration for our work here, presents year-scale, n-gram frequency time series where each book, in principle, counts only once (2) . All cultural fame is stripped away. The words of George Orwell's 1984 or Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson books, indisputably read and reread by many people around the world, count as equal to the words in the least read books published in the same years. However, time series provided by the Google Books n-gram viewer have regularly been erroneously conflated with the changing interests of readers [e.g., the apparent decline of sacred words (2, (18) (19) (20) (21) ]. Further compounded with an increase of scientific literature throughout the 20th century, the corpus remains a deeply problematic database for investigations of sociolinguistic and cultural trends. It is also very difficult to measure cultural popularity. For a given book, we would want to know sales of the book over time, how many times the book has been actually read, and to what degree a book becomes part of broader culture. Large-scale corpora capturing various aspects of popularity exist (15) but are hard to compile, as the relevant data are either prohibitively expensive or closed (e.g., Facebook) and, even when accessible, may not be consistently recorded over time (e.g., Billboard's Hot 100). Now, well into the age of the internet, our recordings are vast, inherently digital, and capable of being created and shared in the moment. People, news media, governmental bodies, corporations, bots, and many other entities all contribute constantly to giant social media platforms. When open, these services provide an opportunity for us to attempt to track myriad statements, reactions, and stories of large populations in real time. Social media data allow us to explore day-to-day conversations by millions of ordinary people and celebrities at a scale that is scarcely conventionalized and recorded. Crucially, when sharing and commenting mechanisms are native to a social media platform, we can quantify popularity of a trending topic and social amplification of a contemporary cultural phenomenon.",

Although amplification is deeply uneven, vast numbers of people may now express themselves to a global audience on any subject that they choose (within limits of a service and not without potential consequences). Unlike journalists, columnists, or book authors, people can instantly record and share messages in milliseconds. From a measurement perspective, this is a far finer temporal resolution than would be reasonably needed to explore sociocultural phenomena or reconstruct major events. The eye witness base for major events is now no longer limited to those physically present because of growing, decentralized livestreaming through various social media platforms. Social media thus enables, and not without peril, a kind of mass distributed journalism.",

For each day, we then have three key levels of popularity: n-gram lexicon, n-gram usage in organic tweets (originally authored tweets), and the rate at which a given n-gram is socially amplified (i.e., retweeted) on the platform. Our data curation using Storywrangler yields a rich dataset, providing an interdisciplinarity resource for researchers to explore transitions in social amplification by reconstructing n-gram Zipf distributions with a tunable fraction of retweets.",

Second, we compute the relative social amplification ratio R \uf074,t,\u2113 rel to examine whether a given n-gram \uf074 is prevalent in originally authored tweets or socially amplified via retweets on day t. For ease of plotting, we have further chosen to display R \uf074,t,\u2113 rel at a logarithmic scale. Positive values of log 10 R \uf074,t,\u2113 rel imply strong social amplification of \uf074, whereas negative values show that \uf074 is relatively more predominant in organic tweets. Figure 4A gives us a sense of the growing discussions and fears of a global warfare following the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani by a U.S. drone airstrike on 3 January 2020.

We find a median value of 3 days after release for peak normalized frequency of usage for movie n-grams (Fig. 5F, inset) . Growth of n-gram usage from 50% (f 0.5 ) to maximum normalized frequency (f max ) has a median value of 5 days across our titles. The median value of time to return to f 0.5 from f max is 6 days. Looking at Fig. 5E , we see that the median shape of the spike around movie release dates tends to entail a gradual increase to peak usage and a relatively more sudden decrease when returning to f 0.5 . There is also slightly more spread in the time to return to f 0.5 compared with the time to increase from f 0.5 to f max (Fig. 5E, insets) .",

While its utility is clear, there are many potential improvements to introduce to Storywrangler. For high volume languages, we would aim for higher temporal resolution, at the scale of minutes, and, in such an implementation, we would be limited by requiring n-gram counts to exceed some practical minimum. We would also want to expand the language parsing to cover continuous-script languages such as Japanese and Chinese. Another large space of natural improvements would be to broadly categorize tweets in ways other than by language identification, while preserving privacy, such as geography, user type (e.g., people, institutions, or automated), and topic (e.g., tweets containing fake news). We note that for Twitter, features such as location and user type are more difficult to establish with as much confidence as for language identification. Increasingly by design, geographic information is limited on Twitter as are user demographics, although some aspects may be gleaned indirectly (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) . Regardless, in this initial curation of Twitter n-grams, we purposefully do not attempt to incorporate any metadata beyond identified language into the n-gram database.",

Popularity, however, is notoriously difficult to measure. The main proxy that we use for popularity is the relative rate of usage of a given n-gram across originally authored tweets, examining how each term or phrase is socially amplified via retweets. While Twitter attempts to measure popularity by counting impressions, it is increasingly difficult to capture the number of people exposed to a tweet. Twitter's centralized trending feature is yet another dimension that alters the popularity of terms on the platform, personalizing each user timeline and inherently amplifying algorithmic bias. We have also observed a growing passive behavior across the platform leading to an increasing preference for retweets over original tweets for most languages on Twitter during the past few years (34) .",

For instance, a trending hashtag can embody a social movement (e.g., #MeToo), such that an n-gram may become mutually constituted to a behavioral and sociocultural revolution. Social and political campaigns can leverage an n-gram in their organized marketing strategies, seeking sustained collective attention on social media platforms encoded through spikes in n-gram usage rates. There are many examples of this emerging sociotechnical phenomenon on Twitter, ranging from civil rights (e.g., #WomensMarch) to gender identity (e.g., #LGBTQ) to political conspiracy theories (e.g., #QAnon) to academy awards promotions (e.g., #Oscar) to movie advertisement (e.g., #Avengers), etc. The Canadian awareness campaign \"Bell Let's Talk\" is another example of an annual awareness campaign that subsidizes mental health institutions across Canada, donating 5 cents for every (re) tweet containing the hashtag \"#BellLetsTalk\" to reduce stigma surrounding mental illness. Marketing campaigns have also grasped the periodic feature of key trending n-grams and adjusted their language accordingly. Marketers and bots often exploit this periodicity by hijacking popular hashtags to broadcast their propaganda (e.g., including #FF and #TGIF as trending hashtags for Friday promotions).",

We break each tweet into 1-grams, 2-grams, and 3-grams. Although we can identify tweets written in continuous script-based languages (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, and Thai), our current implementation does not support breaking them into n-grams.",
