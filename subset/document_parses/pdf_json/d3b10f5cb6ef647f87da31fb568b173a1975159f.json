Although periodontal bacteria have been shown to influence respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia, the synergistic effect of S. pneumoniae and Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontopathic bacterium, on pneumococcal infections is unclear. To investigate whether P. gingivalis accelerates pneumococcal infections, we tested the effects of inoculating P. gingivalis culture supernatant (PgSup) into S. pneumoniae-infected mice. Mice were intratracheally injected with S. pneumoniae and PgSup to induce pneumonia, and lung histopathological sections and the absolute number and frequency of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung were analyzed. Proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was examined by qPCR and ELISA. Inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in S. pneumoniae-infected mice and S. pnemoniae and PgSup mixed-infected mice, and mixed-infected mice showed more pronounced inflammation in lung. The ratios of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils were not significantly different between the lungs of S. pneumoniae-infected mice and those of mixed-infected mice. PgSup synergistically increased TNF-\u03b1 expression/production and IL-17 production compared with S. pneumoniae infection alone. We demonstrated that PgSup enhanced inflammation in pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae, suggesting that virulence factors produced by P. gingivalis are involved in the exacerbation of respiratory tract infections such as aspiration pneumonia.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is a globally common infection and a major cause of death, as highlighted by the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 [1, 2] . Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive aerobic diplococci, is the main cause of bacterial pneumonia [3] . Aspiration pneumonia (AP) is defined as inflammation of the lung tissue, caused by bacterial infection resulting from the entry of foreign materials into the bronchial tree and lungs, usually from oral intake. The mortality and morbidity associated with AP is expected to increase over the next few decades, especially among the older population [4] . Most cases of AP are considered to be caused by a mixed infection of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria [5] . The oral cavity has long been suspected to be a source of the organisms responsible for AP. Bartlett and colleagues demonstrated the presence of oral anaerobic organisms in sputum by collecting samples directly from the trachea to avoid oral contamination [6] . The oral bacterial species implicated in causing pneumonia and lung abscesses are Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces israelii, Capnocytophaga species, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus constellatus [7] . These bacteria are closely associated with oral disease and oral hygiene. Systematic reviews of the relationship between pneumonia and oral health have provided evidence that oral care can reduce the exacerbation or incidence of respiratory illness in older people residing in nursing homes or patients in intensive care [8, 9] . However, recent reports have questioned the quality of the evidence indicating that professional oral care reduces pneumonia mortality compared with regular care in nursing home residents, and so caution is therefore required in interpreting the results, as no conclusions have been reached regarding other outcomes effective in reducing pneumonia [10] . Regarding the relationship between S. pneumoniae and oral hygiene, Okuda and coworkers reported that oral lavage significantly decreased the percentage of S. pneumoniae bacteria detected in patients who underwent oral and maxillofacial surgery [11] .",

Of these three species, P. gingivalis is the major pathogen associated with periodontitis. P. gingivalis has been reported to be more common in affected areas than in healthy areas in patients with periodontitis [18] . P. gingivalis possesses many virulence factors, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), gingipain, and fimbriae, and has a direct effect on periodontal tissue destruction [19] .

Hence, rather than causing pneumonia through the growth of living P. gingivalis, it is possible that the bacterial components and products of the bacterium support infection with other bacteria such as S. pneumoniaethereby establishing pneumonia. Therefore, we hypothesized that periodontal bacteria such as P. gingivalis have a synergistic effect on pneumococcal respiratory infections.

In preliminary tests of P. gingivalis bacteria performed to investigate the possibility of any synergistic effects on lung Sp infection, no changes were observed following stimulation with P. gingivalis (data not shown). Thus, instead, we used the bacterial components/secretions (culture supernatant) of P. gingivalis rather than the bacteria itself in subsequent experiments. First, histopathology was evaluated by HE staining. In the control mice and the PgSuponly mice, no inflammatory findings such as interstitial thickening or inflammatory cell infiltration were observed (Figure 2A(a,b) ), whereas in the Sp-infected mice and the Sp and PgSup mixed-infected mice, interstitial thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed (Figure 2A(c,d) ). In addition, we used ImageJ to quantitatively measure the percentage of lung interstitium in the area of HE-stained histological sections. Sp and PgSup mixed-infected mice showed a significant increase in the percentage of interstitium in the field compared to the Sp-infected mice (Figure 2A (e); p < 0.05). Although inflammation was induced by Sp infection alone, it was observed that the inflammation was exacerbated by the presence of PgSup. Next, to further compare cellular composition during the inflammatory cell infiltration of all the analyzed mouse groups, flow cytometric analysis of monocyte and granulocyte lineage markers was conducted on pulmonary infiltrated cells after administration. The ratios of CD11bhigh Gr-1high neutrophils (right square) were slightly higher in the lungs of the Sp and PgSup mixed-administrated mice than those in the Sp-administrated mice (Figure 2B(h,i) and Table 1 ). The ratios of CD11blow/dim Gr-1dim monocytes/macrophages (left and middle square) were the same between the Sp and PgSup mixed-administrated mice and the Sp-administrated mice. In addition, the ratio of macrophages to granulocytes in the administrated lungs of PgSup alone was nearly identical to that in the control mice ( Figure 2B (f,g) and Table 1 ). Table 1 . The absolute number and frequency of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung after administration. Mice were administrated with sTSB, PgSup, Sp, or Sp-PgSup mixed.

In addition, CXCL1/KC and CXCL2/MIP-2 exist in monomeric and dimeric forms and are involved in neutrophil migration by activating CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), the CXC chemokine receptor, and binding to glycosaminoglycans [21, 22] . In this study, we found that 24 h after the initiation of pneumonia (early stage of infection), PgSup synergistically increased the expression of TNF-\u03b1 in the lungs of Sp-infected mice (Figures 4 and 5 ). In addition, Sp-infected mice and Sp and PgSup mixed-infected mice showed a higher tendency to infiltrate neutrophils and macrophages into the lung compared with control and PgSup-infected mice. These suggest that the bacterial components/secretions of P. gingivalis promote lung inflammation of Sp-administrated mice by inducing recruitment and activation of both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, which may work in concert to drive inflammation. Another important factor for neutrophils-IL-17-is produced by TH17 cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and NK cells, and causes neutrophil activation and migration to inflammatory sites [23, 24] . The production of IL-17 in mice receiving the mixed infection was significantly increased compared with those infected with Sp alone, but the degree of IL-17 expression was low due to the early stage of infection ( Figure 5 ).",

            "text": "P. gingivalis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AP, as has been reported in many clinical cases and animal models [25, 26] . This bacterium expresses virulence factors such as LPS, phosphatase, fimbriae, and a cysteine protease called gingipain, which directly or indirectly activate host cells and play a major role in the formation of inflammatory foci [27] [28] [29] [30] . In particular, there are two types of gingipains with different peptide cleavage site specificities, Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp), which are secreted as monomers into the extracellular space and degrade extracellular matrices such as collagen (types I and IV) and fibronectin [30] [31] [32] [33] . Rgp and Kgp exist as high molecularweight complexes bound to hemocyte aggregates, hemoglobin-binding proteins, LPS, and phospholipids on the outer membrane, and these membrane-bound gingipain complexes exhibit more potent cytotoxic activity than monomers [28, 34, 35] . Gingipains also play a role in P. gingivalis evasion of host defense mechanisms by degrading antimicrobial peptides such as defensins, C3 and C4-involved in the complement cascade-and T-cell receptors and mediators [36] . In this study, we used bacterial culture supernatant rather than P. gingivalis bacteria, which are anaerobic, allowing us to investigate the synergistic effects of lung infection without being affected by the aerobic environment of the lung. Our results suggested the possibility that the lung infection in mice inoculated with S. pneumoniae and PgSup might be caused by gingipains produced by P. gingivalis, which damage the extracellular matrix of alveolar epithelial cells and facilitate the entry of S. pneumoniae into the tissues, thereby increasing the inflammatory reaction. Future studies are needed to investigate whether P. gingivalis gingipains can damage the extracellular matrix of alveolar epithelial cells, facilitating the entry of S. pneumoniae into the tissues and causing an increase in inflammation.",

It has also been reported that infection of airway epithelial cells with rhinoviruses enhances PAFR expression and facilitates adhesion of S. pneumoniae to epithelial cells [38] . Furthermore, Kamio and colleagues reported that PAFR expression was induced in human alveolar epithelial cells stimulated with PgSup, and that culture supernatant stimulation using a gingipain-deficient mutant inhibited PAFR expression and S. pneumoniae adherence to alveolar epithelial cells [39] . Similarly, in our experiment, gingipain in the PgSup may have induced the expression of PAFR and promoted the adhesion of S. pneumoniae to alveolar epithelium, leading to an enhanced inflammatory reaction in the lungs. Further in vitro and in vivo analyses are needed to clarify the mechanism of action of P. gingivalis components/secretions in pneumococcal infection. This study has several limitations. First, to clarify the mechanism of action of P. gingivalis components/secretions in pneumococcal infection, further in vitro and in vivo analyses are needed. Second, since the inflammatory state changes depending on the number of S. pneumoniae causing the lung infection, further analyses are needed with specific numbers of infecting S. pneumoniae. Third, we have demonstrated that PgSup acts synergistically in the first 24 h after the initiation of pneumonia infection (early infection), but the long-term effects are not clear. Further analysis of the effects of PgSup on acquired immunity via T cells and B cells is needed using a longer-term infection model.",

The cDNA was amplified and quantified using the StepOnePlus\u2122 real-time PCR system. The optimal reaction conditions for the one-step assay were as follows: a denaturation step at 95 \u2022 C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 \u2022 C for 15 s and 60 \u2022 C for 40 s. Expression data were normalized to the geometric mean of the housekeeping gene, 18S rRNA, to control the variability in expression levels and were analyzed using the 2 \u2212\u2206\u2206CT method.",

This suggests the pathogenic factors derived from P. gingivalis may play an important role in the effects of periodontitis on exacerbation of respiratory tract infections such as AP. Clarification of these phenomena and the mechanisms involved is expected to provide evidence that treatments targeted at oral periodontopathic bacteria will inhibit the development of AP. Further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of interactions between P. gingivalis and S. pneumoniae.
