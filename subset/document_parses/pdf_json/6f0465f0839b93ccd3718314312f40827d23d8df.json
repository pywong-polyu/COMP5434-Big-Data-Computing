Rapid and early detection is essential to contain COVID-19. Here, we first developed a deep learning (DL) integrated radiomics model for end-to-end identification of COVID-19 using CT scans and then validated its clinical feasibility. We retrospectively collected CT images of 386 patients (129 with COVID-19 and 257 with other community-acquired pneumonia) from three medical centers to train and externally validate the developed models. A pre-trained DL algorithm was utilized to automatically segment infected lesions (ROIs) on CT images which were used for feature extraction. Five feature selection methods and four machine learning algorithms were utilized to develop radiomics models. Trained with features selected by L1 regularized logistic regression, classifier multi-layer perceptron (MLP) demonstrated the optimal performance with AUC of 0.922 (95% CI 0.856-0.988) and 0.959 (95% CI 0.910-1.000), the same sensitivity of 0.879, and specificity of 0.900 and 0.887 on internal and external testing datasets, which was equivalent to the senior radiologist in a reader study. Additionally, diagnostic time of DL-MLP was more efficient than radiologists (38 s vs 5.15 min). With an adequate performance for identifying COVID-19, DL-MLP may help in screening of suspected cases.",

Real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) amplification of SARS-CoV-2 serves as the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, falsenegative results and long turnaround time limit the clinical efficacy of rRT-PCR testing in rapid COVID-19 screening 1,2 , especially during disease outbreaks. Given that about 97% of COVID-19 patients presented chest abnormalities 1,3 , chest CT examination has been regarded as a prompt and complementary reference to rRT-PCR testing for screening COVID-19 patients 3,4 . Yet, an increasing number of chest CT examinations would overload radiologists and subtle chest abnormalities such as ground-glass opacities could be easily missed. Thus, an efficient and reliable CT-based auxiliary tool is urgently needed to help radiologists screen COVID-19 patients.",

Yue et al. built a ML model using CT images to estimate the hospital stay of COVID-19 patients 14 . Another study developed a radiomics nomogram using features extracted from the lung parenchyma window to predict COVID-19 13 . When reviewing published literature on prediction models for COVID-19 diagnosis 15 , we noticed that regions of interest (ROIs) annotation which was time-consuming but indispensable for model development were one of the common challenges for both deep learning and radiomics modeling. Moreover, though radiomics is a widely utilized method in the field of medical imaging 16 , lack of automatic ROI annotation is a key hurdle during its clinical application because each case needs to be annotated before being applied to the radiomics models.",

However, the performance of the radiomics model could be greatly influenced by different feature selection methods and classification algorithms [17] [18] [19] . To achieve the best model, feature selection and classification algorithm need to be well-designed. To our knowledge, no research so far has tried to evaluate the effects of feature selection methods and classification algorithms on the performance of radiomics models for distinguishing COVID-19 and other community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. In this study, we solved the time-consuming ROI annotation problem by integrating a DL segmentation algorithm with the radiomics approach, and developed an end-to-end model using CT images to screen COVID-19 patients. Additionally, cross-combinations of five feature selection methods and four machine learning algorithms were used to develop the optimal radiomics model. Furthermore, the clinical feasibility of the model was validated on an external dataset in terms of classification performance and time efficiency.",

In terms of imaging manifestations on chest CT scans, multifocal small patchy shadows, ground glass opacity (GGO), and consolidation were the main lesions found in both COVID-19 and CAP cases. As can be seen in Appendix Table S2 , GGO was more common and consolidation was less common in COVID-19 patients than among CAP cases, which could be attributed to the relatively larger proportion of mild or moderate clinical type patient.

Coarse annotation strategy was utilized in which major lesions with multifocal small patchy shadowing, ground-glass opacities, and consolidations were selectively annotated on CT images by experienced radiologists (Fig. 1a) . During algorithm training, CT images of different sizes were first resized to 512 \u00d7 512 using bilinear interpolation method as previously described 20 and the CT values of images were rescaled at window center of -600 and window width at 1500 so that the pneumonia lesions could be presented and easily distinguished (Fig. 1b) .

The practice has proved that the CT examination serves as a complementary approach to rRT-PCR for COVID-19 screening in some emergent scenarios [28] [29] [30] . By integrating DL segmentation algorithm with radiomics, we developed an end-to-end model using CT images from multiple medical centers to screen COVID-19 patients. Automatically delineated ROIs by DL segmentation algorithm greatly enhanced the application potentials of radiomics models in clinical practice. Trained with selected radiomics features, DL-MLP model demonstrated comparable diagnostic performance to a senior radiologist with 15 years' experience on internal and external testing datasets. To date, many DL and radiomics models were developed since the outbreak of COVID-19, focusing on screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of COVID-19 15 . However, due to limited medical labor resources and diffused lesion distribution across multiple sections, ROI annotations remained challenging in many of the current studies 8, 9, 11 . In our study, we utilized a DL segmentation algorithm that was trained with 507 sets of coarse annotated suspected COVID-19 CT scans. Lesions were selectively annotated on certain CT sections where they predominantly presented. This strategy reduced the annotation workload when medical resources were scarce and eventually achieved adequate results. The DL segmentation algorithm enabled direct application of radiomics models in clinical practice by saving the need for manual annotation, which is of great value to be extended to other disease scenarios when the radiomics approach was utilized.",

Three of the four machine learning models achieved the best AUC when trained with L1-LR selected features. Redundancy of L1-LR selected features was further tested by modeling without features with strong correlations (PCC \u2265 0.8; PCC \u2265 0.5). All L1-LR selected features were finally utilized because of the robust performance on internal and external testing datasets. Machine learning models were trained with L1-LR selected features.

A recent study ensembled transfer learning with deep convolutional neural networks (15 architectures) to detect COVID-19 on CT images and achieved the best performance with sensitivity of 0.854, accuracy of 0.85, and precision of 0.857 33 . Another DL-based multi-view fusion model was developed using CT images with the maximum lung regions in axial, coronal and sagittal views and achieved AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.819, 0.760, 0.811 and 0.615 on testing set, respectively 32 . In comparison, our study shared similar data size and achieved a better diagnostic performance as evidenced by the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.959, 0.884, 0.879 and 0.887 on the external testing dataset. Similarly, the multi-view fusion model solved annotation problem by using certain whole CT images, however, that may also result in insufficient features to properly detect COVID-19 32 . Another deep learning model was trained with a large dataset to identify COVID-19 from other pneumonia 34 . Like this model, our proposed DL-MLP could also distinguish COVID-19 from etiologically confirmed influenza and mycoplasma pneumonia and achieved better performance in terms of AUC. Table 2 .

An earlier radiomics study that utilized both lesion and normal region patches cropped from COVID-19 CT scans achieved a higher classification accuracy of 99.68% with GLSZM features 35 . However, this study ignored the within-patient correlation between the two classes of image patches. Meanwhile, radiomics nomogram for predicting COVID-19 was also developed by combining radiomics scores and significantly associated CT characteristics 13 and obtained a comparable performance to ours. Yet, note that in addition to internal and external testing sets, the proposed DL-MLP model was further validated by comparing with experienced radiologists on external testing dataset, which substantiated the model's greater application potentials in clinical scenarios.",
