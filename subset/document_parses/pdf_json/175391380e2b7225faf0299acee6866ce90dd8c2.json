As a proof of concept, we scrutinized the spike-antibody and spike-ACE2 complexes formed in the variants of concern, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma), by using contact maps depicting the interactions made amid them, along with heat maps to quantify these major interactions. Results: The results found in this study depict the highly frequent interface changes made by the entire set of mutations, mainly conducted by N501Y and E484K. In the spike-Antibody complex, we have noticed alterations concerning electrostatic surface complementarity, breaching essential sites in the P17 and BD-368-2 antibodies. Alongside, the spike-ACE2 complex has presented new hydrophobic bonds. Discussion: Molecular dynamics simulations followed by Poisson-Boltzmann calculations corroborate the higher complementarity to the receptor and lower to the antibodies for the K417T/E484K/N501Y (Gamma) mutant compared to the wild-type strain, as pointed by E-Volve, as well as an intensification of this effect by changes at the protein conformational equilibrium in solution. A local disorder of the loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032, as well its possible effects on the affinity to the BD-368-2 antibody were also incorporated to the final conclusions after this analysis. Moreover, E-Volve can depict the main alterations in important biological structures, as shown in the SARS-CoV-2 complexes, marking a major step in the real-time tracking of the virus mutant lineages.

The Alpha variant fastly spread across dozens of countries and carried 17 mutations, including eight in the spike protein (HV 69-70 deletion, Y144 deletion, N501Y, A570D, P681H, T761I, S982A, and D1118H), which are the basis of three COVID-19 vaccines licensed (Rambaut et al., 2020) . B.1.351 (Beta) was identified in South Africa at the end of 2020.

These cited spike mutations arose in the viral receptor binding site (RBD) and affected the human as studied (Nelson et al., 2021) . One of those effects revealed by Nelson and collaborators is the increased affinity between the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein caused by the N501Y and E484K mutations, which also have their potentiality enhanced when possessing the K417N/T modification. Also, these lineages are designated as variants of concern (VOCs), because of their rapid growth and fast predominance as the main lineages of SARS-CoV-2, in each respective region (Galloway et al., 2021) . In October of 2020, from the B.1.617 clade, emerged the B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 strain-known as the Delta variant, by the WHO nomenclature, or as 21A, by the Nextstrain nomenclature.

Protonation states for all residues in both systems were estimated for the standard physiological blood pH of 7.4 and salinity of 0.15 M using the H++ web server (Anandakrishnan, Aguilar & Onufriev, 2012) . The systems were parameterized using the tleap tool from AmberTools21 (Case et al., 2008) . The systems were solvated on a cubic box with a minimum border distance of 12 \u00c5, and the water, protein, and glycidic portions of the systems were respectively described with the TIP3P, FF14SB, and GLYCAM-06 AMBER force fields. Na+ and Cl-ions were added in order to reach the physiological salinity of 0.15 M. Afterwards, the minimization, equilibration and proper productive MD simulation steps for both systems were run using NAMD 2.13-verbs-CUDA (Phillips et al., 2005) . All simulations were carried out with the NPT ensemble, with the temperature and pressure constantly maintained respectively at 310 K and 1 atm by a Langevin thermostat and Langevin piston. Periodic boundary conditions were established following a 10 \u00c5 cutoff for nonbonded interactions, and the long-ranged electrostatic interactions were calculated with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method.",

We also analyzed the Sars-CoV-2 spike RBD protein bound to the cell receptor ACE2. Our main objective is to evaluate the differences in 3D structures among wild spike proteins and mutants (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma). We also aim to verify the impact in their interactions with ACE2 and antibodies. Briefly, the E-Volve results highlight the importance of several residues, particularly 417, 484, and 501. We used several structures of the spike in different conformations (a complete PDB ID list is available at Supplemental Material). For example, we aligned with the E chain from 6M0J (RBD), A chain from 6VXX (spike in the closed state), and C chain from 7DK3 (spike in the open state), and we define that a convergency exists if the TM-Score was more significant than 0.5. This cutoff is based on the Xu & Zhang (2010) study. Thus, to acquire a TM-score of no less than 0.5, we should consider at least 1.8 million random protein pairs (p-value of 5.5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ). E-Volve uses this information to build a heat map that shows how the mutations can affect essential regions of the protein using a previously generated database. This also shows how the modelled mutations could impact the interactions between the Sars-CoV-2 spike and ACE2 human protein and between spike and some antibodies. Figure 2A demonstrates the superposition of all generated contact maps: the interaction pairs among the viral spike protein with all the complexed antibodies. In this graph, each dot represents an inter-residue interaction. Different colors indicate the contact type, which can be yellow (disulfide bond), magenta (attractive interaction), cyan (repulsive interaction), purple (hydrogen bonds), green (aromatic stacking), or brown (hydrophobic). This graph can help us detect amino acid substitutions that promote a subtle contact change. For example, in Fig. 1 , we highlighted the E484K mutant, which causes a change in the interaction from attractive to repulsive. Furthermore, we marked the known mutation points for the Gamma lineage with asterisks. Thus, this figure reflects that most of the spike-antibody complex interface is sensitive to RBD mutations once the primary connection in this complex occurs in this site, usually demarcated from the 333 to the 527 spike residue. Figure 2 allows a comparison between the contact maps ( Fig. 2A ) and the superposed heat map (Fig. 2B ) of attractive ionic contacts established between the spike protein and the antibody fragments for the Sars-CoV-2 data set used. Notice that several positive residues can interact with the spike's glutamate E484. According to our large-scale contact detection, follows the list of positive residues that interact with E484: K30, H35 (in 62 complexes), R50, R56, K65, R96 (in 134 complexes), R98 (in 78 complexes), H99 (in 26 complexes), R100 (in 20 complexes), R102 (in 47 complexes), R107 and R112.

Forbye the Alpha lineage, we show the posing of the E484K and K417N, present in the Alpha and the Beta strains, taking shape into the graphs as a constant repulsive interaction amongst the spikeantibody complexes scrutinized. Alongside the breach in the spike-antibody complex caused by the E484K transformation, the effects also go further when evaluating the spike-ACE2 interaction. This positively charged lysine increases binding affinity within the cited human cell receptor, expressing the danger of reinfection already seen by Nonaka et al. (2021) . Beyond this single point mutation, the entire set of alterations on the viral RBD such as E484K, N501Y, and K417N stabilize the VOCs as epidemiologically dominant.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation followed by electrostatics calculations by Poisson-Boltzmann surface analysis (PBSA) confirmates the major E-volve findings at single structure analysis. That is, the most representative conformations adopted by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Gamma lineage present higher stereochemical complementarity in its receptor binding motif (RBM) to ACE2 and lower to antibodies. In addition, the MD and PBSA results suggest that the three substitutions in Gamma lineage (K417T, E484K, N501Y) can still intensify this higher complementarity of the RBM to the receptor and lower to the antibodies by shifting the RBD conformational equilibrium. This favors conformations more complementary to ACE2, less complementary to antibodies, and disfavors conformations with different behaviour. Furthermore, the MD results suggest an additional penalty for the binding of the loop a1\u2032/ \u03b21\u2032 at the Gamma lineage, due its particular conformation and dynamics. The results suggest that this penalty can be considerably higher at the antibody complexation (overall BD-368-2), which may be a further acquired mechanism of antibody resistance for the P1 RBD. All these additional findings suggest a binding mechanism with the participation of conformational selection, a phenomenon both already widely pointed as a key factor for protein-protein and biomolecular recognition, as specifically suggested for spike interactions (Pallara et al., 2016; Ahamad, Hema & Gupta, 2021; Rocha et al., 2021) . Also, for epitope interactions with antibodies and other immune system receptors, the literature points to the significant relevance of protein flexibility and conformational selection (Fieser et al., 1987; Stejskal et al., 2020) . In future studies (already being conducted on our group), we aim to better explore these dynamics features by considering a higher number of mutants and using more robust MD analysis and free energy calculations.",

            "text": "Changes in protein conformational distribution play a pivotal role in the affinity shift in macromolecular complexes (de Lima et al., 2020; Rocha et al., 2021) . For the spike-receptor interfaces, a set of studies pointed to the importance of the molecular plasticity for the RBM adequation around the receptor (Carvalho & Alves, 2020; Dehury et al., 2020; Verkhivker, 2020; Ahamad, Hema & Gupta, 2021) . Here, to present and discuss our MD results on such aspects, we use the nomenclature from Wang et al. (2020) for the RBD and RBM motifs (Fig. S2 ). Our molecular dynamics (MD) results show, for wt and P1, higher fluctuations for the C-terminal extension of the loop \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032 (hereafter called loop \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032-C and comprising the residues 470 to 490) compared to the rest of the RBD (Figs. 5A and 5B ). This is the loop encompassing position 484 close to its center. The higher mobility of the loop \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22-C was recovered both considering its movement relative to the entire RBD as the internal mobility of the RBM (Figs. 5A and 5B, respectively). Also, the \u03b22\u2032/\u03b71\u2032 loop (residues 497 to 506, in whose center the N501Y substitution occurs), as well the loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 (residues 438 to 450) are local fluctuation hotspots at the RBM and at the RBD as a whole (Figs. 5A and 5B). This system of loops comprises a kind of three-fingered \"molecular claw\" (the higher finger being the loop \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032 at one side and the minor being loops \u03b22\u2032/\u03b71\u2032 and a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 at the opposite one). This molecular claw \"pinches\" the borders of the two N-terminal helices from ACE-2 (the H1 and H2 helices) at binding, positioning these helices for deeper contact with the short antiparallel \ua7b51\u2032-\ua7b52\u2032-sheet at the RBM center (Carvalho & Alves, 2020; Wu et al., 2020) .",

Due to this strategic packing at the center of the RBM, tenuous variations on the packing and mobility of position 417 are likely to influence the fluctuation of the entire domain. A higher fluctuation abrangency along different simulations is observed for the wt RBM than P1, especially at loops where positions 484 and 501 are located (Figs. 5A and 5B, Table S2 ). It can be noticed that the wt loops \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032-C and \u03b22\u2032/\u03b71\u2032 reach about 1 \u212b higher maximum mobility in wt than their respective counterparts in P1 (Figs. 5A and 5B ). This reflects a higher distribution of conformational population for the wt RBM at the less dense conformational clusters compared to the Gamma variant, which in turn presents 98.1% of its conformational space centered at the major cluster (Figs. 5C and 5D) . Interestingly, the data in Table S2 suggest that this difference seems not to reflect on the RBD and RBM average topology itself, residing the major differences only on the conformational fluctuations around the average. In fact, we can notice that the majority of the weighted average RMSD measures (using the cluster fraction as weights) related to the starting pre-simulation structures (the PDB:6M0J for wt and the homology model based on this PDB for P1) suggest reciprocally similar and not considerable deviations from these initial conformations at the mean, both considering the RBM and RBD, as considering the RBM major motifs (Table S2 ). However, considering the weighted fluctuations around these same mean values, it can also be noticed a less mobile structure for P1 (for instance, with the average fluctuation of the P1 RMSD of the whole RBM around five times lower than the same fluctuation in wt). The only local exception is a faintly higher fluctuation for the central \u03b21\u2032-\u03b22\u2032 sheet in P1, considering the weighted average measures per cluster representative structures in Table S2 .

Considering this last issue, the differential context of the a1\u2032/\u03b21 loop at the P1 RBD seems also to be reflected in the fact that this loop is the only part of the P1 RBM with higher RMSF compared to wt (opposite to the behavior of the rest of this motif in Figs. 5A and 5B).

Although the local alterations of the Gamma's RBM second major cluster seem to result in a minor contact surface area with ACE-2, two crucial issues diminish the implications of this conformation on attenuation of the spike-receptor affinity. First, there is no apparent emergence of probable charge to charge repulsion with the ACE-2 surface from the first to the second conformation in Gamma. Second, the less complementary second cluster conformation only appears in 1.5% of the MD simulation, suggesting a lower contribution for this conformation at the RBM phase space than for its analogous in wt (right side structures in Figs. 6C and 6E) .",

            "text": "The higher disorder of the loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 at the P1 RBM suggests an additional impedance for antibody binding As previously mentioned, the principal subregions in which interactions with the receptor and/or antibodies occur and/or change at the static structures analyzed with E-volve in Figs. 2-4 (i.e., the \u03b21\u2032-\u03b22\u2032 sheet, the loops \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032-C and \u03b22\u2032/\u03b71\u2032) maintain an average topology equally similar to these starting conformations along the MDs (Table S2) . The same can be said about the average structure of the entire RBM and the RBD as a whole. In this way, the major conclusions previously drawn from the E-volve analysis about the nature of the major interactions around the major part of the RBM/RBD sites are maintained. It seems to be only necessary, for a more accurate discussion, to incorporate to these same conclusions the enhancing effects carried by the distinct conformational fluctuations for wt and P1 RBMs around the average. However, a single specific RBM subsite presenting peripheral interactions with ACE-2 and antibodies, the loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 (residues 438 to 450), seems to suffer a change concerning the average structure in P1 compared to wt (Table S2 ). The differential context of this loop is still corroborated by its higher RMSF in P1 compared to the same region in wt, a behavior in contrast to the recovered for the rest of the RBM. In this way, a more detailed analysis of the differences in conformational space for this only loop at the wt and P1 respective contexts, as well their possible implications for binding, seems to be necessary. Superpositions of representative RBM structures from our MD data with the protein: protein interfaces at different complexes are depicted in Fig. S3 . The superpositions are carried, from right to the left, for the RBM binding interfaces with ACE-2, the antibody P17 and antibody BD-368-2, as well as at the context of the starting (crystal-like), structures (Fig. S3 , top row), the three cluster centroids from wt MD simulations (Fig. S3 , middle row) and cluster centroids from P1 MD simulations (Fig. S3, bottom row) . It can be noticed that both the higher average RMSD related to the pre-MD structure and the higher RMSF at the P1 loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 seem to be associated with a local less structure of the helix a1\u2032 at its basis. This leads to a higher disorder and mobility of the loop as a whole (Fig. S3 , bottom row). This less ordered loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 in P1 leads to representative clusters in which the topology of the same loop is more dissimilar to the binding conformation than in wt. Once the binding conformation of this loop implicates on its higher ordering, it is expected a greater entropic penalty to this organization for the naturally disordered loop in P1 than in wt (naturally ordered) (Batori, Koide & Koide, 2002; Benfield et al., 2006; Rajasekaran et al., 2016) . In addition, an apparent structural clash of the more occupied structures for the binding at the BD-368-2 antibody, overall considering the residue Y449, seems to be expected for the P1 RBM, but not for wt (Fig. S3, last column) . Although more specific studies about this conformational and dynamics influences at complexation need to be carried out (studies already in development in our group), the binding modes suggest that the penalties above mentioned would be lower at ACE-2 association, middle at P17 and higher at the BD-368-2 antibody complex. At the ACE-2 complexation, the residues at the RBM loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 just interact with a small fraction of the receptor interfaces at the C-terminal extension of the ACE-2 helix H1. A major part of the ACE-2 interaction is mediated by the protruding of the middle and N-terminal portions of H1 at the RBM \u03b21\u2032-\u03b22\u2032 sheet, loops \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032 and \u03b22\u2032/\u03b71\u2032 region (dashed arc at Fig. S3 , right and bottom). In this way, it is expected that the higher fit between the RBM and the ACE-2 interfaces at these regions by all the aforementioned effects compensates sufficiently for the conformational difficulties for the loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 interactions. Considering the antibody P17, two respective cavities at this antibody mediates the respective interactions with the RBM loops \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032 and a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 (dashed arcs in Fig. S3 , bottom row, middle column). Although the importance of the interaction with loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 has increased compared to the complex with ACE-2, the interaction with the loop \u03b21\u2032/\u03b22\u2032 are still higher, in such a way that the findings at E-volve analysis can, still, be of more importance to describe the loss of affinity. For the complex with the BD-368-2 antibody, however, a reorientation of the antibody at the protein:protein interface compared to P17 seems to put the interaction with the loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 as being of greater relevance for the complex stability as a whole (Fig. S3, bottom row, right column) . In this way, we advocate that the higher disorder of the loop a1\u2032/\u03b21\u2032 at the P1 mutant can be a specific evolutive strategy to draw back interactions with antibodies with this similar interaction mode. Although this dependence of subtle conformational changes at specific complexes interactions and stability was not taken into account in our case study of the E-volve applications, it is entirely possible to carry previous short MD studies and collection of the more populated conformers before E-volve applications, what can be of more reliable finds for future studies of groups interested on to measure the impact of new spike mutations.",

            "text": "One current limitation of E-Volve is that the models do not present the conformational changes of the generated proteins. The models created in E-Volve are generated by the MODELLER software, which has limitations in the homology modelling algorithm. The output model does not show the conformational changes that occur in the real ligands. Furthermore, mutations that could alter the spike stereochemical configuration, even in regions outside of the analyzed locus, will not be foreseen by E-Volve. Despite this, we believe E-Volve is significant to real-time tracking of structural mutations in new and emerging strains, until the experimental structure is available. It is also interesting to highlight that in our case studies, the major structural features of the MODELLER recovered models have maintained themselves at the average structures recovered at the MD protocols, just being necessary to add to the final conclusions the effects of the distinct structural fluctuations around these averages. This is not an unexpected finding, once that usually, a small number of single amino acid substitutions on the surface of a protein result in a final molecule with basically the same global folding, but changing local attributes related to interactions and mobility (Wang & Moult, 2001) . Anyway, it is possible to increment in future a version in which, after the generation of the models by MODELLER, a short conformational search, for example, using the simplified Monte Carlos based protocols from the ROSETTA software (Brunette & Brock, 2008; Potrzebowski, Trewhella & Andre, 2018) is carried, taken the most probable conformer(s) to the posterior docking procedures. It is also possible to incorporate (once a server with sufficient computing power is available) previous short molecular dynamics simulation protocols, overall for the RBM loops, after the modeling and before docking. Finally, it is equally possible, in future, to implement new versions of E-Volve with a set of other molecular modeling algorithms in which eventual small conformational changes can be more accurately considered. By now, the experimental structures of Alpha, Beta and Gamma are available on PDB.",

As proof of concept, we have evaluated the impact caused by mutations on the spike's RBD as for the non-covalent interactions altered between the spike-ACE2 and the spike-Antibody complexes. In addition, our research scrutinized an interactional increase in highly immunogenic regions in the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2. Those mainly related to the 501, 484, and 417 amino acid positions are also frequent in most models studied. Furthermore, the implementation of E-Volve guides users, in an automatized way, to evaluate and comprehend the process we scrutinized in this research. The tool is useful for constant analysis of the data generated by the real-time tracking of the COVID-19 pandemic. E-Volve facilitates the comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 emerging mutant lineages, rapidly contributing to worldwide epidemiology. Moreover, the tool creates a useful intelligible environment for general protein mutation analysis and evaluation, as demonstrated in this study. Once mutations with higher potential impact to the receptor or immune system interactions are firstly prospected by this tool (on an extensive list), deeper analysis can be individually carried out just for these hits in individuals (as exemplified by our MD comparative studies with the wt and Gamma lineages). This may represent a substantial gain in time for research for new impacting variants. E-Volve encompasses biological systems with amino acid residue alterations, from minor to major scale structures, depicting quality-based bioinformatics models in protein mutagenesis and poses an extending step for proteomics studies.",

(B-top) E-Volve detects intra-chain and inter-chain interactions in the wild and mutant proteins. (C) E-Volve uses MODELLER software to perform comparative modeling of mutants using the wild protein as a template. (B-bottom) E-Volve uses TM-align to perform pairwise structural alignment between the wild protein and each mutant. Then, E-Volve uses the VTR algorithm to calculate contact matches, i.e., detects interacting residue pairs in analogous positions for wild and mutant structures. (D) E-Volve shows interactive visualizations of contact conservation, such as heat maps, contact maps, equivalent contact tables, 3D visualization of the protein structures superimposed, and a statistical summary.
