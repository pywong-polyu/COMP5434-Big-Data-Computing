The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic affecting over 200 countries. 1 In the United States, cases continue to increase with over one million confirmed infections and 73,000 associated deaths as of May 2020. 2 Patients with COVID-19 present with a variety of signs and symptoms but the majority exhibit fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Many patients also experience shortness of breath, myalgias, and anorexia amongst other less common symptoms. Disease severity can range from asymptomatic or relatively mild to severe with an estimated 20% of patients requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). 3 Chest imaging of patients with COVID-19 typically reveals bilateral multi-focal opacities on plain radiographs and bilateral, peripheral interstitial ground glass opacities on computerized tomography (CT). 2, 3 These findings are nonspecific and overlap with other infectious etiologies, creating uncertainty in differentiating COVID-19 from other common viral or bacterial respiratory infections. Thus, if bacterial pneumonia or sepsis is strongly suspected, initiation of empiric antibiotics to cover for communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) has been recommended by national guidelines. 3, 4 Bacterial infections occur both concomitantly and subsequent to a variety of viral respiratory illnesses.

The ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines recommend empirically treating MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa only if specific risk factors are present. These risk factors include recent hospitalization with receipt of IV antibiotics, prior history of either pathogen in the last 12 months, or high local prevalence rates for either pathogen. 13 Only four patients in this study had risk factors for multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms, and therefore the majority of patients were appropriately prescribed narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Most of the patients initiated on broad-spectrum regimens were de-escalated quickly if MRSA surveillance screen and/or blood cultures were negative. Based on these observations, we recommend that careful assessment of MDR risk factors be performed before initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics and cultures should be obtained to help guide de-escalation. MRSA nasal screening has a negative predictive value of > 95% for MRSA pneumonia. The utilization of MRSA surveillance screening to assist with early de-escalation should be encouraged in order to decrease unnecessary exposure to vancomycin, lab draws and monitoring, and reduce risk of nephrotoxicity. 14, 15 There is currently limited information available regarding rates of bacterial coinfections with COVID-19.

Although identification of organisms may have been limited by this inability to obtain quality respiratory cultures, sputum cultures overall have poor yield for pathogen isolation. Our institution does not perform S. pneumoniae urine antigen testing; however, both S. pneumoniae and Legionella urine antigen tests have modest sensitivity for clinical disease and the most recent ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines do not recommend routinely testing these urine antigens in adults with non-severe CAP. 14 Procalcitonin has been suggested as a potentially useful biomarker to differentiate bacterial and viral infections and assist with antibiotic decisionmaking. 21-23 However, due to the lack of data regarding its reliability in completely ruling out bacterial pneumonia with accuracy, the role of procalcitonin in COVID-19 is currently unknown. 13, 24 Although blood cultures are not routinely recommended in non-severe CAP, they were collected from a majority of patients in this cohort.
