For instance, many variational problems and PDEs have been studied to model and solve important problems in a variety of areas such as, e.g., in physics, economy, data processing, computer vision. In particular they have been very successful in image and signal processing to solve a wide spectrum of applications such as isotropic and anisotropic filtering, inpainting or segmentation.",

Each vertex of the graph corresponds to a datum, and the edges encode the pairwise relationships or similarities among the data. For the particular case of images, pixels (represented by nodes) have a specific organization expressed by their spatial connectivity. Therefore, a typical graph used to represent images is a grid graph. For the case of unorganized data such as point clouds, a graph can also be built by modeling neighborhood relationships between the data elements. For these reasons, there has been recently a wave of interest in adapting and solving nonlocal variational problems and PDEs on data which is represented by arbitrary graphs and networks. Using this framework, problems are directly expressed in a discrete setting where an appropriate discrete differential calculus can be proposed; see e.g., [4, 5] and references therein.",

In this work, we introduce a novel class of p-bilaplacian operators on weighted graphs, which can be seen as proper discretizations on graphs of the classical p-bilaplacian operators [9] . Building upon this definition, we study a corresponding regularized variational problem as well as a boundary value problem. The latter naturally gives rise to p-biharmonic functions on graphs and equivalent definitions of p-biharmonicity [8] . For these two problems, we start by establishing their well-posedness (existence and uniqueness). We then turn to developing proximal splitting algorithms to solve them, appealing to sophisticated tools from non-smooth optimization. Numerical results are reported to support the viability of our approach.",

The nodes of the graph are the points in the 2-D cloud and u(x) is the value at a point/vertex x. We choose the nearest neighbour graph with the standard weighting kernel exp (\u2212|x \u2212 y|) when |x \u2212 y| \u03b4 and 0 otherwise, where x and y are the 2-D spatial coordinates of the points in the cloud. The original point cloud used in our numerical experiments consists of N = 2500 points that are not on a regular grid. For the variational problem, the noisy observation is generated by adding a white Gaussian noise of standard deviation 0.5 to the original data, see Fig. 1(a) . For the Dirichlet problem, the initial label function takes the values of the original data on a set of points/vertices where this set corresponds to the boundary data, it is chosen randomly and is equal to N/4 of the original points/vertices, see Fig. 1(b) .
