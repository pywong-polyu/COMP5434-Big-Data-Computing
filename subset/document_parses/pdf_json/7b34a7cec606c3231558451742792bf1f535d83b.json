High-risk work-related exposures (i.e., breach in protective measures) drove an association between work exposure and infection (HR 2.5, 95% CI, 1.3-4.8).

[4] [5] [6] Existing literature and media reports have noted widely varying estimates of prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for infection. [7] [8] [9] Few studies have assessed HCW infection and risk longitudinally despite changes in community prevalence of COVID-19 over time, workplace infection prevention efforts, and dynamic individual adherence to public health measures outside of work. Two European groups reported data from longitudinal HCW screening programs and estimated prevalence and incidence of infection 2,10 but to date, a similar granular approach to describing prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 in United States HCWs has not been reported.",
