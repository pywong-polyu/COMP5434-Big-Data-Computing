We considered two scenarios. The first scenario has two channels of transmission over the economic system: a negative shock of labor supply due to the rates of morbidity and mortality caused by the pandemic, and a temporary shutdown of nonessential economic activities. The second scenario adds to the first the effects of the government fiscal package adopted to counteract the effects of COVID-19 on the economy. Furthermore, in both scenarios, a sensitive analysis related to the temporality of the shutdown is considered by assuming 3 and 6 months of shutdown.",

Thus, the government fiscal stimulus considered in this study partially mitigates the reduction in GDP projected under the COVID-19 outbreak. The study also presents sectoral projections at the national and state levels. The estimates indicate reductions in the GDP of most of Brazilian states in both scenarios.",

They also showed the damage to the tourism economy over 2020 caused by travel restriction and stayat-home policies. These measures have negatively affected the tourism sector, mainly the subsectors of travel, cruises, and accommodation. For example, in the accommodation sector, by March 21, guest numbers have declined by 50% or more, affecting mainly countries with large number of COVID-19 cases, such as Greece and Italy. Ramos et al. (2020) simulated a half drop in the demand of nonessential sector. The authors have divided the WIOD sectors into essential and nonessential sectors and considered a symmetric shock in all countries. Since countries present different economic structure in terms of productive leakages and final demand composition, the authors have identified how they may be affected by consumption pattern changes.",

In the TERM-UF model, all these relationships are established at the regional level, i.e., the Brazilian States, and aggregated for the entire economy allowing for the generation of results at the national and regional levels. For the detailed theoretical structure and more information on TERM see: www.copsmodels.com/term. 7 The data includes regional output shares, regional investment shares and regional household consumption shares by sector and region from IBGE (the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), RAIS (Annual List of Social Information) and POF (Household Budget Survey). Furthermore, it includes regional government expenditure shares, regional export shares and regional import shares by commodities and region from IBGE, SECEX and RAIS. Finally, the data also considers the regional population from IBGE. The simulations with the TERM-UF model involve the specification of a baseline (reference scenario) and policy scenarios. The baseline represents a reference path at a national level, given the expected behavior of economic variables reflected mainly on macroeconomic aggregates (GDP and investment), which follows the trend of the recent period. In this study, the base scenario assumes, for example, that national GDP would grow by 2.2% in 2020, as expected by the Central Bank's Focus report before the proliferation of COVID-19 in Brazil 9 . The regional economic results are calculated endogenously and guarantee the consistence with the baseline at the national economy level. In its turn, the policy scenario represents an exogenous \"disruption\" in the economic system that affects the decision of economic agents, scenarios presented in this paper, all changes related to isolation and the shutdown trigger adverse deviations on the main economic variables, as illustrated in Figure 1 .",

In spite of the emergence of using fiscal policy to mitigate the recessive effects caused by Covid-19 in the short run, the long-term economic dynamic could be negatively affected due the potential expansion of public debt and its consequences on the future tax burden. This concern stems from the high public spending required to combat the pandemic, including transitory expenses for public health and policies to mitigate the economic and social effects. Furthermore, the public revenues had also dropped abruptly. In Brazil, this is politically sensitive since the country was in a process to adjust public accounts.",

            "text": "Source: Elaborated by the authors.TERM-UF is composed of blocks of equations that determine relationships between supply and demand, according to optimization assumptions and market-clearing conditions. In addition, several national aggregates, such as the aggregate employment, GDP, investment, and price indexes, are defined in these blocks. Theeconomic activities minimize production costs subject to a technology of constant returns to scale in which the combinations of intermediate inputs and primary factors (aggregated) are determined by fixed coefficients (Leontief). There is the substitution of domestic and imported goods via the prices in the composition of inputs according to the function of the constant elasticity of substitution (CES). A CES specification also controls the allocation of a domestic compound among the various regions. There is also substitution between capital and labor in the composition of the primary factors through CES functions (Carvalho et al., 2017).There is a representative household for each region consuming domestic and imported goods. The choice between domestic and imported goods (from other countries) is held by a CES (Armington assumption) specification, which is part of a household demand system of preferences, combining CES and Klein-Rubin functions.The specification gives the linear expenditure system (LES), in which the share of expenditure above the subsistence level for each good represents a constant participation of the total subsistence expenditure of each family.The goods of a region are compounded by the basic values plus trade and transport margins. The margin share in the delivery price is a combination of origin, destination, goods and source (domestic or imported). Margins on goods from one region to another can be produced in different regions. In addition, there is substitution between suppliers of margins, according to a CES function.The model operates with market equilibrium for all goods, both domestic and imported, as well as the market factors (capital, and labor) for each region. The purchase prices by user(producers, investors, households, exporters, and government)  are the sum of the basic values, sales taxes (direct and indirect) and margins (trade and transport). Sales taxes are treated as ad valorem taxes on basic flows. Demands for margins (trade and transport) are proportional to the flow of goods to which the margins are connected. The dynamic of the model is of the recursive type, making it possible to project the simulation results for the time horizon of interest. Then, investment and capital stock follow mechanisms of accumulation and intersectoral shift from pre-established rules related to the depreciation and rates of return. The labor market has an element of intertemporal adjustment of real wages. It is assumed that the demand for labor determines the number of workers used in production and that real wages are rigid in the short run, but flexible in the long run. The base year for the calibration of the TERM-UF model for the Brazilian economy is 2015 8 . Its database was updated yearly until 2019, considering the macroeconomic behavior of the Brazilian economy observed in this period. The simulations presented are based on updated data from 2019 and the changes caused by COVID-19 in 2020.",

There are high negative effects in Private Education, Food and Beverages, Livestock and Others in Industry. The sectoral deviation in relation to reference scenario is sensitive to the longer shutdown. The longer shutdown may intensify the sectoral losses, as shown by Figure 3(a) and Figure 4(a). In Scenario 2, in turn, the sectors that concentrate public expenditures show a positive deviation in relation to the reference scenario (baseline)i.e., Public Administration, Public Education and Public Health.
