ADHD exhibits substantial heritability, with rare monogenic variants contributing to its pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate familial ADHD caused by a missense mutation in CDH2, which encodes the adhesion protein N-cadherin, known to play a significant role in synaptogenesis; the mutation affects maturation of the protein. In line with the human phenotype, CRISPR/Cas9-mutated knock-in mice harboring the human mutation in the mouse ortholog recapitulated core behavioral features of hyperactivity. Symptoms were modified by methylphenidate, the most commonly prescribed therapeutic for ADHD. The mutated mice exhibited impaired presynaptic vesicle clustering, attenuated evoked transmitter release and decreased spontaneous release. Specific downstream molecular pathways were affected in both the ventral midbrain and prefrontal cortex, with reduced tyrosine hydroxylase expression and dopamine levels. We thus delineate roles for CDH2-related pathways in the pathophysiology of ADHD.",

Affected individuals have difficulties in higher-level executive functions, which are mediated by latedeveloping frontal-striatal-parietal and frontal-cerebellar neuronal networks. These mainly include motor and interference inhibition, working memory, sustained attention, and temporal information processing 2 . Although its etiology is not well defined, ADHD appears to have substantial heritability, and as such, it has been the focus of considerable genetic research, with growing evidence that rare monogenic variants may possess an essential role in its pathogenesis 3 .",

Patient II:6 was born at term following an uneventful pregnancy, whereas the non-identical twin patients II:3 and II:4 were born prematurely at 32 weeks (weight appropriate for gestational age; 1900 and 2200, respectively). By the age of three, all siblings presented with a similar manifestation of severe hyperactivity behavior, predominantly hyperactive/ impulsive. By the age of four, all patients met the criteria for ADHD, as outlined in the DSM-5. Concisely, information about ADHD manifestations was collected from semi-structured interviews conducted with both parents. Additional information was obtained from observations, questionnaires, and supplementary assessments: Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals 5th Edition 7 and Conner's Parent Rating Scales-Revised 8 . The following were excluded in all three patients: scoring below 80 on both the performance and the verbal scales of the WISC-III 9 , psychosis, bipolar affective disorder, Tourette syndrome, multiple chronic tics, and a first-degree relative diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia. All affected siblings were medication-free for 24 h prior to assessment and cognitive testing. Patients II:3 and II:6 (ages 11 and 7, respectively) reached normal developmental milestones, had no other comorbidities, and are completely normal in terms of intellect. Patient II:4 demonstrated mild developmental delay with autism spectrum disorder manifestations. Brain MRI (patient II:6, at 21 months) was normal. Blood pH, lactate, pyruvate, creatine, phosphokinase, and amino acids, as well as urinary organic acids, were within normal limits. Screening for congenital glycosylation defects, karyotype, and chromosomal microarrays were normal. All three patients were treated with stimulants, neuroleptics, and 3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate. Notably, both parents and other siblings (including II:1 and Fig. 1 Pedigree and CDH2 mutation. a Pedigree of the consanguineous kindred studied.

It is known to play an essential role in synaptogenesis, synapse function, plasticity-induced long-term spine stabilization, and cortical organization. Classical cadherins are initially synthesized bearing a prodomain, thought to limit adhesion during the early stages of biosynthesis, which is then endogenously cleaved within the Golgi apparatus 10 . N-cadherin protein modeling (Fig. 2a) revealed that the sequence linking the prodomain to the outermost extracellular cadherin domain is unstructured and can be found in variable conformational loops, enabling the anchoring of proteolytic enzymes, mainly furin protease 11 . Computational studies (Fig. 2b ) demonstrated that the furin protease consensus cleavage site contains approximately 20 residues, harboring the recognition motif RXK/R-R 12 , located five residues downstream to the p.H150Y mutation site. Using prediction tools for protein-peptide interactions, we demonstrated that the wildtype (WT) p.H150 residue is anchored within the catalytic pocket of the furin protease active-site, putatively contributing to its stable docking. In contrast, the mutant tyrosine sidechain, in a right rotamer conformation, is predicted to project perpendicularly, away from the catalytic pocket due to its nonpolar, uncharged sidechain. Therefore, the mutation is predicted to interfere with the proteolysis and maturation of the protein.",

Following digestion by furin (Fig. 2d) 14 , peptides were cleaved into two fragments based on the recognition preference of the protease (Fig. S1 ). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis demonstrated that proteolytic cleavage of the mutated peptide was substantially decreased compared with that of the WT peptide (Fig. 2e) .

Cdh2 H150Y mice exhibited significantly greater traveling distance, increased velocity, and prolonged mobility time in the open-field exploratory test (OFT), recapitulating motor-associated features of hyperactivity ( Fig. 3a-f ). No differences were observed when examining the duration mice spent in the center of the open-field arena, a measure inversely related to neophobic behavior, nor in the amount of center/border crossings. In addition, no difference was evident in the rotarod test (Fig. 3m) , implying no significant effect on primary motor control. Regarding cognitive evaluation, a trend was observed in the spontaneous alteration test (Y-maze, Fig. 3h) , suggesting a potential effect on executive functions and working memory. A significant difference was observed in the acoustic startle reflex test (ASR, Fig. 3j , k), demonstrating an elevated startle amplitude of the Cdh2 H150Y(1) mice, commonly associated with differences in sensorimotor integration. A similar pattern was observed in the pre-pulse inhibition test (Fig. 3l ), in agreement with deficits in early-stage information processing, although no difference was evident in the pre-pulse attenuation fraction itself. Also, as part of the anxiety-domain assessment, no difference was demonstrated in the elevated plus-maze test (Fig. 3g) . Lastly, the results of social interaction tests were inconclusive; although a significantly shorter interaction time in the resident-intruder test may imply a propensity for aggression (Fig. 3i) , no differences were observed in the three-chamber sociability test followed by the social novelty test (Fig. 3n) .",

(n = 3 for t = 30 and 60, n = 4 for t = 180; n represents an independent peptide digestion experiment subjected to LC-MS analysis (see Methods); mean \u00b1 SEM data were acquired, two-sided Student's t-test, at t = 30 ns p = 0.08; t = 60 ns p = 0.44; t = 180 ns p = 0.052). Right: normalized cleavage efficacy at t = 180. Cleavage disruption of the mutated peptide is demonstrated with digestion >20% weaker in comparison with the WT peptide.

While long-term MPH administration is known to have a therapeutic effect, in acute dosing it has been shown to have anxiogenic effects 16 . Hence, to further examine in-vivo ramifications of the Cdh2 mutation, we investigated MPH's effect on explorative behavior and sensorimotor gating through OFT and ASR, respectively. Male 14-weekold C57BL/6JRcc WT and homozygous Cdh2 H150Y(1/2) mice (n = 39, Fig. 4h ) were injected intraperitoneally with MPH or vehicle (0.9% saline) at 10 mg/kg, 30 min before initiation of tests. While both WT and mutant mice exhibited increased locomotor activity following MPH administration, the effect was significantly greater in the Cdh2 mutant mice (Fig. 4i ). In addition, the fold-change of the cumulative duration within center zone of the mutant mice was significantly smaller compared with the WT mice. These results highlight the in-vivo pathogenicity of the Cdh2 mutation, with the mutant mice being significantly more susceptible to stimulatory intervention following MPH administration. This was further indicated by the ASR results (Fig. 4j) , as the MPH-treated KI mice demonstrated a significantly lower startle amplitude compared with their WT counterparts, as opposed to the non-MPH ASR experiment (Fig. 3j) .",

In accordance with the well-studied role of N-cadherin in synaptic development 17 and the known deleterious effect that aberrant N-cadherin prodomain cleavage has on synaptogenesis 18,19 , we sought to investigate possible effects the mutation might have on synaptic properties in ex-vivo hippocampal neurons of Cdh2 H150Y homozygous mice as compared to their WT counterparts. First, we quantified the total vesicle population by semi-quantitative immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of synaptobrevin2 (Syb2, an integral synaptic vesicle (SV) SNARE protein). Analysis was performed at two time points: 8 days in-vitro (DIV) and 14 DIV, which represent immature and mature synapses, respectively 20 . The IF intensity of the SV cluster in Cdh2 H150Y neurons was significantly lower at 8 DIV, and more prominently so at 14 DIV (Fig. 5a, b) . The decrease in the IF signal was accompanied by a sharper longitudinal distribution of SVs along the axis of the presynaptic terminal. This was quantified by determining the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of Gaussian fits to linear profiles of syb2 IF (Fig. 5c) . These results imply that SV clusters in Cdh2 H150Y synapses are smaller and more compact. We repeated this experiment performing IF for vGlut1, a vesicular glutamate transporter which partakes in a different synaptic function than sy2b. Although no difference was observed in 8 DIV neurons, 14 DIV neurons exhibited a significantly lower vGlut1 peak signal and a narrower distribution, similar to Syb2 at DIV 14 ( Fig. 5a, b) . Thus, the SV cluster in presynaptic terminals of Cdh2 H150Y neurons is smaller.",

The SVs in the synapse can be functionally categorized into different subpopulations based on their availability for release. The recycling pool (RcP) contains SVs that can engage in stimulus-evoked synaptic release, while the resting pool (RtP) vesicles are not released during stimulation but can contribute SVs to the RcP for future rounds of release [21] [22] [23] . The readily releasable pool (RRP), a subgroup of the recycling pool located directly at the active zone 24 , contains the vesicles that are the first to undergo fusion during synaptic activity, meaning they have the highest fusion probability 25 . Finally, the relative division of SVs between these pools can be modulated 26, 27 , thus altering the neuronal synaptic properties. Using the styryl-dye FM1-43, we stained the RcP SVs 28 and assessed the relative size of the RRP and the RcP. To quantify the RRP, we measured FM1-43 destaining during a brief burst of stimulation (20 stimuli at 20 Hz) 29 and found it to be significantly smaller in Cdh2 H150Y neurons, while no difference was observed during prolonged FM1-43 destaining (Fig. 5d) . These results suggest that while the RcP is unaffected (see also Fig. 6c ), the RRP is relatively smaller in the Cdh2 H150Y neurons, consistent with weaker synaptic transmission.",

To monitor synaptic function, primary neuronal hippocampal cultures from WT and Cdh2 H150Y homozygous littermates were infected to express hSyn:synaptopHluorinX2 (sypHy), a genetically-encoded synaptic release sensor. The fluorescence of sypHy is quenched by the acidic lumen of intact synaptic vesicles. During SV exocytosis, fluorescence increases but decays back to baseline during recycling, after SV endocytosis and reacidification 31 . Cdh2 H150Y neurons exhibited a lower sypHy signal upon electrical stimulation (20 Hz, 15 s) compared to WT neurons (\u0394F/F 0 , Fig. 6a, b) , illustrating weaker synaptic vesicle recycling in the mutant neurons. This result implies a decrease in the number of SVs released during stimulation of Cdh2 H150Y neurons. To test whether this is only due to a decrease in the total number of SVs in Cdh2 H150Y terminals, or also due to a decrease in the relative size of the RcP out of the total pool of SVs, we employed the alkaline trapping method (Fig. 6c) 32 ; when sypHy is imaged in the presence of bafilomycin A, a blocker of the SV proton pump, sypHy reports only the cumulative exocytotic portion of the vesicle cycle; the decrease in sypHy fluorescence that is induced by compensatory endocytosis and reacidification is blocked, without affecting the kinetics of recycling 33 . Perfusion with saline containing NH 4 Cl at the conclusion of the experiment unquenches the intact SVs, thus revealing the entire vesicle population; the ratio between the plateau observed during exhaustive stimulation and the total population allows calculation of the relative size of the RcP. We observed no difference in the RcP fraction in WT and Cdh2 H150Y synapses, which was approximately 50% (Fig. 6c) . Considering Cdh2 H150Y neurons exhibit smaller SV clusters, we conclude that their RcP are proportionally smaller and thus exhibit weaker synaptic release.",

A reduction in total vesicle population or SV clusters in presynaptic terminals and a decrease in the RRP could lead to a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic release 30, 34, 35 . Thus, we performed patch-clamp recordings from pyramidal neurons in the CA1 in the hippocampus in acute brain slices from WT and Cdh2 H150Y littermates and recorded spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the presence of Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 nM) and Bicuculline (GABA A antagonist, 10 \u00b5M) ( Fig. 6d-f ). The mEPSC frequency was significantly smaller in Cdh2 H150Y neurons; in contrast, no difference was observed in the mEPSC amplitudes. The latter (also termed the quantal size) is generally associated with changes in postsynaptic properties such as receptor density 36 , while the former is typically attributed to changes in presynaptic propertieseither the availability of vesicles or the per-vesicle probability of spontaneous release. These results strengthen our previous observation that the SV clusters in presynaptic terminals of Cdh2 H150Y neurons are smaller as are their RRPs.",

            "text": "Schaffer collateral pathway synapses from Cdh2-mice exhibit lower frequency facilitation. Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) regulates the activity of neural networks and information processing in the nervous system on a timescale of milliseconds to minutes. One form of STP is synaptic facilitation, a phenomenon in which postsynaptic potentials are augmented during short bursts of repetitive stimulation. Multiple presynaptic mechanisms have been suggested to account for facilitation, including accumulation of calcium in the terminal during the stimulation train that leads to a progressive increase in the probability of release (P r ) [37] [38] [39] ; but facilitation was also correlated with the size of the RRP 30, 34 . To examine STP, we compared the change in excitatory postsynaptic potential responses (fEPSPs) in extracellular recordings from the CA1 area in acute brain slices of Cdh2 H150Y and WT mice during the delivery of 5 stimuli to the Schaffer collaterals at different frequencies ( Fig. 6g -i). At higher stimulation frequencies, Cdh2 H150Y slices exhibited lower frequency facilitation than WT slices, consistent with the smaller presynaptic cluster in their neurons. Using synaptophysin 1-oGCaMP6f, in which the calcium indicator GCaMP6f is fused to the SV protein synaptophysin I, we examined baseline calcium and its accumulation in the terminals during field stimulation. No difference was observed between Cdh2 H150Y and WT neurons ( Fig. 6j-l) . While this result implies that calcium-handling is not different in neurons from the two genotypes, it is of note that facilitation depends on calcium dynamics in nanodomains 37 , which are not directly measurable using calcium imaging. Altogether, our results support a role for N-cadherin in modulating short-term synaptic plasticity, perhaps due to a decrease in the RRP size.",

This prodomain processing is highly important in N-cadherin maturation, with aberrant cleavage impairing its adhesive properties, resulting in impaired synapse formation, mainly through enhancement in migratory properties. The p.H150Y mutation we identified is within the recognition domain of the protease responsible for this endogenous modification, and as we demonstrate through biochemical studies, impacts this tightly regulated post-processing. Also, longterm expression of an aberrant N-cadherin was demonstrated to reduce synapse connectivity 49 .

These observations are consistent with our results, exhibiting a significant decrease in presynaptic vesicle clustering in Cdh2 H150Y neurons, supporting our conclusion that the p.H150Y mutation impairs N-cadherin function.

As aforementioned, the VTA neurons project to several limbic structures, mainly the ventral striatum and the PFC, giving rise to both the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. The latter has been implicated as a critical circuit essential for motivated behaviors and other cognitive functions related to ADHD 55 . Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that loss of N-cadherin leads to a reduction in the number of DA neurons, mediated by the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that \u03b2-catenin, co-localized with N-cadherin, controls DA neurogenesis by maintaining the integrity of the vMB 56 . Our results support these findings, demonstrating a reduction in the density of TH-positive neurons within the PFC and vMB of the Cdh2 H150Y brains, with a concurrent decrease in dopamine concentration. Taken together, these findings delineate an association between a deficiency in adhesive properties of N-cadherin, impaired synaptic function, and potential decrease in dopaminergic tone, with the current notion of ADHD as a \"hypo-dopaminergic\" condition 57 .",

Consistent with our findings of impaired presynaptic activity, it has been demonstrated that the N-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin complex has a principal role at nascent synapses in the assembly of presynaptic vesicle clusters, as the expression of non-functional N-cadherin greatly reduces the size and function of presynaptic terminals. Interestingly, our enrichment analysis delineated potential association between downregulated N-cadherin, P120-catenin, and IQGAP1, perhaps through the Wnt signaling cascade, which, among others, regulates presynaptic vesicle clustering. 6 Synaptic release is attenuated in Cdh2-mutated neurons. a Left: representative images of sypHy-puncta in WT neurons.

Pathologies described within this study were ocular (7/9), urogenital (4/9), cardiovascular (7/9), hearing loss (2/9), axial hypotonia (3/9), epilepsy (2/9), intellectual disability (6/9), and neuropsychiatric issues (7/9). Though carefully studied, none of our heterozygous individuals presented with any clinical abnormalities. Nonetheless, none of the nine heterozygous variants were found to reside in proximity to our mutation, with the majority affecting residues of the EC4 to EC5 linker region. Thus, one cannot rule out that haploinsufficiency mutations in different domains might cause different phenotypes affecting different tissues, likely reflecting, at least in part, tissuespecificities of adhesive interactions.

SypHy is a probe based on the internal fusion of a pH-sensitive GFP called pHluorin 78 (pKa = 7.6), with the vesicular protein Synaptophysin I (SypI), so that pHluorin is located in the lumen of the synaptic vesicles (SVs) and allows the reportage of presynaptic activity 31, 79 . Briefly, pHluorin fluorescence is quenched by the acidic pH of the intact vesicle lumen (pH~5.5). Upon stimulation, SVs fuse with the plasma membrane, thus exposing their lumen to the neutral pH of the extracellular environment (pH~7.3), causing an increase in the fluorescence of pHluorin. Following endocytosis, pHluorin is requenched due to the reacidification of the lumen by the vesicular proton pump (vATPase). Therefore, an increase in fluorescence reflects the exocytosis phase, and the subsequent decrease in fluorescence indicates the endocytosis phase of the vesicle cycle. The kinetics of exocytosis is determined by examining the time course of an upsurge in fluorescence upon stimulation in the presence of bafilomycin A, an inhibitor of the vATPase 80 , which inhibits neurotransmitter loading but not vesicle recycling 81, 82 . In our experiments, 12-14 DIV neurons were field-stimulated in the presence of APV (50 \u00b5M) and DNQX (10 \u00b5M), in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A (Fig. 6a-c) . After stimulation, the bath was perfused with saline in which 50 mM NaCl was replaced with NH 4 Cl. Ammonium ions are in equilibrium with aqueous ammonia, which is membrane-permeable and can diffuse into SVs to neutralize their lumen. Therefore, the combination of sypHy and NH 4 Cl reveals intact SVs within the terminals, and the size of the total SVs pool is measurable. The recycling vesicle pool (RcP) size is estimated by measuring the plateau of fluorescence intensity obtained during exhaustive stimulation (Fig. 6c) , while the resting pool is that which completes the RcP to the total pool 26 . The baseline fluorescence intensity of sypHy (F0) in each synapse of interest was the average value measured in five successive images acquired before stimulation. The change in fluorescence (\u0394F) at time t was calculated as F(t)\u2212F0. Values for each synapse were normalized by the maximal fluorescence intensity (Fmax) measured after the treatment with NH 4 Cl (\u0394F/Fmax).",
