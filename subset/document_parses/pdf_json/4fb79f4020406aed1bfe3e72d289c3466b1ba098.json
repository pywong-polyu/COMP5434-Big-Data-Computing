A search query (Table 1 ) was used to identify publications in PubMed/MEDLINE about covid-19 or the virus causing the disease (sars-cov-2). The query has been elaborated by the university library at Karolinska Institutet and was conducted 26 January 2022. I refer to the set of publications retrieved by this search query as covid-19 publications. Citations were calculated using in-house version of the Web of Science (WoS) at Karolinska Institutet, containing data from the Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index and Arts & Humanities Citation Index. 1 The analyses are restricted to the intersection between Web of Science and PubMed if not otherwise stated. Furthermore, a restriction was made to the Web of Science publication types \"article\" and \"review\" and to publications from 2020 and 2021. The search resulted in 31,789 publications in 2020 and 74,064 in 2021, an increase of about 133%. Figure 1 shows the number of publications in 2021 at the primary y-axis for the covid-19 set as well as the 20 largest Web of Science journal categories in medicine (without restriction to PubMed publications). The secondary axis shows the number of citations from 2021 to 2020. It is shown that covid-19 publications cite more publications from 2020 than any of the journal categories, despite being less than half the size of the largest category (\"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary\"). This shows that covid-19 publications cite recent publications in a much higher extent than other medical publications. The average number of outgoing citations from covid-19 publications in 2021 is relativly low, about 30 ( Figure 2 ). However, as much as 37% of these citations goes to the previous year. This figure varies between 5-15% in medical journal categories. It is clear from figure 1 and 2 that covid-19 publications cited recent papers to a much higher extent than expected in the beginning of the pandemic. ",

This figure looks approximately the same as the figure for 2019. A small increase from 2019 and 2020 of the number of publications with more than 200 citations after a twoyear period can be seen, when covid-19 publications are excluded. In Figure 5 the covid-19 publications have been added (yellow marks). The number of publications with more than 200 citations has now increased to almost 1,000.

For a publication, this indicator is usually calculated by dividing the number of citations to the publication by the average number of citations in the same field, from the same publication year and commonly also of the same publication type. The Web of science journal categories are commonly used as fields in this calculation. If we again take \"Medicine, General & Internal\" as an example, we see that the value of the denominator in this field (the field reference value) is more than doubled by the covid-19 publications. To illustrate the effect on the field normalized citation score, we can for example consider a cancer publication having no relation to covid-19 and which has received 14 citations after a two-year period. This publication would have a field normalized citation score of 4 if covid-publications are excluded. However, the covid-19 publications reduce the normalized citation rate of such publication to about 1.8. Even in some fields with a low proportion of covid-19 publications the average citation rate is heavily affected by the high citation rates of covid-19 publications. In for example \"Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems\" with only about 3.9% covid-19 publications (Table 1) the average citation rate is about 24% higher when covid-19 publications are considered (5.6 compared to 4.5).

Now assume that this unit keeps publishing non-covid publications in 2020 with the same average citation rate as the earlier publications. Its field normalized citation score will now drop from 1 to 0.71 because of the change of the field reference value caused by the covid-19 publications. Now consider that this unit publishes equal parts in the three largest journals for pediatrics (\"JAMA pediatrics\", \"Pediatrics\" and \"The Journal of pediatrics\"). The unit would then have an increase of their estimated JIF with about 54% (the average increase in JIF in the three journals), also because of the high citation rate of covid-19 publications.

Moreover, the field normalized citation score is an average-based indicator. Percentile-based indicators may be less affected (Bornmann et al., 2013) . Furthermore, I have focused on one journal indicator only, namely the journal impact factor. I expected the JIF to be affected by the rapid growth of covid-19 publications because the indicator is based on citations from one publication year only.

There is a considerable risk to draw misleading conclusions from citation indicators spanning over the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, in particular when time series are used and when the biomedical literature is assessed. The study supports the concern that there is a risk of overemphasizing on covid-19 related research at the expense of other research areas, not the least since citation indicators influence research policy.",
