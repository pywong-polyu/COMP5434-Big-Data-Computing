LITERATURE REVIEW 19 Global pandemics, dating back to the Black Death (occurred in Asia and Europe in the 14th 20 century) and the more recent example of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 21 2003, can significantly increase the mortality rate over large geographic areas that can cause drastic 22 social, economic, and political disruption (Madhav et al., 2017) . The World Health Organization (WHO) 23 has designed specific standards that compel its member states to prepare, detect, report on, and respond to 24 compact such infectious diseases after the SARS pandemic (Katz, 2009). Such standards potentially 25 enable the WHO to lead a more coordinated effort to combat global pandemics which it successfully did 26 in combating a 2009 influenza outbreak. 27 It has long been established that travel plays a significant role in the spread of infectious diseases. 28 Cliff Bogoch (2018) also warned that the increasing ease and affordability of air travel plays a critical role in 33 spreading many infectious diseases as air travel contributed significantly to the SARS pandemic in 2003. 34 Hence, one of the most common practices to slow down the spread of contagious disease is to limit entry 35",

Two criteria are used to evaluate the forecasting power of each model: (i) mean 37 absolute percentage error (MAPE) and (ii) the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). MAPE is one of the 38 most common measures to quantify forecast error. RMSD is calculated as the square root of the second 39 sample moment of the differences between predicted values and observed values or the quadratic mean of 40 these differences (Zwillinger, 2002) . A model's forecasting results with a lower MAPE and/or RMSD 41 suggest that the model has a higher forecasting power compared to those with a higher one. Table 7  42 shows that the 11-day exposure-to-confirm temporal delay model has the highest predicting power with 43 the lowest RMSD and the second-lowest MAPE.

The exposure-to-confirm temporal delay between the time-varying travel-related 39 factors, social distancing measures, and their impacts on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are to 14 days of temporal delay. These various temporal delays are used to capture the temporal delays from 1 exposure (which connects to travel-related factors) to confirmed infection. For example, with n day of 2 temporal delay, the independent variable values are from the day i, and the dependent variable value (i.e.,",

(2020). SDI is removed because of its high 12 correlation with other variables and multicollinearity. Additional studies are needed to compare these two 13 variables in other counties and other regions. Additional studies are needed to use the proposed CAS 14 method to compare CAS and other methods, such as SDI and Community Social Risk Estimator. 15 The model estimation results also show that the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases increase as the 16 number of trips increases, while the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases decrease when the walking 17 frequency increases. It shows that the increased trip frequency contributes to increased COVID-19 cases 18 after the economy opens up. The increased walking can potentially reduce COVID-19 case because 19 COVID-19 is less likely to spread in an outdoor environment while walking (Feng et al., 2020; Morawska 20 et al., 2020), and the increased exercises through walking may benefit people as shown in Feng et al. 21 (2020) that people with more physical exercises have a lower risk of contracting COVID-19. It is also 22 important to note that trip frequency and walking frequency are from different data sources. Trip 23 frequency is based on mobile phone location information that shows a person moves away from home and 24 stays at a different location for at least 10 minutes. The walking frequency is based on Apple Maps 25 information that captures the number of route requests by walking. The walking frequency may only 26 represent a person's desire to travel to a different by walking. Additional studies are needed to validate 27the relationship between route requests and trips made by walking.28The model estimation results also show that the increasing visits to locations such as parks and 29beaches contribute negatively to the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. Numerous studies suggest that the30 decreased physical activities during quarantine and the closure of gyms contribute to the increased risk of 31 COVID-19. It is crucial to maintain a certain level of physical activity level during the pandemic 32 (Hammami et al., 2020; Mattioli et al., 2020). The increasing visits to parks and beaches suggest that the 33 recovery of physical activity level to the pre-pandemic baseline can potentially lower the risk of COVID-34 19 and the risk of contracting COVID-19 is also low in an outdoor environment. However, Honolulu 35 County closed most parks and beaches after the surge of COVID-19 cases since July, and this may 36 contribute positively to the increasing COVID-19 cases in Honolulu county. 37 Regarding the policy implications, the modeling results show that both mandatory face-covering 38 policy and mandatory work-from-home policy contribute positively toward reducing COVID-19 infection 39 in Honolulu County. These results highlight the importance of using various social distancing measures to 40 reduce COVID-19 spread. For example, the likelihood of infection can be reduced if face-covering is 41 required, even if the travel behavior remains the same.42",
