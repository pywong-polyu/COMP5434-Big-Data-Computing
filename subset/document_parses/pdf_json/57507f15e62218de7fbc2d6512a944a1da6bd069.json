            "text": "Background: COVID-19 pandemic has remained one of the leading causes of death which claimed the lives of many well-trained and experienced healthcare professionals. Vaccination is the most effective way of controlling infectious diseases, while success is challenged by individuals and groups who choose to delay or refuse vaccines. The objective of the present study was to assess the intention of healthcare workers in Eastern Ethiopia to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional survey research design was used to collect quantitative data from a representative sample of healthcare workers in Dire Dawa, Haramaya, and Harar towns of Eastern Ethiopia. The correctly filled questionnaires were selected and entered into SPSS software for further analysis, where frequency tables, percentages, mean, and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used in the process. Results: The findings revealed that most (61.6%) of the research participants are willing to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine, and 10.3% reported that they have not decided yet. Moreover, the main reason for respondents' lack of intention to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine is the belief that the first round of COVID-19 vaccine is sufficient to prevent infection (27.8%) followed by concern over the safety or side effects of the vaccine (26.6%). Above all, the healthcare workers' intention of taking the second round of COVID-19 vaccine is significantly associated to having children (OR=0.362, P<0.05; 95% CI: 3.279-5465.189), previous interaction with someone infected by COVID-19 (OR=1.480, P<0.05; 95% CI: 3.949-0.055), the perception that COVID-19 causes a severe illness (OR=0.018, P<0.05, 95% CI: 13.489-196.391), and experience of receiving the first round of COVID-19 vaccine (OR=50431.104, P<0.01; 95% CI: 408.789-626.00).",

Nevertheless, the findings have also made it clear that there are still issues to be addressed as far as both willingness to receive the second round of the vaccine and experience of taking the first round of the vaccine are concerned.

            "text": "Reports indicate that healthcare workers across the world are facing an increasing threat as a result of confronting severe and contagious diseases, including COVID-19. 1,2 Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has remained one of the leading causes of death which claimed the lives of many well-trained and experienced healthcare professionals, especially in Europe. 3 Many healthcare workers have died after contracting the virus while treating the patients infected by COVID-19. 4 The loss of such trained manpower has enormous economic and social consequences, 5,6 the impact of which increases especially in developing countries such as Ethiopia where the cost of training medical personnel is relatively high. Some of the determinants of risk of disease transmission to the healthcare workers include working in close proximity to a patient, risks associated to the hospital environment, the lack of consistency with safety instructions and the frequently changing directives, the attitudes and actions of the management and the perceived importance of occupational health and safety, the absence of evidence-based and practical infection control policies, and the lack of communication about safety within healthcare organizations. 7 Vaccine hesitancy is believed to be responsible for decreasing vaccine coverage and an increasing risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks and epidemics. 8 Previous researches are full of findings that show a mix of both high and low acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination among the healthcare workers in various parts of the world. For instance, a study conducted in Democratic Republic of Congo 9 and Saudi Arabia 10 found low acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers. Moreover, Kukreti et al 11 found that Taiwan's healthcare workers' and outpatients' willingness to receive vaccination was low for both healthcare workers (23.4%) and the outpatient sample (30.7%) due to the relatively safe status of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan, where risk perception, willingness to take rapid test, and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors were significant factors explaining the healthcare workers' willingness to receive vaccination. Paudel et al 12 found that only one-third (38.3%) of healthcare workers in Nepal are willing to be vaccinated for COVID-19. On the other hand, a study conducted among the clinical staffs of Yale Medicine and Yale New Haven Health by Roy et al 13 revealed that 85% of healthcare workers were extremely likely or somewhat likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, Alvarado-Socarras et al 14 found that between 77.0% and 90.7% of physicians in Colombia accept COVID-19 vaccination. According to a study undertaken by Vignier et al 15 in French Guiana, 65.6% of respondents reported that they were willing or had already been vaccinated against COVID-19, while 24 .3% of respondents reported that they did not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and 11.2% were unsure.",

Therefore, the target populations of the present research were all people in Eastern Ethiopia that had taken the first round of COVID-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, it was only the healthcare workers and a few elderly having chronic illnesses that had got the chance to be vaccinated, given the lesser amount of vaccines that the government could supply. With the poor client's basic information archival experiences of healthcare facilities in the study area, tracing the addresses of the other groups who have taken the vaccine (the elderly with chronic illnesses) was hardly possible for the researchers. Consequently, the survey populations of the present study are all healthcare workers in Eastern Ethiopia that have taken the first round of COVID-19 vaccine.

Next, a pilot test was undertaken to prove compatibility of the questionnaire on a 5% sample of respondents having similar characteristics with the actual survey population. On the basis of feedbacks and comments obtained from the baseline survey, slight improvements were made to the instrument of data collection. The same questionnaire, having similar items, was duplicated according to the already determined sample size after consideration of a 5% addition of questionnaire copies to substitute potential losses before distribution. Finally, the actual data collection activity was held in June 2021 under the supervision of the principal investigator. During data gathering, data collectors have been clearly instructing respondents about how to fill the questionnaire. A close follow-up was made by both data collectors and supervisors. Respondents were told to freely raise any question that is unclear to them.

The multinomial logistic regression test was used to examine the association between the socio-demographic characteristics of respondents and their intention to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine. Table 1 show the frequency and percentage distribution of respondents' socio-demographic characteristics. The mean age of respondents is 31.97 (SD=8.0), and females constitute the majority (60.8%) of the research participants; 55.6% of respondents are married, while the widowed hold the least (3%) share in the distribution. Moreover, 53.4% of the survey participants reported to have children. The educational status of the respondents reveal that most (53%) of them are BA/BSc degree holders, followed by college diploma holders (26.7%). Furthermore, nurses constituted 39.7% of the occupational group, followed by other categories of healthcare professionals (22.3%). In addition, 75.4% of respondents currently work in the public healthcare organizations, and 21.1% of them belong to the private healthcare facilities. Above all, 80.6% of research participants disclosed that they know someone who has been infected by COVID-19, and 73.7% know someone who died from COVID-19. The data also show that 59.1% of respondents think that they can be infected by COVID-19, while 87.9% of them believe that COVID-19 causes a severe illness. It is also revealed that 50.4% of the research participants perceive that they are not likely to die if infected by COVID-19.",

Nevertheless, the findings have also made it clear that there are still issues to be addressed as far as both willingness to receive the second round of the vaccine and experience of taking the first round of the vaccine is concerned. With the government's very limited capacity of satisfying the vaccination demands of the population, the few doses obtained through international aid have been allocated to the healthcare workers, given their risky professional engagements. When that is done, it was with expectation that they will have all the required awareness about the vaccine and hence will be willing to receive it. The results of the present study, however, made it clear that healthcare workers hold negative attitude towards the vaccine, and more than one-third of them not only did not receive the first round of the vaccine but also do not have the intention to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, we have also found that some of the healthcare professionals believe that the first round of the COVID-19 vaccine is sufficient to prevent infection, while there are others that are still concerned about the safety or side effects of the vaccine. It is, therefore, important that sufficient training should be given to the healthcare workers in the area in order to raise their level of awareness and enhance their willingness to receive the second round of the vaccine.",
