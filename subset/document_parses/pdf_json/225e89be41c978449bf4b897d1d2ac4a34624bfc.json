A five category e-phenotype model based on ICD-10 coding was developed from prior published work. Ongoing work is refining this via machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. Portable NLP tools, focused at the sentence level, were also developed to identify uncoded opioid overdose related concepts in provider notes. Optimal performance was seen in NLP tools that combined rule-based with deep learning methods (F score, 0.94). A template for ED overdose documentation was developed to improve primary data capture. Interactive prompts to physicians inside ED progress notes were effective in promoting use of the template. The template had good system usability and net promoter scores (0.72 and 0.75, respectively, n=13). Work to design ED trials based on the network's data is underway.",

Opioid misuse and dependence continue to be a significant and growing cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States [1] . Over the last 10 years, the number of individuals presenting to emergency departments (EDs) as a result of intentional or unintentional opioid-related overdose(OD) has dramatically increased [2] [3] . Many of these individuals die or have a repeat OD presentation within a year [4] [5] and public health costs associated with opioid-related OD are high [2] [6] [7] . The defining features of the opioid epidemic have changed over time. While prescription opioid misuse was initially a major contributing problem, increasingly the use of high potency non-prescription drugs, such as fentanyl, heroin, and illicit fentanyl have been the cause of opioid-related ED presentations and mortality [3] [8] . Recent data suggest that a growing proportion of opioid-dependent individuals are initiating use with heroin (or illicit synthetic opioids), rather than prescribed opioids [9] [10], contributing to public health experts' beliefs that opioid-related OD may continue to increase over the next 1-5 years [9] [10] .",

ACT is a network supported by The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) that includes approximately 60 Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA)-funded sites. It has a standardized clinical data model. Through use of Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) software [14] , it has the unique capability of providing counts of patients meeting specific criteria, in real time, across the network. Our work predates efforts also discussed below on adapting CTSA data networks to COVID-19 research as part of NCATS National COVID Cohort Collaborator (N3C [15] ) but also illustrates how this new investment might be broadened to address other national priorities for research.",

These tools, designed in the context of cross institution collaboration, allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with OOD including: demographics, comorbidities, OOD agent and concepts that are often incompletely represented in ED notes such as source of the opioid, intentionality of OOD, and ED treatment and discharge disposition.

We believed many key features of extant cases of OOD would be \"locked\" in notes of providers caring for patients in the ED. Examples of data that might only be recorded in provider notes include level of consciousness on admission, use of opioids in the field by paramedics, type of opioid suspected in the OD, and intentionality of the OD. We envisioned two types of information that might be abstracted from a note for OD case identification: 1) mention of OOD; and 2) documented response to OOD treatment (\"Narcan\" or \"naloxone\"). Other attributes about the case may or may not be stated in a note, but be critical to understanding context, and potentially be inferred from the note using ML and/or artificial intelligence (AI) methods. A critical detail might be inference of the intentionality of the OD. Was this a patient with chronic pain who accidentally used too much medication, an individual with OUD who unanticipatedly took a more concentrated aliquot of drug in a recreational context, or was this a suicide attempt? While such inferences might be highly precise, they may provide valuable information for trial planning and clinical intervention development.

Modifiers such as OD for opioid, response to Narcan, subject, condition, hypothesis, or intentionality were detected for two primary entities (opioid and Narcan). Inference rules were applied to further eliminate false positives, including situations such as the subject is not the OD patient, an OD event did not happen (e.g., condition, hypothesis), or a negation (e.g., \"no,\" \"deny').

These sentences were manually annotated by reviewers as to either containing (\"True\" sentences) or not containing (\"False\" sentences) targeted opioid-related OD content and were then partitioned into three datasets: training (1,213), development (150), and test (150) with equally distributed \"True\" and \"False\" cases.

Prior to implementation of the reminder, there were zero clinical uses of the OST. There were 43 recorded uses of the OST by 26 different users during the test period. As shown in Table 3 , the OST reminder triggered in roughly 21% of cases categorized as high probability (n=81) for OOD during the test period at MUSC Charleston. The MUSC hospital system had recently acquired four regional hospitals, and we were surprised to see that ED providers at the newly acquired regional hospitals were also using the OST, despite not having received any training. In a subset of cases seen in these facilities (n=130), the rate of template use in high probability cases was 14% (Table 3 ).",

Thus, it also provides an opportunity to improve the quality of care for OOD as well as documentation. However, triggering insertion of the template requires \"real time\" data such as the chief complaint, which may not always be present. Additionally, its use requires changing clinician documentation behavior, which is a difficult task.
