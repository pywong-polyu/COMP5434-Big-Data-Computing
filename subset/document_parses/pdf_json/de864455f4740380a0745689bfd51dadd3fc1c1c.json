Among them, patients with cancer of the upper and lower airways share other risk factors, mostly related to tobacco-smoke exposure, including male gender, airway epithelial damages, chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Clinical and pathophysiological factors shared by these conditions are reviewed. Methods Review of the published literature since the beginning of 2020. Results COVID-19 is a respiratory infectious disease and SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding occurs in nasal and bronchial epithelial respiratory cells through the interaction with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, both overexpressed in smokers and former smokers. Tobacco-smoke airway exposure is also characterized by a chronic inflammation with activation of inflammatory cells and cytokine release including interleukin-6 (IL-6). A high release of cytokine in response to viral infection is documented in COVID-19 patients with adverse clinical outcomes and IL-6 is a key element of the cytokine storm syndrome leading to multi-organ damage. Conclusions Patients with cancers of the upper and lower airways might be at increased risk of infection, morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 also because of tobacco exposure, a key factor in triggering inflammation, immunity and cancer.",

[11] showed higher viral loads after symptom onset, higher in the nose than in the throat, but SARS-CoV-2 has been also detected in lower respiratory tract samples [12] . In fact, although the nasal goblet and ciliated cells represent the main site of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, both required for SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cancer cells [13] , a recent study by Lukassen et al. [14] confirm that SARS-CoV-2 receptors are expressed also in bronchial secretory epithelial cells. Interestingly, a significant higher ACE2 expression has recently documented in bronchial epithelium from former and current smokers when compared with non-smokers [15] . Indeed, the goblet secretory nasal epithelial cells over-express ACE2 receptor, thus suggesting that the upper airway is the main initial target of SARS-CoV-2 involved in infection and transmission of the disease [16] .",

The high release of cytokines by the immune system in response to virus infection and/or secondary infections resulting in cytokine storm syndrome is responsible for uncontrolled systemic inflammation with multi-organ damage leading to organ failure, especially cardiac, hepatic and renal system and frequently to death [18] . Accordingly, many fatal cases of COVID-19 infection resulted in a high release of inflammatory cytokines, mainly of IL-6, and the latter is significantly elevated in patients with severe clinical course [19] . A recent meta-analysis of mean serum IL-6 concentrations reported 2.9-fold higher levels in patients with complicated COVID-19 infection when compared with patients without complications. For this reason, an humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6 receptor, with the ultimate aim to block downstream pro-inflammatory effects of IL-6, named Tocilizumab, that was already approved by FDA for immune-mediated rheumatic disease, has been used in high-risk patients appearing efficacious and safe in preliminary investigations [19] .",

At variance, IL-6 can also be released by various cells in the tumor microenvironment including the cancerous and stromal cells [20, 21] . Increased levels in serum and cancer tissue of IL-6 have been related to poor prognosis and lower survival rates in several human cancers (such as breast, renal, gastric, prostate, leukemia) [21] [22] [23] , while down-regulation of IL-6 might be related to a better response to treatment representing a potential target for anticancer therapy [22] . IL-6 can also act on cancer cells in autocrine manner as a growth factor [24] and in paracrine fashion activating inflammatory surrounding cells [20, 21] . Furthermore, the pro-inflammatory IL-6 controls suppression of apoptosis by deleting the genes involved in cell cycle, inducing phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1 transcription factors [25] .",

Among them, four (22.3%) had lung cancers, while no one was affected by HNC. At variance, in a paper by Zhang et al.

            "text": "How SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect non-functional upper airway is intriguing. Total laryngectomy, by excluding nasal breathing, inevitably results in a loss (or at least a serious decrease) of the sense of smell and taste. In fact, only a minority of laryngectomized patients maintain at least in part olfactory function, allowing odorant molecules to reach and stimulate olfactory mucosa through the nose or nasopharynx [40] . However, the mechanism(s) by which odorant molecules reach olfactory mucosa is not completely understood.",

Two main hypotheses were formulated suggesting a retronasal or an anteronasal air flow in laryngectomized patients. The generation of a negative pressure (\"underpressure\") in the oral cavity by an extended yawning movement (\"polite yawning maneuver\") [40] generates an airflow through the nose, thus potentially stimulating the olfaction in a physiologic manner. Because of a correlation between the quality of the esophageal voice and olfaction acuity of the laryngectomized patients, (probably as a result of the better control of oropharyngeal musculature in good esophageal speakers, enabling them to pump air into the nasal cavity), a retronasal airflow has been postulated. Conversely, others suggest an anteronasal flow of the air as a consequence of the oropharyngeal movements improved by polite yawning maneuver [40, 41] . Therefore, it is likely that also in COVID-19 laryngectomized patients, the virus can reach the anatomically excluded upper airway from the trapped air into the oral cavity or alternatively from the infected tracheobronchial secretions, aerosolized during coughing or talking using esophageal voice with and without prosthesis [42] (Fig. 1 ).",

The study reveals the highest ACE2 expression in the nose with decreasing expression throughout the lower respiratory tract, paralleled a striking gradient of SARS-CoV2 infection from the nose to the lung (Fig. 1) . Accordingly, the haematogenous spread of the virus has been clearly documented by systemic endotheliitis with multiorgan failure described in severe COVID-19 infection [44] as well as in COVID-19 patients with severe neurological complications [45] .",

From experimental evidence, the nasal mucosa appears to be both a target and a key factor in the regulation of the in vivo immune response which seems to be mainly driven by IFNalpha stimulated pathway.

Together, a cross-talk between upper and lower airways seems to be the key factor in the transmission of infection from the early site of virus replication to the lungs and this transmission seems to be regulated by activation of innate immunity by NALT with a modulation of the immune response at lower respiratory tract [46, 52, 53] .",

Host immune response is crucial to fight viral infections including SARSCoV-2, however, if COVID-19 activates an aggressive inflammatory response, this can result in damage of lungs and other tissues. In severe cases, the uncontrolled inflammation can produce a vast release of inflammatory cytokines, responsible for the multi-organ damage and related organ failure [18] . Despite an altered host immune reactivity is frequently reported in cancer population, the increased IL-6 production by inflammatory and airway epithelial cells of smokers might be actively involved in the pathogenesis of such an aggressive immune response. Thus, the tobacco-induced chronic inflammation can damage epithelial airway cells inducing ACE2 overexpression with an increased IL-6 release and a reduced production of IFN responsible for host defense response against viruses [51] . The high circulating level of IL-6 released in COVID-19-infected patients with smoking-related cancers might indicate an host immune inbalance, resulting in an exaggerated immune response and hyperinflammation with a cytokine storm syndrome and severe evolution. Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that the airway damage by heavy tobacco-smoke exposure acts both in transforming epithelial cells and generating a heavy chronic inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract with an host inflammatory response characterized by a high release of cytokines, mainly IL-6, thus exposing active and former smokers to cancer of the airways as well as to SARS-CoV-2 severe infection.",
