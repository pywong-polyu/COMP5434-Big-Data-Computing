The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 restrictions on mental well-being, working life, family life and social life among Faroese employees within a broad range of professions. A total of 1328 Faroese employees answered an anonymous selfreport survey from 13 April to 4 May 2020. Employee mental well-being was only modestly affected by the restrictions and the respondents had a mean score of 50.7 on the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale where a score between 41-44 is found to correspond with possible depression. Work commitment, work and family life, work satisfaction and work ability were all rated significantly worse after the COVID-19 outbreak than before (all p values < 0.005). Contrary to previous research, employees in health services assessed their work ability significantly higher than employees in teaching, and child and youth care (p < 0.05). Working parents had higher levels of stress and assessed their work ability significantly lower than employees without children (p < 0.05), and women tended to be more worried than men because of the pandemic. In conclusion, the overall mental well-being of Faroese employees was on an average level during lock-down in April and May 2020. Their working life seemed, however, to be worse than usual.",

The essential functions such as grocery stores, the acute functions in the hospital system, care homes for elderly and disabled people and child care for employees in the essential functions were to stay open, whereas the non-essential functions such as beauty parlors, child care for non-essential staff and schools were to close their services or let their employees solve their tasks remotely. These sudden changes have made the topic of employee well-being more critical and may pose different challenges for different groups of employees. For employees in the essential functions, the infection risk might lead to mental health concerns, stress and anxiety [2, 3] , while employees working remotely are at risk for experiencing loneliness and isolation, which has been associated with depression, suicidal behavior and other mental difficulties [4] . One study found perceived stress among individuals working from home to increase during COVID-19 [5] . tourism), and other workplaces rearranged their activities, e.g., by dividing employees in groups and limiting interaction between groups of colleagues. Social distancing was recommended, and people were encouraged to avoid social gatherings. After the first case, other cases followed quickly causing a spike in March, another spike in August, and yet another spike in December 2020. The government s approach has from the beginning been large scale testing, contact tracing and isolation combined with social distancing. Testing is still mandatory for visitors to the country [24, 25] . At the time of writing, the Faroes have recorded 661 cases of COVID- 19 and there has been one fatality from COVID-19 in the Faroe Islands [25] .",

In addition, sociodemographic data were collected in the survey including age, sex, marital status, family situation, education and employment status, rating of overall health and possible mental health issues. The questionnaire was tailored by the authors to address the research questions.

A score in the range 41-44 has been found to correspond with possible depression [30] , so the respondents mean score on the WEMWBS is well above the level of depression. The results also showed that 21.8% of the respondents scored below 44, meaning that quite a large proportion of employees reported a mental well-being corresponding with depression in comparison with, e.g., the prevalence of depression in Denmark, which is around 3-4% [35] . It is worth noting, though, that the WEMWBS is not a screening tool for depression and thus not a reliable measure of prevalence. In our study, perceived stress was associated with poor mental health, which makes sense considering the interrelatedness of these constructs: high levels of stress typically have an adverse effect on the overall mental well-being and vice versa. A university degree also predicted poor mental well-being in our study, which is similar to results from a recent Spanish study that found a relationship between higher education and higher levels of depression [14] . In other studies, higher socioeconomic status has been associated with better mental well-being and health in general [36, 37] . We propose two ways of interpreting this result. First, Faroese employees with a university degree are more likely to have demanding jobs, such as leading workplaces and/or teams. This task was especially challenging during lock-down and thus might have affected these employees mental well-being negatively. Second, the result can be interpreted in light of selection bias, because of the homogeneity of the sample. As Table 1 illustrates, the sample consisted mainly of well-educated women in their mid-thirties, which can influence the generalizability of the results. Job satisfaction and better work ability also predicted a better mental well-being.",

In fact, employees in health care had a significantly better mental well-being than employees in the category other branches. Employees in health care also assessed their work ability significantly higher than employees in teaching, child/youth care and in other branches. These results are inconsistent with previous research that found a high prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health difficulties among especially health care workers [9] [10] [11] . Our results could be explained by the nature of the changes caused by the restrictions for the different professions. Although health care professionals experienced changes in the organization of their work (e.g., working in smaller teams, longer shifts), they still maintained their core tasks, whereas teachers and professionals within teaching and child/youth care had to solve their core tasks in a different way than before, e.g., by teaching online or taking care of small children without too close physical contact. Besides suddenly finding new ways to solve the core task, the relationship between teacher and student/child, which is also a fundamental part of the core task, is compromised. The low rating of work ability could be understood in the light of these changes. Within the health care system, all non-acute treatments such as operations and outpatient treatments were postponed, and the number of COVID-19 related admissions turned out to be much lower than anticipated, which overall lessened the workload for the employees in the health care system. In fact, during the first wave, only eight patients were admitted to hospital, and no intensive care unit admissions or fatalities occurred [38] . The world-wide public support and celebration of front-line workers, especially nurses, doctors and first responders, is also likely to affect the mental well-being of health care workers.

            "text": "Employees experienced more positive consequences of the COVID-19 restrictions in their family life compared to their working life. Lock-down of schools and workplaces meant more time at home with family, and some employees seemed to make the most of that time by doing activities, that are more driven by pleasure than by duty and activities that have a positive effect on mental well-being. The most widely used coping mechanisms among the Faroese employees were, e.g., maintaining a normal everyday life, paying attention to the news, maintaining regular contact with family and friends; mechanisms that are in line with advice from WHO on how to cope with stress during COVID-19 [40] . The respondents more often used healthy coping mechanisms instead of less healthy coping mechanisms such as using smoking or alcohol to deal with the situation. These activities correspond with programs promoting mental health such as the 'ABC for mental health', where the three components of positive mental health are being active, feeling connected to other people and doing something meaningful [41] . The positive consequences or positive coping mechanisms might have served as protective factors, preventing mental well-being from deteriorating, explaining parts of the main result which was that the respondents reported an average level of mental health. Although family can be considered a protective factor to prevent mental health from deteriorating, our study also suggested that employees with children under the age of 18 tended to experience more stress and a lower work ability during COVID-19. This result is somewhat consistent with the study of Pesce and Sanna who found that having young children at home was significantly associated with mood-worsening during lock-down [19] . Balancing work and family simultaneously with home-schooling and remote working was difficult and affected the ability to perform the work-related tasks. We found that more women than men had worries because of COVID-19, which is consistent with some of the previous research [19, 21, 42] . The level of worrying might be understood as a reflection of the fact that the lock-down period put an extra strain on especially women. The International Labour Organization estimates that women, under normal circumstances, perform a daily average of 4 h and 25 min of unpaid care work against 1 h and 23 min for men [43] . The changes caused by COVID-19, increasing the daily time spent in unpaid work for women, is likely to be one factor contributing to the extra worrying for women in this survey.",

            "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, the Faroe Islands have managed to quickly gain control of three major peaks in number of infected cases since March 2020, which can be explained in several different ways. One of the measures used has been regular information from the authorities using press conferences and updated information on the official website, bringing forth an awareness among the Faroese people to change their behavior without using laws and legislation. The awareness and perception of risk has most likely contributed to behavior that minimized the spread of the virus [44] . Risk perception has in previous research been associated with the adoption of preventative health behaviors such as social distancing [45] . Another regulation of behavior comes from social control, i.e., how the surrounding society regulates our behavior [46] . In small, close knit societies, this mechanism tends to be more active, and might serve as an extra regulation to ensure that people are keeping the COVID-19 recommendations from the authorities, partly in fear of possible social consequences. A concern among the employees in this survey was the fear of being the disease carrier in the workplace and possibly infecting vulnerable people, e.g., in nursing homes. The fear of being stigmatized as a disease carrier or as infected has from other infectious diseases proven to be an important issue with implications for mental health, and the fear of stigmatization is thus an incentive to behavioral change [47, 48] .",

It thus broadens the perspective concerning the effect of COVID-19 on employees. This study also has some limitations that should be taken into consideration. First, the cross-sectional research design prevents us from including the effect of time and, e.g., drawing conclusions on causal relationships. Second, this study was an online study, shared primarily through social media. This may have caused selection bias, attracting those who are active on social media and with a much higher representation of women, especially well-educated women within health care, teaching and child/youth care. This bias could affect the results, seeing that higher socio-economic status, including higher income and educational attainment, previously has been associated with preventative health behaviors [37] . The results may, therefore, not be representative for the entire population, and thus limit the generalizability.",

Although the average mental well-being was above clinical range, a proportion of 21.8% reported a mental well-being that corresponds with depression, which is a large part compared to prevalence studies. High levels of stress predicted a poor mental well-being while high levels of job satisfaction and work ability predicted a better mental well-being.",

The results from our survey highlight the importance of addressing mental health and working environment in a pandemic such as COVID-19 which may have far-reaching implications on people s daily life. Some employees highlighted the positive effects of lock-down, e.g., spending more time with family, while others reported negative effects during lock-down. Working parents might be especially receptive of the negative effects because of the shift in domestic care obligations and the increased burden of unpaid work during COVID-19. Furthermore, short-term effects of adverse working environment, stress and worrying can have long-term implications for individual mental health and family functioning.",
