Despite being known as a serious public health issue, MetS does not have any straightforward, definitive treatment due to its multifaceted nature [8] . The most common clinical management of MetS is to reduce the risk factors; for example, maintaining low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and BP under a certain threshold, mitigating the risk of T2DM for those who belong to atrisk populations, and encouraging patients to adopt lifestyle changes including eating a healthy diet and doing regular exercise [8, 9] .",

            "text": "Researchers have conducted several studies to establish the relationship between Vit D and specific components of MetS. For example, some studies investigated the effects of Vit D on BP, triglycerides (TG), and glucose intolerance [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Some studies explore the association between Vit D and MetS as a whole [22, 23] . Some of the studies deployed randomized clinical trials (RCTs), whereas some relied on observational studies. The population recruited for these studies vary by sex, age, and country of origin [19, [23] [24] [25] . A few studies reported a non-significant association between Vit D and different components of MetS [24] [25] [26] . By organizing these disparate studies into one systematic review, we hope to highlight the commonalities and differences in these studies, providing a big-picture analysis and understanding of the correlation between Vit D and MetS that applies to the general adult population around the world. This systematic review aims to illustrate the relationship between Vit D level and different components of MetS and the effects of Vit D supplementation on components of MetS. Based on the findings in this systematic review, we hope to accomplish two goals in our future studies: first, to identify the threshold of Vit D levels that can be used as a risk indicator of MetS for specific demographics, and second, to identify the specific dosage of Vit D that can reduce the risk of CVD.",

The relationships between Vit D and each component of MetS, however, were not reported in detail. Although the study reported that low Vit D level is significantly associated with MetS, the overall Vit D levels in both case and control groups were lower than the normal range (20 to 40ng/mL).

The parameters of MetS in focus for this study were TG, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), lipid accumulation product (LAP), FBS, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), BMI, WC, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Contrary to the studies discussed above, no significant difference in Vit D level between the case and control groups was found. In particular, the researchers found no significant correlation between Vit D vs. Compared to other studies discussed before, this study has the largest participant population and was able to detect the significant association between Vit D and some components of MetS for specific gender and BMI levels.",

Insulin sensitivity and total trunk fat mass measured by X-ray absorptiometry were significantly improved with Vit D supplementation. Other components of MetS such as TG, HDL, LDL, and BMI were not significantly associated with Vit D supplementation. In a 2011 study by Mheid et al., researchers proved the effect of Vit D in suppressing the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle, which in turn affects BP by regulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system [43] . Two of the seven RCT-based papers we selected investigated the effects of Vit D supplementation in BP and arterial stiffness. An RCT by Raed et al. recruited 70 African American patients between 13 to 45 years of age who have a Vit D level < 20ng/mL [15] . The trial lasted 18 weeks, and carotidfemoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid-radial PWV were measured to check the participants' arterial stiffness. The researchers found that Vit D supplementation is significantly associated with a reduction of arterial wall stiffness. [24] . Like in the trial by Karefykalis et al., Vit D supplementation had no significant effect on the components of MetS studied, including the lipid profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), and CVD risks.",

The only two significant findings from this study were the inverse associations between Vit D vs. HDL and Vit D vs. LAP. Similar to the study by Krishnaswany et al., this study recruited hospital outpatients as participants. However, most of the components of MetS, except LAP and HDL, were not significantly associated with Vit D level. The contradictory findings from these two studies could be due to the difference in the inherent prevalence of VDD in Egypt vs. India and other compounding factors such as lifestyle differences between the two countries.A cross-sectional study byKhoja et al. investigated  the association between Vit D receptor (VDR) genes and MetS and the association of Vit D and each component of MetS[17]. Researchers focused on four variables of VDR gene polymorphism -namely ApaI (VDR 7975232 C > T), BsmI (VDR 1544410 A > G), FokI (VDR 2228570 C > T), and TaqI (VDR 731236 T > C) -and reported that MetS is significantly associated with ApaI gene polymorphism. In this study, 82 patients from Saudi Arabia between the age of 20 and 50 years were divided into MetS (case) and healthy (control) groups. The patients in the case group have three out of five NCEP-ATP III criteria. The researchers found that patients in the MetS group have significantly low Vit D levels than those in the control group. Among the six components of MetS, Vit D is significantly and inversely associated with each of the following factors: TG, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), BP, and WC. Unlike other studies discussed thus far, we should note that this study measured HbA1C instead of FBS for IR or glucose intolerance.An observational study by Kaminska et al. recruited 2381 Polish patients. Similar to the study byKrishnaswamy et al.,  patients for this MetS (case) group were selected using the JIS criteria[25]. The patients were subdivided into male and female. Researchers found a significant inverse relationship between Vit D level and SBP among the female population and no significant finding among the male population. Male and female participants were then further subdivided into two groups using a BMI threshold of 30. A significant association between Vit D vs. TG and Vit D vs. BP was found for BMI > 30. Similarly, for men with BMI > 30, there is a significant association between Vit D vs. HDL and between Vit D vs. BP. For men with BMI < 30, Vit D level is significantly associated with WC. Although only one of the MetS components, SBP, was significantly associated with Vit D for female participants, more significant associations were identified after further dividing the participants by BMI. Similar to the study byMirhoseini et al.,  this study found no significant association between Vit D and WC for men who are above the BMI threshold.",

The trial was 26 weeks long. The components of MetS studied in it were the percentage of body fat, BMI, maximum oxygen uptake (V02max), and oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (AT). V02max and oxygen uptake at AT were measured to investigate the strength of circulation and respiration. No significant changes in these components were detected when the participants were provided with Vit D supplementation.

The most notable limitation is that the studies focused on different components of MetS, making it difficult to carry out like-for-like comparisons. For example, Khoja et al. used HbA1C to measure insulin and glucose metabolism, whereas the study by Mirhoseini et al. used FBS. Similarly, Raed et al. used carotid-femoral PWV and carotid-radial PWV to measure the BP, while McMullan et al. used PRA, Ag II, and 24-hour BP as indicators.",
