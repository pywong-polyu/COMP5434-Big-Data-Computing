Here we report measurements of the size distribution, number, and volume concentration of exhaled particles from 31 healthy musicians playing 20 types of wind instruments using aerosol spectrometry and in-line holography in a strictly controlled cleanroom environment. We find that playing wind instruments carries a lower risk of airborne disease transmission than speaking or singing. We attribute this to the fact that the resonators of wind instruments act as filters for particles >10 \u00b5m in diameter. We have also measured the size-dependent filtering properties of different types of filters that can be used as instrument masks. Based on these measurements, we calculated the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in different near-and far-field scenarios with and without masking and/or distancing. We conclude that in all cases where there is a possibility that the musician is infectious, the only safe measure to prevent airborne transmission of the disease is the use of well-fitting and well-filtering masks for the instrument and the susceptible person.",

            "text": "Numerous contagious diseases are known to spread via exhaled infectious particles that are inhaled by a susceptible, e.g. influenza, tuberculosis, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and most recently the Coronavirus Disease 2019 , which is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Leung, 2021; Morawska and Cao, 2020; Nannu Shankar et al., 2022) . Currently, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is still considered a public health emergency of international concern (WHO Team, 2022). About 8% of the persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with no or very mild symptoms of COVID-19 (Alpha strain of SARS-CoV-2) had a very high viral load (more than 10 9 genome copies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus per swab), which promotes disease transmission by highly-infectious asymptomatic individuals if high viral load is associated with high infectivity (Jones et al., 2021) . It is well-known that various respiratory maneuvers, like speaking and singing produce particles (see e.g. Morawska et al., 2009; P\u00f6hlker et al., 2021; Bagheri et al., 2021a, and references therein) . However, the fact that wind instruments also release respiratory particles (see e.g. Lai et al., 2011; He et al., 2021; K\u00e4hler and Hain, 2020; Parker and Crookston, 2020; Spahn et al., 2021; Stockman et al., 2021; Abraham et al., 2021; McCarthy et al., 2021; Firle et al., 2021; Gantner et al., 2022) indicates that band or orchestra rehearsals or concerts are also associated with an enhanced risk of airborne infection transmission (hereafter called \"infection risk\"). Because of this potential risk, most forms of live music events were forbidden in most of 2020 in Germany and also other countries. Governmental rules forced opera houses and theatres to close, and instrument education / singing lessons could not take place as usual. This unfortunate situation is mainly due to the fact that much is unknown about the emitted amount of respiratory particles and effective measures to mitigate the risk of infection during live performances of singers and wind instrument players.",

            "text": "Among the particle emission from different respiratory activities, not much attention was given to wind instrument players prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was found that playing a very simple brass instrument such as a vuvuzela releases much more particles than a person who is shouting (Lai et al., 2011) . A study by He et al. (2021) has shown that many wind instruments release more particles during the play in comparison to normal breathing or speaking. Instruments in the low register (e.g. tuba, bassoon) typically had less particle emission compared to instruments in the high register (e.g. clarinet, trumpet). The selection of instruments examined by He et al. (2021) covers approximately two orders of magnitude in particle emission from the lowest (tuba) to the highest emitter (trumpet). For wind instruments with a simple geometry, increasing loudness was associated with increasing particle emission, but the net effect of loudness on the emitted particle concentration was low . Abraham et al. (2021) also examined the pitch dependence and found negative correlation between pitch and particle emission for instruments in the low register (in particular the bass trombone and the bassoon) while a positive correlation was found between pitch and particle emission for instruments in the high register (clarinet, oboe, trumpet). Short notes played on the trumpet led to more particles compared to long notes of the same pitch. However, it is still unknown which notes or playing styles on which instrument lead to the highest emission of particles. A study by McCarthy et al. (2021) came to the conclusion that the particle size distributions from breathing and from playing a wind instruments are similar, and that the mean particle emission is also comparable. Stockman et al. (2021) however measured higher particle number concentration compared to the data shown in He et al. (2021) for clarinets (2 times more), bassoon (4 times more), oboe (4 times more) and French horn (3 times more). The emitted particle number concentration from the trumpet measured by Stockman et al. (2021) was 3 times lower compared to He et al. (2021) . Emitted particle number concentration shown in Firle et al. (2021) is also higher for playing flute or oboe compared to speaking. In all of the studies mentioned above, and also in Brosseau et al. (2022) , the conclusion was drawn that the highest number density of emitted particles from wind instruments is <1 \u00b5m.",

            "text": "Furthermore, these studies (except for Firle et al., 2021) used an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) from TSI Inc. as the primary aerosol size spectrometer, which nominally measures the aerodynamic diameter of particles in a size range from 0.5 to 20 \u00b5m. However, it cannot detect smaller than 0.5 \u00b5m that may include a significant number of particles containing \u223c0.1 \u00b5m SARS-CoV-2 virions and, as pointed out in Bagheri et al. (2021a) and other studies (e.g. see P\u00f6hlker et al., 2021 , and references therein), APS suffers from low detection efficiency for larger 4 \u00b5m particles. Furthermore, it is extremely important to perform measurements in a certified cleanroom with controlled relative humidity and temperature. For a quantitative assessment of the infection risk, either the size distribution of the dry residues or the size distribution of the particles right after emission needs to be known as described in Nordsiek et al. (2021) since particles in any state in between exhalation and fully dried would introduce huge uncertainties in the infection risk calculation. The importance of controlled measurements becomes clear when one considers that the particle volume decreases by a factor of about 90 (almost two orders of magnitude) from exhalation to fully dry (Bagheri et al., 2021a) .",

            "text": "In terms of infection risk, the most frequently discussed scenario is a wellmixed room with accumulation of infectious particles. The well-mixed room is recently used by several investigations (e.g. Buonanno et al., 2020; Nordsiek et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2020; Jimenez, 2020; Bagheri et al., 2020; Firle et al., 2021; Kriegel et al., 2022) . Miller et al. (2020) as well as Kriegel et al. (2022) determined the emission rate of pathogen copies from retrospective analyses of superspreading events. This is an insightful simplification of the dose-response model, but it remains unclear which size fraction of emitted particles drives the release of pathogen copies into the room. To give a reasonable estimation on the efficacy of infection mitigation measures, the relationship between particle size and number concentration of pathogen copies needs to be known. The risk calculation done by Firle et al. (2021) was based on a constant conversion factor from pathogen copies to particle number concentration within a specified diameter range. Numerical simulations carried out by Stockman et al. (2021) have shown that the well-mixed room assumption is reasonable for indoor spaces of 18 m 2 area and 63 m 3 volume if the susceptible is not standing downwind of the infectious (i.e. the donor of pathogens) at close distance.",

Spahn et al. (2021) investigated the airflow from wind instruments (contrabassoon, bassoon, bass clarinet, English horn, tenor saxophone, clarinet, alto flute, oboe, recorder, piccolo, tuba, French horn, trombone and trumpet) played by professional musicians and found that for all instruments measured the flow had relaxed to that of the room at a radius of more than 1.5 m from the bell end. This question was also investigated by Abraham et al. (2021) , who found that the so-called aerosol influence zone (i.e. the distance up to which the released particles were detectable above the background in the Minnesota orchestra hall) was less than 0.3 m for all instruments examined. These findings suggest that the source is highly localized before the emission plume gets mixed with the ambient air, mainly due to the wide opening of the instrument bells and the resulting low air speed.",

At a distance between 2 to 6 m, the center velocity of the air jet from the wind instruments reached room air draft level very much in agreement with the results by Spahn et al. (2021) . Particle dispersion to more than a meter away from the wind instrument was also reported by Gantner et al. (2022) .

In addition, it is critical to consider particle shrinkage in ambient air and its impact on risk of airborne disease transmission, as well as size-dependent filtration, which have not yet been considered. The importance of particle shrinkage becomes clear when one considers that particle volume can decrease by a factor of 90 in a fraction of a second, e.g., from exhalation to measurement (Bagheri et al., 2021a) . The impact of size-dependent filtration on infection risk has also been shown to be extremely important Bagheri et al. (2021b) . These problems can be attributed in part to due to the large variability in measurement methods, the different levels of environmental control, limitations of measurement instruments, uncontrolled sampling, and/or lack of representative statistics.",

In total 300 minutes of spectrometry data and 24000 holograms to present the field-standardized, normalized number-size distribution in the size range of 1.5 to 40 \u00b5m diameter is collected. The particle shrinkage is taken into account by controlling the relative humidity of the sampling tubes and recalculating the wet diameter of the particles at the time of exhalation. We characterized 12 types of filter pieces used as instrument masks and generated size-dependent filtration curves. Using these data, we performed a through analysis of the risk of transmission in the near field according to the upper bound concept presented in Bagheri et al.

            "text": "The main setup consisted of two aerosol size spectrometers, which were an Optical Particle Sizer Type 3330 (OPS) and a Nanoscale Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer Type 3910 (SMPS), both from TSI Inc. In the very beginning of the study, a third spectrometer, the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer Model 3321 (APS) from TSI Inc., was also connected to the setup. The SMPS uses a flow rate of 0.75 L min \u22121 and the OPS uses 1 L min \u22121 . If the APS was connected to the setup, it added 5 L min \u22121 to the total flow rate (1 L min \u22121 sample flow plus 4 L min \u22121 sheath flow). Both OPS and SMPS had sampling times of one minute per sample. While all experiments had valid OPS data, valid SMPS and APS data are only available for some of the measurements (see Table 1 in Supplementary Information (SI)). In the 16 logarithmically equidistant channels of the OPS, we obtain less resolution, but better counting efficiency (less losses) for particles larger than 4 \u00b5m compared to an APS (see P\u00f6hlker et al., 2021 , for more details), and we had two channels measuring particles smaller than 0.5 \u00b5m. There is a reasonable agreement between OPS and APS up to 4 \u00b5m particle diameter (see Fig. 2 of SI). According to the SMPS user manual, each of the 13 SMPS channels is scanned for approximately 4.6 s per sample. As the sample flow rate is 0.75 L min \u22121 , the sample volume for each channel in each oneminute sample is 58 cm 3 , which yields a physical detection limit of 0.017 cm \u22123 for the SMPS to measure one count. The spectrometers are connected via electrically conductive polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) tubing with 6 mm inner diameter to a flow splitter, which is connected via the same kind of tubing to two serial diffusion dryers (Grimm Model 7813), filled with silica gel. The outermost diffusion dryer is connected via the same kind of tubing to a sampling funnel made of plastic. Via intercomparison between the particle size distributions measured with the setup described in Fig. 1 A and playing the instrument directly into the inlet nozzle of the OPS, we could verify that the material of the funnel (non-conductive plastic) did not introduce notable electrostatic losses (see Fig. 3 and 4 of SI). Particle losses due to the diffusion dryers are approximately 25% and independent of the particle size (see Bagheri et al. (2021a) for more details). The total tube length was 4.2 m from the funnel to each aerosol size spectrometer. For measuring the particle size distribution from wind instruments, we used two collection funnels of different size (a smaller one with 100 mm diameter, and a larger one with 150 mm), depending on the bell diameter of the instrument. We expect acceptable inlet efficiency around 50 -80% for the setup with the collection funnel for particles <3.5 \u00b5m (more details in Subsection 1.2. and Fig. 1 in SI). The standard setup for measuring the particle emission at the end piece or bell end of a wind instrument is shown in Fig. 1A . During those measurements where particle leakage from the nose or embouchure (i.e. next to the mouth) was measured in parallel with emission at bell end, a second funnel was placed in front of mouth and nose, connected to another OPS (see Fig. 1B ). For instruments with tone holes, we did additional measurements as described in Fig. 1C to determine the particle leakage from the tone holes in comparison to the particles emitted from the bell end. The role of leakage from mouth and nose, and the leakage from the tone holes is discussed in detail in Subsection 2.5. of the SI. Between the funnel and the bell end, there was a narrow gap for air to escape in order to operate the aerosol size spectrometers at ambient air pressure. As already studied by Bouhuys (1964) , the peak exhale volume of wind instrument players is much larger than the sampling flow rate used in our setup (up to 100 L min \u22121 for a tubist compared to a maximum sample flow rate of 6.75 L min \u22121 ), so dilution due to the small gap at the side can be assumed to be negligible. In addition to the measurements of the particle emission at the open bell end, we examined the penetration of masks made of different materials similar to setup A in Fig. 1 . Mask penetration was also measured with dolomite test dust as described in Bagheri et al. (2021b) to obtain better counting statistics in particular for large particles. More details about the mask materials and their penetration can be found in Subsections 2.13. to 2.16. of the SI. In the following we call these filter pieces \"instrumentmasks\".",

Instruments. computers, and wind instruments were wiped with clean-room cloth to minimize contamination of the results by dust. Before the measurements in order to avoid artifacts from dust from inside the wind-instrument, they were either flushed with particlefree air, or were played for at least two minutes before the actual experiment started. In contrast to measuring particle emission from mouth and nose, for wind-instruments we need to account for the time of particle transport from the mouthpiece through the wind instrument to the particle spectrometers. Thus, the activities started at least 30 s before sampling was started. This time for particle transport was increased to 90 s for wind-instruments with large volume (e.g. B-flat tuba, see Fig. 6 in SI). Each measurement sample was 60 s long, and each experiment consisted of at least one sample. The subject played at least one piece of music selected by themselves, some also played single long notes at different pitch, or multiple pieces of music.",

An overview of the subjects, the instruments played and the number of experiments can be found in Table S1 of the SI. A total of thirty-one musicians, ranging in age from 14 to 80 years, with an average age of 35 years, participated in the study. Five participants were from HMTMH, 8 played in a traditional German brass ensemble (\"Blasorchester\"), four were from a traditional German wind ensemble, four participants played in a trombone choir (\"Posaunenchor\"), 2 played in jazz bands and one played in a marching band (\"Spielmannszug\"). Due to fundamental differences in instrumentation and style between international wind ensembles, we decided to use the German term below in addition to the English. At the time the study was conducted, neither point-of-care tests nor vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 were available. For all participants, an anamnesis was performed for possible risk situations due to close contact with persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 or travel to risk areas or virus variant areas as defined by the German Robert Koch Institute within the last 14 days, and they were asked about their health status. During all phases of the study, the study team and the participants strictly adhered to the official regulations and the Institute's hygiene plan. With the exception of the musician whose particle emission was measured, all participants wore FFP2 masks throughout. None of the subjects felt ill on the day of the measurements and no COVID-19 infections were traceable to the study. Participants with symptoms or people closely exposed to someone tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the study. The study was ethically approved by the Max Planck Society. All subjects participated voluntarily, were informed in advance about the conduct of the experiment and subsequently consented to their participation. The subjects had to be legally competent and not impaired to carry out activities in this study. For participants below the age of 18 years, both the participants themselves and their legal guardians gave consent. Participation could be revoked at any time during the study.",

Although the instruments are typically made of brass this also includes other materials like metals, plastics, or wood. Woodwind instruments we put into three categories: edge-blown , i.e., piccolo, flute, fife, and recorder ; single-reed, i.e., clarinet and saxophone; and double-reed, i.e., oboe, bassoon and chanter of bagpipes. The sound from edge-blown woodwind instruments is created by blowing a fast air stream onto a sharp edge. In a single-reed instrument, the sound is created by the fast opening and closing of the air channel between the reed and the actual mouthpiece. Double-reed instruments use the same principle but the air channel is formed between both reeds. All clarinets in the study were clarinets in B-flat, all trumpets were trumpets in B-flat (with piston or rotary valves), and all trombones were tenor slide trombones in B-flat. The double horn in our study was played in B-flat only. The single-reed instruments in the study are all exposed single-reed instruments (the reed is actually in the player's mouth) while all double-reed instruments examined in this work are double-reeds in a windcap. An illustration of the wind instruments examined in our study is shown in Fig. 2 .",

We chose this approach to better understand real-life music events. This allowed us to identify scenarios with lower or higher emissions.

The effect of using other mask materials will be also discussed in the Results section. This material also had acceptable acoustic impedance according to the musicians who used it during the measurements. Size-specific penetration is taken into account by using the parameters obtained by the power-law fit for penetration of dry dolomite dust in Subsection 2.13. of SI. We assume that the infectious particles are already dry when they reach the mask material resulting in a lower filtration efficiency compared to the assumed diameter of the exhaled particles and thus a higher risk of infection. For all scenarios we assume that the wind instrument player plays the instrument without any interruption (i.e. no pause), which precludes a breakdown of the air jet emanating from the instrument bell and makes distancing less effective.

We assume that we have one susceptible sitting in the audience, and one infectious musician playing a wind instrument. It is assumed that the susceptible has not absorbed any SARS-CoV-2 copies prior to exposure. In this paper, we assume a dose-response relationship such that the absorption of a given pathogen dose by the susceptible will lead to some probability of infection. Even though individuals with some degree of immunity (e.g. vaccinated or recovered individuals) might not get infected at all after being exposed to a high number of pathogen copies, we assume that our susceptible individual does not have any immunity against the respective pathogen. This assumption is part of the upper bound concept as described in Bagheri et al. (2021b) . As mentioned above, we consider both near-and far-field infection risk in a number of scenarios. As the risk of infection is the result of a stochastic process, adding more infectious or susceptible persons to the scenario increases complexity but does not significantly improve insight. Similar to the scenarios in Bagheri et al. (2021b) , we examine the upper bound of infection risk for near-field exposure, but also for the far-field scenario. For the calculation of the risk of infection, the exponential model as described in Nordsiek et al. (2021) is used in a simplified way, i.e. the classical mono-pathogen model, as for SARS-CoV-2 the differences to consider the poly-pathogen are negligible. The mean infection risk R I is given by Eq. 1 where \u00b5 is the absorbed dose (which is time-dependent), and ID 63.21 is the infectious dose required for 63.21% chance of infection.",

The absorbed dose \u00b5 depends on exposure duration t, inhaled volumetric flow rate of the susceptible Q S (which is the same as the exhaled volumetric flow rate), the concentration of pathogen copies in the inhaled air per particle diameter n P,k , the dilution factor f d for mixing of the exhaled air with the ambient air before inhalation and the effective penetration P I,k of the mask the infectious is wearing, and the effective penetration P S,k of the mask the susceptible is wearing. Effective penetration means that total inward leakage is taken into account. Unmasked susceptible means P S,k = 1\u2200k and unmasked infectious means P I,k = 1\u2200k. Also, the deposition within the respiratory tract D rt,k as a function of particle size needs to be known.

As the volumetric flow rate for exhalation through the wind instrument is typically different from the volumetric flow rate for normal breathing, we decided to take the volume-weighted average of emitted pathogen concentration at the location of the susceptible.

We examine the infection risk in the far-field by assuming a small, well-mixed room. The room is assumed to have an area A = 12 m 2 and a ceiling height of h = 2.5 m, which yields a volume V = 30 m 3 . This room is assumed continuously cleaned from particles by an air purifier with an equivalent clean air delivery rate (CADR) of 4 airchanges-per-hour (ACH). Only the infectious and the susceptible are in this room. The initial concentration of pathogen copies in the room air is zero. In a well-mixed room of volume V , we use the pathogen concentration n P,k derived from the particle concentration N k and size to calculate the infection risk as explained in detail in Nordsiek et al. (2021) . The rate of change in n P,k as expressed in Eq. 6 is given by the source term (which is the emission of pathogen copies into the room by the infectious) and four sink term: (i) the removal of pathogens via inhalation by the infectious, (ii) the removal of pathogens via inhalation by the susceptible (this yields the absorbed dose per time for the susceptible, which determines the infection risk), (iii) the removal of pathogens due to ventilation of the room or usage of an air purifier with \u03b2 v in the unit of air changes per second, and (iv) the pathogen inactivation \u03b3, which is approximately 0.64 h \u22121 as described in van Doremalen et al.

As already explained in Materials and Methods, Subsection 2.1, we can trust the measured particle concentrations to about 16 \u00b5m diameter at exhalation, which is 3.5 \u00b5m dry diameter. As the observable decrease in particle concentration released by wind instruments starts at smaller sizes, we think the decrease is real and caused by the wind instruments themselves acting as a filter. We know from the results discussed in Bagheri et al. (2021a) that a substantial amount of large (D 0 >10 \u00b5m) particles is released during phonetic activities. It is only the high sampling and detection efficiency of the holographic setup that enables reliable characterization of such large particles. We have also conducted experiments with several wind instrument being played right into the sample volume of the holographic setup. These experiments were done with four trumpets, one tenor trombone, two clarinets, two transverse flutes, one alto recorder, one soprano sax, one alto sax and two tenor saxophones. In none of the experiments, we were able to detect particles >6 \u00b5m at the bell end of any wind instrument with the holographic setup. These results give us confidence that we are not missing an important mode of the size distribution at larger sizes. In general, we found that wind instrument players release higher concentration of particles up to 10 \u00b5m exhaled diameter when playing their instrument compared to breathing and speaking.",

However, the geometric standard deviation \u03c3 1 needed to be varied for the different wind instrument types to achieve a good coefficient of determination (r 2 ). To avoid overfitting, the first step was to fit the first mode to the data with fixed D 1 to determine A 1 and \u03c3 1 . Then, the fitted first mode was subtracted from the data and another mode was fitted to the remaining data. For most instrument types, two modes could explain the measured data very well. For some instruments (practice chanter, Great Highland Bagpipes, Scottish Smallpipes, F tuba), a third mode was visible and fitted to the data remaining after mode 1 and 2 were subtracted. In the final step, all D i and \u03c3 i were fixed, based on the results of the previous fits, and the coefficients A i were used as free parameters for the fit to the original data. All fit parameters and coefficient of determination are shown in Table 1 . A weighting function was used for the final fit, which is defined as 1/\u03c3(dN dLogD 0 ) where \u03c3(dN dLogD 0 ) is the standard error of the data.

Both piccolo and fife had emitted size distributions very similar to the size distribution emitted during normal breathing in terms of shape. In direct comparison between wind instruments in Fig. 6 -8 and phonetic activities in Fig. 8 , most brass and reed instruments emit a higher number of particles per volume in the size range from 1.5 to 10 \u00b5m than a person speaking or singing (the total volume emitted, which is most important for the risk of infection, is discussed later). There does not appear to be a Figure 5: Normalized emitted particle concentration (dN/dLogD 0 ) from SMPS and OPS obtained from two brass (orange), two edge-blown woodwind (blue) and four single-reed woodwind instruments (red) as a function of exhaled diameter D 0 . Shown are arithmetic mean and standard error (black symbols and errorbars), median (solid lines), and range from 25th percentile to maximum (shaded area). Dashed blue (Fit breathing) and red lines (Fit speaking) represent multi-modal log-normal fits for breathing and speaking as published in Bagheri et al. (2021a) . For each wind instrument type, the base or reference note is given in parenthesis. Fig. 6 it can be seen that the highest number-concentration is for the tenor trombone, which has about double the tube length of a trumpet or Kuhlo horn, and four times the tube length of a piccolo trumpet. The emitted particle concentration from a F-tuba is not so much different from the particle emission by a Kuhlo horn or a trumpet despite the tube of the tuba being three times as long. In the group of the reed instruments in Fig. 7 (clarinet and saxophones) we find the highest variability in particle emission in the clarinet data. The mean emitted particle concentration from the soprano sax is somewhat lower, and the alto sax and tenor sax emit less particles than the soprano sax. For the emission by the clarinet, we found a very strong pitch dependence with lowest emission in the chalumeau register and substantially higher emission in the clarion and altissimo register (see Subsection 2.11. of SI). The highest average emission was found for the tenor trombone and the clarinet. However, we found that a large amount of particles is produced primarily by the vibrating lips when playing a brass mouthpiece. The effect of the instrument resonator on the emitted particle size distribution is discussed in Subsection 3.3. The fact that we could not detect particles with the holographic setup emitted by wind instruments is in accordance with the results by McCarthy et al. (2021) who used water-sensitive cards and also could not detect particles >20 \u00b5m containing water at the bell end of any wind instrument.",

If a person has for example an emitted particle concentration for normal breathing which is higher than the geometric mean plus the geometric standard deviation of emitted particle concentration in the examined cohort for the same activity, this person is called a super-emitter (see Asadi et al., 2019; Bagheri et al., 2021a) . Our data indicate that this is also the case here, i.e. some musicians produce more respiratory particles with the same instrument and playing technique as others, just because of different physiological properties (see Subsection 2.9. of SI for more detailed discussion). In addition to physiological reasons for higher or lower emission, the music that was played does also have an influence on the particle emission. We typically found higher particle emission in the high register for brass players as well as for clarinet players (see Fig. 9 of SI).

A possible explanation is the generation of the sound for these different instrument types. Edge-blown woodwind instruments need a fast, narrow airstream with virtually no resistance to make a good sound whereas the lips of a brass player or the mouthpiece of a single-reed woodwind instrument have a notable resistance to the exhaled air. The pressure within the respiratory tract needs to be higher for playing a brass or a single-reed woodwind instrument compared to playing an edge-blown woodwind instrument and we already found an increase in emitted particle concentration for exhalation at higher pressure (see Subsection 2.7 of SI).",

On the other hand, we know from Bagheri et al. (2021a) that the oral cavity and the lips are very important sources of particles released by a person speaking or singing. When playing a brass instrument, the sound is generated by the vibrating lips. If they are wetted before they are opened and closed, they can produce a large amount of particles >30 \u00b5m. We investigated the production of particles by a brass player with the holographic setup and OPS-based measurements of particles that passed the mouthpiece of a trombone. To study the role of the resonator (the trombone), we also measured the particle size distribution at the trombone bell end and recalculated the particle size at exhalation from the measured dry diameter as shown in Fig. 10 . The size distributions are based on three subsequent experiments executed by the same subject playing the same piece of Figure 9 : Relative emitted particle volume concentration from directly mouth-blown wind instruments (blue circles, brass in top panel, woodwind in bottom panel) compared to normal breathing (dashed black lines), speaking (dashed blue lines) and singing (dashed magenta lines).

Red squares denote the arithmetic mean for the respective wind instrument. \"Pr. chanter\" is the abbreviation for \"practice chanter\". Relative volume concentrations for singing and speaking values are from Bagheri et al. (2021a) for particles with 1.3 \u00b5m< D 0 <45 \u00b5m, which are almost indistinguishable from each other in this plot. music for the same duration at same dynamics, which were (i)\"Mouthpiece @ Holo\": playing the trombone mouthpiece into the holographic sample volume (no correction needed due to negligible drying), (ii)\"Mouthpiece @ OPS\": playing the trombone mouthpiece into the OPS inlet (cannot be corrected due to partial drying), and (iii)\"Trombone @ Setup A\": playing the trombone into the standard setup (corrected assuming full drying to obtain D 0 ). As expected from the size distributions in Fig. 5 , the particle concentration emitted by the trombone player through the instrument is about two orders of magnitude higher than the typical emission from breathing. Around 6 \u00b5m exhaled diameter, the fitted data from the trombone mouthpiece measured by the holographic setup intersect with the corrected (measured dry) data from the trombone bell end measured via Setup A. Due to partial drying, it was not possible to correct the data measured by the OPS directly from the trombone mouthpiece. What we can derive from the data shown in Fig. 10 is that the trombone acts as a filter with a transmission T of \u223c 1% for D 0 >20 \u00b5m and \u223c 0.1% for D 0 >30 \u00b5m. It should be emphasized that up to 20 \u00b5m exhaled diameter, the data obtained via Setup A are trustworthy. Moreover, it is actually possible to approximate the transmission of the trombone resonator by T \u223c exp(\u22120.3(D 0 \u2212 D 1 )) with D 1 = 3.8 \u00b5m. This is the same functional relationship as found for penetration of non-charged melt-blown filter fabrics, the only difference is that D 1 = 0 for the filter fabrics (see Subsection 3.4 and Subsection 2.13 of SI for more details).",

Brass instruments do not have leakage at the valves, but another source of infectious particles is particles released by normal breathing, either through the nose or the mouth. The particle leakage from tone holes is taken into account in our infection risk calculations by assuming the upper bound of exhalation volume flow rate for professional wind instrument players given by Bouhuys (1964) for different instrument types. For some of the brass and woodwind instrument players, we examined the size distribution of particles from mouth or nose during the play with an additional measurement setup and found that the particle size distributions were very close to the particle size distributions from normal breathing (see Fig. 7 and Subsection 2.5. of SI). From these findings, two consequences arise: Firstly, woodwind instruments need to be covered entirely with an instrument-mask as leakage from the tone holes is an issue. Secondly, particle emission from normal breathing while playing the instrument needs to be taken into account for the calculation of infection risk.",

The acoustic properties as described by the musicians can be summarized in fabrics with higher weight per area yielding higher playing resistance and stronger acoustic attenuation. The mask materials had a typical pressure drop between 7 and 45 Pa for a mean air velocity of 7.3 cm s \u22121 through the mask. This velocity corresponds to about 100 L min \u22121 of breathing through a typical FFP2 mask. However, the material with lowest measured penetration was quite thick (about 120 g m \u22122 ) but the sound quality was acceptable for low brass instruments (trombones, tenorhorns, tubas). High brass instruments (in particular trumpets) had a notable loss of brightness in the sound due to attenuation of the high harmonics. For them, a thinner material with 55 g m \u22122 (filter03) was better suited. ",

As we find the range of emitted volume concentration for some of the instruments to be almost a factor 1000 (e.g. clarinet) in Fig. 9 , we need to use a conservative estimation of the emitted volume concentration when calculating the infection risk. The arithmetic mean values of emitted volume concentration from the trombone and the clarinet are almost equal (see the red squares in Fig. 9 ). These numbers will be used to represent a high emitter. As low emitter, we chose the piccolo. With these choices the typical emission from any wind instrument is within these two extremes. In scenarios with instrument-masks, we chose the \"filter05\" material as mask material. We assume that all inhalation rates are the same as the corresponding exhalation rates. Breathing rates are assumed to be Q I,w = 47 L min \u22121 for the infectious playing the trombone (Max), Q I,w = 44 L min \u22121 for the infectious playing the piccolo (Min), and additional Q I,b = 9 L min \u22121 for breathing. The values for the trombone and piccolo are taken from Bouhuys (1964) and the value for normal breathing is taken from International Commission on Radiological Protection (1994) . For the near-field exposure, we use the volume averaged concentration of pathogen copies from both sources (instrument and nose of infectious). The susceptible breathes with a constant volumetric flow rate Q S,b = 9 L min \u22121 . For the interpretation of the infection risk, it needs to be mentioned that we show the upper bound of infection risk, and that the infection risk is cumulative. An instrument lesson, band rehearsal or concert might not be the only exposure scenario during the day. So it makes sense to draw the line of an acceptable infection risk somewhere on the low end.",

From Fig. 13 , it can be concluded that the \"Room-Masked\" scenario is associated with a low risk of infection transmission (< 1%) even after 12 hours. Fig. 12 for far-field exposure. Shown are \"Room-Unmasked\", \"Room-Mixed\", \"Room-Instrument-mask\" and \"Room-Masked\" scenario for maximum and minimum of the mean particle emission among the examined wind instruments.",

Other scenarios, where multiple infectious and/or multiple susceptible individuals are in rooms with different ventilation characteristics, can be studied with the HEADS (Human Emission of Aerosol and Droplet Statistics) web app, which has a user-friendly interface (Bagheri et al., 2020) . In HEADS, the effect of room size, ventilation rate, number of susceptible and infectious individuals, activities, pathogen concentration, infectious dose, pathogen deactivation rate, particle deposition, intake efficiency of the susceptible, particle drying and their re-hydration of particles in susceptible airways, and poly-pathogen aerosols on the risk of infection transmission for any airborne disease can be studied. The HEADS \"Advanced View\" allows also mixtures of different activities (for example, 80% breathing, 10% speaking, 10% singing). Another powerful tool in HEADS is the analysis of subsequent exposure scenarios. If the relevant parameters are known, it is possible to add for example the use of public transportation to/from the concert. The HEADS web app is available in English, German and some other languages.",

This span by itself introduces an uncertainty of \u00b12.5 orders of magnitude (factor 300) for the time to exceed a given threshold of the infection risk. In other words, a given time to exceed a threshold of the risk of infection transmission of 5 minutes could actually vary between 1 second for an infectious with extremely high virus concentration, and 1 day for an infectious with low virus concentration. Also, the value of ID 63.21 is not exactly known and could vary between 100 and 1000 virions for the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 (see e.g. Nordsiek et al., 2021) . However, it is unlikely that the uncertainty caused by ID 63.21 will affect the real-world application of the results presented, at least for the near-field scenarios, since we have already used extremely conservative estimates for other parameters. Another aspect that introduces uncertainty to the model is that the dependence of \u03c1 p on particle origin site and time during the course of the disease is not known. There is also a recent discussion about the inactivation rate for particles containing SARS-CoV-2, which could depend on several parameters of the room air and could be higher (Oswin et al., 2022) . On the other hand, simpler models like the ones used in Miller et al. (2020) , Stockman et al. (2021) and Firle et al. (2021) have the same issues while they also do not take the size to volume ratio of the particles into account. In this regard, the upper bound we have presented for the near-field calculations should remain valid as we have not considered the deactivation term.",

Another possible limitation is the aggregation of wind instruments of the same type, e.g. the \"trumpet\" class consists of several different trumpet models in B-flat with both rotary and piston valves and there is evidence that the instrument geometry and/or mouthpiece geometry can have an effect on emitted particle concentration and size distribution. One trumpet player played exactly the same pieces of music on two different trumpet models at same dynamics and tempo with the result that the mean emitted particle number concentrations differed systematically by a factor 2 between the two trumpet models. The assumption of a diverging jet flow is rather crude but useful to discuss the effect of dilution as a function of distance between source and receiver. Finally, the limitations discussed need to be taken into account when interpreting the results of the infection risk calculation. Nevertheless, the infection risk calculations presented can provide very useful guidance for planning rehearsals, instrumental lessons, and live music events.",

Edge-blown woodwind instruments had on average lower emitted particle volume concentration compared to single-reed or double-reed woodwind instruments and brass instruments. We did not observe a systematic trend in a way that for example brass instruments with a shorter tube emitted more particles than brass instruments with a longer tube.

We tested a mask material with penetration <10 \u22124 for 1 \u00b5m particles on several wind instruments and found minor influence of the instrument-mask on the sound quality of brass instruments playing in the same tonal range as a tenor trombone or lower.

When susceptible wears an FFP2 mask and instrument-mask is used, transmission risk in near-field is only 5% even after 12 hours of continuous exposure. In a well-mixed room situation (i.e. far-field scenarios) like a band rehearsal (with one wind instrument) or private instrument lessons, the risk of infection transmission is >50% after 20 minutes but stays below 0.5% even after 12 hours with a moderate air exchange rate (4 ACH), instrument-mask and FFP2 masks for the attendees.",
