            "text": "Introduction Several studies have shown that COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) patients' quality of life (QoL). However, very few studies were performed in Middle Eastern countries. Aim The aim of the current study was to assess, the QoL and diabetes-specific QoL, treatment satisfaction and psychological distress of Lebanese patients with T2DMs using: the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL), Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status version (DTSQs) and Kessler 10 (K10) questionnaires and to compare results to those obtained during the pre-COVID-19 period. Results 461 patients with T2DM participated in the study; 52.6% men, 47.4% women; median age 59 years old. The respective median ADDQoL and DTSQs scores were \u2212 2.2 (interval interquartile range (IQR) \u2212 3.9, \u2212 0.8) (range from \u2212 9 maximum negative impact to + 3 maximum positive impact) and 30(IQR22-36) (range from 0 maximum dissatisfaction to 36 maximum satisfaction). K10 median score was 26(IQR18-35) (range from minimum score of 10 indicating no distress to maximum score of 50 indicating severe distress). Rural dwelling, lack of exercise, current smoking, diabetic complications, injectable diabetes treatment, and previous COVID-19 infection were all associated with significantly worse ADDQoL, DTSQs, and K10 score indicating greater distress. A significant worsening of ADDQoL scores followed onset of the pandemic with no significant change in DTSQs scores. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, T2DM Lebanese patients experienced more negative impact of diabetes on QoL and mental health. Those infected with COVID-19 also reported worse QoL, treatment satisfaction and mental health. This highlights the need for community and individual support.

The manifestations of COVID-19 vary between mild symptoms such as a common cold to severe respiratory infections and multiple organ failure [2] . The presence of chronic diseases such as obesity, hypertension, and/or diabetes mellitus are considered as high-risk factors for increased severity and mortality from the infection [3] . It was estimated that 10% of patients infected with COVID-19 have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and that there was a two-fold increase in the rate of intensive care unit admission in individuals with T2DM compared to those without diabetes [4] . The pandemic has severely disrupted routine diabetes self-management because of changes in diet due to unavailability of certain food products and difficulty in maintaining physical exercise due to the lockdown. Furthermore, people with T2DM were facing difficulties visiting doctors and refilling prescriptions [5] .",

The overview items are followed by a series of 19 questions about the impact of diabetes on leisure, work, journeys, physical health, family life, friendships and social life, personal relationship, sexuality, physical appearance, selfconfidence, motivation, reactions of other people, feelings about the future, finances, living conditions, dependence on other people, dietary freedom. This evaluation allows patients to indicate which aspects of life apply to them, the impact of diabetes on each applicable aspect of life (including any positive as well as negative impact on a scale from -3 maximum negative impact to + 1 positive impact); and the perceived importance of each aspect of life for their QoL (from 3 very important to 0 not at all important). Impact scores are multiplied by importance scores to give weighted impact scores for all applicable items ranging from -9 to + 3.

It was designed to assess treatment satisfaction in specific areas, treatment satisfaction from these areas combined and perceived frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. The six questions which are combined to assess treatment satisfaction ask about \"satisfaction with current treatment\", \"flexibility\", \"convenience\", \"understanding of diabetes\", \"recommend treatment to others\" and \"willingness to continue\". Each item is rated on a 7-point scale from 6 (e.g., \"very satisfied\") to 0 (e.g., \"very dissatisfied\"). Treatment satisfaction is assessed as the sum of the scores of these six questions (maximum score 36, minimum score 0), with a higher score indicating greater treatment satisfaction. Two additional items, scored as separate items, assess the frequency of hyper-and hypoglycemia (Questions 2 and 3). The scale of answers ranges from 6 \"most of the time\" to 0 \"none of the time\".",

First, we analyzed the QoL of Lebanese T2DM patients. We found that the ADDQoL AWI score was -2.2 (possible range \u22129 to + 3) showing a negative impact of diabetes on QoL in the current sample of T2DM patients. Likewise, several studies have shown, using different QoL and health status scales, that COVID-19 has had a negative impact on QoL in Australian [25] , Croatian [9] , and Danish [15] T2DM patients. In the Australian study, QoL was mainly affected for leisure activities, feelings about the future, and emotional well-being [25] . In the Arab world, an Egyptian study performed on a sample of 200 T2DM patients [11] , showed that respectively 64% and 62% of patients with T2DM reported poor physical and mental health components on the SF-36 measure of health status. In the current study, gender was not associated with the ADDQoL AWI score while age was significantly correlated with a better score. The relation between gender and QoL is conflicting. Two previous studies performed in Egypt [11] and Iran [12] , found that women had poorer physical QoL compared to men while in a third [9] male gender was a significant predictor of worse QoL. Likewise, it has been shown that younger Australian T2DM patients reported lower QoL compared to older ones [25] . Conversely, in Denmark [15] and Iran [12] , the oldest age group, compared to the youngest one, had a significant decrease in QoL. Cultural differences may explain these differences between countries; it is possible that in our population older T2DM patients are more prone to manage their QoL. We found that dwelling location outside the city of Beirut has a negative impact on QoL, similarly to what was observed in a Croatian study where living in rural regions was a significant predictor of poorer QoL [9] . This could be explained by the fact that living in urban areas allow a better access to good health management. Also, we found that the absence of physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a worse ADDQoL score. This was also found in 2 other studies from Bangladesh [26] and Netherland [27] where participants who became less active during the pandemic experienced more stress and psychological distress. Moreover, patients having at least one comorbidity (dyslipidemia, diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and/or neuropathy) and current smokers had lower ADDQoL score. Similarly, in several reports [9, 11, 26, 28] , the presence of diabetic complications and current smoking were associated with lower score in physical domain part. Finally, the current study showed that a shorter duration of diabetes, a better diabetes control (measured by the last HbA1C) and the use of OAD are associated with better QoL scores. This finding can be explained by the fact that OAD are usually used at an earlier stage of the disease at a time when diabetic complications are less frequent. Then, we assessed treatment satisfaction using the DTSQs. Our results showed that our participants experienced an overall good treatment satisfaction with a median score of 30 over 36, and our median score of perceived hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia was 3 for a range between 1 and 6. This highlights the fact that our population has an adequate degree of satisfaction, regardless their treatment strategy. The discrepancy between the QoL and treatment satisfaction could be explained by the availability of a good Lebanese healthcare network, which was surprisingly maintained despite the prevailing circumstances in a country facing one of the hardest socio-economic crises. Treatment satisfaction has only been studied in the Saudi RIMODIS study [29] during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly to our results, a relatively good degree of treatment satisfaction was found also among Saudi T2DM patients with a median score of 28 versus 30 in the current study).",

            "text": "We also evaluated mental health issues in our population. The K10 score obtained was of 26 over 36 confirming a notable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. In a study from Saudi Arabia [16] , the average psychological assessment score K10 of T2DM patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was 9.8. This huge difference with our results can be explained by the additional impact of the severe Lebanese economic and social crisis [30] that has severely burdens the Lebanese mental health. In the United Kingdom (UK) [28] and Denmark [10] , the reduction in enjoyment of normal daily activities during the COVID-19 pandemic has also led to an increase in psychological distress. We also found that the K10 score was significantly higher in women compared to men. Similarly, other studies [11, 15, 28] showed an increase in psychological distress in women comparing to men. At the opposite, in the Croatian study [9] men were more affected in the psychological and the spiritual domain. In addition, we found that the absence of income was associated with the worst K10 score (score = 30) indicating severe mental disorder in these patients. Worldwide job loss and/or a wage's reduction were common since the beginning of the economic downturn leading to food insecurity, homelessness, psychological distress, and anxiety [31] . We also demonstrated that patients living outside an urban area, as in the Bekaa valley, North, and South Lebanon had higher K10 scores suggesting that living outside the city may increase the mental distress probably due to the absence of leisure activities adapted to the pandemic in these regions. Moreover, the current study proved that lifestyle factors such as exercise and smoking have an impact on mental health. T2DM patients not practicing regular physical activity were more prone to mental disorders in comparison to those with regular physical exercise. This finding was also seen in studies from Iran and India [13, 32] where the decrease in healthy lifestyle behaviors, mainly exercise, during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in psychological distress. This confirms the importance of regular physical exercise to reduce emotional and psychological stress [33] . Current smokers have also higher K10 score confirming the fact that mental disorders are more associated with addiction behaviors such as smoking [34] . Finally, patients with diabetic complications, on OAD treatment, with a worse diabetes control or with a longer duration of the disease had higher K10 scores. Three studies [10, 11, 15] have shown that patients with diabetic complications were more likely to have mental distress and feelings of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, Madsen et al. [15] and Ghosh et al. [35] found that since the beginning of the pandemic, patients with high HbA1c showed an increased in social loneliness, psychological and mental distress scores compared to those with low HbA1c. This can be explained by the fact that uncontrolled diabetes increases the risk of diabetes-related complications, and therefore impact negatively mental health. Similarly to our results, in Singapore [36] , patients on both OAD and insulin had more mental disorders in comparison to other treatment modalities (OAD only, insulin only).",

In that study, the authors analyzed the QoL and treatment satisfaction using the same Arabic version of the questionnaires. The unprecedented political, economic, sanitary and social collapse [30] that Lebanon had to face these last 2 years, added to the tragic massive explosion of August 4th 2020 in the Beirut port has certainly caused extensive physical and mental damage to the overall Lebanese population [37] . This has probably worsened the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the QoL of the Lebanese population, and explain the lower score obtained in the ADDQoL overview I general QoL in our study compared to the Atallah et al. one. However, there was no significant difference in treatment satisfaction between our results and those of Atallah et al. [17] using the DTSQs questionnaire. This result highlights the persistence of high medical qualified standards in our country despite the severe crisis the country is currently passing through. It is also important to mention, that mean score of perceived hypoglycemia was superior in the current study in comparison to those of Atallah et al. [17] . This could be explained by the impact of COVID-19 on patient's food consumption or diet changes [5] . On the contrary, in the Saudi Arabia study [16] , the incidence of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia did not differ significantly between the pre-and post-lockdown phase for COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the observed decrease in physical activity and the increase in smoking habits in the current study, can be explained by the national lockdown imposed by the government leading to the closure of gyms, wellbeing places, and increase level of stress among our study population.",

Collected data, as already mentioned, was based on self-reported questionnaires. Therefore, there is no way to confirm how accurate the collected information is. Moreover, a control group was not included in this study for the K10 questionnaire. Considering that ADDQoL and DTSQ are only used for diabetic populations, Atallah et al. was chosen as a control group. This might explain some differences obtained between the two studies. However, due to similar ethnicity between the two populations, a comparison can be made. In addition, the study did not capture the economic burden associated with the disease's comorbidities. Finally, it is difficult to compare our results to those of the literature considering the use of a multitude of QoL questionnaires.",

T2DM has a negative impact on multiple dimensions of QoL, treatment satisfaction and mental health. Younger women patients living outside the city of Beirut, with poor diabetic control or with diabetic complications were more prone to an altered QoL. Moreover, those infected with COVID-19 also reported worse QoL, treatment satisfaction and mental health. These findings highlight the need to improve QoL of T2DM patients during the severe sanitary and societal crisis that Lebanon is facing. Developing strategies to provide adequate physical and mental support to this subgroup of our population is mandatory.",
