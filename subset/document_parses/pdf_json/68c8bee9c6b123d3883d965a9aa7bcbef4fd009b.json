Given the cardiovascular effects of metoprolol, patients were monitored invasively and by echocardiography before and on every day after metoprolol injection/control. As expected, metoprolol significantly reduced heart rate (P < 0.01) and invasively measured systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05), although both remained within the physiological range (Supplemental Table 2 ). Echocardiography showed no deterioration of cardiac function parameters after metoprolol treatment (Supplemental Table 3 ). Overall, metoprolol intravenous administration was shown to be safe and without side effects in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS on IMV. Figure 2C ). All patients were discharged from the ICU, and 1 patient in each group died before hospital discharge.",

For flow cytometry (FCM) studies, BAL samples (8 mL) were previously inactivated with 2 mL of a cellular antigen stabilization reagent containing formaldehyde (TransFix, Cytomark Ltd). Samples were then centrifuged (5 minutes at 540g), the supernatant discarded, and the cell pellet resuspended in 200 mL phosphatebuffered saline. Afterwards, 100 mL of cell suspension was stained for 15 minutes at room temperature with the following color combination: antihuman CD15fluorescein isothiocyanate, CD33-phycoerythrin, and CD3-V-450 and CD45-V-500 (Becton Dickinson Biosciences). After staining, 2 mL of FACS lysing solution (Becton/Dickinson Biosciences) was added, and after 5 minutes incubation, the sample was centrifuged and resuspended in 100 mL phosphate-buffered saline. Before acquisition, the fluorescent dye DRAQ5 (Biostatus Limited) (25,26) and Perfect-COUNT microspheres (Cytognos SL) (27) were added for the selection of DNA-positive cells and cell count, respectively. Samples were run on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Biosciences) equipped with FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson Biosciences), and information was acquired about all events corresponding to nucleated cells present in the stained sample aliquot. Data were analyzed with INFINICYT software (Cytognos SL). FCM analysis included a first-step identification of nucleated cells by DRAQ5 staining. Leukocyte populations were identified with a gating strategy based on forward scatter, side scatter, and CD45 expression. Neutrophils and macrophages were identified from their relatively higher light-scattering properties, their unique pattern of CD45 expression, and the expression of CD15 (neutrophils) and CD33 (alveolar macrophages). Lymphocytes were also identified according to their CD45 expression and forward and side scatter properties. Neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte populations were quantified as the percentage of total CD45 events. CHEMOKINE ELISA ASSAYS. Samples were inactivated by incubation in a final concentration of 0.2% SDS per 0.1% Tween-20 and heat treatment at 60 C for 15 minutes. Plasma and cell-free BAL samples were analyzed with human ELISA kits for von Willebrand factor (RAB0556-1KT, Sigma) and the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (orb315028, Biorbyt), interleukin (IL)-6 (orb219452, Biorbyt), and IL-8 (orb315028, Biorbyt). NETosis MARKERS. A total of 3 NETosis biomarkers were measured: citrullinated histone-3 (Cit-H3), MPO-DNA complexes, and cell-free DNA. For Cit-H3 and MPO-DNA ELISA, samples were first inactivated by suspension in 0.2% SDS per 0.1% Tween-20 and heat treatment at 60 C for 15 minutes. For cell-free DNA measurement, samples were inactivated by heat treatment at 60 C for 1 hour. Cit-H3 was measured with an ELISA kit (clone 11D3, Cayman, 501620). Quantification of MPO-DNA complexes was based on a previously described protocol (28,29) that uses several reagents from the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit (Roche, 11544675001) but includes a high-binding EIA/RIA 96-well plate differently coated overnight at 4 C with antihuman MPO antibody (Bio-Rad, 0400-0002). Cell-free DNA was measured using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, P11496). NEUTROPHIL AND NET VISUALIZATION IN BAL.NETs were visualized by Giemsa staining of BAL samples then inactivated and fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature with an alcohol-based spray fixative for cyto-diagnosis (M-Fix spray fixative).

            "text": "To assess the ability of metoprolol to ameliorate neutrophil-mediated exacerbated lung inflammation, we analyzed leukocyte populations in BAL samples by flow cytometry at baseline and on day 4. At baseline, the metoprolol and control groups showed no differences in BAL neutrophil content (Supplemental Figure 1). In contrast, on day 4 (after 3 days of metoprolol/control treatment), neutrophil content was significantly lower in BAL from patients in the metoprolol group than in those randomized to control (median: 14.3 neutrophils/ml [Q1, Q3: 4.63, 265 neutrophils/ml] vs median: 397 neutrophils/ml [Q1, Q3: 222, 1,346 neutrophils/ml]; P \u00bc 0.016). Day 4 BAL from metoprolol-treated patients also had lower total inflammatory-cell content and lower monocyte/ macrophage content, whereas lymphocytes did not differ between groups (Figure 1A). We further explored the impact of metoprolol on MCP-1 in BAL, because this chemokine has been shown to promote pulmonary fibrosis in late-stage ARDS (32,33). MCP-1 in cell-free BAL was significantly attenuated after 3 days of metoprolol treatment (median: 298 pg/mL [Q1, Q3: 236, 350 pg/mL] vs median: 203 pg/mL [Q1, Q3: 175, 258 pg/mL] for baseline and day 4, respectively; P \u00bc 0.009), whereas it remained unchanged in control patients (Figure 1B). Conversely, changes in IL-8 and -6 in cell-free BAL did not differ between treatment groups (Supplemental Figure 2). Excessive neutrophil activation in the lungs is associated with NET formation and the release of species and proteolytic enzymes, which can drive severe epithelial and endothelial injury (2,34). To study whether the inflammationdisrupting effect of metoprolol reduced the production of these neutrophil activation byproducts, we measured the NETosis markers Cit-H3 and MPO-DNA complexes. Levels of both markers were decreased in day 4 BAL from metoprolol-treated patients (P \u00bc 0.005 and P \u00bc 0.086 vs baseline, respectively), whereas no changes were observed in BAL from control patients (Figure 1C). Lower NET formation and inflammatory content in the metoprolol group was confirmed by Giemsa staining (Figure 1D). We found no differences in cell-free DNA content (Supplemental Figure 3), probably reflecting its nonspecific nature as a NETosis biomarker (3). To determine if attenuated immune-cell infiltration in the lungs was associated with a systemic effect, we assessed changes in circulating levels of chemokines known to be markedly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients (34). The 3-day treatment with metoprolol was associated with a significant reduction in the circulating concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 (median: 94.4 pg/mL [Q1, Q3: 72.1, 168 pg/mL] vs median: 80.1 pg/mL [Q1, Q3: 69.5, 85.2 pg/mL] for baseline and day 4, respectively; P \u00bc 0.003), whereas no changes were observed in controls (Supplemental Figure 4). Metoprolol had no significant effect on circulating levels of IL-6 (Supplemental Figure 4) or NETosis markers (Supplemental Figure 5). METOPROLOL TREATMENT IMPROVES RESPIRATORY FUNCTION.

In this study, we present the effects of 3-day intravenous metoprolol administration on lung inflammation in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The MADRID-COVID pilot trial shows the following: 1) IV administration of the clinically approved b-blocker metoprolol tartrate is safe in this clinical context; 2) metoprolol treatment abrogates the exacerbated lung inflammation associated with the disease; and 3) the disruptive effect on exacerbated inflammation is associated with better oxygenation and, consequently, fewer days on IMV and in the ICU (Central Illustration). These data suggest that metoprolol repurposing for the treatment of ARDS in COVID-19 patients is a safe and inexpensive strategy with the potential to improve outcomes. The present study stems from our extensive experience in the field of myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion injury. We previously demonstrated that metoprolol protects the heart during ongoing myocardial infarction by stunning neutrophils and abrogating exacerbated inflammation (20,24). The identification of this cardioprotective mechanism created an opportunity to repurpose metoprolol for other acute conditions in which exacerbated inflammation plays a role, as is the case for COVID-19associated ARDS. The present study highlights the importance of knowing the mechanism of action of long-established drugs to identify other potential indications. Patients with severe COVID-19 present with bilateral pneumonia that can lead to respiratory distress requiring IMV. COVID-19-associated ARDS is characterized by active neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space, which perpetuates exacerbated inflammation, leading to a cytokine storm and hypoxemia (8,34). Neutrophil infiltration is thus a major contributing factor to the poor prognosis of these patients. Mitigation of immune dysregulation is therefore a major therapeutic avenue for the treatment and prevention of severe COVID-19.Several studies have tested the potential benefits of b-blockers in sepsis/septic shock. Retrospective observational data have suggested that patients admitted with septic shock and previously on maintenance b-blocker therapy have a better vital prognosis than those who were not on b-blockers before admission(13). In addition, small prospective clinical trials have tested the benefits of IV b-blockers in sepsis patients(12,(39)(40)(41). The conclusion of most of these trials is that b-blockers seem to offer a clinical benefit.In an analysis of diverse experimental models of exacerbated inflammation, we very recently showed that not all b1-selective blockers exert the same effects on neutrophil biology. Of all tested b-blockers,only metoprolol significantly attenuated exacerbated inflammation and reduced neutrophil infiltration and interaction with other cell types (24). Those results position metoprolol as the b-blocker of choice in the context of exacerbated inflammation. The present study shows that 3-day treatment with IV metoprolol reduces exacerbated inflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with associated ARDS. This was evidenced by the attenuation of infiltration by immune cells, especially neutrophils, and reduced levels of their related pro-inflammatory and NETosis byproducts (Figure 1), which are potential drivers of severe epithelial and endothelial injury. Lower neutrophil infiltration in metoprolol-treated patients was accompanied by a significant reduction in circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory IL8, which exerts chemotactic and activating functions on neutrophils, suggesting a systemic anti-inflammatory effect of this treatment (SupplementalFigure 4).",

Systemic markers of NETosis were unaffected at day 4; however, an effect over a longer time window after metoprolol treatment cannot be discarded (Supplemental Figure 5). The ameliorative effect of metoprolol on pulmonary inflammation of COVID-19 patients with ARDS was associated with strong indicators of clinical benefit, demonstrated by a significant improvement in oxygenation (PaO 2 :FiO 2 ) not seen in control patients (Figure 2). These results are very encouraging, but further large-scale trials are needed to validate the clinical benefits of metoprolol in this context. Given that neutrophils play a major role in the pathophysiology of ARDS of many causes (not only COVID-19 related), further large validation studies might include a wide spectrum of patients with this condition. The MADRID-COVID pilot trial has demonstrated that IV administration of the clinically approved b-blocker metoprolol to critically ill patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19 is safe and disrupts the exacerbated lung inflammation associated with the disease. The beneficial effects on exacerbated inflammation were associated with better oxygenation and a nonsignificant reduction in the number of",

COVID-19 patients. Although these data need to be corroborated in a larger sample, metoprolol is a clinically available and cheap drug (daily treatment costs <2V) that can improve outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.STUDY LIMITATIONS. The main limitation of this study is the small sample size. The study was powered to detect differences in lung inflammation and not clinical events. Another limitation is the singlecenter nature of the study. This was an open-label study, and treating physicians were not blinded to treatment allocation. Finally, we cannot rule out a selection bias resulting in patients with very poor condition according to physicians not considered for inclusion. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that IV administration of metoprolol to patients with severe COVID-19-associated ARDS is safe and abrogates the exacerbated lung inflammation associated with the disease. Reduced lung inflammation was associated with a significant improvement in oxygenation and with a trend toward fewer days on mechanical ventilation and of ICU admission. Metoprolol repurposing for the treatment of ARDS associated with COVID-19 is a safe and cheap intervention that can help to alleviate the massive personal and health care burden associated with the pandemic.

PERSPECTIVES COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES: In critically ill patients with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilatory support, intravenous administration of metoprolol upon admission to the ICU is safe and improves pulmonary function and clinical outcome.

Due to the small sample size, all distributions were considered non-normal, and nonparametric tests were applied for statistical analyses. Paired comparisons between pretreatment and post-treatment samples (basal and 4 days) were by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Comparisons between treatment conditions (vehicle vs metoprolol) at baseline or after treatment were made by unpaired Mann-Whitney U test. For hemodynamics and functional parameters during metoprolol administration, differences at baseline or pre-post boluses were calculated by the nonparametric chi-square Friedman test with correction by the Durbin-Conover test for pairwise comparisons.For categorical data, percentages were compared by exact methods. Differences were deemed statistically significant at P values below 0.05.RESULTSPATIENT CHARACTERISTICS. Between October 19, 2020, and January 19, 2021, a total of 20 patients were enrolled; 12 were randomized to metoprolol and 8 to control. There were no between-group differences in baseline characteristics (Table 1). All patients were treated during ICU admission with corticosteroids (dexamethasone 6 mg daily), anticoagulants, melatonin, and acetylcysteine. Before enrollment in the trial, all patients (except 1 in the metoprolol group) were treated with bolus and maintenance dose of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone and/or dexamethasone) in the ward before admission to the ICU without differences between groups. Of the patients randomized to metoprolol, 11 received all scheduled IV doses (15 mg daily for 3 days). The remaining patient received 15 mg of metoprolol on the first 2 days but not the third because the heart rate was <50 beats/min caused by intensified sedation (initiation of propofol). BAL was conducted without complications in all patients before and 24 hours after treatment. Clinical laboratory analyses at baseline and after treatment are presented in Supplemental Table 1.
