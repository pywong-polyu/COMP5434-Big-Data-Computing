In this case, the rankings of alternatives are changed strategically, which is the strategic weight assignment problem in MADM. However, the attribute weights cannot be changed easily and usually need a compensation. Some research denoted the compensation as costs and assumed that they are deterministic. In this paper, we study the strategic weight assignment based on robust optimization theory, which assumes that the uncertain costs reside in the uncertainty sets. With perturbation vector varying in box set, ellipsoid set and polyhedron set, it allows the costs to be considered with several different uncertain levels. A series of mixed 0-1 robust optimization models are constructed to set a strategic weight vector for a desired ranking of a particular alternative. Finally, an example based on the actual anti-epidemic performance data from 14 provinces and cities illustrates the validity of the proposed models. Comparison between the certainty model and the three robust models illustrates that uncertain unit adjustment costs always lead to the higher weight assignment costs. And a further comparative analysis highlights the influence that the weight assignment costs will increase as the uncertain levels increase.",

And there exist many approaches to obtain the attribute weights (Roberts and Goodwin 2002; Shirland et al. 2003; Horsky and Rao 1984; Pekelman and Sen 1974; Wei 2015; Gou et al. 2019) . For example, Tang and Liao (2021) applied a data mining technique to the large-scale MAGDM and adopted a natural language processing from to mine public attribute preferences when determining the weights of attributes. By assuming that the weight information is completely unknown and partly known, Gou et al. (2020) established two different models for determining the attribute weights. Different weights can lead to completely different ranking results. Based on this, the real objective of some decision makers (DMs) is not the maximization of the group interests but the maximization of their own interests. They may strategically assign the weights or dishonestly express their opinions. The dishonest or non-cooperative behavior in decision-making process have been analyzed widely. For example, Yager (2001 Yager ( , 2002 considered a kind of strategic preference manipulation and suggested a mechanism to modify the aggregation function to resist this manipulation. Palomares et al. (2014) and Xu et al. (2015) proposed consensus models to prospect and manage non-cooperative behaviors in decision-making problems with a large number of DMs. And it is natural to assume that the process of setting attribute weights in MADM problems is not immune to dishonest behavior. Liu et al. (2019) and Dong et al. (2018) proposed mixed 0-1 linear programming models to derive the strategic weight vectors and manipulate the alternatives to the desired rankings.",

The input data are not always precisely known and the influence of data uncertainty should be taken into account. (3) Depending on the amount of available information and the urgency of the time, the uncertainty levels can always be varied.

Although robust optimization is a relatively new research field, there have been many research works that have shown the value of this method in many applications (Gorissen et al. 2015; Qu et al. 2020) . For example, in the share-of-choice single product design problem, Wang and Curry (2012) proposed and evaluated a robust optimization model to address the issue of part worth uncertainty directly during the modeling stage. Yan and Tang (2009) considered the uncertainty in market demands instead of utilizing a fixed market share and market demands. Then, models were developed by stochastic and robust optimization methods and were tested using data from a major Taiwan inter-city bus operation. Ji et al. (2020) also considered the uncertainty in market demands and constructed a mixed integer robust programming model to solve the perishable products inventory routing problem, which considered the time window costs and opportunity constraints. Recently, Han et al. (2020) added the distributionally robust to minimum cost consensus model, overcoming the optimism of the original minimum cost consensus model and the conservatism of the robust consensus model. Qu et al. (2021) applied robust optimization method to measure uncertain costs and proposed three mixed integer robust maximum expert consensus models. Huang et al. (2020) studied a two-stage distributed robust optimization problem where the nominal distribution was estimated by data-driven approach and considered the risk aversion at the same time.",

            "text": "Existing studies always set attribute weights directly or according to some given rules. The premise is that DMs are absolutely honest and their ambition is to obtain a most optimal alternative. However, in real-life, different DMs may stand for different interest groups and probably strategically assign the rankings to obtain their own benefits. Besides, it is not easy to change the attribute weights and money is often needed in return. Based on the information in Table 4 , we assume that the manipulator aims to strategically set weights of the five attributes to illustrate the validity of the four MASWA models. In the following, we assume that a manipulator wants to make the alternative x k gets the desired ranking r * . Then, based on models P1, P2, P3 and P4, the manipulator can strategically set an attribute weight vector w * with minimum adjustment costs C * , to obtain the desired ranking order. For example, let x 1 be the target alternative and r * (x 1 ) = 1 be the corresponding desired ranking. The comparison of the solutions between different models is demonstrated in Table 4 . We can obtain the strategic attribute weight vector w * = (0.2, 0.5544, 0, 0.2, 0.0456) with minimum adjustment costs C * = 5.5614 by model P1. In model P2, the w * = (0.2, 0.5544, 0, 0.2, 0.0456) with minimum weight adjustment costs C * =6.3056.w * = (0.2, 0.5544, 0, 0.2, 0.0456) and C * =6.0110 can be calculated by model P3. As for model P4, the w * = (0.4528, 0.5188, 0, 0.0177, 0.0107) and minimum costs C * =11.4754 . Then, strategically set the rankings of x 3 , x 4 and x 11 in a same way, the corresponding results are shown in Table 5 . Particularly, we can see that there are no solutions under all the four models when we want x 3 to achieve the first order, which means that the ranking order cannot be assigned arbitrarily.",

From Figs. 1 and 2, we can see the minimum adjustment costs on manipulating x 2 and x 10 from Ranking 1 to Ranking 5 by the proposed four models. For the three robust cases, in comparison with the deterministic model P1, all the three robust minimum adjustment costs are higher than that under certainty situation. It means that it often cost more when cost varying on uncertain sets. Therefore, in real-life decision-making problems, information should be collected extensively to reduce the uncertainty of the environment, so as to reduce the decision-making costs. On the contrary, the uncertainty of weight modification costs can also be increased to increase the difficulty of adjusting attribute weights and suppress the strategy weight assignment behavior. In Fig. 2 , we can find that all the minimum adjustment costs obtained by the four models equal to zero when we assign x 10 to Ranking 3.",

For example, we select alternatives x 2 ,x 4 ,x 5 and x 11 , and then set them to Ranking 1, respectively. Change the uncertain levels , \u03a9 and \u0393 in the three robust models from 1 to 6.

Unlike previous studies, we consider the difficulty of changing the weight and introduce a cost to measure it. Besides, we denote the unit adjustment costs with deterministic numbers and indeterministic numbers, respectively. Robust optimization theory is applied to describe the indeterministic costs. Robust optimization is widely used to solve problems under uncertainty. The key idea is to use uncertain sets to measure indeterminate parameters and then optimize against worst-case realizations within the sets. This method also takes the uncertain level into account, which has a huge influence on the total adjustment costs. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:",

According to the LO Duality Theorem, the same conclusion can be yielded: the optimal value in (CP) is \u2264 \u2212 c T 0 d \u2212 B if and only if there is the optimal value in (CD) and the value is \u2264 \u2212 c T 0 d \u2212 B .
