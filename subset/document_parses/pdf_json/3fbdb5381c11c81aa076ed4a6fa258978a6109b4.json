Our goal is twofold: first, we propose a novel spatial econometric model of the epidemic spread across NUTS-3 regions to identify the role played by commuting-to-work patterns for spatial disease transmission. Second, we explore if the imposed containment (lockdown) measures during the first pandemic wave in spring 2020 have affected the strength of this transmission channel. Our results from a spatial panel error correction model indicate that, without containment measures in place, commuting-to-work patterns were the first factor to significantly determine the spatial dynamics of daily COVID-19 cases in Germany. This indicates that job commuting, particularly during the initial phase of a pandemic wave, should be regarded and accordingly monitored as a relevant spatial transmission channel of COVID-19 in a system of economically interconnected regions. Our estimation results also provide evidence for the triggering role of local hot spots in disease transmission and point to the effectiveness of containment measures in mitigating the spread of the virus across German regions through reduced job commuting and other forms of mobility.",

This work is concerned with an econometric analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 in Germany during the first pandemic wave in spring 2020. The goal is twofold: First, we identify the significance of commuting-to-work patterns between NUTS-3 regions (Kreise und kreisfreie St\u00e4dte) as an explicit channel for spatial disease transmission before containment measures have been introduced in mid-March 2020. While it seems natural to assume that the spread of COVID-19 has a spatial dimension, estimating the magnitude of mobility effects related to professional and social interactions is challenging as these interactions are difficult to measure (e.g., social contacts with family and friends, shopping behavior, etc.) and disentangle-even with novel digital data sources such as mobile phone or social media data available (see Schlosser et al. 2020 , for an overview). 1 The identification strategy proposed in this paper makes use of detailed information on interregional commuting flows across German NUTS-3 regions measured at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to proxy structural labor market interdependencies between regions. Although pre-COVID-19 data on interregional commuting cannot directly track behavioral changes in mobility patterns associated with the pandemic development (see, e.g., Lee et al. 2020; Pepe et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2020; Schlosser et al. 2020 , for this type of analysis using mobility as key outcome), we argue that the main advantage of our identification strategy is precisely to exploit this exogeneity of using pre-pandemic mobility data to size the infection effects from mobility at the regional population level. To do so, we estimate a series of spatial panel error correction models (SP-ECMs), which allow us to combine elements from a theoretically grounded long-run specification of epidemic diffusion between regions together with a flexible short-run approach that accounts for the nonlinear dynamics of new COVID-19 cases.",

            "text": "Building on the SP-ECM specification, our second goal is to assess the effects of containment (lockdown) measures on the strength of interregional disease transmission through job commuting. In the case of Germany, several public health measures were targeted to reduce the mobility of the population in spring 2020 (e.g., Berlemann and Haustein 2020; Hartl and Weber 2020) . While, for instance, almost all white-collar workers have been encouraged or ordered to work from home, education institutions, most retail stores and service activities (restaurants, bars, hairdressers, etc.) have been temporarily closed during the first lockdown between mid-March and mid-April 2020. We test for the effectiveness of such mobility constraints in slowing down the epidemic spread by measuring changes to the strength of spatial diffusion of COVID-19 across German regions with and without policy interventions in place. We argue that the analysis of the first pandemic wave and lockdown phase in Germany during spring 2020 is well suited to answer our research questions as both (a) the international arrival of COVID-19 and (b) the imposition of containment measures can be regarded as an exogenous shock to the local population so that early anticipation effects biasing our estimation results are likely to be small. This is less so the case for the second wave in autumn 2020 with lockdown measures being imposed in a much more staggered way accompanied by an inconsistent implementation of these rules (Warren et al. 2021) .",

The main novel finding from our study is that this spatial correlation is significantly determined by job commuting-even when we control for other types of spatial dependence. Particularly, job commuting was found to be the first factor that significantly correlated with the spatial spread of COVID-19 after its international arrival in February 2020. With regard to the size of this propagation effect, we find that a doubling of new COVID-19 cases in neighboring regions interconnected through commuting flows is associated with an up to 20% higher number of new COVID-19 cases in a region. Importantly, we also find that the estimated spatial commuting channel (different from spatial dependence of general form) breaks down once mobility restrictions during the first lockdown are in place, which points to the effectiveness of such strict measures in mitigating spatial disease transmission. Our estimated effect size is comparable to recent other studies, such as for US cities reported in Glaeser et al. (2020) .",

This is followed by a brief discussion of the empirical specification and estimator choice in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the data and variables. In this section, we also refer to institutional details of containment measures in Germany and discuss the time span when new infections can be expected to be shown in the data.

A particularly influential analysis tool for analyses in this context is the susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) model (see H\u00f6hle 2016 , for an overview). 2 SIR-type models can be spatialized by dividing the overall population into a number of sub-populations in different geographical areas and by allowing for various types of linkages between these sub-populations, for instance, proxied through the geographical distance between them. In the case of directly transmitted human diseases (such as COVID-19), a distinct focus is often placed on the temporary, recurrent movement of infectious individuals between sub-population, e.g., through job commuting and long-distance airplane travelling. A specific commuter-based SIR model is, for instance, presented in Tizzoni et al. (2014) .",

While the endemic component typically includes deterministic short-and long-run trends in new disease cases (e.g., seasonal variations), the epidemic dynamics is essentially estimated as an autoregressive specification of new disease cases (i.e., the reproduction of cases in the own region), regional population levels to proxy the stock-flow relationship between susceptibles, infectious and newly infected together with random regional effects and covariates capturing the infection dynamics in other, spatially interconnected regions. A standard way to incorporate spatial dependence in the HHH and related multivariate time-series SIR models is to rely on gravity-type mechanisms relating interregional disease transmission between sub-populations to the inverse geographical, social and/or economic distance between them (e.g., Xia et al. 2004 ).",

While the focus in Chinazzi et al. (2020) is on the national and international COVID-19 transmission delay caused by the travel ban from Wuhan, China, in January 2020, Gatto et al. (2020) model the countrywide spread of the COVID-19 in Italy on the basis of provincial data and estimate the effects of restrictions posed to human mobility and human-to-human contacts. Their findings from a spatial SIR model indicate that lockdown measures associated with professional and social mobility constraints have significantly reduced COVID-19 disease transmission rates. McGrail et al. (2020) investigate the effect of social distancing policies on community mobility. The authors find for US data from the Google mobility reports that average mobility rates in response to regional or national mitigation policies declined by 40-50%. Similarly, Klein et al. (2020a, b) find for interregional mobility data in the USA that COVID-related mobility constraints temporally coincide with a strong reduction in overall mobility patterns (commuting volumes between US census tracts and inter-city travel, i.e., visits of two US Census Bureau Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) within 24 h) by up to 60%. Extending this descriptive evidence, Glaeser et al. (2020) study the causal impact of changes in mobility on the development of COVID-19 per capita for five US cities. The authors find that a decrease of roughly 20% in COVID-19 cases for every 10% points falls in mobility.",

Key findings from their network analysis of mobility changes are that (a) long-distance travel has been strongly reduced during the spring lockdown rendering mobility patterns more local and (b) the density of the German mobility network has been reduced. The authors use a spatial SIR model to assess the mediating effect of changes in a mobility network (although the model is not calibrated to COVID-19 parameters).

Their analysis is focused on predicting regional counts (NUTS-3 regions) of newly infected persons in the HHH-model framework and on evaluating the effectiveness of three waves of containment measures during spring 2020. Estimation results indicate that particularly the first wave of containment measures (ban of mass events) contributed to flatten the curve of new infections. Similar to Berlemann and Haustein, results reported in Wieland (2020) provide mixed evidence for a regional trend change in infections around the timing of public interventions in spring 2020. As the author points out, in nearly two-thirds of German counties the flattening of the infection curve was found to occur before the full lockdown came into force on March 23 and one in eight counties even experienced a decline of infections even before the closures of schools, child day care facilities and retail facilities. Kergassner et al. (2020) use a combined SIR-type and mobility network model to study the effect of infections stemming from selected \"seeds\" such as (a) Heinsberg in Germany during the Carnival season 2020 and (b) returning travelers from Ischgl in Austria. The authors conclude that refraining from traveling and large events are two key interventions that can effectively attenuate the spreading of COVID-19 at the regional level. Felbermayr et al. (2020) similarly report that the road distance to Ischgl is an important predictor for infection cases across German regions and that mobility restrictions have helped to suppress the further disease spread.",

As shown in the online appendix in greater detail, we can formulate ex ante expectations about the strength of spatial (dis-)equilibrating forces induced by this adjustment mechanism which depend on the state of regions along an S-shaped infection curve during an epidemic wave. That is, if regions move along their S-shaped infection curves below its turning point, we expect that the coefficient for u i,t\u2212p is positive and exerts a disequilibrating force, i.e., it increases the differences in new cases between region i and its geographical neighborhood in the short run. Beyond this turning point, however, we expect that an equilibrating mechanism comes into play. Accordingly, tracking the evolution of over time allows us to predict the peak of an epidemic wave.

(1) is estimated straightforwardly as dynamic fixed effects model (DFE) by ordinary least squares (OLS) given that it only includes predetermined space-time lags of \u0394covid i,t as right-handside regressors, i.e., we do not need to account for the endogeneity of the included spatial lag terms. We refrain from applying bias-correction or generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation methods for the short-run equation since earlier research has shown that the estimation bias in the AR coefficients becomes negligible for sufficient time periods (Judson and Owen 1999) . Similarly, Korniotis (2010) has shown through Monte Carlo simulations that with increasing number of time observations the reduction in the percentage mean bias in \u2211 M m=1 m is larger for the DFE estimator compared to a bias corrected estimator or the Andersen-Hsiao-type IV estimator. Finally, GMM methods are typically found to suffer from instability with regard to the choice of overidentifying restrictions used for estimation (e.g., Ziliak 1997; Windmeijer 2005) .",

The choice of maximum likelihood estimation is mainly motivated by the contemporaneous inclusion of the spatial lag of covid i,t as endogenous right-hand-side regressor. For the case that the long-run specification in Eq. (2) contains more than one spatial weighting matrix, we impose exogeneity assumptions on the spatial lag terms included to facilitate estimation. Finally, as stated above, for both the short-and long-run specification, we argue that the inclusion of two-way (region-and time-) fixed effects is crucial factor for ensuring estimator consistency in the presence of unobserved regional heterogeneity. We thereby essentially deviate from the estimation practice chosen in related studies on the HHH model such as Berlemann and Haustein (2020) , which assume that time-constant differences in regional infection cases are randomly distributed across regions. The inclusion of region-fixed effects together with space-time dynamics motivates our choice for using a linear panel data model instead of count data regression approaches. 8 While it seems natural on first sight to apply count data estimators for our analysis of new COVID-19 infections at the regional level, we follow the methodological literature arguing that standard count data estimators, such as the Poisson conditional maximum likelihood estimator with individual specific constants, are inconsistent in settings that involve (two-way) fixed effects together with a dynamic panel data structure (Blundell et al. 2002) and may thus result in severe estimation biases. 9 As Manning and Mullahy (2001) report, the log-transformed OLS estimator deals particularly better with heavy-tailed data than many generalized linear model (GLM) alternatives, such as Poisson-like and gamma models. While the log-transformation of data with zero entries is not without limitations either (Bell\u00e9go and Pape 2019), we carefully account for the pitfalls of this linearized dynamic panel data approach and test for biases associated with the transformation and back-transformation of the data for model predictions.",

            "text": "Finally, to be able to formally test for the effect of policy interventions on the evolution of new COVID-19 cases, we need to consider that reported cases only appear in the data with a certain time lag. Two aspects determine this time lag: First, we need to consider an incubation time. Prior research has documented a median incubation time of 5.2 days for COVID-19 infections (Linton et al. 2020 and Lauer et al. 2020) . Secondly, we need to account for a reporting lag, i.e., the time period between the outbreak of the disease (first symptoms) and the recording of a new COVID-19 case in the data. The median reporting lag for German data is found to be of almost similar size as the incubation time, which implies a median overall transmission lag of approximately 10.5 days (see Mitze et al. 2020 ). Table 2 reports the estimated short-and long-run coefficients for alternative SP-ECM specifications. Optimal lag selection has been guided by statistical information criteria (see Table S6 in the online appendix for details). 14 The table reports coefficient sums for the AR component and space-time lags together with associated standard errors calculated on the basis of the Delta method. For all specifications, we find that newly reported COVID-19 cases are autoregressively distributed over time; in most cases, the estimated coefficient sum for L = 4 is about 0.5, i.e., a doubling of new cases in the last four days leads to an increase in new cases by roughly 14 The model's explanatory power increases with the inclusion of additional lags starting from a simple AR(1) specification but becomes smaller for a lag size larger than L = 4 and M = 4. We thus argue that the latter lag structure is sufficient to capture both the short-run temporal and spatial dynamics of new infections.",

When we look at the estimation results that combine spatial lags calculated on the basis of metric information (gross commuter flows and inverse distances), the results in Table 2 further point to (a) larger spatial transmission effects when gross commuter flows are used instead of a binary dummy for a common commuting zone (given that higher order neighbors are considered as well) and (b) that commutingbased interregional dependence dominates the overall effect size stemming from spatial dependence in the data generating process. This can, for instance, be seen in columns (VII) and (VIII) showing that space-time lags calculated on the basis of inverse distances turn nonsignificant or negative once we include space-time lags calculated on the basis of gross commuter flows.

All three regions have been epidemic epicenters during the first COVID-19 wave in Germany, for which the local disease dynamics can be traced back to individual superspreading events, for instance, related to 16 The online appendix additionally assesses the robustness of the estimated effects for alternatively specified outcome variables in the linear dynamic panel data model and alternative estimators including a negative binomial (NegBin) panel data model with random and fixed effects. However, since model properties of the NegBin specification are unclear in dynamic panel settings (e.g., related to the initial condition problem in nonlinear models), the obtained (unadjusted) estimates should only be seen as a rough proxy for comparison purposes. All in all, these specifications provide similar (or even higher) estimates for the included space-time lag coefficients for the short-run dynamics and thus underline parameter robustness in the baseline SP-ECM rendering the reported DFE coefficients conservative estimates of the propagation effect of commuting to work. 17 In the estimation of the long-run specification as shown in Eq. (2), we avoid estimating specifications with higher order spatial weights by assuming strict exogeneity of one of the two included spatial lag terms. The results show that the estimated coefficients remain very stable regardless which spatial lag term is treated as exogenous right-hand side regressor. For the results shown in Table 2 , we have maximized the concentrated log likelihood for the general spatial weighting matrix while included the commuting-based spatial lag term as an exogenous regressor. vacationers returning from ski holidays (in the Main-Tauber-Kreis, the first 21 out of 23 infections were detected among travelers from a tour group returning from South-Tyrol); in the case of Heinsberg, the COVID-19 spread was triggered through social events in the carnival season (see Kuebart and Stabler 2020) . Over time, Fig. 2 indicates that larger urban areas, such as Hamburg and Hannover, exhibit a more dynamic COVID-19 development compared to their respective hinterlands. Finally, the residual plots also highlight why certain policy choices were taken. For instance, the local administration in Jena was Germany's first city to mandate the mandatory use of face masks in public transport and sales shops in early April (Mitze et al. 2020) . As Panel B in Fig. 2 shows, this policy intervention coincides with a relatively high number of infections in Jena relative to is spatial neighborhood in late March. The visualization of long-run residuals in Fig. 2 thus indicates that our proposed SP-ECM model can be used as a tool for the space-time surveillance of hot spots to identify locations for targeted policy interventions (Desjardins et al. 2020 ). In addition, the inclusion of u i,t\u2212p as additional source of newly reported COVID-19 cases adds a further predictive element to our SP-ECM approach, which complements the short-run parameter estimates.",

Model predictions for SP-ECM based on first-order contiguity spatial weighting matrix and commuting linkages measured on the basis of gross commuter flows; AR(4) = time-series autoregressive specification with L = 4; daily count along x-axis performance, Fig. 3 shows that the SP-ECM properly tracks the dynamic pattern of new COVID-19 cases for the aggregated German development. Importantly, the figure also shows that the chosen log-transformation and the subsequent back-transformation do not bias the predictions new cases in levels. The SP-ECM clearly outperforms the predictive performance of an AR(4) benchmark specification. By accounting for time heterogeneity in the parameters of the SP-ECM, we finally use the model to assess the effects of containment measures on the spatial transmission of COVID-19. Figure 4 therefore plots the estimated coefficients (rescaled to percentage effects) of the different model components by calendar weeks. Panel A and B plot the coefficients for the level (trend) component and the adjustment to the long-run spatial association between regions, respectively. While the trend component reflects that the number of new COVID-19 cases has increased over time between calendar weeks 10 and 13, we observe a sideward trend afterward and a consecutive reduction in effect size between calendar weeks 15 and 17. Accounting for incubation times and a reporting lag, this period coincides with the timing of imposed containment measures. The evolution of the estimated trend component in Panel A thus indicates that these measures were successful in suppressing the overall spread of the virus, although effects stay significant over time (evaluated against the baseline period before calendar week 9). The temporal distribution of the spatial adjustment component in Panel B of Fig. 4 supports our theoretical considerations that a spatial disequilibrating force (driven by emerging local hot spots) is observed if regions move along an exponential growth path of infections. Our estimation results indicate that this was particularly relevant in the initial phase of the first pandemic wave in Germany during calendar weeks 7 to 9. Hereafter, the effects turn nonsignificant pointing to a flatting of the German infection curve. With the imposition of mobility constraints, we further get evidence for an emerging equilibrating process as indicated by negative coefficients for u i,t\u2212p . Together with the general trend results in Panel A, this indicates that the first wave of new COVID-19 cases peaked around calendar week 13 (starting on March 23, 2020).",

Here, we find a significant spatial association already from calendar week 9 onwards, which phases out after calendar week 14 (starting on March 30, 2020). Taking a median incubation time and a reporting lag of 10.5 days into account, this phasing out of spatial association through commuting flows clearly coincides with the imposition of mobility constraints in mid-March as shown in Fig. 1 . This result also holds if we disaggregate newly reported COVID-19 cases by age groups (see the online appendix for more details). The latter disaggregation shows that COVID-19 transmission follows a similar spatial pattern across age groups for aggregate regional data. Taken together, our SP-ECM approach provides important empirical evidence concerning the effectiveness of lockdown measures in suppressing the spatial spread of COVID-19 in Germany. The commuting-based channel of disease transmission quickly breaks down after their imposition.",

In addition to the spatiotemporal short-run dynamics, we also find that disease trajectories for German NUTS-3 regions show a distinct spatial component in their long-run development. Importantly, deviations from this spatial long-run relationship can be used to identify and surveil emerging local hot spots constituting a significant effect channel triggering the short-run dynamics of COVID-19.",

While spatial disease transmission across NUTS-3 regions strongly matters during the initial phase of the first pandemic wave of COVID-19 in Germany, particularly correlating with commuting-to-job patterns early on, the timing containment measures during the German lockdown in mid-March 2020 coincides with a significant decline in the degree of spatial dependence across regions. This is most strongly shown for the commuting-based transmission channel, which quickly breaks down after lockdown measures have been initiated. Our findings of a decline in short-distance job commuting thus complement related studies pointing to a drop in long-distance mobility during the German lockdown and a reduction in the German mobility network (Schlosser et al. 2020) .",

Moreover, our analysis should not be seen as a strict causal investigation of policy effectiveness as our primary focus is on revealing space-time correlations in COVID-19 data; however, the significant temporal heterogeneity in estimated parameters strongly points to the fact that mobility constraints have been effective in slowing down the spread of COVID-19 across regions.",

With regard to the former, first survey results for Germany reported in Hofmann et al. (2020) indicate that the majority of firms in Germany was able to rapidly adapt to digitalized business processes. About 70% of surveyed firms reported that employees were able switch to major or full use of home office work during the lockdown period. Prior to the lockdown, only 15% of these firms allowed employees to use of home office work (to a large or full extent). With regard to the relative productivity performance, the available empirical results are mixed. Though some studies point at low or moderate productivity losses of home office work (Hofmann et al. 2020; Valoir 2020) , effects may considerably vary by education levels (Bartik et al. 2020) . Given limits to workplace digitalization, Morikawa (2020) predicts that a productivity gap between home office and regular on-site work is likely to remain also in the mid-run. Further, risks for firm innovativeness and worker satisfaction need to be considered (OECD 2020).",
