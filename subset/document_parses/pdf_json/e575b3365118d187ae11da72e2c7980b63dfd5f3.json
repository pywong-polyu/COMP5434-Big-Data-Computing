Health promotion strategies should be valued, and life skill education is a potential approach in this direction. This study aimed to investigate the implementation of an evidence-based life skill education programme during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy Region (Italy) by collecting opinions about the programme's usefulness and feasibility and identifying the strategies for implementing it through distance teaching. The study involved 63 middle school expert teachers, principals or coordinators in life skill education. An online questionnaire with closed-and openended questions was used. A qualitative content analysis was carried out using N-Vivo Answers software. The participants recognized the high value of life skill education at the time of COVID-19, but they showed reticence regarding its feasibility. Positive effects of the programme on both health and learning outcomes were reported. The obstacles were related to interpersonal aspects, student involvement, methods, organization and planning. Many strategies were suggested related to the teaching method, the curriculum organization and the adaptation needs. These strategies can be used to implement active and cooperative learning at a distance to reinforce students' life skills to cope with the crisis and promote their health.",

A significantly vulnerable population is represented by children and adolescents. Although children have proven to be resilient during crises, this characteristic cannot be taken for granted, and efforts should be made to ensure their growth and development [8] . School closures, distance teaching and social distancing have been shown to impact children and adolescents' health, learning and safety [4, 6, 9, 10] . In particular, the pandemic has reduced the time spent in learning and students' motivation to learning. It has affected many protective factors usually guaranteed by schools, such as equal access to education, different typologies of activities, and formal and informal education [6, 11, 12] . Fear, anxiety, frustration and boredom, isolation and depressive symptoms are common conditions during quarantines and pandemics [1, [13] [14] [15] . The school closures have denied children and adolescents social and emotional experiences necessary for their development and well-being [10] . Most children have lost the opportunity to experience healthy behaviours, such as healthy nutrition or physical activity, or access health services [16, 17] . The pandemic may also effect children and adolescents for long time. Disruptions to their education and the consequent widening of inequalities may affect their skills, increase drop-out risks and increase the probability of future unhealthy habits and risky behaviours [10, 18, 19] .",

It has a central role in empowering communities and individuals by enhancing social responsibility, social cohesion and solidarity [8, 19] . In the school setting, health promotion should be considered in the planning of educational strategies, and programmes that promote cognitive, social and behavioural skills, healthy attitudes, resilience and empowerment should be implemented [10, 20] . The World Health Organization (WHO)-Europe Technical Advisory Group for schooling during COVID-19 affirms that 'the principles of health promoting schools (HPS) are even more important in a pandemic' [21, p. 9] . A whole-school approach should be promoted to guarantee safe and including learning environments, develop skills able to impact learning and health, offer a positive social environment and connectedness, and assure positive and healthy experiences [22] [23] [24] . Moreover, evidence-based health promotion programmes and good practices should be implemented in this difficult period [3] .",

Life skills are psychosocial and interpersonal 'abilities for adaptive and positive behaviour that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life' [26] . They include decision-making and problem-solving skills, critical thinking, communication skills, social skills, refusal abilities, empathy building and the ability to cope with emotions, stress and changes. These skills can be promoted by the educational curriculum and the teaching methods employed to create and maintain healthy lifestyles, reduce risk behaviour, prevent non-communicable diseases and promote well-being [28, 29] . The WHO, United Nations and Unicef have promoted life skill education for approximately 30 years, and many evidence-based programmes have been validated and implemented around the world. Their efficacy increases when implemented through a wholeschool approach [25] . Stojanovic and colleagues [17] demonstrated the relevance of a life skill education programme during the pandemic in Croatia. Moreover, qualitative studies about adolescents' actual challenges showed the importance of educational activities that can allow them to share positive experiences with friends, include healthy practices in their routines, and receive support to share and cope with their emotions, even though remote education [30, 31] .",

Moreover, the evidence-based programmes that require a certain level of fidelity and inevitably impose constraints and are considered too challenging at that moment [17, 32] . Finally, active and cooperative learning, which include techniques such as modelling, behavioural practices or group work, are critical aspects in distance teaching or when physical distance limitations are present [32] . However, these methodologies are fundamental to develop a more inclusive and student-centred education, to promote participation and empowerment and to enhance the skills, health and resilience of students [9, 23, 33] .

All these elements are particularly important for health promotion, considering the relevance and the effects of relationships in this area [24] .

The first theme includes all the difficulties at the communicative and relational levels. Distance learning lacks physical contact, the immediacy of exchange and the details of non-verbal communication. The process of sharing between peers, a fundamental aspect of life education programmes, is limited. Educators refer to the difficulty in building nonsuperficial relationships due to the absence of proximity, daily contact and effective interaction at a distance. The respondents expressed doubts about the students' possibilities to express their emotions and grasp others' moods at a distance, which prevents empathic exchanges. Additionally, the class bond and the sense of community are difficult to maintain. The second theme includes all obstacles related to the students' involvement in activities. Their commitment is lower because of concentration and participation difficulties, and their disclosure is reduced. Other factors are associated with the actual situation. Distance teaching requires more autonomy in managing learning and schoolwork. Regarding the programme, students need to initially familiarize themselves with the programme activities and method, which is difficult to do at a distance if the programme has not been experienced in person before. As the lessons are followed from home, a lack of privacy, which is necessary when dealing with typical life skill topics (e.g. coping with emotions, shyness or relational conflicts), is highlighted in particular due to family members' presence and interference. Moreover, vulnerabilities due to the pandemic period and related to social, emotional and cognitive impacts have inevitable impacts. The third theme reflects the methodological difficulties of distant teaching. According to the participants, all the characteristics of active and cooperative learning (e.g. experiential learning, peer modelling and group work) are difficult to use, as are some specific techniques typical of life skill education (e.g. circle time and simulations). Additionally, the coaching role in guiding or monitoring students is challenging. The last theme regards organizational obstacles. Some difficulties are due to school reorganization. Teachers and principals underline the lack of continuity in school opening and are concerned about the possible fragmentation of the curriculum. Consequently, they perceive a lack of resources, and life skill education could be perceived as an additional task. Moreover, they struggle to create an adequate setting for life skill education activities. They report difficulties in creating a welcoming and non-judgemental virtual ",

The first theme focuses on methods to make explicit the educational goals of the work units and activities. Promoting students' life skills is important to make the students aware of the aims of their learning experience. To introduce the work unit and its aims, flipped classroom strategies are suggested. This method consists of reversing the traditional learning cycle; i.e. the lesson becomes homework while time in the classroom is used for collaborative activities, experiences, debates and workshops. In this context, the student plays an active and central role in the learning process. The strategies include the use of guiding tools prepared by the teachers to support students in identifying the unit's core elements autonomously. To close and summarize the units' main points, participating strategies to synthesize the contents, collect students' perceptions and value students' participation are suggested.",

To promote a good climate and student participation, it is important to check the students' involvement, consider that attention is more difficult to maintain in front of a screen and that students' interactions can also be promoted at a distance with specific tools. Another relevant issue to promote life skills is to give students the opportunity to confront and share thoughts, feelings and experiences with each other. This exchange can involve an individual presenting to the whole class or participation within groups or pairs. The participants suggested strategies that consider both direct and synchronous sharing and mediated sharing through students' material production. To foster cooperative learning, it is important to allow students to work in pairs or groups, alternating between plenary and group sessions. The group session objectives can be to share thoughts, feelings and experiences or produce specific materials and practice specific behavioural skills. Specific ideas and tools are suggested. ",

The difficulties related to the programme's practical implementation are particularly relevant, considering that the participants have high expertise with the programme. To better understand the answers to these closed-ended questions, the perceived usefulness and implementation obstacles were investigated through open-ended questions. The teachers and school principals reported positive effects of the programme on both health and learning outcomes. They referred to the programme's content, the importance of behavioural and transversal skills, the method, and the positive effects on relationships and climate. This result confirms the relevance of life skill education programme to promote health and reduce the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on students. However, many obstacles to programme implementation were identified to be related to interpersonal aspects, student involvement, methods, organization and planning.

A characteristic of many strategies reported is to value the students' autonomy in managing their learning processes. In many cases, students are required to prepare materials for the lessons, be creative in sharing experiences, practice without continuous teacher control and be responsible for their learning. This approach has several positive repercussions, both for curriculum organization and teaching and learning.

It would be an opportunity to enhance and validate students' skills, and it would reinforce mutual support between students. If students were familiar with the programme and responsible, continuous teacher monitoring and assistance would not be necessary, and teachers could play coaching and facilitating roles. This result confirms the importance of redefining the caring role of teachers in remote teaching and the relationship between students, students and contents, and students and instructor [45] . Some authors affirm that this new form of teaching can facilitate the reciprocity between lecturers and students and equalize power relationships [34, 35] . The strategies reported also value the digital tools' relational potential to protect the connections, both between teachers and students and between the students themselves. Actually, one of the merits of digital tools is that they make it possible to maintain a connection with others and encourage the communication necessary for comparison and sharing. Moreover, they make peer modelling possible at a distance, enabling observations between students, observations of common practices and the sharing of behaviour models. Additionally, group work can benefit from the careful use of digital tools. However, the participants underlined the importance of considering the setting created by digital platforms and the implicit message tools and context sent (e.g. privacy, hospitality and creativity). The capacity of digital tools to maintain connectedness and group work is particularly important considering the protective power of good relationships both for health and learning [24, 37, 46] . In particular, many strategies suggested aimed to maintain informal resources that often lack in online teaching [34] .",

However, in the literature, many obstacles and challenges have been identified in implementing this type of programme. The results of this study showed the importance of investing energy to overcome these difficulties. Teachers and principals value life skill education to achieve both health and learning objectives. Moreover, the potentialities and critical points identified should be considered to develop strategies and tools to promote and support life skill education implementation and a healthpromoting school approach. Finally, the qualitative analysis has made it possible to identify strategies to overcome organizational and methodological obstacles. These strategies can be used in all teaching activities to promote active and cooperative learning approaches, customize teaching methods according to individual characteristics, foster inclusion and equality, and develop a curriculum to encourage health promotion during this crisis. Moreover, many of the strategies identified may also be useful in the future to integrate digital tools into teaching. Schools and teachers must move from an 'emergency remote teaching' to a well-planned and designed online teaching [34, 35] .",
