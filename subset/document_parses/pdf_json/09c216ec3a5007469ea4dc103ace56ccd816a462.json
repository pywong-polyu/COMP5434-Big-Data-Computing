            "text": "Conventional approaches to isolate and characterize nanobodies are laborious and cumbersome. Here we combine phage display, multivariate enrichment, and novel sequence analysis techniques to annotate an entire nanobody repertoire from an immunized alpaca. We combine this approach with a streamlined screening strategy to identify numerous anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, and use neutralization assays and Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) epitope mapping to characterize their potency and specificity. Epitope mapping revealed that the binding site is a key determinant of neutralization potency, rather than affinity alone. The most potent nanobodies bind to the receptor binding motif of the RBD, directly preventing interaction with the host cell receptor ACE2, and we identify two exceptionally potent members of this category (with monomeric IC50s around 13 and 16 ng/ml). Other nanobodies bind to a more conserved epitope on the side of the RBD, and are able to potently neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 founder virus (42 ng/ml), the beta variant (B.1.351/501Y.V2) (35 ng/ml), and also cross-neutralize the more distantly related SARS-CoV-1 (0.46 \u00b5g/ml). The approach presented here is well suited for the screening of phage libraries to identify functional nanobodies for various biomedical and biochemical applications.

            "text": "Camelids, including llamas and alpacas, express unique immunoglobulins composed of just heavy chains 1 . The antigenbinding variable fragment is a single-domain that can be expressed recombinantly as a 15 kDa antibody fragment called VHH or nanobody. For applications where the functions of an Fc-domain are not required, nanobodies have many advantages over their full-size antibody counterparts. Nanobodies can be produced at high quantities much more costeffectively than monoclonal antibodies. Their small size and single-gene nature allows for easy cloning, modification, and functionalization and also permits better tissue penetration and, for imaging purposes, closer proximity of fluorophores or radioisotopes to the antigen. As a result, nanobodies have applications in cell biology 2 , structural biology 3 , cancer research 4 , and immunology 5 . In addition, nanobodies are ideal neutralizing molecules or perturbants of viruses. Potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. They neutralize the virus either by blocking ACE2 receptor interactions 6, 7 , or other mechanisms such as the triggering of conformational changes 8 . One affinity matured nanobody fused to a human IgG is currently in clinical development for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections 9 . Antigen-specific nanobodies are typically isolated from large immune libraries 10, 11 , or more recently, also from synthetic libraries 12, 13 . Typically, such libraries are screened using robust phage display or yeast display techniques. To encompass the larger diversity of non-immune and synthetic libraries, screening typically starts with ribosome display. Often these screens only yield a handful of useful binders. Other screens using lentiviral nanobody libraries allow direct phenotypic readouts that are more productive and limit the time-consuming functional testing of individual identified binders 14 . However, phenotypic readouts cannot be implemented in all cases. To address this gap, we combined the robust and versatile phage-display with rapid high-throughput functional testing, both bridged by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and enrichment analysis. Applying this approach, we identify a panel of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies, and provide detailed methodological descriptions enabling easy implementation in other nanobody discovery workflows.",

For each immunization, both proteins were injected separately into different flanks of the animal. Four days after the last immunization, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), amplified nanobody specific regions, and constructed a phagemid library. We performed three parallel phage selections on proteins C-terminally immobilized on magnetic beads. The first screen was performed with recombinant spike protein (\"S\"), the second screen with RBD (\"RBD\"), and the third screen with immobilized spike in the presence of non-immobilized RBD to deplete RBD-specific nanobodies from the phage pool (\"ScRBD\"). Thus, the RBD and ScRBD pannings should enrich for non-overlapping sets of nanobodies, and the S panning should enrich for the union of these.",

The premise of our approach was that when the starting library contains a large number of distinct variants with highly variable frequencies (as is expected of immune repertoires 15 ), the final frequency postpanning is dominated by the starting frequency of a variant. The enrichment -the increase in frequency due to panningwhich should be a better proxy for binding affinity, can be overwhelmed by the starting frequency. This suggests that the traditional approach of picking colonies post-panning 11 may miss potent nanobodies with low starting frequencies.",

To base our choices on enrichment, we need to know how reliable are the estimates of enrichment. Here we exploit the fact that the library construction step includes a primer with degenerate bases, allowing us to consider independent versions of each variant that differ at a synonymous position. A correlation plot of the enrichment for two versions of each variant shows excellent agreement for RBD and ScRBD, but weak agreement for S (See SI fig  1) . Possible explanations for this reduced correlation could be due to S offering more targets to the nanobody repertoire, increasing the competition and perhaps the stochasticity, or the introduction of a bottleneck at the start of the panning step, causing some variants to drop out. Regardless of the explanation, this indicates that enrichment calculated from the S panning may provide a less reliable signal of enrichment than RBD and ScRBD pannings. For further analysis, the cloning primer regions were ignored to provide total counts for all versions of each variant, from which the final enrichment metrics were calculated. Figure 2A shows the RBD against the ScRBD enrichment. As intended by the panning design, there were very few sequence variants showing enrichment in both of these panning steps. Further, we color by S enrichment, which tends to be higher when either RBD or ScRBD enrichment is high, but the unreliability of the S enrichment identified by the barcode analysis is also visible at this level, especially for variants that were smaller in the baseline library.",

For screening purposes, nanobodies with similar VDJ sequences should be avoided, but later it might be useful to screen further candidates related to any promising hits. This would be aided by a way of visualizing sequence relatedness. One standard approach for visualizing a set of sequences would be a phylogeny, or clustering dendrogram, but these are unwieldy for such large sequence datasets, often requiring multiple sequence alignments, and behaving poorly for regions of problematic homology, which are especially common in nanobody CDR3s. Here we adapt the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP 17 ) -an approach that is now standard in the single-cell RNAseq literature and popular in many other domains), but is not commonly used to visualize sequence data, possibly due to technical challenges. We circumvent these issues using kmer sequence embeddings 18 , and call the resulting approach \"seqUMAP\", which embeds sequences into two-dimensional space, such that closely related sequences are neighbours. Figure 2C -E shows seqUMAP embeddings of the entire nanobody repertoire, overlaid with different data for each variant. Where enrichment is plotted (especially for RBD and ScRBD, but less so for S), there is a striking spatial association with enrichment, showing that genetic relatedness strongly predicts whether a variant is enriched. The mutual exclusivity of RBD and ScRBD panning is recapitulated in Figure 2D , where entire regions of VDJ space are enriched exclusively in one or the other, but not both. We selected 72 nanobodies from across enrichment and VDJ space, shown in Figure 2B and C. Since less is known about anti-spike nanobodies that do not target the RBD, we biased our selec- Multivariate repertoire analysis. A shows the enrichment across three parallel panning runs, with RBD panning on the x axis, spike with competing soluble RBD (\"ScRBD\") on the y axis, and colored by spike (\"S\"). Variants selected for further screening are shown either upon the enrichment plot (B), or upon a seqUMAP embedding of the nanobody sequences (C), which embeds nanobody sequences into two dimensions such that closely related variants are neighbours. D shows which regions of seqUMAP space are targeting RBD (green), which are targeting the rest of spike (red), and which are not SARS-CoV-2 specific (blue). The lack of double-enrichment (yellow) in RBD and ScRBD shows that these two panning runs enriched for mutually exclusive variants, which is corroborated by the lack of points in the top right quadrant of panel A. E shows RBD, S, and ScRBD enrichment separately, as well as the CDR3 lengths (number of amino acids, square root transformed) for all nanobody variants overlaid on the seqUMAP plot.",

A band corresponding to the nanobody was visible for most periplasmic extracts at 15 kDa, alongside other bands typically of higher molecular weight (Fig.  S3 ). To get an estimate of the expression efficiency of the different nanobodies, we quantified the band intensity. For most nanobodies, expression efficiency and purity were sufficient to analyze binding specificity by ELISA (spike or RBD coated) and antiviral activity by pseudotyped virus neutralization assays.

We pair the ScRBD enrichment with the differ-ence between the Spike and RBD ELISA values.

The correlation for S was not significant, which is mostly because both spike and RBD targets exhibit S ELISA signal, reducing the variance, but may be due, in part, to the less reliable enrichment estimates for S than for RBD or ScRBD.",

This technology provides a powerful means to study protein dynamics and interactions in solution 27, 28 . In the case of epitope mapping it can be viewed as a comparison of deuterium uptake between two states of a protein (unbound and bound), where the interaction leads to a change in conformational stability and/or solvent accessibility. In brief, nanobody-RBD complexes and RBD were exposed to deuterated H2O resulting in hydrogen/deuterium exchange, followed by denaturation and digestion with pepsin. Peptides were then analyzed by LC-MS. Comparison of bound and unbound RBD then allows to identify areas with altered HDX. All the investigated nanobodies were found to exhibit clear and defined interaction sites on the RBD (Fig. 5B ,C). The structural resolution as defined by the degree of overlap of the peptides generated by pepsin digestion, i.e. the peptide map overlap, and the kinetics of the uptake is shown for respective state in supplementary file S1. Nanobodies E2 and C7 appear to have a common strong binding site spanning AA 487-496 where a strong protection was observed, with a unique weaker site for E2 spanning 441-452 and for C7 an extension of the strong binding site to include 471-486. F1 was the nanobody that introduced the most deuteration protection on the RBD, with a strong interaction at AA 352-361 but also at 392-400, 462-470, 483-492 and 514-530, explaining its exceptional affinity. When annotating these sites on a 3D structure of the RBD, it appears that F1 engages a large continuous surface. Finally, for G6 and E11 a common strong interaction site shows picomolar affinities (170 pM to <10 pM) for all tested nanobodies. B depicts HDX-MS signal across the RBD sequence, which is mapped onto the RBD structure in C, together revealing three distinct epitope classes. Right-most in C shows the positions of all RBD mutations occurring in Variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa, Epsilon, Eta, Iota and Lambda, shown in red.

Unlike the others, G6 shows an additional predicted disulfide bond between cysteines in the CDR3 and in FR2. E shows immunoprecipitation competition analysis, supporting these three epitope classes. C7 and E2, the two most potent neutralizers of SARS-CoV-2 target an epitope at the ACE2 interface, which explains both their potency and their lack of cross reactivity. Nanobody G6 targets an epitope that is well conserved across the founder virus of SARS-CoV-2, the beta variant, and SARS-CoV-1 (where there is only a single substitution relative to SARS-CoV-2), explaining its cross reactivity, with E11 having a similar epitope.

Epitopes in the RBD have been broadly classified into 4 classes based on overlapping epitopes frequently targeted by antibodies isolated from convalescent humans 29 . Nanobodies C7 and E2 were mapped to a class 2-like epitope, consistent with their ability to compete with ACE2 for binding to RBD, as well as the inability to neutralize the beta variant harbouring E484K. Nanobodies E11 and G6 were mapped to epitopes overlapping that of the monoclonal antibody COV2-2677 30, 31 , consistent with that of a class 4 antibody (that also more broadly includes the antibody CR3022 32 ).

To evaluate the therapeutic potential of neutralizing nanobodies for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used transgenic mice that express human ACE2 under the control of the cytokeratin-18 promoter (K18-hACE2 mice) 33 . These mice are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and experience weight loss following infection that correlates with pathology and disease severity 34 . One major limitation to the therapeutic application of nanobodies is their short half-life in vivo. We therefore conjugated C7 to a nanobody specific for Albumin (Alb1) that has been demonstrated to increase serum halflife 35 . Mice were challenged with 86 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (2.4 \u00d7 10 6 RNA genome copies) and subsequently treated with 320 \u00b5g C7-Alb1 (in 160 \u00b5l PBS) intraperitoneally (i.p.) on days 1 and 6 post infection. Untreated control mice experienced significant weight loss, beginning around 4 days following challenge. Both weight loss and viral load in oropharyngeal swabs were significantly lower for mice treated with C7-Alb1 compared to untreated mice (Fig. 6) . Although three animals treated with C7-Alb1 experienced some transient weight loss between day 5 and 6, weight loss was significantly reduced compared to untreated mice (Fig. 6A,B) .",

To identify potent dimers, we developed a screen to rapidly generate and test different nanobody combinations. We used sortase A functionalization and click chemistry to generate nanobody homo-and heterodimers as described in detail previously 36 . In brief, using sortase A, nanobodies were C-terminally functionalized with a dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) or an azide. Labeled nanobodies were then mixed and incubated to permit sprainpromoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and C-to-Cterminal fusion of azide and DBCO-labeled nanobodies (Fig.  7A) . Successful dimerization for all tested combinations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. S4) , with dimerization efficiencies ranging between 55-70 %. Given that we were screening for substantial potency increases relative to the monomers, dimer reactions were not purified further before testing for their neutralization potential (Fig. 7B) .

            "text": "Lineage-level analysis. Nanobodies do not exist as independent sequences, but as lineages arising from common VDJ recombination events that expand and undergo somatic hypermutation. Anti-spike single-domain antibodies from the same lineage are expected to bind the same epitope, but with varying affinities, and so identifying lineages can help guide both screening selection and downstream searches for optimized candidates. The grouping of sequence variants into lineage is not directly observed, and must be inferred from the sequences themselves. While the analysis of antibody lineages is growing in popularity in the antibody repertoire sequencing community, it has not been widely adopted for nanobodies, which may be, in part, due to the poor availability of germline sequence data. Many strategies for grouping lineages take all sequences with the same V and J germline assignments, and then cluster these based on the distance between their CDR3 38 . One of the benefits of relying on V and J assignments is reduced computational burden. The number of pairwise CDR3 comparisons is quadratic in the number of variants that must be compared, and splitting into groups by V and J assignment dramatically reduces the number of comparisons. Here we adopt a germline-naive lineage assignment strategy. Rather than V and J assignment, we use proximity in seqUMAP space to define a search neighbourhood over which to compare CDR3s (see Methods for a description of how to do this efficiently) and merge variants into lineages. Figure 8 explores the lineage structure of this nanobody dataset. In some cases, multiple nanobodies were screened from the same lineage. For example, panel D shows that three nanobodies, E11, G1, and F12, arise from distinct clades of a single lineage. These three nanobodies are up to 17 amino acids apart from each other, exhibit a 20-fold difference in potency between the most and least potent, and can cross neutralize the beta variant, and SARS-CoV-1. This lineage would be an excellent candidate for further screeningif another order of magnitude improvement were found in a variant on this lineage, this would be the most potent crossneutralizing nanobody in the dataset.",

            "text": "The use of nanobodies or nanobody-like proteins has increased greatly across a variety of applications in recent years. Although NGS-enabled analysis of immune repertoires is common for studying the elicitation and maturation of conventional antibodies [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] , this approach is not yet standard for camelid repertoires, nor commonly used for nanobody discovery. Here, we describe a rapid and straightforward approach to nanobody discovery that exploits the fact that, once established, nanobody libraries can be expanded indefinitely. This allows enrichment against multiple targets, which can be different sub-components or variants of the same antigen. Multiplexed NGS of the starting library and of each distinct enrichment step provides us with massively parallel information about the affinity of individual nanobodies against each target. In contrast to conventional panning and colony picking, this approach relies on enrichment metrics instead of post-panning abundance, which enables the identification of high affinity nanobodies even when they exist at low abundance in the baseline library, and are not sufficiently enriched to be sampled during traditional colony picking (see Fig. S5 ). Another benefit is that, as this approach relies on enrichment metrics, it only requires a single panning round. This could be expanded further to more complex antigens such as cell surfaces or different conformational states of proteins. Serendipitous discoveries have identified a number of nanobodies that recognize specific conformational states of proteins 43, 44 . By panning, for example, against different Grouping nanobody variants by their inferred lineage, sharing a common original VDJ rearrangement, allows us to interrogate the clonality of the alpaca immune response, the consistency of enrichment, and lets us identify other candidate nanobody variants that might have improved properties. A and B shows the enrichment of variants, organized by lineage, in RBD and ScRBD enrichment conditions. Like at the variant level, enrichment at the lineage level is mutually exclusive, suggesting that lineages are each restricted to a single target. The lineage ordering in A shows that, prior to panning enrichment, only 11 of the largest 250 lineages are spike-specific, and B shows how this shifts with a single round of panning. C depicts lineages overlaid on the seqUMAP embeddings, and D shows the phylogeny for a subset the variants from a single lineage, containing nanobodies E11, G1, and F12. Neutralization data shows a 20-fold difference in potency between E11 and G1.",

            "text": "conformational states and identifying nanobodies that are enriched in one but not the other, our approach could provide the means to rationally isolate nanobodies with such conformation specificity. This high-throughput approach provides joint enrichment and genetic information, and the genetic information allows grouping the nanobodies into lineages that will share func-tional properties. Most importantly, while their affinity may differ, nanobodies from the same lineage will target the same epitope. The advantages of a lineage-based analysis are twofold: i) It avoids redundancy arising from testing multiple highly related nanobodies in the initial screen, and ii) once a promising lineage has been identified, information from across the lineage can be leveraged to identify or further opti-mize nanobodies with improvements in a particular function. We demonstrate the utility of the approach using a nanobody library obtained from an alpaca immunized with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, isolating a number of extremely potent, neutralizing nanobodies. These included nanobodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in the low picomolar range, as well as broadly neutralizing nanobodies capable of cross-neutralizing Variants of Concern and SARS-CoV-1. Nanobodies E2 and C7 are among the most potent monomeric neutralizing nanobodies isolated to date, consistent with targeting of a 'class 2' epitope 29 overlapping the ACE2-binding site, which is highly represented among potently neutralizing antibodies isolated to date 45, 46 . Several neutralizing nanobodies have been evaluated against the beta variant, and the frequent resistance to neutralization suggests this is a frequent target for potently neutralizing nanobodies as well. Sziemel et al. 47 characterized three potent neutralizing nanobodies and, while one nanobody was similarly potent against beta, the other two neutralizing nanobodies failed to cross-neutralize this variant. Furthermore, a single mutation (E484K) was sufficient to recapitulate this escape. Similarly, in another nanobody library, the beta variant mutations (and E484K alone) were sufficient to almost completely abolish binding by two (out of 7) of the most potently neutralizing nanobodies 48 . F1, while not a potent neutralizer, shows exceptional binding properties that are of substantial benefit for diagnostic applications, where favorable binding may improve the ability to detect small quantities of SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The binding to a unique and conserved epitope, with associated crossreactivity to the beta variant, is also desirable since diagnostic applications need to maintain sensitivity in a landscape dominated by such Variants of Concern. G6, E11, and E4 are almost as potent as E2/C7, but exhibit robust cross-neutralization of the beta variant (B.1.351/501Y.V2), and no presently identified Variants of Concern harbour mutations in the epitopes identified for G6 and E11, suggesting that these may provide broad crossvariant neutralization. This property is becoming progressively more critical as Variants of Concern continue to emerge. For G6 and E11, this breadth is further supported by their neutralization of SARS-CoV-1, which has a single amino acid mutation in the epitope region common to G6 and E11, and one additional mutation in the E11-specific epitope region. Among sarbecoviruses that have the potential to use ACE2 (lacking two common deletions in the RBD that prevent ACE2 use 49 ), the overwhelming majority of these are identical in the G6 epitope to either SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2, and since G6 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and tolerates the substitution in SARS-CoV-1, it is likely to exhibit substantial pan-sarbecovirus neutralization for ACE2-using sarbecoviruses. We further show the therapeutic potential of nanobodies in a transgenic mouse model. A half-life extended C7 construct (C7-Alb1) administered following infection was able to rescue all treated animals from a near-universally fatal SARS-CoV-2 challenge dose. C7-Alb1 administered on day 1 and day 6 post-infection substantially reduced pathology, demonstrated by significantly reduced oropharyngeal viral loads and weight loss. To be applied as therapeutics or prophylactics, nanobodies may need to undergo \"humanization\" to reduce their immunogenicity. One generally successful strategy is to replace the nanobody framework regions with those from related human immunoglobulin genes 50 . With G6 in particular, the extreme variation in the CDR1 and CDR2 of enriched members of the G6 lineage suggest that binding may be completely dominated by the CDR3, suggesting humanization may be achievable without affecting neutralization potency. With its minimal binding footprint, a suitably humanized G6 construct would have exceptional potential as a broadlyneutralizing therapeutic or prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2 and its many emerging variants. plasmid, which was generated using funding from the South African Medical Research Council.

The plasmid was used for transient transfection of FreeStyle 293F cells using the FreeStyle MAX reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The spike trimer was purified from filtered supernatant on Streptactin XT resin (IBA Lifesciences) or Ni-NTA resin and purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200. The RBD domain was cloned upstream of a sortase A motif (LPETG) and a 6xHIS tag. The plasmid was used for transient transfection of FreeStyle 293F cells as described above. The protein was purified from filtered supernatant on His-Pur Ni-NTA resin followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200. Nanobodies were cloned in the pHEN plasmid with a C-terminal sortase motif (LPETG) and a 6xHIS tag. BL21 E. coli were transformed with this plasmid, and expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG at OD600 = 0.6 and cells were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C. Nanobodies were retrieved from the periplasm by osmotic shock and purified on Ni-NTA resin and size-exclusion chromatography. The albumin binding nanobody Alb1 was described earlier 35 and the sequence was obtained from WO/2006/122787. Sortase A 5M was produced as described before 36 in BL21 E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA and size exclusion chromatography. Fluorescent spike ectodomain was generated by first attaching dibenzocyclooctyine-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (DBCO-NHS) to the spike trimer in a 3:1 molar ratio, before attaching AbberiorStar-635P-azide by clickchemistry. The final product was purified from unreacted DBCO and fluorophore on a PD-10 desalting column. The biotinylated RBD was generated using sortase A and amine-PEG3-biotin as a nucleophile. The reaction was performed with 50 \u00b5M RBD, 5 \u00b5M sortase A 5M, and 8 mM amine-PEG3-biotin for 6 hours at 4 \u00baC. Sortase A and unreacted RBD was removed on Ni-NTA resin and excess nucleophile was removed by two consecutive purifications on PD-10 desalting columns. The biotinylated nanobodies were generated using sortase with a reaction of 100 \u00b5M nanobody, 5 \u00b5M sortase A 5M, and 8 mM amine-PEG3-biotin for 2 hours at 25 \u00baC. Sortase and unreacted nanobody was removed on Ni-NTA resin and the nanobodies were purified by size-exclusion chromatography or PD-10 desalting columns. Alpaca library generation and phage selection. The alpaca nanobody library used in this study was already described and used here 19 . In brief, one adult female alpaca (Funny) at PreClinics, Germany, was immunized four times in a 60-day immunization schedule. Each immunization consisted of two injections. For the first immunization, 200 \u00b5g of prefusion stabilized spike and 200 \u00b5g of S1+S2 domain (Sino biologicals) was used. Remaining immunizations each consisted of one injection with 200 \u00b5g RBD and one injection with 200 \u00b5g prefusion stabilized spike, both produced in Freestyle 293F cells as described above. The animal study protocol was approved by the PreClinics animal welfare officer commissioner and registered under the registration No. 33.19-42502-05-17A210 at the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety-LAVES and is compliant with the Directive 2010/63/EU on animal welfare. The nanobody phage library was generated as described by Hanke et al. 6 . Phage display was performed on biotinylated RBD immobilized on streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, Invitrogen) or strep-tagged spike immobilized on Strep-Tactin XT magnetic beads (IBA Lifesciences). To select for non-RBD binders, the phage enrichment on the spike protein was performed in the presence of nonimmobilized RBD. Next generation sequencing and enrichment analysis. Nanobody phage libraries were sequenced at baseline and after each panning, as described in Hanke et al. 6 . Briefly, phage libraries are amplified by PCR, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (2 x 300). The establishment of a nanobody phage library described above overwrites the N-terminal region of the VHH with a cloning primer, which includes ambiguous nucleotides. Here we used this to investigate the internal consistency of each panning step. Sequencing primers were trimmed, and reads were collapsed by identity, retaining the frequency of each sequence. We performed an interim frequency analysis that compares the frequency of the two most frequent \"versions\" of each variant, where \"versions\" have identical sequences after the cloning primer, but distinct ambiguities in the cloning primer sequence (considering the three N-terminal ambiguities to prevent bias driven by priming effects). If a panning run is consistent in which variants are enriched, then there should be agreement between two versions of each variant. Figure S1 shows that this is true of RBD and ScRBD panning, but much less so of S panning. For downstream analysis, the cloning primer region was excluded when calculating variant frequencies. To reduce sequence error and the volume of data for downstream analysis, we exclude all non-functional sequences (with early stop codons), and all variants that do not occur at least three times across all datasets. Enrichment is estimated as the change in frequency between pre-and post-panning sequence datasets, in the log10 domain. To avoid undefined log ratios, we use pseudocount regularization when estimating frequencies. Enrichment is defined as: log10(Fpost+ \u03b5) -log10(Fpre+ \u03b5), where Fx is the proportion of reads from dataset x, and \u03b5 is a small constant, which we choose to be the reciprocal of the number of unique variants across the entire dataset. Antibody repertoires exhibit complex relatedness patterns, due to the nature of VDJ recombination, and subsequent somatic hypermutation. To visualize the relatedness of sequences, we employ Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP 17 ). UMAP first constructs a neighbour graph in the original highdimensional space, and then searches for a low-dimensional embedding that best preserves the similarity (measured by cross-entropy loss) between the original neighbour graph and the graph implied by the low-dimensional embedding. UMAP does not natively work on sequences (especially not unaligned sequences), and so we first embed sequences in a high dimensional \"kmer\" space, in which the squared euclidean distance between closely related sequences well approximates their levenshtein distance 18 especially for sequences that are closely related. As is popular in single-cell RNA seq applications of UMAP, we first project the high dimensional kmer representations into an intermediate space by PCA, and then apply UMAP to these PCA coordinates. The approach (which we call \"seqUMAP\") is implemented in the Julia language and will be described in detail in a forthcoming manuscript. We apply seqUMAP to embed the set of 68,123 functional VDJ sequences into two dimensions.",

            "text": "Antibody repertoires are made up of distinct lineages. Within a lineage, antibodies share the same ancestor, but differ by somatic hypermutation. Clustering sequences into lineages typically relies on accurate V and J gene assignments, as the search for lineages is, for computational reasons, constrained to occur within sequences that share the same V and J germline gene. However, alpaca V gene databases appear to be incomplete, so we preferred an alternative strategy for lineage calling. We begin with our seqUMAP embedding of all of the nanobody variants. We construct a \"k-d tree\" 52 of the seqUMAP coordinates of all variants, exploiting this space-partitioning data structure 52 to efficiently define a neighbour graph for all points within a set radius (0.4 here) of each other in seqUMAP space. The CDR3 is the strongest signal for lineage membership, and we consider each edge in G, and prune that edge if the CDR3s are too dissimilar. For efficient comparison of CDR3s, we again rely on kmer embeddings, and a \"kmer distance\" which approximates a length-normalized levenshtein distance 18 . For CDR3s that are the same length, we prune edges where the kmer distance is greater than 12.5%, and for CDR3s of unequal length, we only allow up to 10% kmer distance. Most lineage calling strategies do not allow for any CDR3 length variation, which is partly for computational considerations, as this avoids a large number of pairwise alignment comparisons, but our kmer approach avoids any additional computational cost of comparing CDR3s of different lengths. Since CDR3 length variation is less common, and since allowing CDR3s of different lengths to be considered as the same lineage can lead to overly permissive lineage merging, we use a stricter distance requirement for CDR3s of unequal length. After CDR3-based pruning edges in G, the connected components of G define our single-domain antibody lineages. This lineage calling relies on consistent CDR3 calling. We used an alignment based strategy to identify CDR3s. We constructed a multiple sequence alignment of all amino acid variants, and defined the CDR3 as the portion of the alignment after the canonical cysteine to the end of the conserved DYW, and project these regions back into nucleotide space, as the comparisons described above occur on CDR3 nucleotide sequences. With the radii used for the analysis of our 68123 variant sequences, the exploitation of the seqUMAP neighbourhood reduces the number of pairwise CDR3 comparisons from 4.6 billion to 5.3 million, and the entire algorithm completes in around 15 seconds on a standard laptop.",

Epitope mapping by Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. All chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich, pH measurements were made using a SevenCompact pH-meter equipped with an InLab Micro electrode (Mettler-Toledo), prior to all measurements a 4 point calibration (pH 2,4,7,10) was made. The HDX-MS analysis was made using automated sample preparation on a LEAP H/D-X PAL\u2122 platform interfaced to an LC-MS system, comprising an Ultimate 3000 micro-LC coupled to an Orbitrap Q Exactive Plus MS. HDX was performed on an RDB, 0.6 mg/ml without and with nanobody (E2, C7, F1, G6 and E11), in PBS, pH 7.5 (Sigma-Aldrich, D8537). All HDX-MS was done in one continuous run, with runs of the apo state made in between the nanobody runs, in total 8 replicates were made for the apo state, for E2, C7, F1, E11 triplicates and for EB-G6 duplicate samples were run. Apo state samples constituted 2.5 \u00b5l RDB and 2.5 \u00b5l PBS and the interaction analysis samples, 2.5 \u00b5l RDB mixed with 2.5 \u00b5l ligand, the samples were diluted with 30 \u00b5l 10 mM PBS, pH 7,46 or HDX labelling buffer of the same composition prepared in D2O, pH(read) 7.10. The HDX labelling was carried out for t = 0, 30, 300, 3000 and 9000s at 20\u00b0C. The labelling reaction was quenched by dilution of 30 \u00b5l labelled sample with 30 \u00b5l of 1% TFA, 0.4 M TCEP, 4 M urea, pH 2.5 at 1\u00b0C, 60 \u00b5l of the quenched sample was directly injected and subjected to online pepsin digestion at 4\u00b0C (in-house immobilized pepsin column, 2.1 x 30 mm). The online digestion and trapping was performed for 4 minutes using a flow of 50 \u00b5L/min 0.1 % formic acid, pH 2.5. The peptides generated by pepsin digestion were subjected to on-line SPE on a PepMap300 C18 trap column (1 mm x 15 mm) and washed with 0.1% FA for 60s. Thereafter, the trap column was switched in-line with a reversed-phase analytical column, Hypersil GOLD, particle size 1.9 \u00b5m, 1 x 50 mm, and separation was performed at 1\u00b0C using a gradient of 5-50 % B over 8 minutes and then from 50 to 90% B for 5 minutes, the mobile phases were 0.1 % formic acid (A) and 95 % acetonitrile/0.1 % formic acid (B). Following the separation, the trap and column were equilibrated at 5% organic content, until the next injection. The needle port and sample loop were cleaned three times after each injection with mobile phase 5%MeOH/0.1%FA, followed by 90% MeOH/0.1%FA and a final wash of 5%MeOH/0.1%FA. After each sample and blank injection, the Pepsin column washed by injecting 90 \u00b5l of pepsin wash solution 1% FA /4 M urea /5% MeOH. In order to minimize carry-over a full blank was run between each sample injection. Separated peptides were analysed on a Q Exactive Plus MS, equipped with a HESI source operated at a capillary temperature of 250\u00b0C with sheath gas 12, Aux gas 2 and sweep gas 1 (au). For HDX analysis MS full scan spectra were acquired at 70K resolution, AGC 3e6, Max IT 200ms and scan range 300-2000. For identification of generated peptides separate undeuterated samples were analysed using data dependent MS/MS with HCD fragmentation. A summary of the HDX experimental detail is reported in Supplementary File 1. The mass spectrometry and HDExaminer analysis files have been deposited to the Pro-teomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (REF ID:30395289).",

Peptides identified by PEAKS with a peptide score value of log P > 25 and no modifications were used to generate a peptide list containing peptide sequence, charge state and retention time for the HDX analysis. HDX data analysis and visualization was performed using HDExaminer, version 3.1.1 (Sierra Analytics Inc., Modesto, US). Each nanobody + RDB state was analysed and compared to its four closest (in time) apo state runs. The analysis was made on charge states 1-6 for each peptide, allowed only for EX2 and the two first residues of a peptide were assumed unable to hold deuteration. Due to the comparative nature of the measurements, the deuterium incorporation levels for the peptic peptides were derived from the observed relative mass difference between the deuterated and non-deuterated peptides without back-exchange correction using a fully deuterated sample 54 . As a full deuteration experiment was not made, full deuteration was set to 75% of maximum theoretical uptake. The presented deuteration data is the average of all high and medium confidence results. The allowed retention time window was \u00b1 30 seconds. Heatmaps settings were uncoloured proline, heavy smoothing and the difference heatmaps were drawn using automatically calculated significance based on replicate variance. The spectra for all time points were manually inspected; low scoring peptides, obvious outliers and any peptides where retention time correction could not be made consistent were removed. As bottom-up labelling HDX-MS is limited in structural resolution by the degree of overlap of the peptides generated by pepsin digestion, the peptide map overlap is shown for respective state in Supplementary file 1. Nanobody competition assay. Immunoprecipitations for competition assays were performed with 8 \u00b5g of Cterminally biotinylated nanobody on M-280 streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen) and 10 \u00b5g of spike or RBD preincubated with 10 \u00b5g of the indicated (HIS-tagged) nanobodies. Bound spike or RBD was eluted in 0.2 M glycine pH 2.2 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.",

            "text": "K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories and maintained as a hemizygous line. Experiments were conducted in BSL3 facilities at the Comparative Medicine department (KM-F) at Karolinska Institutet. Ethics for studies of virus infection and therapeutic intervention were obtained from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (10513-2020). Mice were administered nanobodies as described in the main text and challenged intranasally with 86 PFU SARS-CoV-2 in 40 \u00b5l PBS following isoflurane sedation. Oropharyngeal sampling was performed on day 5, under light anesthesia with isoflurane. Weight and general body condition were monitored daily until weight drop started, whereupon mice were monitored twice daily. During the experiment, weight loss, changes in general health, breathing, body movement and posture, piloerection and eye health were monitored. Mice were sacrificed when they reached 20% weight loss or when movement was greatly impaired and/or they experienced difficulty breathing that was considered to reach a severity level of 0.5 on Karolinska Institutet's veterinary plan for monitoring animal health. The weight loss in response to infection was highly reproducible. In Fig. 6 data from 50% of the untreated, challenged animals are historical controls from previous experiments performed under identical conditions. This challenge experiment was run at the same time as that from Hanke et al. (2021) 19 , and the control mice were shared between both. RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Viral RNA was isolated from buccal swabs collected 5 days post infection and stored in 500 \u00b5l of TRIzol\u2122 Reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA extractions from buccal swab samples were performed using an adapted TRIzol\u2122 manufacturers protocol with a 45 min precipitation step at -20\u00b0C. RNA pellets were resuspended in 20 \u00b5l of RNase-free water. RT-PCR reactions were performed using 4 \u00b5l of resuspended RNA in a 20 \u00b5l reaction volume using the Superscript III one step RT-qPCR system with Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen) with 400 nM concentrations of each primer and 200 nM of probe. Primers and probes for the CoV-E gene target were as previously described 55 . Primers and probes for the ABL1 target were adapted from Ishige et al. 56 to enable detection of the murine homolog: ABL1-ENF1003-deg: 5'-TGGAGATAACACTCTCAGCATKACTAAAGGT-3' ABL1-ENR1063: 5'-GATGTAGTTGCTTGGGACCCA-3' ABL1-ENPr1043-deg: 5'-HEX-CCATTTTTSGTTTGGGCTTCACACCATT-BHQ1-3'. The CoV-E and ABL1 TaqMan assays were run in multiplex. Detection of the subgenomic CoV-E target was adapted from W\u00f6lfel et al. 57 , using a leader/E gene junction specific forward primer: sgEjunc-SARSCoV2-F 5'-CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTCTAAACG-3' All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Eurofins Genomics. Thermal cycling conditions for all assays consisted of RT at 55\u00b0C for 10 min, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, and 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C, 15s and 58\u00b0C, 30s. Reactions were carried out using a CFX96 Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) following manufacturer instructions. To generate standard curves, a synthetic DNA template gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies) was transcribed using the mMessage mMachine\u2122 T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) and serially diluted. To reduce sampling-related variability, SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were normalized by ABL1 copies, and this ratio was used for comparisons. ABL1 copies were not significantly different between groups. Generation of nanobody dimers by sortase-mediated functionalization and click chemistry. Nanobodies were functionalized site-specifically on the C-terminus using sortase A 5M with either an azide or a dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) and subsequently dimerized by Cu-free strain-promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry (SPAAC) reaction as described earlier 36 . In brief, nanobodies at concentrations ranging from 75 \u00b5M to 205 \u00b5M were incubated with 5 \u00b5M sortase A, 8 mM DBCO-amine (Sigma-Aldrich, 761540) or 10 mM 3-Azido-1-propanamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 762016), in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, for 3 h at 25\u00b0C. Unreacted nanobody, sortase A and excess nucleophile were removed using Ni-NTA resin and Zeba spin desalting columns (2 mL, 7K MWCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89890). Dimers were generated with a SPAAC reaction by incubating 30 \u00b5g of DBCO functionalized and 30 \u00b5g of azide functionalized nanobody in a 96-well plate for 72 hours at 4\u00b0C",

The relative amount of dimers in the gels (Fig. S4 ) was quantified using ImageJ and an E4 homodimer as a reference. Some homodimers, when produced at larger scale (Fig. S2) , were generated by combining azide-functionalized nanobody with bis-PEG11-DBCO to increase solubility. These constructs were purified by size-exclusion chromatography. Fig. SI1 . Within-panning consistency estimation. We compare two \"versions\" of each nanobody variant that differ by degenerate bases introduced with the cloning primer when establishing the baseline library. RBD and ScRBD panning shows consistency in enrichment, but spike panning is less consistent. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentiviruses are shown for nanobody dimers generated by Cu-free strain-promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry (SPAAC) reaction. E11 and G6 homo-and heterodimers neutralized with similarly high potency. An E2 dimer (with a short PEG11 spacer, E2-PEG-E2) was ultrapotent, with an IC50 of approximately 0.7 ng/ml (23 pM). SI5 . Lineage enrichment vs sampling probability. Each bubble represents a lineage, showing the mean enrichment for each lineage vs the probability that a single well would contain a member from that lineage, after a second round of RBD panning, estimated from NGS frequency data (left: linear scale; right: log scale). The skewed size distribution of lineages, where a small number of lineages are extremely high frequency, shows that colony-based sampling approaches will not reach the lower frequency lineages. As an example, we would have had to screen nearly 500 colonies to have a >50% chance of discovering a member from the lineage of our highest affinity RBD binding nanobody (F1).",

The lack of double-enrichment (yellow) in RBD and ScRBD shows that these two panning runs enriched for mutually exclusive variants, which is corroborated by the lack of points in the top right quadrant of panel A.
