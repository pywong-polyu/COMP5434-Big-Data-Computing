The economic costs of the COVID-19 are enormous in many countries (Amewu et al., 2020 , Andam, 2020 . In the United States (US), nearly 50 million people have been infected by COVID-19, resulting in more than 800,000 deaths. At the same time, over 70% of the US population aged \u226512 years has been fully vaccinated, and the percentage has reached 86% among older adults aged \u226565 years (CDC, 2021b) . Although the rapid development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines brought about hopes of curbing the pandemic (Burgos et al., 2021 , Corey et al., 2020 , recent reports of a growing number of breakthrough infections have raised serious concerns from the public ( , Bergwerk et al., 2021 . Both the rampant transmission of the SARS-COV-2 Delta variant and the waning protection of the existing vaccines likely contribute to the increasing number of breakthrough infections. New vaccination strategies, such as providing vaccine boosters to those who have been fully vaccinated, are currently being discussed (Burki, 2021) .",

Although the FDA approved the use of booster shots, debate continues as whether booster shots should be offered and, if so, to which populations (Burki, 2021) . On one hand, real-world data from countries such as Israel showed that booster shots significantly increased the vaccine's effectiveness, which provides additional protection against COVID-19, especially for older adults and people with compromised immunity ( Bar-On et al., 2021) . In addition, recent serological studies have demonstrated a substantial waning of vaccine-elicited immunity against SARS-COV-2 infection 6-11 months after administering its second dose (Chemaitelly et al., 2021 , Thomas et al., 2021 . On the other hand, the wide dissemination of COVID-19 booster shots may further increase the already skyrocketing healthcare costs and exacerbate the health equity issue exposed by the pandemic (Shadmi et al., 2020, Wang and Tang, 2020) . There is, thus, an urgent need to analyse the potential impact of widely administering booster shots in the US.",

Figure 2A showed that if the booster provided 62% additional protection against the infection to fully-vaccinated older adults, it would be costeffective even if the booster did not provide additional protection against the development of severe COVID-19 disease. Similarly, a combination of 50% additional protection against a SARS-COV-2 infection and 39% additional protection against severe COVID-19 would render the strategy cost-effective.",

Our finding showed that for the current booster shots to be cost-effective (>50% chance), the population incidence of COVID-19 in the US aged \u226565 years needed to be \u22658.1/100,000 person-day.

For example, if the proactive efficacies against infection and severe COVID-19 disease by both the 2-dose vaccine and booster would reduce by 10% (as of BNT162b2), the population incidence threshold needed to be 9.7/100,000 person-day for the booster to be cost-effective.",

Implementing the booster strategy in a cohort of 100,000 older adults would result in a net momentary benefit of $3.8 million in 180 days. Notably, the cost-effectiveness of the booster strategy is highly sensitive to the population incidence of COVID-19, with a threshold of 8.1/100,000 person-day being required to ensure the booster strategy to be costeffective.

African Americans reportedly have a lower vaccination rate and a greater disease burden of COVID-19 compared to Whites (Mackey et al., 2021) .

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, our study used a decision-analytic Markov model and did not account for the dynamic changes of population incidence of COVID-19. Second, we estimated the efficacy of the BNT162b2 booster against the Delta variant based on a synthesis of evidence from real-world data rather than randomised controlled trials. We conducted various sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in real-world data and parameter biases. Third, we did not consider the other COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., Moderna or J&J/Janssen) in the US. While the other vaccines, particularly the Moderna vaccine, represents a substantial proportion of COVID-19 vaccines administered in the US, they differ from the BNT162b2 vaccines in efficacy and price. It may not be reasonable to combine different vaccines together. Nevertheless, the BNT162b2 vaccine comprises the largest proportion of all COVID-19 vaccines in the US; thus, the cost-effectiveness result of the BNT162b2 vaccines and boosters would be most policyrelevant. As the latest data showed that the Moderna vaccine could be more effective than the BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing hospitalisations , the cost-effectiveness of a booster strategy, in reality, is likely to be more favourable than what we estimated. Fourth, we assumed that the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines begins to wane in 6 months after full vaccination. In reality, the efficacy of vaccines is more likely to gradually decline without a clear cut-off. This assumption may have led to an overestimate of vaccine efficacy in the short term and an underestimate in the long term. Fifth, we only evaluated the booster strategy for older adults. It is unclear whether the conclusion would be applicable to younger adults and children who have a lower vaccination rate but, at the same time, a lower risk of hospitalisation if diagnosed with COVID-19. This research question warrants further investigation. Finally, we did not consider recent emergence of the Omicron variant-a -high-mutated\u2016 variant-in our model as well as its impact on vaccine and booster effectiveness. Early data suggest that the current COVID-19 vaccines might be less effective in preventing infections caused by the Omicon variant, but the data and evidence are far from conclusive (Karim and Karim, 2021, Mohiuddin and Kasahara, 2022) .",
