            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) belongs to the family Flaviviridae genus pestivirus. The viral genome is a singlestranded, positive-sense RNA that encodes four structural proteins (i.e., C, Erns, E1, and E2) and eight non-structural proteins (NSPs) (i.e., Npro, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B). Cattle infected with BVDV exhibit a number of different clinical signs including diarrhea, abortion, and other reproductive disorders which have a serious impact on the cattle industry worldwide. Research on BVDV mainly focuses on its structural protein, however, progress in understanding the functions of the NSPs of BVDV has also been made in recent decades. The knowledge gained on the BVDV non-structural proteins is helpful to more fully understand the viral replication process and the molecular mechanism of viral persistent infection. This review focuses on the functions of BVDV NSPs and provides references for the identification of BVDV, the diagnosis and prevention of Bovine viral diarrhea mucosal disease (BVD-MD), and the development of vaccines.",

Due to the increasing number of reports and the gradual deepening of BVDV research, researchers have classified BVDV, such as BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. At present, BVD is prevalent worldwide, so the animal infection rate is higher in areas with developed animal husbandry. It is one of the main infectious diseases to the cattle breeding industry and has caused huge economic losses to the world's breeding industry. BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 can infect domestic and wild animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and camel. Among these susceptible animals, the clinical signs in BVDV-infected cattle are the most serious, including diarrhea, respiratory disease, immunosuppression, growth retardation, abortion, and decreased reproductive efficiency, which poses a serious impact on the production and health of the cattle herd [6] . Therefore, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) lists BVD as a Class B infectious disease, and BVDV control and eradication plans are in place in most of Europe, the USA, and the UK [7] . At the same time, China has also been listed as a Class II infectious disease in China's import and export inspection and quarantine. At present, the Class II infectious diseases have been adjusted to 154 in the latest standard [8] .",

The Cp biotype of BVDV can cause a series of cytopathological effects (CPE) in cells, such as cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death, while the Ncp of BVDV does not cause obvious CPE [10] . Because the fetal immune system is immature, and NCP-type BVDV (BVDV-1, BVDV-2) inhibits the ability of animals to induce type I interferon production. Therefore, cows infected with Ncp-type BVDV-1 or BVDV-2 in early pregnancy can directly kill oocytes, embryos, and cause abortion or stillbirth in cows [11] . If the fetus continues to develop, the virus can transmit vertically through the placenta to infect the fetus, making it a persistently infected (PI) animal [12] .",

However, their thyroid hormone concentrations were significantly lower than those of healthy calves, and their clinical manifestations were far lower than normal levels of feed intake, stunting, and growth retardation [13, 14] . The feces and secretions of PI animals contain a large number of viral particles, so they are one of the important sources of infection of the disease. PI cattle develop Mucosal disease (MD) when the non-cytopathic (NCP) form of BVDV they are infected with undergoes spontaneous mutation to the cytopathic form. The clinical symptoms were severe high fever, anorexia, diarrhea, bloody stool, and severe dehydration [15] . The disease is generally sporadic, the incubation period is one to two weeks, and the mortality rate of sick animals is extremely high. The clinical features of cows with the mucosal disease are hemorrhagic, necrotic, and ulcerative lesions. In addition, it is often manifested as loss of intestinal gland crypts, erosions, ulcers, and large-scale mucosal necrosis in part or throughout the entire gastrointestinal system [16] . PI animals with BVDV-1 or BVDV-2 are immune-tolerant to BVDV, carry the virus for life, and excrete the virus to become a new source of infection in the animal population, making it difficult to eradicate the disease [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, the complete elimination of PI animals is the most effective way to stop the spread of the disease. In addition, studies have found that BVDV-1 can be detected in semen, which poses a great threat to vertical transmission, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the detection of bulls [20, 21] .",

Darweesh et al. found that Ncp BVDV2a N pro can inhibit the production of type IFN-I by reducing the activity of S100A9 protein in somatic cells, thus enhancing the replication ability of BVDV in infected cells [34] . Furthermore, BVDV N pro can also inhibit the production of type IFN-I by degrading intracellular IRF-3 through the N pro proteasome [19, 33, 35] . Chen et al. found that the N pro of Cp BVDV-1a ( NADL strain) can degrade IRF-3 through ubiquitination and proteasome [36] . Further studies showed that the viral N pro has a zinc atom binding domain that can bind to IRF-3, resulting in the binding of specific E3 ubiquitin ligase to the N pro IRF-3 complex, catalyzing the polyubiquitination reaction of IRF-3, and finally degrading IRF-3 through the proteasome pathway. Moreover, CSFV N pro can also reduce the expression of IRF-3 [37] . These results suggest that BVDV N pro is involved in the regulation of type I interferons. Furthermore, E74-like factor 4 (ELF4) is an IFN transcription factor, which can increase the binding affinity of IRF3 and IRF7 by interacting with the enhancer elements. Simultaneously, the interaction between ELF4 and STING is activated by TBK1, leading to the nuclear translocation of ELF4 and then binding to the IFN promoter [32, 38, 39] . Therefore, whether BVDV N pro is associated with ELF4 needs further clarification. Obviously, BVDV N pro has a great effect on the production or inhibition of IFN-I responses.",

However, the cleavage of NS2-NS3 was significantly reduced in the later stage of infection, resulting in NS2-NS3 mainly present in infected cells. The infection of Cp BVDV can quickly lead to cellular apoptosis, which was partly due to the protease activities of NS2 and NS3, while Ncp BVDV can coexist with host cells after infecting cells [55] . Furthermore, Gamlen et al. found that NS3/NS4A can induce the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [56] . NS3 protease cannot inhibit the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter mediated by TLR3-and RIG-I.

Among the domains, TM is responsible for anchoring the NS3/NS4A complex on the intracellular membrane and participates in the formation of virions. The central peptide can form a \u03b2-lamellar structure to stimulate the activity of NS3 protease. NS4A acts as a protease cofactor in the NS3/NS4A serine protease complex, catalyzing the cleavage of downstream proteins NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B, and interacting with NS3 [62] . In addition, the results of co-precipitation studies show that the interaction between the N-terminal region of NS4A and NS3 can induce cleavage of NS4B/5A and NS5A/5B sites [54] . NS4B (p30) is a 35 kDa hydrophobic protein with NTPase activity, which participates in BVDV genomic replication [63] . Furthermore, NS4B is also an integral membrane protein of the Golgi apparatus, which can be inhibited by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) inhibitors (Clemizole). Once the dimerization of NS4B protein is destroyed, RNA replication and molecular rearrangement will occur in the cell membrane of infected cells [64] . Fu et al. found that the BVDV envelope proteins E rns and E2 participate in the induction of autophagy [65] . Subsequently, Suda et al. proved that the NS4B can induce autophagosomes to enhance their intracellular replication [66] . It is reported that there is no difference in the localization of NS4B protein between Ncp and Cp BVDV. However, in vitro experiments have shown that if the 15th codon in the NS4B of BVDV (strain Oregon C24V) is mutated from tyrosine to cysteine, Cp BVDV can be converted to Ncp BVDV [57, 67] .",

The results showed that NS5A and NIBP coexist in the endoplasmic reticulum of BVDV-infected cells. Overexpressed NS5A can inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB, while the inhibition of endogenous NIBP by siRNA molecules can promote virus replication, which indicates the important role of host NIBP in the pathogenesis of BVDV [73] .

            "text": "Up to now, researchers have made preliminary progress in the research of BVDV NSP. However, a series of problems such as the regulation mechanism of the interaction between p7, NS4B, NS5A, and other NSP, the regulation mechanism of virus replication, and the pathogenic mechanism have not been resolved. The clinical signs of BVD are complex, and the mechanisms of persistent infection, immunosuppression, and immune escape are not fully understood, which restricts the development of new vaccines. To date, most vaccines have been developed by inactivated pathogens, protein subunits, or based on live attenuated organisms, which are at risk of pathogenicity recovery under the condition of the impaired immune system. To avoid this situation, the research and development of nanoparticles-based vaccines that enhance the stability and targeting of antigens [72] have attracted attention [90] [91] [92] . Mahony et al. combined E2 protein with hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles with surface amino functionalization (HMSA) to make a recombinant subunit vaccine, and immunized sheep by subcutaneous injection of non-lyophilized or freeze-dried nano-formulations. The results showed that the E2 nanoformulations were immunogenic in sheep, and freeze-drying did not affect the immunogenicity of the E2 antigen, which was still detectable four months after immunization [93] . This also indicates that the research on nanoparticle-based vaccines is of great significance and can be used as a new research direction in future research. However, BVD cannot be eradicated by vaccination alone, and effective rapid detection methods and compulsory culling policies should be applied worldwide to prevent and control the disease. Among them, the culling objects mainly include sick animals and suspected infected animals. At the same time, strengthening the study of the interaction between BVDV and the host, and exploring the interaction between viral structural proteins and non-structural proteins will provide feasible solutions to eradicate BVD on a global scale. To further study the relationship between BVDV and the host, the researchers found through transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of BVDV-infected MDBK cells.BVDV can inhibit host cell apoptosis and inhibit the expression of antiviral proteins and genes in the complement system, thereby promoting the proliferation of BVDV. At the same time, BVDV can also utilize host metabolic resources and cell autophagy to promote replication, which provides an important basis for further exploration of the mechanism of BVDV-host interaction, and also provides guidance for the eradication of BVD [94] [95] [96] .",
