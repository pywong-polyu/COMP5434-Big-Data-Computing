            "text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the association between loneliness and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional online study from 22 to 26 December 2020. A total of 27,036 participants, all employed at the time, were included in the analysis. Participants were asked if they felt loneliness in a single-item question. The Kessler 6 (K6) was used to assess psychological distress, defined as mild for K6 scores of 5 to 12 and severe for 13 or higher. The odds ratios (ORs) of psychological distress associated with loneliness were estimated using a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustment for age, sex, marital status, equivalent income, educational level, smoking, alcohol consumption, job type, number of workplace employees, and cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 in the prefecture. Communication with friends, acquaintances, and family was strongly associated with psychological distress, so we adjusted for these factors and eating meals alone. Results showed a significant association between loneliness and psychological distress (OR = 36.62, 95% CI = 32.95-40.69). Lack of friends to talk to, lack of acquaintances to ask for help, and lack of people to communicate with through social networking sites were all strongly associated with psychological distress, as were family time and solitary eating. Even after adjusting for these factors, loneliness remained strongly associated with psychological distress (OR = 29.36, 95% CI = 26.44-32.98). The association between loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and psychological distress indicates the need for intervention.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency on 30 January 2020, and on 11 March 2020, it declared COVID-19 a pandemic. In Japan, the first case was reported on 16 January 2020, and the disease was designated as a designated infectious disease on 1 February 2020. As of March 2021, the disease continues to spread around the world. Japan is no exception. Since the first case was reported, the outbreak has spread, with a cumulative total of 324,846 confirmed cases in the year from 16 January 2020 to 16 January 2021 (Outbreaks in Japan). In addition to its infectiousness, COVID-19 was found to be highly contagious, with a high severity of illness and a high mortality rate in severely ill patients, leading to measures aimed at preventing COVID-19 in many countries around the world (Weiss and Murdoch, 2020) .",

Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors.\" It also recommends avoiding the 3Cs (i.e., spaces that are closed, crowded, or involve close contact), using the phrase \"Avoid the 3Cs\" (World Health Organization, 2021). These COVID-19 measures were also applied in Japan, resulting in a transformation of lifestyles and making people more isolated. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has announced a \"new lifestyle\" for the new coronavirus, recommending that people avoid contact with other people as much as possible, and if they do make contact, it should be for short periods of time; they should avoid talking and maintain as much distance from others as possible. People are advised to refrain from going out unnecessarily and to shop online as much as possible (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare) .

As a result, employees work alone at home and meetings are held on the web. They no longer have dinners with their workmates but rather eat and drink alone. No more crowded commuting; no more being with others in enclosed spaces, such as offices or conference rooms; and no more conversations without wearing a mask when eating or drinking. In parallel, opportunities for both public and private communication have decreased, and people's lifestyles have become more solitary than before the COVID-19 pandemic. People became socially isolated and felt lonely more easily. Loneliness and social isolation are similar, but loneliness is subjective and social isolation is objective (Wheeler et al., 1983) . Thus, loneliness is associated with psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety, and social isolation is considered to be a predictor of loneliness (Sanders, 2020) . Loneliness is considered to have a negative impact on physical and mental health. A survey conducted among US adults in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic reported that loneliness was higher than before the pandemic (Rosenberg et al., 2021) . A survey conducted in Wuhan also showed that loneliness among people was increasing in prevalence before the COVID-19 pandemic (Torales et al., 2020) . In sum, during the current pandemic, loneliness among people has been increasing.",

In a 2-month follow-up study conducted in Italy during lockdown, stress levels in the general population increased (Roma et al., 2020) . Psychological distress causes physical and mental health problems. Physically, psychological distress can trigger the onset and exacerbation of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease and heart failure, and chronic stress can lead to overeating and lack of exercise, which in turn leads to obesity, placing an additional burden on the cardiovascular system (Rosengren et al., 2004; Iso et al., 2002) . Furthermore, excessive psychological distress is a risk factor for mental disorders, including depression (Slavich and Irwin, 2014) .",

Responses received extremely quickly after the survey were opened. Those responses reporting a height below 140 cm or weight below 30 kg and those that were inconsistent across multiple identical questions were excluded as likely to be fraudulent. Invitations to participate were sent via email to monitors registered with Cross Marketing Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). A total of 55,045 registered monitors participated by answering the initial screening questions, and 33,302 monitors responded by matching the survey criteria (worker status, region, gender, and age). Thus, a total of 33,302 people participated. After excluding clearly suspected responses, data from 27,036 participants were included in the analysis.

In contrast, only 33.9% of the group who did not feel loneliness had a K6 \u2265 5, and 3.5% had a K6 \u2265 13. The percentage of participants who answered \"Yes\" to the following questions: \"Do you have friends or neighbors with whom you can easily engage in small talk or daily conversation?\"; \"Do you have someone you can ask for help?\"; and \"Do you have a partner with whom you can communicate closely using SNSs?\" was lower in the loneliness group in all cases. Those who spent less time with their family during meals and gatherings were more likely to feel loneliness, while those who ate all their meals alone were more likely to feel loneliness. The percentage of participants who felt loneliness was higher among women, unmarried individuals, and those with low incomes. No differences emerged in relation to job type or number of employees in the workplace. Table 2 shows the odds ratios (ORs) of loneliness and severe psychological distress estimated by the logistic model. In the age-adjusted model, there was a significant association between loneliness and psychological distress (OR = 37.74, 95% CI = 34.04-41.85). This result was also found in the multivariate analysis (OR = 36.62, 95% CI = 32.95-40.69). Lack of friends to talk to, lack of acquaintances to ask for favors, and lack of people to communicate with through social networking sites were all strongly associated with psychological distress. Family time and solitary eating were both associated with psychological distress. Even after adjusting for these factors, loneliness was still strongly associated with psychological distress (OR = 29.36, 95% CI = 26.44-32.98).",

Among older adults in Hong Kong, 8.8% felt loneliness before the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas 27.7% of them felt loneliness during the pandemic (Wong et al., 2020) . As the subjects of this study were workers, they necessarily participated in social activities more than the elderly or the general population, and as a result, the percentage of people who felt lonely was lower than in previous studies. When there was social isolation as living alone in addition to loneliness, the OR was higher than for loneliness without social isolation. This suggests that more attention is needed when social isolation is added to loneliness.

In this study, loneliness was assessed by the subjective question, \"Have you ever felt loneliness?\" In contrast, communication with friends, acquaintances, and family, which was used as an adjustment factor, was assessed using objective questions, as was social isolation. The results of this study showed that loneliness and social isolation overlap, but only partially, and the nonoverlapping parts are considered to be subjective experiences. We believe that this subjective experience is associated with psychological distress and is a factor that should be addressed. One of the reasons for the loneliness highlighted here is considered to be the particular lifestyle that has emerged due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This lifestyle requires a different way of living, complying with \"avoiding the 3Cs\" (World Health Organization, 2021) to prevent infection, but as a result, communication has decreased. This has led to a sense of loneliness, which in turn is thought to be linked to psychological distress. As of February 2021, there is no prospect of COVID-19 eradication, and people will need to continue their new lifestyles to prevent infection. Therefore, the incidence of psychological distress is expected to remain high for some time. As severe psychological distress conditions can be physically and mentally disabling, interventions for loneliness are needed if psychological distress under COVID-19 pandemic conditions persists.",

Second, there are various ways to assess loneliness (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015) , but in this study, loneliness was assessed by only asking the question, \"Have you ever felt alone?\" This method was adapted from previous studies that assessed loneliness with a single question (Courtin and Knapp, 2017) . Third, because this is a cross-sectional study, the temporal relationship between loneliness and psychological distress is unknown. Fourth, the effects of loneliness vary by culture and personal factors. For example, there is a culture called \"super solo\" in Japan, which is characterized by enjoyment of loneliness. In this way, different cultures have their own perceptions of loneliness, which may undermine the external validity of the results of this and indeed some other studies on this topic.",
