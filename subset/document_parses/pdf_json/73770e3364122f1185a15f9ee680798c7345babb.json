Currently, they are passing through another crisis, which is of much larger dimension, in terms of its impact and uncertainty. It is therefore of interest to examine how they are responding to the crisis created by the pandemic of Covid-19. Cooperatives all over the world are responding and trying to do their best to protect their members and workers from the adverse impact of Covid-19. While the reporting on their activities seems to be not up to the desired level, based on the information from the reporting cooperatives, we can say that cooperatives are certainly responding keeping in mind the values and principles they are structured upon. In the Asia Pacific region, cooperatives are primarily trying to focus on relief measures and providing social and economic protection to their members and workers. They are partnering with state and/or responding to state mandates to an appreciative extent. Some cooperatives are exhibiting a much longer term and futuristic response trying to insulate their businesses from continued economic uncertainties and adjust their approach to business as well as meeting the needs of the members, to the 'new normal', that of living with the virus. The case example of IFFCO and ULCCS clearly demonstrates that cooperatives have a highly forward-looking approach and are functioning very much in tune with the principle and values cooperatives stand for.",

Since then, new forms of cooperatives have evolved especially during varied crisis periods and cooperatives have quickly responded to the needs of a crisis period. In the Asia Pacific region, the governments in many countries have relied on cooperatives to overcome pressing socioeconomic challenges. For instance, in India, the British regime introduced Agricultural Credit Cooperatives to overcome the financial stress faced by the farming community.",

Therefore, by their very nature, they respond to the changing needs of the member community. Evolution of new forms of cooperatives ranging from worker cooperatives to health cooperatives to the recent emergence of platform cooperatives has all been based on the changing needs of the community over time and space. Similarly, innovations in the cooperative services, be it micro finance, marketing strategies such as joint buying, direct delivery from producers to consumers or cooperative consortiums to benefit from scale of operations, have all occurred as a response to the needs of the members. It is, therefore, natural to expect that cooperatives respond quickly and strive to protect the interests of the member community whenever there is a crisis.",

The Committee was established through the donation of one day salary from all employees of affiliated companies.
