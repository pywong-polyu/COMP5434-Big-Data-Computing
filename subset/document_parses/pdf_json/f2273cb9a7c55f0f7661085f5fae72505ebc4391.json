COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2] . Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause colds, severe acute respiratory syndrome [3] , and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [4, 5] . The early symptoms of infection are similar to flu virus infections and mainly manifest as fatigue and muscle soreness. Some patients may have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea [6] . Patients with worsening symptoms tend to have dyspnea, chest tightness, shortness of breath, respiratory distress, and even pulmonary interstitial changes. In severe cases, sepsis, septic shock, coagulation dysfunction, and renal failure may occur [7] . SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lower respiratory tract. Some patients may develop life-endangering acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in the liver, muscles, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, and the heart has also been found or proposed [8, 9] .",

Lipids can be divided into classes and subclasses according to their head group and the type of connection between the head group and acyl chains [13] . The diversities in the head group and acyl chain of lipids lead to many individual lipid molecular species [14] , including fatty acyls (FAs), glycerolipids (GLs), glycerophospholipids (GPs), sphingolipids (SPs), sterol lipids (STs), saccharolipids (SLs), prenol lipids (PRs), and polyketides (PKs). Furthermore, lipids have a highly complex composition and structure and have a wide range of concentrations. Since the pathway and network of lipid metabolism have been widely studied, changes in lipid content can reveal changes in enzyme activity and gene expression patterns simultaneously. In addition, abnormal lipid metabolism can lead to many human diseases, including diabetes, obesity, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases [15] .",

            "text": "As a powerful analytical tool, lipidomics can systematically describe lipid alterations of complex biological samples in response to internal or external subtle perturbations [16] . It has become an exciting field with broad prospects and has been widely used in drug research and development, molecular physiology and pathology, functional genomics, nutrition, and health issues [17] . Previous studies have demonstrated significant changes in the lipidome in human plasma caused by various diseases, like Ebola virus disease (EVD) [18, 19] . Compared with healthy volunteers, the lipid metabolism of EVD patients had changed dramatically. With the recovery process, the difference in lipid molecules gradually decreased, which implied that the patients recovered. SARS-CoV-2 can induce characteristic molecular changes detected in patients' sera using proteomic and metabolomic technologies [20, 21] . These changes may provide valuable knowledge about plasma biomarkers and insight for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Here we performed the untargeted lipidomics analysis of plasma samples collected from a cohort of cured COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. We found abnormal lipid metabolism in cured COVID-19 patients when they were about to discharge the hospital, indicating that viral infection and drug treatment affected the patients' systemic metabolism. Although the sample size was relatively small and the age factor was not fully considered during the comparison process, this work could provide valuable knowledge of COVID-19-related plasma biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. It is an essential resource for further studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis, suggesting that these discharged patients were not fully recovered from the physiological effects of COVID-19. The results of the present study will contribute to the understanding of COVID-19 and its clinical treatment strategies.",

The written informed consents were provided by all subjects from January 2020 to March 2020. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th edition) issued by the National Health Commission of China, and SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were enrolled in the study after diagnosis. Blood samples (\u22643 ml) were collected when the patient's disease was diagnosed as negative and met the discharge criteria. The basic information of the cured patients is displayed in Table 1 , including age, gender, the days from onset to hospitalization and symptoms. The cured patients were divided into two groups: one group was the rehabilitation of severe symptoms or elderly patients (the SE group). The other group was composed of young people with mild symptoms (the MY group) who were considered to have no underlying diseases. It can be seen from Table 1 that the age of SE groups was older than 40 years and the members of MY groups were younger than 40 years. Healthcare staff younger than 35 years was recruited as the healthy control group from Maoming People's Hospital, who were thought to have no underlying diseases as well. None of them had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and their throat swabs and serological testing were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Because of the large age span of SE group, it was not easy to find suitable healthy controls to compare with SE group only, so the same healthy cohort was chosen to compare with SE and MY groups. All blood samples were collected by potassium-EDTA blood collection tubes according to the biocontainment procedures of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimen treatment, and the plasma was obtained through 3000 rpm/min centrifugation for 10 min. Lipid extraction was conducted according to the MTBE method [22] . Briefly, 200-\u03bcl plasma samples were added to 1.2 ml of chilled mixture of methanol/MTBE/water (4:5:5, v/v/v). Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h and vortexed for 1 min every 15 min. After centrifugation (3000 rpm/min, 5 min), 200 \u03bcl supernatant of each sample was transferred to new tubes and dried under nitrogen flow at room temperature. Samples were re-suspended in 300 \u03bcl IPA (\u221220 \u2022 C precooling) with 10 \u03bcl SPLASH internal standards and then centrifuged at 12000 rpm/min for 20 min at 4 \u2022 C. The supernatant was transferred to the sampling bottles for UPLC-high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis, and 10 \u03bcl of each sample was mixed into the quality control (QC) samples to evaluate the repeatability and stability of the LC-MS process [23] .",

The stable isotope addition strategy was also used in the untargeted lipidomics approach to analyze the plasma samples. The Q Exactive HRMS combines high sensitivity and accuracy and can accurately determine the composition of the precursor and product lipid ions. The LipidSearch software contains over 1700000 of lipid information and their predictive fragment ions. It can provide powerful bioinformatics capabilities for the automated identification of lipids and integration of an entire dataset into a concise report showing statistical differences between sample groups. MS2 results in the LC-HRMS analysis matched to lipid datasets for lipid identification, which was conducted by LipidSearch software against databases to improve the confidence of lipidomic identification. After lipidomic feature extraction and alignment, the full-scan MS results in the LC-HRMS analysis were used in the multivariate/univariate statistical analysis to extract statistically significant lipidomic features between groups. The endogenous lipids as the potential biomarkers for disease prognosis are mapped on to metabolic pathways to reveal possible pathway dysregulation during viral infection and medical treatment.",

            "text": "Our lipidomics results showed that over 50 lipids, including TGs, DGs, and LPCs, were up-regulated in the plasma of both the SE and MY groups of cured COVID-19 patients. This result is probably because of damage to the liver, which is consistent with the observations that many COVID-19 patients showed liver function abnormalities [9, 20] . Concerning the alteration of plasma TGs in the SE vs. H groups, an interesting finding was that most polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing TGs were increased significantly, such as TG (18:3/18:2/18:3) and TG (18:3/18:2/18:2) ( Figure  3A ). This increased proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acid in TGs could be attributed to an increase in the relative amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids available to the liver for TGs' assembly rather than the release of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids from adipose tissue, such as TG (16:0/16:0/16:0) [28, 29] . Furthermore, the lipids involved in the glycerol metabolic pathway, which maintains the balance of the energy metabolites in the body, suggests that SARS-CoV-2, like many other viruses, probably hijacks the cellular metabolism [30] .",

Reports suggest that SPs and glycosphingolipids might play essential roles in the early development of enveloped viruses [31] . PEs may contribute to driving the suppression of inflammatory responses in human cells by a medically and globally important dengue fever virus [32] . Low total ChE can usually be caused by liver damage, such as viral hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer [33] . Therefore, the dramatic reduction of such lipids was also consistent with the hepatic impairment associated with COVID-19, especially for patients in the SE group. The differential lipids were particularly enriched in GPs, SP, and linoleic acid metabolism for pathway analysis. GPs and SPs are essential components of biomembranes, which mediate signal transduction and immune activation processes. Furthermore, SPs regulate diverse processes, including growth regulation, cell migration, adhesion, apoptosis, senescence, and inflammatory responses [34] .",

So, the interpretations of our lipidomic datasets should also be combined with other types of systematic studies, such as transcriptomic and proteomic studies, clinical observations, and laboratory examinations, to provide more comprehensive disease information. Such integration not only would help us to understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on specific cells and tissues, but also might explain why some patients are vulnerable to COVID-19 while others are not. However, a major limitation of the study was that age was not taken into account when comparing SE group with healthy controls (less than 35 years old), since age may also be an important factor relating to lipid changes. Therefore, such limitation of lipidomics data should be paid more attention to SE group, especially for differential analysis. Another limitation of the present study was that the sample size was rather small, which only comprised five to eight participants in each group. So the individual factors such as underlying diseases may affect the results of statistical analysis. Like the observation of lipidomic alterations, it is apparent that these cured patients, whether they continue to experience severe or mild symptoms, were not fully recovered from the aftermath of COVID-19 from the aspects of lipid metabolism. Therefore, these discharged patients should continue with consolidation therapy to recover fully from the physiological effects of COVID-19.",

The statistical and differential analyses of plasma lipids were also performed between healthy controls and cured COVID-19 patients, who were further divided into the SE and MY groups. Our results indicated that lipidomic alteration was dramatically changed, even in the patients who attained the discharged standards. So, it is better to continue the subsequent physical therapy and consolidation treatment. Probably because of relatively small sample size and no fully consideration of age factor, more rigorous study design may be carried out in bigger cohorts in the future. Such an MS-based lipidomics strategy can help obtain highly valuable resources to improve understanding of host metabolic responses associated with COVID-19. This information will broaden our knowledge about the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and accelerate the identification of disease biomarkers.",
