By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we developed nanobodies that disrupt the interaction between Spike and ACE2. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains locked into their inaccessible down state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment, which enables aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia.",

The surface-exposed portion of Spike is composed of two domains, S 1 and S 2 (10) . S 1 binds the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), whereas S 2 catalyzes fusion of the viral and host cell membranes (11) (12) (13) . Contained within S 1 is the receptor binding domain (RBD), which directly binds to ACE2, and the N-terminal domain (NTD). The RBD is attached to the body of Spike by a flexible region and can exist in an inaccessible down state or an accessible up state (14, 15) . Binding to ACE2 requires the RBD to occupy the up state and enables cleavage by host proteases, triggering a conformational change in S 2 required for viral entry (16) . In SARS-CoV-2 virions, Spike exchanges between an active, open conformation with at least one RBD in the up state and an inactive, closed conformation with all RBDs in the down state (8, 9) .",

These nanobodies fall into two classes. Class I binds the RBD and competes directly with ACE2-Fc (Fig. 1B) . A prototypical example of this class is nanobody Nb6, which binds to Spike S2P and to RBD alone with a dissociation constant (K D ) of 210 and 41 nM, respectively ( Fig. 1C and table S1 ). Class II, exemplified by nanobody Nb3, binds to Spike S2P (K D = 61 nM) but displays no binding to RBD alone ( Fig. 1C and table S1). In the presence of excess ACE2-Fc, binding of Nb6 and other class I nanobodies is blocked entirely, whereas binding of Nb3 and other class II nanobodies is moderately decreased (Fig. 1B) . These results suggest that class I nanobodies target the RBD to block ACE2 binding, whereas class II nanobodies target other epitopes. Indeed, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments demonstrate that class I and class II nanobodies can bind Spike S2P simultaneously (Fig. 1D ).",

These linkers are too short to span the 72-\u00c5 distance between Nb6 molecules bound to open Spike. Moreover, steric clashes would prevent binding of three RBDs in open Spike with a single up-state RBD even with longer linker length ( fig. S4 ).

The dissociation phase can be fitted to two components: a fast phase with kinetic rate constants k d1 of 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22122 s \u22121 for Nb6-bi and 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u22122 s \u22121 for Nb6-tri, which are close to that observed for monovalent Nb6 (k d = 5.6 \u00d7 10 \u22122 s \u22121 ), and a slow phase that is dependent on avidity (k d2 = 3.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s \u22121 for Nb6-bi and k d2 < 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 s \u22121 for Nb6-tri) (Fig. 3A) . The relatively similar k d for the fast phase suggests that a fraction of the observed binding for the multivalent constructs is nanobody binding to a single Spike S2P RBD. By contrast, the slow dissociation phase of Nb6-bi and Nb6-tri indicates engagement of two or three RBDs. We observed no dissociation for the slow phase of Nb6-tri over 10 min, indicating an upper boundary for k d2 of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 s \u22121 and subpicomolar affinity. This measurement remains an upper boundary estimate because the measurement is limited by the intrinsic dissociation rate of Spike S2P from the SPR chip imposed by the chemistry used to immobilize Spike S2P . The true dissociation rate, therefore, may be considerably lower.",

            "text": "Biphasic dissociation could be explained by a slow interconversion between up-and downstate RBDs, with conversion to the more stable down state required for multivalent binding: A single domain of Nb6-tri engaged with an up-state RBD would dissociate rapidly. The system would then reequilibrate as the RBD flips into the down state, eventually allowing Nb6-tri to trap all RBDs in closed Spike S2P we observed an exponential decrease in the percentage of fast-phase dissociation with a halflife (t 1/2 ) of 65 s (Fig. 3B) , which, we surmise, reflects the time scale of conversion between the RBD up and down states in Spike S2P . Taken together, dimerization and trimerization of Nb6 afforded 750-fold and >200,000-fold gains in K D , respectively. Unable to determine the binding site of Nb3 by cryo-EM, we turned to radiolytic hydroxyl radical footprinting. We exposed apo-or Nb3-bound Spike S2P to synchrotron x-ray radi-ation to label solvent-exposed amino acids with hydroxyl radicals, which we subsequently quantified by mass spectrometry of proteasedigested Spike S2P (18 Nb3 at a level consistent with prior observations of antibody-antigen interactions by hydroxyl radical footprinting ( fig. S5 ) (19) . Previously discovered coronavirus neutralizing antibodies bind an epitope within the NTD of Spike with Fab fragments that are noncompetitive with the host cell receptor (20, 21) . Further SPR experiments demonstrated that Nb3 can bind Spike S2P simultaneously with monovalent ACE2 (fig. S6 ). We hypothesized that the multivalent display of Nb3 on the surface of yeast may account for the partial decrease in Spike S2P binding observed in the presence of ACE2-Fc. Indeed, a trivalent construct of Nb3 with 15-amino acid linkers (Nb3-tri) inhibited Spike S2P binding to ACE2 cells with an IC 50 of 41 nM (fig. S6 ). How Nb3-tri disrupts Spike-ACE2 interactions remains unclear. We next tested the neutralization activity of monovalent and trivalent versions of our top class I (Nb6 and Nb11) and class II (Nb3) nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus using a previously described assay (22) . Nb6 and Nb11 inhibited pseudovirus infection with IC 50 values of 2.0 and 2.4 mM, respectively. Nb3 inhibited pseudovirus infection with an IC 50 of 3.9 mM (Fig. 3C and table S1 ). Nb6-tri shows a 2000-fold enhancement of inhibitory activity, with an IC 50 of 1.2 nM, whereas trimerization of Nb11 and Nb3 resulted in more modest gains of 40-and 10-fold (51 and 400 nM), respectively (Fig. 3C) . We confirmed these neutralization activities with a viral plaque assay using live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of VeroE6 cells. Here, Nb6-tri proved exceptionally potent, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 with an average IC 50 of 160 pM (Fig. 3D) . Nb3-tri neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with an average IC 50 of 140 nM (Fig. 3D) .",

Two rounds of selection identified high-affinity clones with two penetrant mutations: I27Y (Ile 27 \u2192Tyr) in CDR1 and P105Y (Pro 105 \u2192Tyr) in CDR3. We incorporated these mutations into Nb6 to generate matured Nb6 (mNb6), which binds with 500-fold increased affinity to Spike S2P (Fig. 4A) . mNb6 inhibits both pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 infection with low nanomolar potency, a~200fold improvement compared with Nb6 ( Fig. 4B and table S1). A 2.9-\u00c5 cryo-EM structure shows that mNb6 binds to closed Spike S2P (Fig. 4C and fig. S7 ). mNb6 induces a slight rearrangement of the down-state RBDs as compared with Spike S2P bound to Nb6, inducing a 9\u00b0rotation of the RBD away from the central threefold-symmetry axis. This deviation likely arises from a different interaction between CDR3 and Spike S2P , which nudges the RBDs into a new resting position (Fig. 4D) . Although the I27Y substitution optimizes local contacts between CDR1 in its original binding site on the RBD, the P105Y substitution leads to a marked rearrangement of CDR3 in mNb6 (Fig. 4, E and F ). This conformational change yields a different set of contacts between mNb6 CDR3 and the adjacent RBD. An x-ray crystal structure of mNb6 alone revealed dramatic conformational differences in CDR1 and CDR3 between free and Spike S2P -bound mNb6 (Fig. 4G and table S3 ). Although differences in loop conformation in the crystal structure may arise from crystal lattice contacts, they are suggestive of conformational heterogeneity for unbound mNb6 and induced-fit rearrangements upon binding to Spike S2P .",

Moreover, mNb6 and mNb6-tri were stable to lyophilization and to aerosolization, showing no aggregation by size exclusion chromatography, and preserved high-affinity binding to Spike S2P (Fig. 5, A and B, and fig.

Strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell aim to block the ACE2-RBD interaction. Although high-affinity monoclonal antibodies are leading the way as potential therapeutics (20, (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) , they are expensive to produce by mammalian cell expression and need to be intravenously administered by health care professionals (31) . Large doses are needed for prophylactic use because only a small fraction of systemic antibodies cross the epithelial cell layers lining the airways (32) . By contrast, nanobodies can be inexpensively produced in bacteria or yeast. The inherent stability of nanobodies enables aerosolized delivery directly to the nasal and lung epithelia (33) . Indeed, aerosol delivery of a trimeric nanobody targeting respiratory syncytial virus (ALX-0171) was recently demonstrated to be effective in substantially decreasing measurable viral load in hospitalized infants (34) . Finally, potential immunogenicity of camelid-derived nanobodies can be mitigated by established humanization strategies (35) . Nanobody multimerization has been shown to improve target affinity by avidity (33, 36) . In the case of Nb6 and mNb6, structure-guided design of a multimeric construct that simultaneously engages all three RBDs yielded profound gains in potency. Furthermore, because RBDs must be in the up state to engage with ACE2, conformational control of RBD accessibility serves as an added neutralization mechanism (30) . Indeed, when mNb6-tri engages with Spike, it prevents ACE2 binding both by directly occluding the binding site and by locking the RBDs into an inactive conformation.",
