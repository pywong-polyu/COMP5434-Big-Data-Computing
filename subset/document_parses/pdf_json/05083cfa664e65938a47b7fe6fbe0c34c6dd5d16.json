Thrombocytopenia and thromboembolic complications are a composite factor associated with critical COVID-19 and increased mortality. Immune-inflammation-mediated destruction, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection per se and increased consumption are proposed to be responsible for thrombocytopenia. Multiple concomitant conditions or results caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are high risk factors for thrombosis. Recently, platelet activation and platelet-mediated immune inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection were also found to be the contributors to the thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. In addition to thrombus scoring system, D-dimer is an excellent indicator for monitoring thrombosis. COVID-19 patients with high risk for thrombosis should be subjected to early thromboprophylaxis, and prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time should not be a barrier to the use of anticoagulation therapies in the control of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.",

As the seventh known human coronavirus genus, SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in that they all cause unusual viral pneumonia. As we gain further insights into the condition, COVID-19 is more a systemic condition than it is a respiratory disease, especially in severe cases. Mounting evidence has revealed that thrombocytopenia and thromboembolic complications are associated with disease severity and increased mortality [1, 2] .",

            "text": "A national multicentre retrospective study conducted in China revealed that the incidence of thrombocytopenia (< 150 * 10 9 /L) on admission in COVID-19 was 36.2% [3] , which is similar to that in SARS (40-45%%) and MERS (36%) [4] . It has been widely accepted that thrombocytopenia is indicative of disease severity, and a progressive decline of platelet counts was significantly associated with increased mortality [1] . Although thrombocytopenia is often believed to be an indicator of bleeding, the frequency of bleeding events was reportedly significantly lower in COVID-19 than in Ebola and other infections caused by haemorrhagic fever viruses. Liao et al. found that only three out of 55 nonsurvivors experienced nonlethal haemorrhagic events [4] . Bowles et al. also showed that no clinically significant haemorrhage was found in 35 COVID-19 patients who suffered from a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT) [5] . The possible reason for this might be that the pattern of coagulation disorder in COVID-19 is of a Open Access *Correspondence: dr_huyu@126.com more severe hypercoagulative state rather than a hypocoagulative one [6] . Currently, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes thrombocytopenia are speculated to involve the following: (1) an impaired haematopoietic microenvironment caused by systemic inflammation or cytokine storm, for example, elevated IL-6, which is a common phenomenon in SARS-CoV-2 infection [4] , could suppress haematopoiesis [7] . (2) SARS-CoV-2 might directly infect haematopoietic stem cells or megakaryocytes through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), CD13 or CD66a, as in other coronavirus infections that elicit thrombocytopenia [8] . (3) antiviral antibodies cross-reacting with haematopoietic cells and (or) platelets, e.g. anti-adenovirus antibodies, can crossreact with platelet integrin GPIIb/IIIa [8] . Indeed, Chen et al. showed that delayed-phase thrombocytopenia was the result of impaired maturation of megakaryocytes in COVID-19 patients [9] . (4) An autopsy of nonsurvivors revealed thrombotic microangiopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which lead to the increased consumption of platelets [6] . (5) Activated platelets can be scavenged via splenic/hepatic macrophages. In fact, two separate teams independently provided evidence that platelets are hyperactivated in COVID-19 patients [10, 11] . The activation of the Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway could partially explain this platelet hyperreactivity [10, 11] .",

Most recently, elevated platelet activation, including platelet aggregation, platelet spreading, \u03b1 granule secretion and dense granule release, among others, was proved to be closely linked to thrombosis in COVID-19 [11] . Moreover, Zhang et al. exhibited that SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein directly stimulated platelets, resulting in the release of coagulation factors and inflammatory cytokines and enhancing leukocyte-platelet aggregates, which can promote thrombosis and thrombus stability [11] .",

Zhang et al. demonstrated that thromboprophylaxis halved the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, with the Padua prediction scores being 4 or higher [2] . Dynamic monitoring of D-dimer and platelet counts, as well as the use of thrombus scoring systems, such as Autar, Caprini, Padua and Improve, are believed to be of value for assessing the risk of thrombosis [13] . Indeed, in a retrospective study, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that D-dimer elevation was an excellent in predicting thrombosis [2] . As a general consensus for thromboembolism prevention, appropriate hydration and proper physical therapy should be provided for severely ill patients. All hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients should receive appropriate anticoagulation unless the risk of bleeding outweighs the danger of thrombosis (abnormal prothrombin time or aPTT). Low molecular weight heparin is recommended with higher priority for thromboprophylaxis than unfractionated heparin. When not available or having contraindications of heparin anticoagulant drugs, non-heparin anticoagulant drugs, such as argatroban or bivalirudin, are recommended [13] . In patients contraindicated for anticoagulant agents, mechanical preventive measures are recommended [13] . The precise timing, type and dose of preventive anticoagulation therapy remain unclear.",
