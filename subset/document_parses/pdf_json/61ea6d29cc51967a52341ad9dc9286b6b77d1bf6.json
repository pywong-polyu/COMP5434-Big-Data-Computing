Ltd. reports that 35% of the total annual claims value was incurred by workers in the construction and manufacturing trade [3] . Hey et al. studied 504 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of National University Hospital (NUH) Singapore with hand injuries over a course of 3 months and found that 43% of these patients suffered from industrial injuries, comprising of lacerations and crush trauma [10] . If there is a significant correlation between hand injuries and activity in the construction and manufacturing industries, a fluctuation in the labour force of these industries may cause the number of hand injuries to fluctuate correspondingly. Singapore's labour workforce is flexible, with the total labour force fluctuating over the years. The Report on Labour Force in Singapore by the Ministry of Manpower details that between 1994 to 1996, the percentage change was 4.5 to 5.04% to 15.75% respectively; and from 2000 to 2002, the percentage change was \u2212 0.74 to 6.3% to \u2212 0.42% respectively [11] . Moreover, as Singapore has long counted on its people as its biggest resource, Singapore's economy is heavily dependent on foreign labour, particularly in blue collar jobs. There are 1,382,900 foreign workers (36% of Singapore's total labour force), of which approximately 300,000 of them are in the construction industry [12] , while 50% of the manufacturing industry are foreign workers [13] .",

Mathematical and statistical models can provide substantial contributions to the understanding of growth trends in the incidence of hand injuries. Machine learning has been proposed as an appealing approach for building models with more predictive power than linear regressions [16] . Among these models, the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model is useful in situations when the time series data exhibit seasonality-periodic fluctuations that recur with about the same intensity each year [17] and its use in forecasting time series models have been widely reported [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . This characteristic makes the SARIMA model adequate for studies concerning monthly data of the incidence of hand injuries, given that the number of hand injuries tends to be subject to seasonal variations in economic activity. However, the trade-off of most machine learning models is that they are based on mathematical functions that do not have readily interpretable coefficients [16] in contrast to linear regressions. Hence, the use of linear regression to identify factors associated with a particular outcome has been reported by various sources [16, [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

A non-observer team member extracted the relevant patient data from the Electronic Medical Records and performed de-identification of data. The study was performed by two independent observers who were blinded to the patient identifiers. Various indicators pertinent to Singapore's economy were collected from online published data by Singapore government agencies. The Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) 2020 was used to ensure all major economic industries were accounted for. SSIC is the national standard for classifying economic activities undertaken by economic units and is used in censuses of population, household and establishment surveys and in administrative databases. The SSIC adopts the basic framework and principles of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC). It is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect significant changes in the structure of the Singapore economy and the emergence of new activities as well as to align with changes in international standards [26] . Details of the economic markers used and their corresponding abbreviations appear in Since Singapore lacks both arable land and natural resources pertaining to fuels, metals or minerals [27, 28] , mining activities are negligible [29] . Hence mining activities were not included in our analysis. Agricultural activity in Singapore consists of poultry and fishing farms [27, 28, 30] .",

            "text": "While there are several methods for modeling in time series forecasting, including SARIMA and exponential smoothing methods, SARIMA models have shown better performance in predicting road traffic injuries in relation to gender [19] . Advantages of the SARIMA model include autoregressive, moving average and seasonal functions for trend, auto-correlation, smoothing and season [34] . Previously acknowledged disadvantages of the SARIMA model include the requirement of longitudinal data with a large sample size [19] . The number of data points necessary to develop a time series model has been determined to be at least 52 [38] or 80 data points in which 7 years of data is to be collected given the availability of monthly data [39] . With a data collection period of 2012 to 2018, our study has sufficient data points that would allow the SARIMA model to be used. Comparing SARIMA models in the monthly and quarterly analysis, the monthly analysis yielded a low R 2 of 0.238 while the quarterly iteration had a higher R 2 of 0.747. This suggests that the quarterly SARIMA model is a better predictor of hand injuries. When comparing for citizenship status, in the quarterly analysis, multiple linear regression for non-Singaporeans suffering from hand injuries yielded a higher R 2 (0.898) than Singaporeans (0.430). A possible explanation could be the rise in work permits given out in the period of 2012 to 2018. In particular, the total number of work permits issued for semi-and low-skilled jobs in 2014 was 991,300, however in the short span of 6 months in January to June 2015, 993,900 work permits for blue collar jobs (construction workers and factory workers) were issued [40] . Another contributory factor is the large proportion of foreigners that make up ground constructions teams, with figures as high as 90% being reported and a 78% proportion of foreign workforce relative to total employment in construction [41] . The Singapore government has also predicted that two-thirds of Singaporeans will hold white-collar jobs by 2030, up from half the workforce in 2013 [42] .",

In the monthly comparison, the R 2 for CI and AgriFish were 0.171 and 0.128 respectively for males; while in females this was 0.531 and 0.138. In the quarterly analysis, the R 2 values were 0.204 (CI) vs. 0.157 (AgriFish) for males and 0.516 vs. 0.297 for females. This finding is likely attributed to the larger workforce in Singapore's construction industry as opposed to the fishing industry. In 2013, it was reported that the main source of labour in Singapore's fishing industry are the fish farm owners and his or her family members. Such a fish farm would employ less than 20 workers, even when seasonal workers are included. Many of these firms are labour-intensive with minimal automation [43] .",

            "text": "Since men often work in more dangerous jobs than women and appear to have higher overall injury rates [44] , we expected that the multiple linear regression model would fit better for men than women. However, our findings were contrary to this expectation. In both the monthly and quarterly analysis, the female subgroup analysis had a higher R 2 than males. A previous study amongst aluminum smelter workers found that the injury rate was higher for females compared to males, arriving at the conclusion that women receive less on-the-job safety mentoring from supervisors and coworkers than men [45] . Male workers also tend to have more autonomy and control at work [46, 47] , leading to a greater agency in the duration of work that they are exposed to compared to their female counterparts. It has been demonstrated that employees working long hours are more vulnerable to diverse types of occupational health problems [48] including hand injuries. These factors are likely more evident in industrial workforces traditionally dominated by men and could account for female workers having significantly higher risks of all injuries compared to male colleagues [49] . Our findings thus suggest a greater need for occupational workplace precautions and education amongst women to prevent the incidence of hand injuries. With 17 to 62 being the legal working ages in Singapore [31, 32] , we expected that the subgroup analysis for age would yield a higher R 2 than SARIMA. This hypothesis held true in the monthly multiple linear regression, where R 2 for the age subgroup yielded a higher R 2 of 0.275 than SARIMA (0.238). However, this trend was not present in the quarterly analysis with the age subgroup analysis yielding a lower R 2 of 0.477 than SARIMA (0.747). The rate of accidents and occupational injuries has been reported to be higher among blue-collar compared to white-collar workers [50] [51] [52] . The contracts for blue-collar work are relatively short-term relative to white-collar contracts [53] , possibly explaining how the monthly analysis is better able to reflect the hand injuries suffered by blue-collar workers than the quarterly analysis.",

The proportion of the foreign workforce relative to total employment is about 56% in manufacturing [41] , indicating an almost equal percentage of Singaporean and non-Singaporean workforce in the manufacturing industry. We also found that TransAir was significant regardless of citizenship. While we were unable to find publicly available figures describing citizenship demographics in Singapore's air transport cargo industry, we know that advances in automation in cargo operations industry could lead to a decrease in hand injuries. For example, previous cargo operation assistants previously had to manually sort and lift mail bags, which can be as heavy as 35 kg. However, since the introduction of automation in the form of automated tilt-tray sortation systems for intelligent processing capabilities and assisted loading devices for lifting mail bags, workers have undergone training to operate automated systems as technical specialists [54] .",

This provides a favorable outlook to the overall economic activity. Correspondingly, based on our equation, the number of hand injuries would increase. In like manner, if Labour Productivity Change for Manufacturing increases, which means that the hourly manufacturing economic output produced by an hour of labour rises, then there will also be a reciprocal increase in the number of hand injuries.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the correlation of economic factors against the number of hand injuries. In our data, there is a relatively high proportion of foreign patients (41.21%) that undergo hand surgeries. As of 2018, the total foreign workforce in Singapore stood at 1,386,000 (24.58% of the entire population). However, they are usually under-represented in studies. In this study, we present a large cohort of foreign patients compared to the national proportion.",

These hand surgeries included both elective and emergency operations and therefore may not be reflective of patients who presented with hand injuries but did not undergo hand surgeries. However, our large sample size of 20,764 patients is likely to account for exceptions pertaining to these cases. Hand injuries are typically emergency injuries such as lacerations and crush trauma; but our data combines both. Fortunately, elective operations are not known to fluctuate much. For example, trigger finger operations are not known to fluctuate from month to month [66] [67] [68] . Since we have found in our results that there is a significant correlation between the incidence of hand injuries and economic indicators, an extrapolation between two time points would effectively nullify the electives, leaving the emergencies to account for the cause of fluctuations.",
