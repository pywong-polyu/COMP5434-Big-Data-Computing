            "text": "Testing of symptomatic persons for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is occurring worldwide. We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out jointly in test settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the testnegative case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only requires collecting information about potential risk factors for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups: one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn from existing country-wide healthcare databases. We also describe other possibilities for population controls. Combining the TND with population controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes between exposures that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, and exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19. This combined design can be applied to future epidemics, but also to study causes of nonepidemic disease.",

Ideally, this should be coupled with random/representative population testing to follow the epidemic in the population. 3 However, there is much that can be learnt about the causes of COVID-19, even if only symptomatic people are tested. Still more may be learnt by conducting formal test-negative design studies, with additional population controls, thus yielding three linked case-control studies. In this article, we describe how these combined study designs can enhance understanding of risk factors for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Given assumptions described in the literature, 8 it can produce effect estimates (odds ratios) that are generalizable to the general population (See eAppendix A; http:// links.lww.com/EDE/B716 for more detail). The approach is most commonly known for its use in assessing vaccine effectiveness, 4 but has also been applied to study risk factors for antibiotic resistance, 5, 10 and to estimate risk factors in circumstances in which diagnostic bias was suspected, for example, in studies on oral contraceptives and venous thrombosis, and on aspirin use and Reye syndrome. 8 Test-negative designs allow us to obtain quick answers to important questions. Additionally, by design, they protect against some forms of bias which are otherwise difficult to control. People who are tested for a disease will not be a representative of all those who have the disease (unless everyone in the population is tested)-usually, they are more likely to have severe symptoms, and more likely to seek medical help. This helpseeking behavior is affected by many factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, proximity to testing facilities, severity of symptoms, personality, and insurance coverage. In a test-negative design, the same selective forces that lead individuals to be tested will operate on both those who test positive and those who test negative. There is a substantial literature on this study design, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and it is generally agreed that it can produce valid effect estimates under the assumption of similar selection pressures for the test-positives and the test-negatives.",

Although reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has a high specificity for SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity can vary in relation to timing of symptom onset, 11 , 12 the bodily fluid tested, 13 and the assay used. 14 There will be misclassification of cases and controls. This can be expected to be \"nondifferential\" (whether the test works correctly on a particular person is unrelated to exposures such as crowding). Such nondifferential misclassification of exposure or disease is a known problem in case-control studies, and it usually results in bias of the effect estimate towards the null (an underestimation of effects). However, there is a major difference between the usual case-control study and the TND. In the standard population-based case-control study, the false-negatives remain part of the source population, and only a (small) fraction of them will be sampled and end up in the control group. In contrast, in the TND, it is certain that at a particular test site, all false-negatives will be included in the control group (the test negatives); similarly, all false-positives will be included in the case group-since all persons tested at the test site will be in the study. This may lead to stronger misclassification which has most consequences in situations wherein the proportion of COVID-19 relative to other respiratory disease among the persons tested is either very high or very low. There is an extensive literature on sensitivity analysis for standard case-control studies, 15, 16 which essentially involves making assumptions about how large this misclassification would be, and these methods can be adapted to the TND situation.

In addition, measures might have been taken to shield bus drivers (passengers only entering via rear doors; obligatory unoccupied seats). While this muddles the estimates of risk factors, the immunity conferred by earlier infection as well as the preventive measures taken earlier are worthwhile goals of a TND study. This paradox ideally requires investigating the evolution of the magnitude of the risk factor associations over the course of the epidemic, with additional background knowledge beyond the data; as a minimum we need to look separately at the upward and downward phases of the epidemic curve. To verify a potential role of immunity in an epidemic, subsamples of test-positives and test-negatives for acute infection might be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",

Thus, the ideal situation is to also have a comparison of the testnegatives with the general population. This strategy has already been applied as an extension of TNDs of antibiotic resistance. 5, 10 Below, we outline two different strategies to obtain population controls: first, the use of friends or household members accompanying the case as matched controls, and second the use of a random sample from general population databases with healthcare and other registered information from that population.

If these studies were all perfect, one would be able to calculate the results of any one contrast from the two others, for example, the results of comparison CC-POS should logically follow from combining the results of the TND comparison and comparison CC-NEG (if the odds ratio for male sex is 1.0 in the TND, but is 2.0 in comparison CC-NEG, then it also should be 2.0 in comparison CC-POS). In reality, there might be differences due to sampling and/or unknown selection biases. Thus, although it would be sufficient in theory to only conduct the TND and comparison CC-POS, it remains valuable to conduct also comparison CC-NEG.

This can be learned from a test-negative case-control study on urinary tract infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in contrast to infections with sensitive bacteria, with added population controls to both groups. 10 In this study, male gender proved a strong risk factor for antibiotic resistance in the test-negative design, while female gender was a strong risk factor for urinary tract infections in comparisons with the population. This seems like a reversing of usual risk factors, but is logical because men generally only acquire urinary tract infections at older ages, subsequent to prostate or other pathology which also puts them at risk of acquiring resistant bacteria. 10 This analysis and reasoning are explained in eAppendix D; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B716, which shows how the triangulation of the test-negative design with population controls leads to identifying the right causal pathways.",

During the initial wave of COVID-19 in February-March in Europe, testing for persons with minor symptoms was available in Germany; in The Netherlands, only persons with symptoms that were sufficiently severe to require hospitalization were tested. Because these were country-wide measures, in both countries, the general population may be seen as the source population. In this context, it should be noted that if (self) selection is based only on severity of disease, this will not create a bias in itself within one country.",

For example, consider private healthcare facilities that are only accessible to individuals who can afford them (these facilities exist in many guises, from standard private health care coming as an employee benefit to facilities only available to the very rich). A comparison of the test-positives and test-negatives from such facilities with a general population control group may not be warranted, because of inherent differences in socioeconomic status, medical care, and lifestyle. Among persons tested in private facilities, both test-positives and test-negatives are, for example, unlikely to live in very overcrowded conditions. Thus, a better control group, representing their own source population, might consist of other persons (or patients) who make use of the same healthcare facilities. This means that one may not be able to study all of the causes of the disease (e.g., if poverty is an underlying cause, but no one who accesses these healthcare facilities is low income). Also, if we suspect that there are differences in access to testing for persons with very mild symptoms or without symptoms (depending on type or health insurance or wealth), but few such differences for severe disease, then one might restrict the analysis to the subgroup of tested individuals with more severe symptomatic disease.",

The existence of physician preference has been studied in different countries. 23 Physician's preference can be based on a different interpretation of the literature on topics where there is not yet consensus, or on implicit biases (regarding age, sex, and ethnicity). If this is suspected to have been the case, it might be better to select population controls from the GP practices of the individuals who underwent testing-and to approach this in the analysis as a form of matching. Matching by GP practice would, however, limit the ability to compare between catchment areas and lead to loss of information about regional differences. Once again, restricting the analysis to patients with severe disease (whether test-positive or test-negative) may suffer less from self-selection and testing preference by doctors. An analysis according to severity can also be added as a sensitivity analysis.",

The first thoughts of decision makers are to facilitate testing for people with symptoms who became ill recently, either to isolate, or to know which treatment trajectory is necessary if symptoms worsen. 1, 2 The situation with COVID-19 remains urgent in many parts of the world, and it is important that the best possible use is made of information collected in the process of widespread testing of symptomatic persons. Therefore, there are research and public health benefits in employing a test-negative case-control design, combined with case-control studies with population controls added to it. Still, such collection of information has to be as unburdensome as possible, in order not to disturb the primary medical aim: to test people for their own benefit and for controlling the epidemic. The proposed data collection can be done with a minimal extra effort, it would roll along with the epidemic, and it can potentially yield important information at much less cost, and with greater ease, than doing genuinely random population repeated sampling and testing. In situations where extensive databases exist, data will have been collected as the epidemic unfolded, and then kept frozen in time in the databases. This allows investigators to return to the data and evaluate the course of the epidemic with new hypotheses. At the time of this writing, several efforts are underway to set up collections of types of questions and data of interest to study the COVID-19 pandemic. 24, 25 Adding general population controls yields linked casecontrol studies (the TND, CC-POS, and CC-NEG) and creates a triangulation situation 17 for inferences about local as well as general factors that drive the pandemic. Follow-up of test-positives or test-negatives and other additional strategies will lead to better understanding of the course of the disease. In particular, follow-up starting from a test-negative design of acute disease may be a good starting point to provide information on the degree and duration of protection from (re)infection conferred by having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection previously and/ or specific antibody titers, because such studies might need exact matching on date and place of testing. 26 Finally, having an infrastructure for a test-negative design already established in different settings may be a valuable base to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions such vaccines when they become available, or other measures to limit transmission.",
