In T2DM, both once-daily and once-weekly insulin are expected to be available. This study elicited utilities associated with these treatment regimens from members of the general public in the UK, Canada, and China, to quantify administration-related disutility of more-frequent injectable treatment, and allow economic modelling. Methods Two anchor states (no pharmacological treatment), and seven treatment states (daily oral tablet and generic injectable regimens of variable frequency), with identical outcomes were tested A broadly representative sample of the general public in each country participated (excluding individuals with diabetes or pharmacologically treated obesity). An adapted Measurement and Valuation of Health protocol was administered 1:1 in web-enabled interviews by trained moderators: visual analogue scale (VAS) as a \"warm-up\", and time trade-off (TTO) using a 20-year time horizon for utility elicitation. Results A total of 310 individuals participated. The average disutility of once-daily versus once-weekly GLP-1 RA was \u2212 0.048 in obesity and \u2212 0.033 in T2DM; the corresponding average disutility for insulin was \u2212 0.064. Disutilities were substantially greater in China, relative to UK and Canada. Discussion Within obesity and T2DM, more-frequent treatment health states had lower utility. Scores by VAS also followed a logical order. The generated utility values are suitable for use in modelling injectable therapy regimens in obesity and T2DM, due to the use of generic descriptions and assumption of equal efficacy. Future research could examine the reasons for greater administration-related disutility in China.",

The disutility of weekly injectable GLP-1 RA treatment added to oral treatment has previously been estimated as \u2212 0.013 to \u2212 0.020 in Italy [16] , and \u2212 0.010 to \u2212 0.030 in the UK (dependent on injection device) [18] , versus \u2212 0.011, \u2212 0.030, or \u2212 0.058 in the current study (dependent on country). The disutility of daily versus weekly injectable treatment in T2DM has been estimated as \u2212 0.023 in Scotland [17] , versus \u2212 0.032, \u2212 0.037, or \u2212 0.090 (GLP-1 RAs), or \u2212 0.039, \u2212 0.057, or \u2212 0.095 (insulins) in the current study. The use of patient preferences (from individuals living with T2DM) rather than general public preferences may have contributed to a reduction in perceived disutility in these studies, due to the adaptation of these individuals to treatment regimens that they have received [22] .

Utility elicitation interviews were carried out with members of the general public in each of three countries (representing Europe, North America, and Asia), as preferred by relevant HTA bodies [11] [12] [13] . This sample size of \u2265 100 participants is also broadly consistent with prior research in T2DM on utility elicitation [16] [17] [18] [32] [33] [34] , or patient preferences in general [35, 36] . In addition, a moderated 1:1 interview method (with highly consistent electronic data collection) was used, which represents the gold standard for health state valuation [23] . A set of pilot interviews conducted in the UK as part of this study provided additional prior validation of this methodology. Additionally, the use of generic descriptions of treatment regimens allows the estimated disutility values to be generalised across therapy compounds and injection devices.",
