Chronic periodontal disease causes an immune response in the host, both innate and adaptive, in which cells are recruited from the systemic circulation [3] . As a result, many immune cells or inflammatory cytokines induce severe inflammation of subgingival tissues. These biological reactions in the host as a result of P. gingivalis infection have also been suggested as a potential risk factor for several systemic diseases, such as diabetes, premature birth, heart disease, and atherosclerosis, as well as local lesions [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

            "text": "P. gingivalis possesses many virulence factors that can cause tissue destruction or induce inflammation via other mediators [8, 9] . The biological activities and role of P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) have been extensively investigated. Pg-LPS can stimulate the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and the receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand by activating the innate immune response of nonimmune cells such as gingival fibroblasts [10] [11] [12] [13] . In addition, P. gingivalis pili play an important role in the adhesion properties to host molecules and oral substrates. The fimbriae are recognized by receptors on epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells, resulting in cell activation and cytokine and adhesion molecule production [14] [15] [16] . Gingipain is an important factor in the pathogenesis of periodontitis for degrading gingival epithelial cell adhesion molecules and disrupting the epithelial barrier [17, 18] . Gingipain is also involved in the regulation of the immune response and the production of immune mediators in various cells [19, 20] . So far, the pathogenicity of P. gingivalis has been investigated, mostly based on its bacterial components.",

ARS also serves as a multifunctional moonlighting protein that performs additional cellular functions, both intracellularly and extracellularly. It has been reported that some ARSs are secreted by intact or necrotic cells and serve as cytokines [21] [22] [23] [24] . Ahn et al. suggested that tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase (WRS) secreted by macrophages in the early stages of bacterial and viral infection induces cytokine production in host cells [25] . WRS has been suggested to be involved in host defense as a protective alert in the acute phase, the so-called risk detection, and rapid response. Although WRS functions as an innate immune factor, the continuous release of WRS can cause inflammation when microbial antigens stimulate host cells, for example, during chronic infection. The production of WRS by host cells infected with periodontal bacteria can cause local inflammation of subgingival tissues and systemic disease as the bacteria migrate to various sites in the body. However, no studies have investigated the production of WRS by host cells infected with periodontal bacteria.",

Then, we examined the effects of WRS on the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and leukocyte adhesion molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or THP-1 cells. Macrophages actively take up unmodified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or modified LDL, such as oxidized LDL (oxLDL) [26, 27] . The uptake of unmodified LDL or oxLDL via the LDL receptor (LDLR) or scavenging receptors (SRs) by macrophages leads to the formation of mature lipid-laden macrophages called foam cells and is associated with atherothrombotic disease. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the expression of LDLR and SRs, macrophage SR class A (SR-A), CD36, and lectin-like oxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) in THP-1 cells treated with WRS. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether WRS, an intracellular multifunctional protein, can be related to systemic disease, especially atherosclerosis, following P. gingivalis infection.",

WRS was detected from 1 to 24 h, and apparent WRS production was observed after 4 h. The WRS level in the whole cell lysate was detected constantly from 0 to 24 h following P. gingivalis stimulation. \u03b2-actin was detected in the supernatants at a very low level following P. gingivalis stimulation and was detected at 24 h. While no change in WRS mRNA expression was observed from 1 to 6 h in THP-1 cells, WRS mRNA expression was significantly increased 12 h after stimulation with P. gingivalis (Figure 1b) . Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was observed from 4 to 24 h (Figure 1c) . These results suggest that WRS in the culture supernatant was secreted by THP-1 cells at an early stage following infection (1~2 h). Conversely, WRS detected in the supernatant from 4 to 24 h could have leaked from THP-1 cells because of the partial destruction of the cells following P. gingivalis infection. The detection of WRS in THP-1 cells infected with P. gingivalis was significantly dose-dependent at a dose from MOI 1 to 100 (Figure 1d ). The cells (1 \u00d7 10 5 /well) were stimulated with P. gingivalis (MOI: 10) at 37 \u00b0C for the indicated times in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail.

(d) WRS levels in the culture supernatants with the indicated doses (MOI: 1, 10, 50, and 100) were estimated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

P. gingivalis, which is mainly distributed in the oral cavi is most commonly associated with chronic periodontitis and has been suggested to associated with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, premature birth, rheumatism, and m ocardial infarction. P. gingivalis DNA is often detected in various body sites, such plaques in thrombi [30, 31] . This suggests that P. gingivalis hematogenously invades fro the oral lesion and reaches the vascular lesion. Among systemic diseases, atherosclero is the most common cause of death and disability, and it induces the development of m ocardial infarction [32] [33] [34] . Therefore, we focused on the association of P. gingivalis wi atherosclerosis, which induces the development of myocardial infarction. Thus far, atte tion has been focused on the pathogenic mechanism of P. gingivalis, such as LPS or p which induce host inflammatory responses [11] . In this study, we investigated the pr duction of WRS by cells infected with P. gingivalis and the biological activity of WRS host cells to clarify a new pathogenic mechanism of atherosclerosis caused by P. gingival ARS is an intracellular protein that is involved in protein synthesis; recent studi have identified it as a novel molecule that controls host immune responses against infe tions.

P. gingivalis, which is mainly distributed in the oral cavity, is most commonly associated with chronic periodontitis and has been suggested to be associated with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, premature birth, rheumatism, and myocardial infarction. P. gingivalis DNA is often detected in various body sites, such as plaques in thrombi [30, 31] . This suggests that P. gingivalis hematogenously invades from the oral lesion and reaches the vascular lesion. Among systemic diseases, atherosclerosis is the most common cause of death and disability, and it induces the development of myocardial infarction [32] [33] [34] . Therefore, we focused on the association of P. gingivalis with atherosclerosis, which induces the development of myocardial infarction. Thus far, attention has been focused on the pathogenic mechanism of P. gingivalis, such as LPS or pili, which induce host inflammatory responses [11] . In this study, we investigated the production of WRS by cells infected with P. gingivalis and the biological activity of WRS in host cells to clarify a new pathogenic mechanism of atherosclerosis caused by P. gingivalis.",

Tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (YRS) is secreted extracellularly and is cleaved into two distinct cytokines, yielding an N-terminal catalytic domain (mini-YRS) possessing an IL-8-like cytokine via its Glu-Leu-Arg motif and a C-terminal endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II-like domain [23, 24, 35, 36] . Furthermore, lysyl tRNA synthetase (KRS) is secreted from macrophages stimulated with Salmonella toxin or TNF-\u03b1. The secreted KRS was found to bind to the host receptor of monocytes and macrophages to induce immune responses via the ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways [37] [38] [39] . Ahn et al. suggested that WRS secreted by macrophages in the early stages of bacterial infection activate host cells through TLR-2 or TLR-4 signaling [25] .",

[25] , because LDH activity was not detected within 2 h. In contrast, WRS and LDH activity were detected in the medium after 4 h. This suggests that WRS may have been secreted into the medium due to the partial destruction of THP-1 cells following P. gingivalis infection. Thus, secretion and leakage are both involved in the production of WRS by THP-1 cells due to P. gingivalis infection. In addition, human rWRS induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, and chemokines, such as IL-8 and CXCL2, in THP-1 cells. Similarly, the treatment of HUVECs with rWRS induced the expression of MCP-1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 at the gene and protein levels. Moreover, the expression-inducing activity of cytokines and chemokines in THP-1 cells treated with rWRS was inhibited by C29, an inhibitor of TLR-2 signaling. Conversely, HUVEC-inducing activity was inhibited by TAK242, suggesting that TLR-4mediated expression was upregulated. This may be due to the difference in TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression levels between THP-1 cells and HUVECs [40] .",

            "text": "WRS secreted in the early stages of infection is mainly considered to protect against pathogen infection, but the continuous secretion of WRS by the host cell during P. gingivalis infection can be a potent inflammatory substance in the pathogenic lesion, such as damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Atherosclerosis is generally recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the excessive recruitment of white blood cells (monocytes and T cells) to the inflammation site. That is, the increased expression of adhesion molecules and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to cardiovascular risk factors lead to the attachment, migration, and accumulation of leukocytes within atherosclerotic lesions [46, 47] . Infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae, which is suggested to be one of the etiologic agents of atherosclerosis, stimulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, etc.) [48] and leukocyte adhesion molecules [49] . These cause T cells and monocytes to migrate trans-endothelially and differentiate into macrophages. Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) in C. pneumoniae is a homolog of human HSP60, regarded as a DAMP, and is considered the etiologic agent of the inflammatory response in atherosclerosis [48, 50] . As shown in this study, the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by macrophages following rWRS treatment could induce inflammatory cell recruitment and inflammatory responses at the infection site. In addition, the induction of MCP-1 and the leukocyte adhesion molecule expression of HU-VECs could promote macrophage accumulation and tissue infiltration from blood vessels. These results indicate that the behavior of rWRS is similar to that of C. pneumoniae HSP60.",

Therefore, in this study, the mRNA expression of these receptors was examined in THP-1 cells treated with rWRS. rWRS and Pg-LPS significantly induced the expressions of LDLR, SR-A, and LOX-1. Maekawa et al. reported that the upregulation of LDLR by murine macrophages treated with Pg-LPS was suppressed by the nuclear factor LXR that controls LDLR expression [51] . Because LPS signals are transmitted via TLRs, WRS, which has an affinity for TLR, may upregulate LDLR via a similar mechanism. SR-A and LOX-1 were upregulated in macrophages by bacterial LPS or lipoteichoic acid via TLRs of host cells [55] . Therefore, the upregulation of these LDLRs by rWRS in this study could also depend in part on TLRs, i.e., TLR-2 or TLR-4.",

In addition, rWRS upregulated LDLR and oxLDLR expressions, which may result in the formation of foam cells. Therefore, the secretion of WRS from THP-1 cells following P. gingivalis infection is considered one of the new pathogenic mechanisms of periodontal bacteria in atherosclerosis. ARS has also been reported to be involved in several immunological diseases [38, 56] . The elimination of unwanted physiological activities of extracellular multifunctional proteins, such as ARS and DAMPs, may be a new therapeutic strategy for various inflammatory diseases.",
