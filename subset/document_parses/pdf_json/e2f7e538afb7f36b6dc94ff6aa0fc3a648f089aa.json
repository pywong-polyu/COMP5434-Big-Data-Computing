VITT is a rare syndrome that clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) [8, 9] . Similar to HIT, special therapeutic treatment is indicated in the case of Vaccines 2021, 9, 712 2 of 10 VITT, including the administration of non-heparin, non-APTT-adjusted anticoagulants, intravenous immunoglobulin, and possibly Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors [10] [11] [12] . In the majority of patients with VITT and thrombosis in uncommon sites, the diagnostic work-up has confirmed the presence of antibodies against heparin/PF4, although none of the patients had a history of exposure to heparin [7, 13] . On the basis of these reports, it has been suggested that the diagnosis of VITT should be confirmed with an approved PF4 ELISA [13] . In addition, anti-PF4-related non-platelet activating antibodies have been detected in patients with COVID-19 who were suspected of having HIT [14, 15] .",

Furthermore, it is unclear whether the vaccine can induce the development of anti-PF4 antibodies (seroconversion) in vaccinated individuals who have not developed thrombosis [17] , since the data published so far are limited to patients with overt thrombotic complications. Determining the indications of anti-PF4 antibody testing in vaccine recipients is essential for assuring best clinical practice and for avoiding misinformation [17, 18] . In this context, the aim of this prospective study was to assess the presence of antibodies against heparin/PF4 in healthy adults who received the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine, according to the national vaccination program, and correlate them with clinical data and antibody responses to the vaccine. Antibodies against PF4 were evaluated 22 days after the first dose of the vaccine, based on the known kinetics of adaptive immunity, both after COVID-19 natural infection and after vaccination [19] [20] [21] .",

The ability of participants' serum, which was positive for anti PF4 antibodies, to aggregate platelets in the presence of unfractionated heparin (UFH) was also tested with whole blood impedance aggregometry on a Multiplate Platelet Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) [22] . Briefly, whole blood from a healthy donor, as a source of non-activated platelets, was mixed with heparin in three different concentrations (a high concentration solution of 400 U/mL, an intermediate concentration solution of 100 U/mL, and a low concentration solution of 2 U/mL) and a 0.9% saline solution as negative control. The samples were incubated for 6 min in the multiplate measuring cells. After the incubation, 200 \u00b5L of the participant's plasma was added in order to trigger platelet aggregation. We observed eventual activation during 20 min. Each run included a known positive control of a non-vaccinated patient with no history of COVID-19 who had tested positive for HIT and a negative control from a healthy donor who tested negative for PF4 antibodies. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the tests were always performed in duplicate and a coefficient of variation was applied before software calculation. Duplicates with a difference superior to 20% were repeated. The donor's platelets efficiency to aggregate was tested by using a parallel run with Thrombin Receptor Activating Peptide (TRAP) as an activator.",

In summary, the cPass\u2122 SARS-CoV2 NAbs Detection Kit (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was applied, which allowed for the indirect detection of potential SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in the blood by testing the antibody-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to the human host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2.

In accordance with our results, Thiele et al. have recently reported that up to 6.8% of the healthy individuals vaccinated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may present anti-PF4 antibodies following vaccination [26] . More specifically, the frequency of anti-PF4 antibodies was 5.6% (95% CI: 2.9-10.7%) with BNT162b2 and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.5-13.7%) with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [26] . It has to be noted that the optical densities were mainly low (range 0.5-1.0, positivity cut-off 0.5) among the participants with anti-Pf4/polyanion antibodies, whereas the addition of PF4 did not induce platelet activation in any of the positive sera [26] . In another study including health care workers vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCov-19, an even lower incidence of anti-PF4 antibodies was reported at 1.4% [27] . Similar to the previous study, the optical densities of the positive sera were low, ranging from 0.58 to 1.16 (positivity cut-off 0.4). Importantly, the presence of anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies was not correlated with reduced platelet counts [27] . The differences in the percentages between the studies may be attributed to the variable sensitivities of the laboratory assays used [28] . Low titers of anti-PF4 antibodies have been detected following both BNT162b2 and ChA-dOx1 nCov-19 vaccination and, more importantly, these antibodies do not activate platelets in the presence of PF4 [26] .

In accordance with our results, Thiele et al. have recently reported that up to 6.8% of the healthy individuals vaccinated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may present anti-PF4 antibodies following vaccination [26] . More specifically, the frequency of anti-PF4 antibodies was 5.6% (95% CI: 2.9-10.7%) with BNT162b2 and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.5-13.7%) with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [26] . It has to be noted that the optical densities were mainly low (range 0.5-1.0, positivity cut-off 0.5) among the participants with anti-Pf4/polyanion antibodies, whereas the addition of PF4 did not induce platelet activation in any of the positive sera [26] . In another study including health care workers vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCov-19, an even lower incidence of anti-PF4 antibodies was reported at 1.4% [27] .

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that antibodies directed against HPF4 complexes are produced in approximately 85% of HIT cases. They are mainly of the IgG class but may also be of either the IgA or IgM class; however, IgM and IgA anti-PF4 antibodies, as well as non-PF4-dependent antigens, are not usually implicated in HIT [34] . We have to keep in mind that results obtained with HPF4 measurement must be interpreted in relation to the function of both the clinical state of the patient and in terms of platelet kinetics. The presence of anti-PF4 antibodies is not sufficient to provoke thrombosis. ELISA-based diagnostics are highly sensitive (up to 99%) but they have relatively low specificity, which may lead to overdiagnosis of HIT syndrome [34] [35] [36] . Indeed, about 50% of the patients with clinical suspicion of HIT and positive ELISA demonstrate a positive platelet activation assay [34, 35] . A high prevalence of PF4/heparin antibodies has been reported in cardiosurgical and orthopedic patients, as well as in volunteer blood donors without a clinical syndrome of thrombosis/thrombocytopenia [29, 35, [37] [38] [39] . Among approximately 4000 blood bank donors, antibodies against PF4/heparin by ELISA were detected in 249 individuals (6.6%) [37] . However, a confirmatory evaluation was positive in 163 (4.3%). The vast majority of false positives had marginal values of optical density, ranging from 0.40 to 0.59. Similar values were also reported for the 71% of the confirmed positive samples. Heparin-dependent binding of the detected anti-PF4 antibodies was demonstrated in 124 (76%) of the 163 confirmed positive samples [37] . Interestingly, Krauel et al. demonstrated that PF4 binds to bacteria during infection and induces the production of antibodies against PF4/polyanion complexes that enhance antibody-dependent bacterial phagocytosis [40] . Therefore, the immune system of some individuals may be primed to recognize PF4/heparin due to preimmunization by bacterial antigens with similar structures [40] .",

A list of clinical signs and symptoms can be used in order to raise suspicion of VITT syndrome and guide the diagnostic algorithm. These \"red flags\" typically appear between 4 and 28 days post vaccination, and include loss of consciousness, double and/or blurred vision, sudden loss of balance with accompanying dizziness and/or severe headache, severe and persistent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, bloody or tarry stools, shortness of breath with or without chest pain, and edema of an upper or lower extremity [17] . It should be noted that VITT is a rare complication and the anticipated benefits of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination outweigh the possible risks. The still accumulating knowledge on the underlying pathophysiology of this syndrome and experience in the management of patients will contribute to the optimization of a diagnostic and therapeutic approach in order to prevent functional impairment and life loss due to VITT. The education of both health care personnel, with specialized algorithms for differential diagnosis and therapeutics, and the general population in simplified language is essential for increasing confidence in the indispensable vaccination effort against SARS-CoV-2.",

Similarly, we did not include an external control Vaccines 2021, 9, 712 8 of 10 group consisting of individuals vaccinated with other vaccine types. Furthermore, an investigation into a larger number of vaccinated individuals may be necessary to perform subgroup analyses in order to evaluate the possible role of confounding factors in the production of anti-PF4 antibodies and the presence of thrombosis following vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine. In addition to the above, the evaluation of platelet activation by a more sensitive and specific functional assay, such as the serotonin release assay, would have enhanced our findings further.",
