According to the Handbook for Neonatal Intensive Care, the recommendations for starting pressures for beginning ventilator support are PIPs of 16-20 cmH 2 O [15] . However, there are no evidence-based studies to support these guidelines. A cross-sectional study of 173 European NICUs reported an average PIP range of 15-25 cmH 2 0 in preterm neonates [4] . In a study to investigate the effects of triggered and untriggered inflations on PIP in neonates, triggered inflations had a PIP of 12.9 \u00b1 4.9 cmH 2 O vs. untriggered of 17.0 \u00b1 3.3 cmH 2 O [16] . Some authors have Fig. 2 Distribution of VT and PIP on NAVA (17,912 breaths) and PIP on NIV NAVA (20,164 breaths). The subject on NAVA was a 25-week, 669-g neonate at 24 days and 670 g with chronic pulmonary insufficiency of prematurity was analyzed. The subject on NIV NAVA was a 27week, 795-g neonate at 4 days and 740 g with respiratory distress syndrome. The data are median with IQR and the whiskers are the minimum and maximum values Fig. 1 One-minute tracing from a 26-week, 960-g subject at 30 days, 1360 g with chronic pulmonary insufficiency of prematurity. PIP mostly varied between 15 and 20 cmH 2 O with one breath as low as 12 cmH2O and one at 24 cmH 2 O. VT mostly varied between 2 and 5 ml/kg with few VT less than 1 ml/kg and a few as high as 8 ml/kg. Despite these wide variations in PIP and VT, there was minimal variation in respiratory rate suggested keeping PIP below 20 cmH 2 O but do not provide data to support these recommendations [17] . In animal studies, PIPs > 30 cmH 2 O have been shown to produce lung injury in relatively short periods. One study in sheep showed that as few as five high PIP breaths delivered immediately after birth could produce diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation [18] . Other studies in rats and piglets looked at lung damage from ventilation with a high PIP from 20 min to 48 h [19, 20] . At a typical ventilator rate of 40 breaths per minute, these animals were exposed to 800 to 57,600 continuous breaths at those pressures [20] . The vast majority of PIPs from our study were less than 20 cmH 2 O and only a small proportion (< 5%) were in the 30-35-cmH 2 O range. The augmented PIPs likely represent lung recruitment breaths, an expected phenomenon commonly observed in premature neonates [21, 22] . The wide range of pressures generated as illustrated from the pressure distribution curve are consistent with neural respiratory pattern variability, an intrinsic property of breathing. Mechanical ventilation has been shown to negatively impact respiratory variability. Due to its unique neurorespiratory coupling capability, NAVA ventilation has been found to superiorly support innate respiratory variability as opposed to other more monotonous modes of traditional ventilation [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 79, "end": 82, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 83, "end": 86, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 246, "end": 250, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 440, "end": 443, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 635, "end": 639, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1604, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1878, "end": 1882, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1994, "end": 1998, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2002, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2142, "end": 2146, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2413, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2414, "end": 2417, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2900, "end": 2904, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 660, "end": 666, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1088, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury remains a high priority and current evidence supports the use of VTV [2, 3, 24] . There are many different volume ventilation strategies, some which have a volume guarantee option, to assist the provider in achieving consistent tidal volumes [25, 26] . However, these strategies assume that tidal volume delivery should be relatively consistent for each breath. Neonates < 32 weeks gestation on continuous positive airway pressure were found to have an average VT of 4.4 ml/kg with a wide range of 2.6-7.2 ml/kg [27] . Typical VT ranges to initiate VTV range from 4 to 7 ml/kg [3, 4, 14] but in a survey from European neonatal intensive care units, 18% used VT > 7 ml/ kg [4] . Although some authors have suggested that VT > 8 ml/ kg can cause volutrauma [28, 29] , it is important to note that any positive pressure ventilation can cause cyclic trauma up to 86,000 times/day [30] . It may be the repetitive shearing force caused by exposure to these high VTs that causes volutrauma and not the high VT itself. Alternatively, provision of inadequate tidal volumes can also increase the risk of lung injury. This finding was observed in a study which randomized premature neonates to receive either VTs of 3 ml/kg as compared to 5 ml/kg during the acute phase of respiratory distress syndrome [28] . The tracheal aspirates of the group receiving 3 ml/ kg VT had significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory markers. The ventilator mode used during this study was synchronized intermittent positive pressure ventilation that included a volume guarantee feature, with the ultimate goal of delivering consistent tidal volumes. The tidal volumes reported from our study averaged around 3 ml/kg with a wide range noted within a subject (Fig. 2) . Tidal volume variation has been recognized as a normal finding in healthy subjects [23, 31] . In the adult population, decreased respiratory variability has been associated with increased mortality [32] . The neural breathing pattern in preterm neonates has been shown to be even more variable than in older children and adults. Breathing sighs are common in this population and may explain the intermittent high PIPs and VTs seen in this study [22] . By assisting with the plastoelastic stretching of lung tissue and respiratory muscles, sighs play an important role in improving lung compliance, reducing airway resistance, and optimizing lung volume recruitment [21, 33] . The high PIP and VTs observed in this study may be intermittent sigh or recruiting breaths enabling optimal lung recruitment and potentially resulting in the subsequent predominance of low PIP and VT. Both average and median VT were significantly less than the 5 ml/kg volume currently recommended for volumetargeted neonatal ventilation [34] and both average and median PIP were well below the currently recommended PIP [15] .

It is therefore likely that providing high NAVA levels to neonates who may not need it (as was done in the titration study [43] ) can result in excessive variability in PIP and a higher proportion of excessive VT but, when used appropriately in neonates with severe lung disease, VT and pressures are acceptable, suggesting evidence of intact neural feedback pathways.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 202, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 464, "end": 468, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Potential limitations of our study include inherent inaccuracies that can be associated with calculating exhaled tidal volumes at the expiratory valve of the Servo-i ventilator [44] . A recent study demonstrated the benefits of the circuit compliance compensation, which were used in this study, helping to assure more reliable exhaled VT [45] . In-line proximal sensors can also be used to measure volume; however, they can negatively impact patient care by increasing the amount of dead space, which can be very significant for the smallest of neonates. Our study did not include the use of proximal flow sensors due to their limited use in both NICUs used in the study. While the proximal sensor may have refined the accuracy of each measured VT, the overall distribution should remain unchanged. The Servo-i does not record leakage in the invasive mode so it is possible that expiratory VT measurements could be underestimated and may explain the number of breaths observed with VT less than 2 ml/kg. Unfortunately, this measurement problem is a challenge inherent to any ventilator offering a VTV mode.

Examination of statistical assumptions for all ANOVA (F-tests) revealed minor departures from normality of residuals; however, the Ftests are known to be robust to these departures in large samples.

Mechanical ventilation strategies, like NAVA, which promote native respiratory reflexes, appear intuitively superior to that of traditional modes of ventilation that strive to deliver unwavering tidal breaths. Although neonates on NAVA took occasional large breaths, we speculate that eliminating these sigh breaths would be detrimental to the preservation of an open lung concept.
