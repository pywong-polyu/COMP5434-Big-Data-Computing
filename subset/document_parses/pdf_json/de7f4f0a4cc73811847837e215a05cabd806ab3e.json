The causative agent was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (1) (2) (3) . It spread rapidly within China and swept into at least 200 countries within 3 mo. Symptoms are primarily pneumonia, as with two other important human coronaviruses (CoVs), SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (1-3). As of 1 February 2021, more than 102,399,513 cases had been reported worldwide, with 2,217,005 deaths (\u223c2.2% mortality). There is an urgent need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine to protect the populace from this new virus. Globally, more than 300 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are in preclinical development (4) (5) (6) and at least 30 vaccine candidates have entered human clinical trials (4, 5, 7, 8) . Among them, vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA), inactivated virus, and adenovirus vectors (Ad5-nCoV and ChA-dOx1) are now in phase III clinical trials. Excitingly, preliminary results indicate that these vaccines are highly efficacious, reaching 90 to 95% effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection in some cases. The durability of the protection conferred by these vaccine candidates is unknown. Although these vaccine candidates are highly promising, exploration of other vaccine platforms is needed.",

As such, the S protein is the primary focus for CoV vaccine development (9, 10) .

For SARS-CoV-2, S is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by furin before the virion is Significance Measles virus (MeV) vaccine is one of the safest and most efficient vaccines with a track record in children. Here, we generated a panel of rMeV-based vaccines with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S antigens inserted near 3\u2032 of the MeV genome. The rMeV expressing a soluble stabilized, prefusion spike (preS) is much more potent in triggering SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody than rMeV-based full-length S vaccine candidate. A single dose of rMeV-preS is sufficient to induce high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in animals. Furthermore, rMeV-preS induces high levels of Th1-biased immunity. Hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Our results demonstrate rMeV-preS is a safe and highly efficacious bivalent vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 and MeV.",

Both S and its RBD have been shown to be immunogenic for many CoVs (13) (14) (15) . The native S in the virion is in its \"prefusion\" form. Upon triggering, the prefusion S (preS) undergoes significant conformational changes to insert its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane and bring the virion and cell membranes together, arriving at its postfusion S form as it causes the membranes to fuse. For paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, and HIV, it has been shown that prefusion forms of glycoprotein are more potent in inducing neutralizing antibodies than their postfusion forms (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .

MeV has previously been shown to be a highly efficacious vaccine vector for many viral diseases such as HIV (24, 25) , SARS-CoV-1 (26, 27) , MERS-CoV (28, 29) , respiratory syncytial virus (30) , hepatitis B and C viruses (31) , influenza virus (30, 32) , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (33) , and flaviviruses (Zika virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus) (34) (35) (36) .",

We found that all SARS-CoV-2 S antigens are highly expressed by the MeV vector. Among these vaccine candidates, rMeV expressing stabilized preS (rMeV-preS) and full-length S (rMeV-S) proteins were the most potent in triggering SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Animals immunized with rMeV-preS induced the highest level of neutralizing antibodies that were higher than convalescent sera of patients recovered from COVID-19, and the highest Th1-biased T cell immune response. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS provided complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge and lung pathology. The codon optimized full-length S, preS, S-dTM, S1, RBD1, RBD2, and RBD3 were amplified by PCR and inserted into the same position at the gene junction between P and M in the genome of the MeV Edmonston vaccine strain. The domain structure of S protein is shown: SP, signal peptide; RBD, receptor-binding domain; RBM, receptor-binding motif; FP, fusion peptide; HR, heptad repeat; CH, central helix; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. The organization of negative-sense MeV genome is shown. Le, leader sequence; N, nucleocapsid gene; P, phosphoprotein gene; M, matrix protein gene; F, fusion protein gene; H, hemagglutinin protein gene; L, large polymerase gene; Tr, trailer sequence. (B) The plaque morphology of rMeV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S antigens. All plaques were developed after 5 d of incubation in Vero CCL-81 cells. (C) Multistep growth curve. Confluent Vero CCL81 cells in 12-well plates were infected with each virus at an MOI of 0.01. After 1 h of absorption, fresh DMEM with 2% fetal bovine serum was added. The cell culture supernatants and cell lysates were harvested and combined, and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. Data are geometric mean titers (GMT) \u00b1 SD from n = 3 biologically independent experiments. (D and E) Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S and S1 protein expression in cell lysate and supernatants by Western blot. Vero We have developed a yeast-based recombination system for rapidly constructing complementary DNA (cDNA) clones of rMeV expressing foreign genes such as the SARS-CoV-2 S antigens. Six overlapping DNA fragments (designated a to f) spanning the full-length MeV Edmonston vaccine strain and a SARS-CoV-2 gene annealing to the junction between the P and M genes were ligated into the pYES2 vector in a single step mediated by DNA recombinases present in yeast (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). Using this strategy, we constructed a series of rMeV vaccine vectors expressing eight variants of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein: 1) full-length S (S), 2) deletion of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail reflecting the soluble ectodomain (S-dTM), 3) S1 subunit (S1), 4) three different lengths of RBD (RBD1, RBD2, and RBD3) of S, and 5) a prefusion-stabilized soluble ectodomain with deletion of the furin cleavage site, two proline mutations (amino acids 986 and 987), and a self-trimerizing T4 fibritin trimerization motif replacing its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (preS) (9) (Fig. 1A) . All rMeV viruses were recovered from full-length genome cDNAs using the standard reverse genetics system and plaque-purified. To confirm that the recombinant viruses indeed contained the target gene, viral genomic RNA was extracted followed by RT-PCR using primers annealing to the flanking MeV P and M genes. PCR products were sequenced, confirming that S and its variants were inserted into the MeV genome between the P and M genes. Finally, the entire genome of each recombinant virus was sequenced to confirm that no additional mutations had been introduced. Compared to the parental rMeV, all recombinant viruses formed relatively smaller plaques (Fig. 1B) and exhibited delayed syncytia formation and cytopathic effects (CPE) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). A multistep replication curve showed that these recombinant viruses had delayed replication kinetics in Vero CCL81 cells (Fig. 1C) . However, the peak titer of rMeV-S1 (10 7.2 plaque-forming units [PFU]/mL) was higher than that of the parental rMeV (10 6.9 PFU/mL). Three recombinant viruses (rMeV-RBD1, RBD2, and RBD3) grew to titers comparable to the parental rMeV in Vero CCL-81 cells, whereas rMeV-S and rMeV-preS had 0.3 to 0.5 log reductions in peak titer. These results suggest that insertion of near-full-length SARS-CoV-2 S genes into the MeV genome further attenuates MeV replication.",

We examined the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins by rMeV in confluent Vero CCL81 cells inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Cell culture supernatants and lysates were harvested at 72 and 96 h postinfection and analyzed by Western blot using antibody against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein or MeV N protein. As expected, two proteins with molecular weights of 190 and 95 kDa were detected in rMeV-S-infected cells at 72 h, reflecting the full-length S and cleaved S1 (Fig. 1D ). In rMeV-preS-infected cells, the 180-kDa uncleaved, stabilized preS protein was detected, somewhat smaller because it lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. In rMeV-S1-infected cells, the 95-kDa S1 protein was detected. The preS and S1 but not the full-length S were also secreted into the culture medium. By 96 h postinfection protein expression had increased (Fig. 1D ). Although the S1 subunit from rMeV-S-infected cells had not been detected in the supernatant at 72 h, it was at 96 h ( Fig. 2E ). At both times, much of the S protein had been cleaved to its active form but the release of S1 into the supernatant at the later time suggests that some of the metastable cleaved S protein had either triggered spontaneously or following engagement with its receptor on a neighboring cell. Triggering releases S1 and allows S2 to refold, engaging with the target cell membrane and causing fusion between the two membranes. RBD1 (34 kDa), RBD2 (40 kDa), and RBD3 (45 kDa) proteins were produced by their respective rMeV vector-infected cells (Fig. 2F ), consistent with their predicted molecular weights. High levels of RBD1 and RBD2 were secreted into the cell culture supernatant. These results demonstrated that all of these SARS-CoV-2 S antigens were highly expressed by the rMeV vector, with the exception of S-dTM (Fig. 2E) , which was not pursued further. The extensive fusion CPE observed at both 72 and 96 h (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ) is most likely due to MeV, which causes this type of CPE. Interestingly, the CPE did not impair the production of most versions of the S protein over the 96 h of the experiment.",

However, antibodies were detectable at the lowest dilution in most cotton rats in the rMeV-S1 and RBD1-3 groups. After the booster immunization, antibodies in the rMeV-preS group were uniformly high, whereas three cotton rats in rMeV-S had high antibody titers and two had low antibody titers.

Type-I interferon receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) knockout, human CD46 transgenic mice (IFNAR1 \u2212/\u2212 -hCD46) mice can be robustly infected by MeV and have been used as a model to test the efficacy of many rMeV-based vaccine candidates (38) .

Six-week-old IFNAR1 \u2212/\u2212 -hCD46 mice were immunized with 8 \u00d7 10 5 PFU of each vaccine candidate (half subcutaneous and half intranasal) and at week 2 were boosted with the same vaccine candidate at a dose of 6 \u00d7 10 5 PFU.

We first quantified SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3)-producing T cells by enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot). Mice immunized with rMeV-preS had significantly higher frequencies of S1 peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells compared to the control mice vaccinated with rMeV vector (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3C ). Upon stimulation with peptide pools spanning the S1 subunit, five out of six mice in the rMeV-preS group showed a strong antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing T cell response, whereas only two out of six mice in the rMeV-S1 group showed a weak T cell response (Fig. 3C ). When S2 peptide pools were used for stimulation, only two of six mice in the rMeV-preS group had a strong IFN-\u03b3-producing T cell response (Fig. 3C) , indicating that the vaccine candidate induced T cells primarily targeting the N terminus of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To further characterize the nature of vaccine-induced T cells, four mice with the strongest IFN-\u03b3-producing T cell responses in the rMeV-preS group were analyzed using flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 3 D and E) . Th1 cells, which produce cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin (IL)-2, play an important role in protection against viral infection (39) . After peptide stimulation ex vivo, CD8 + T cells producing one or more of the three signature Th1 cytokines, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2, were detected in all four mice immunized with rMeV-preS (Fig. 3 D and E) . Moreover, antigen-specific cytokine-producing CD4 + T cells were also detected but at lower frequencies representing 0.1 to 0.5% of the total CD4 + T cells (Fig. 3D ). Together, these data suggest that rMeV-preS vaccine candidate is capable of inducing robust T cell immunity that is predominated by CD8 + T cells capable of producing Th1 cytokines.",

Thus, we chose the combination of intranasal and subcutaneous route for immunization in order to achieve maximal levels of immune responses. We chose rMeV-S1 to compare with rMeV-preS in the hamster study as rMeV-S1 induced good antibody responses in IFNAR1 \u2212/\u2212 -hCD46 mice (Fig. 3B) and grew to the highest titer in Vero cells (Fig. 1C ).

Hamsters in the rMeV group started to lose weight at day 1 postchallenge and reached \u223c15% weight loss at day 6 and then started to regain weight from days 8 to 12 (Fig. 5A) . Hamsters in the rMeV-S1 groups had similar weight loss from days 1 to 6 but had a faster weight recovery compared to the rMeV group (Fig. 5A) . Importantly, hamsters in the rMeV-preS group did not have any abnormal reaction or weight loss. The body weight in the rMeV-preS group was not significantly different at most time points compared to the normal controls (Fig. 5A) .",

Briefly, IFN-\u03b11, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, TNF, and CXCL10 in lungs in each group were quantified by real-time RT-PCR and normalized to a control. Lung IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 6B) , IL-6 ( Fig. 6E) , and CXCL10 (Fig. 6G ) mRNA had \u223c17to 36-, 66-to 84-, and 27-to 48-fold increases in rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups compared to the normal control group, respectively. However, the increases in these three cytokine mRNAs in the rMeV-preS group were minimal (two-to fourfold increase). Statistically, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and CXCL10 were indistinguishable between the rMeV-preS group and the normal control group (P > 0.05). In addition, increases in TNF (Fig. 6F ) and IL-1b (Fig. 6C) in the rMeV-preS group were significantly less than in rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups (P < 0.05). IFN-\u03b11 (Fig. 6A ) and IL-2 (Fig. 6D) in rMeV, rMeV-S, and rMeV-preS groups were similar (P > 0.05).

Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective against MeV and 88% effective against MuV. Both MeV and MuV are nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus and have potential as vectors to deliver foreign antigens. Particularly, MeV has been widely used as a vaccine vector. To date, more than 100 antigens have been expressed by MeV and more than 20 rMeV-based vaccines have been tested in preclinical trials (23, 43) . Animal studies have shown that rMeV-based vaccines are highly effective against infectious diseases. Common immunization routes such as intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intranasal were effective to induce a high level of immune responses in cotton rats, IFNAR1 \u2212/\u2212 -hCD46 mice, and nonhuman primates (34, 44, 45) .

Fixed lung tissues from days 4 and 12 after SARS-CoV-2 challenge were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm, deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin for the examination of histological changes by light microscopy. Each slide was quantified based on the severity of histologic changes including inflammation, interstitial pneumonia, edema, alveolitis, bronchiolitis, alveolar destruction, mononuclear cell infiltration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and peribronchiolar inflammation. Score 4 = extremely severe lung pathological changes; score 3 = severe lung pathological changes; score 2 = moderate lung pathological changes; score 1 = mild lung pathological changes; score 0 = no pathological changes. Data were analyzed using twoway ANOVA (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001). record of high safety and efficacy in the human population since the 1960s (33, 46, 47) . MeV grows to high titers in Vero cells, a WHO-approved cell line for vaccine production, facilitating vaccine manufacturing. Natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may not be long-lived (48, 49) . However, MeV vaccine induces longlasting immunity and protection against MeV infections (22, 50) . By expressing the S protein from an rMeV vector, it may be possible to also induce long-lasting immunity to the S protein and to protect against COVID-19 disease. In areas of the world where MeV vaccination is not complete, such a combination vaccine could protect against both diseases. By incorporating rMeV-preS into the existing MMR vaccine, a quadruple vaccine could be developed against these four important pathogens for children. According to American Academy of Pediatrics, the number of US infants, children, and teens diagnosed with COVID-19 had reached more 2.6 million by 21 January 2021, accounting for 12.7% of all cases in the United States. Such a quadruple vaccine would be highly attractive for children.",

            "text": "In this study, we directly compared the efficacy of preS, native full-length S, S1, and three different lengths of RBD antigens in cotton rats. We found that the preS protein is the most potent antigen in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA antibodies, but more importantly, neutralizing antibodies. All five cotton rats immunized with rMeV-preS triggered uniformly high antibody responses whereas antibody titers in the rMeV-S group were variable. Although there was no significant difference in antibody titers (P > 0.05), the rMeV-preS induced significantly higher neutralizing antibodies than rMeV-S (P < 0.05). Similarly, rMeV-preS induced uniformly high antibodies in other animal models including IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 -CD46 mice and golden Syrian hamsters. In hamsters, the neutralizing antibody induced by rMeV-preS was significantly higher than human COVID-19 convalescent sera (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that preS is more immunogenic than native full-length S. It is likely that spontaneous triggering of the metastable native full-length S leads to release of the S1 portion of the protein and refolding to the postfusion form, thereby losing the prefusion-specific antigenic sites and reducing its ability to induce neutralizing antibodies. This is similar to many fusion glycoproteins (such as those from paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, and HIV) in that the \"prefusion\" form of proteins are more potent in inducing neutralizing activity than its \"postfusion\" forms (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . We also found that S1 and the RBDs are poor antigens in the MeV vector, which is probably due to the suboptimal conformation of these monomeric proteins. Interestingly, Pfizer's BNT162b1, a lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the trimerized RBD, was effective in triggering neutralizing antibody in human clinical trials (7, 51) . Perhaps, the trimerization and/or adjuvants enhance its immunogenicity.",

We observed high frequencies of CD8 + T cells capable of producing Th1 cytokines, whereas frequencies of CD4 + T cells were low. Similar results were observed in an earlier study in which mice were vaccinated with recombinant adenovirus vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein (52) . Consistent with this, hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge without any enhanced lung immunopathology. These results suggest that rMeV-preS is safe and highly efficacious. Historically, ADE has been a challenge in coronavirus vaccine development (53) . It was reported that inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine candidates (54) and several SARS-CoV-1 vaccine candidates, including an inactivated whole-virus vaccine (55), virus-like-particle vaccine (56) , and modified vaccinia virus Ankara-based recombinant vaccine (57), induced ADE in various animal models. Mechanistically, the excessive Th2-cytokine-biased responses and inadequate Th1-biased T cell response contributed to the immunopathology upon SARS-CoV-1 infection (53, 55, 56) . Thus, an ideal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should induce a high level of Th1 but not Th2-biased T cell response. Clearly, the rMeV-preS-based vaccine platform meets this criterion.",

After challenge with SARS-CoV-2, the MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H)-immunized hamsters had significant weight loss at postinfection days (PIDs) 1 to 3 but started to gain weight at PID 4. Furthermore, 4 to 5 log PFU/g tissue of SARS-CoV-2 were still detected in the nasal turbinate in MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H)-immunized hamsters. Thus, MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H) only induced partial protection Fig. 9 . rMeV-preS immunization prevents SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in lungs. IHC staining of lung sections from hamsters killed at day 4 after SARS-CoV-2 challenge is shown. Lung sections were stained with SARS-CoV-2 N antibody. Micrographs with 1\u00d7, 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7, and 10\u00d7 magnification of a representative lung section from each group are shown. Scale bars are indicated at the left corner of each image. against SARS-CoV-2 challenge (58) . It should be noted that our study differs significantly from the H\u00f6rner's study. We significantly improved the efficacy of the rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by using two different strategies. First, we generated rMeV expressing a stabilized, preS (rMeV-preS) and rMeV expressing full-length S protein (rMeV-S) and found that rMeV-preS was significantly more potent in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies than rMeV-preS. Second, our preS and S genes were inserted at the P and M gene junction, near the 3' end of the MeV genome. As a typical nonsegmented negativesense RNA virus, MeV mRNA transcription is sequential and gradient such that 3\u2032 proximal genes are transcribed more abundantly than 5\u2032 distal genes, thereby producing more copies of their encoded proteins. Thus, the expression of preS and S in our vaccines is much higher than H\u00f6rner's vaccine, which further enhance the immunogenicity. As shown in our report, rMeV-preS induced uniformly high levels of neutralizing antibody in all animals in all four animal models. A single immunization of rMeV-preS is sufficient to induce a high level antibody response. Importantly, rMeV-preS induced higher levels of neutralizing antibody than found in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, rMeV-preS provides complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.",
