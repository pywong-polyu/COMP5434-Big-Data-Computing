In the 13-to 19-year-old age group, rates rose from 6.9/100,000 in 2013 to 8.8/100,000 in 2019, a 28% increase [2] . The data from the biennially conducted Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) indicate that suicide attempt rates were stable or declining during the same period [3] , which suggests that the lethality of attempts may be increasing. The reasons for adolescent suicide attempts are complex, and numerous risk factors in the home, community and school settings are identified [4] [5] [6] . Adolescent suicidal behavior and deaths make lasting impacts on families, who may be left confused about the lack of signs prior to suicide, and who struggle with stress, anxiety and depression in the wake of losing a valued family member [7] . Friends of adolescents who die by suicide also struggle with depression and suicidal ideation [8] , and the larger community is affected as well [9, 10] , including through potential suicide contagion [11] .",

Friendships play a somewhat unclear and complicated role in suicide risk for Hispanics [16] .

For Mexican-American girls, social disconnectedness from friends at school is a risk factor for suicidal ideation, especially for academically high achieving girls [18] .

For Latina suicide attempters who expressed clear intent to die, familism, or the sense that they must sacrifice themselves and their happiness for the sake of their family, was a commonly expressed sentiment [24] . Additional Latina-specific risk factors identified from a longitudinal analysis of YRBS data include experiencing physical fighting or bullying at school, forced sexual intercourse, four or more lifetime sexual partners, and drug use [25, 26] . For Hispanic teenagers in New Mexico of both sexes, food insecurity and being born outside of the US were risk factors, and for girls, speaking a language other than English at home was associated with suicide attempts [27] .",

The measures of positive relationships with adults at home and in the community, and with same-age friends, were significantly and negatively associated with suicide attempts for Hispanic teens of both sexes. The strongest effect size was associated with parents or other adults at home believing in students' success. For both sexes, each additional level of agreement with the statement was associated with approximately a 50% reduction in the probability of past-year suicide attempts. The effect size of Hispanic teens, who had a parent knowing where they were when they were not at home, was also strong and associated with a decrease in the probability of suicide attempts by nearly 50% with each additional level of agreement with the statement. Positive relationships with community adults had effect sizes that were only slightly lower, indicating a 35-44% reduction in suicide attempt probability. Having caring or helpful friends was also significant, with past-year suicide probability decreasing by approximately 24-34% for each increasing level of endorsement of the two statements about same-age friends. The involvement in group activities outside of home and school was related to pastyear suicide attempt probability for Hispanic girls but not boys. The participation in music, art, and hobbies, was significantly related to past-year suicide attempts for Hispanic boys only. Controlling for age, grades, and parents' education notably changed the results of only one analysis. For girls, the significant relationship between participation in organized group activities outside the home and school was slightly lower in effect after controlling for confounders (OR = 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79, 0.98; p-value 0.018). Table 3 presents the results of multivariable modeling, including the full model and the final model after reverse stepwise regression. Hispanic boys and girls did not differ with respect to the types of relationships that remained associated with a lower probability of a suicide attempt. Having a parent or other adult at home believing in their success had the greatest effect size, with the probability of suicide attempt reduced by more than 30% for each increased level of agreement with the statement when other variables were controlled. Additionally, related to parents and the home environment, having a parent or guardian know where their teen children were when they were not at home was strongly protective with respect to suicide attempt probability. Importantly, having an adult outside the home or school who tells Hispanic teens when they do a good job remained significant in the model. School grades remained a control variable for Hispanic teens of both sexes and age was a control variable for adolescent girls. The relationships with friends did not remain significantly associated with the probability of past-year suicide attempts when other variables were controlled for Hispanic boys or girls.

Most salient were the vastly different perspectives that parents and adolescents had on the severity of suicidal ideation.
