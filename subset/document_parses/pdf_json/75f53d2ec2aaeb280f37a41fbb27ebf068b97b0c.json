The authors concluded that pwCF may have better outcomes compared to other chronic diseases due to younger age and lower prevalence of obesity. The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR) reported 414 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in pwCF from 37 countries across Europe in their continually updated registry till January 20, 2021 [7] . Many of these patients are included in the 'Cystic Fibrosis Registry Global Harmonization Group' study noted above. A total of 7 deaths have been noted in patients with cystic fibrosis included in that registry. Notably, 150/414 patients had unknown severity of COVID-19 disease. Of the patients that required hospitalization, 17 needed ICU care (15%).",

Firstly, many patients in the reports discussed above, did not have follow-up available, and many of them were reported as not yet recovered from COVID-19, with some still admitted to the intensive care at the time of publication. All of our patients had 30-day follow-up available, during which time their disease course should have truly manifested itself, and therefore this analysis results in a more 'real world' and accurate picture of the course of COVID-19 disease in this population. Interestingly, the rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 in pwCF reported by both registries noted above (51.2% and 27.54%) were even higher than the rates of hospitalization that we have noted. Their analysis lacked a control group; however, it should be safe to assume that such high levels of hospitalization with COVID-19 would not be expected in the general population. Secondly, due to the availability of a control group, and propensity scores matching performed in our analysis, conclusions can be drawn regarding the risk of severe disease compared to the general population. As our data is directly pulled from electronic health records, and not reported by providers manually, it should also suffer less from selection bias.",

This may introduce some bias in the result, given the significant degree of immunosuppression that these people receive and any possible differences in response to SARS-COV2 vaccination in transplant patients.
