In contrast, the second sample had a higher viral RNA concentration, Viruses 2020, 12, 895 2 of 13 which yielded good genome coverage and consensus. ARTIC amplification showed the highest depth of coverage results for both samples, suggesting this protocol is effective for low concentrations. Liverpool amplification provided a more even read coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, but at a lower depth of coverage. Bait capture enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA provided results on par with amplification. While only two clinical samples were examined in this comparative analysis, both the Liverpool and ARTIC amplification methods showed differing efficacy for high and low concentration samples. In addition, amplification-free bait capture enriched sequencing of cDNA is a viable method for generating a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and for identification of amplification artifacts.",

            "text": "The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has infected over 20 million people globally, of which over 750,000 have died (as of 13 August 2020) [1] . COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, which emerged in December 2019 [2] . As with any outbreak of a novel pathogen, diagnostics are critical to assess infection in humans and to monitor the extent of the spread of the pathogen. Critical components of outbreak analysis and pathogen identification are second generation high-throughput short-read sequencing and third generation long-read sequencing [3, 4] . For COVID-19, the rapid development of diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was facilitated by the availability of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolates [4, 5] . In addition, sequencing enables continuous monitoring of circulating strains of the virus to determine any adaptive changes that the virus may accumulate, which may affect its detection, transmissibility, and pathogenicity [6] . Sequencing will also serve an important function as antiviral and vaccine trials roll out, identifying antiviral resistance determinants and vaccine escape mutants, and is essential for detecting viral recombination. For reliable determination of genomic sequences, it is important to have high quality starting genetic material, such as RNA from cultured SARS-CoV-2. Patient samples, such as mid-turbinate swabs, may contain other viruses including seasonal coronaviruses and are also dominated by host genetic material and resident respiratory flora. It is thus imperative to evaluate the performance of genomic amplification and sequencing protocols needed to enhance the derivation of SARS-CoV-2 specific genomic data. Two methods have been widely adopted to obtain SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from patient samples: (1) the use of SARS-CoV-2 specific PCR primers (tiling multiplex PCR) [7] and (2) the use of bait capture to enrich the SARS-CoV-2 genomic material [8] [9] [10] . These processes have their own advantages and disadvantages. Tiling multiplex PCR allows for the amplification of numerous viral amplicons but can introduce synthetic artifacts with subsequent cycles. Moreover, divergence from PCR primer sequences can result in suboptimal binding resulting in lost information on genetic diversity or off-target hybridization. Alternatively, bait capture enriches viral RNA by reducing the quantity of non-viral nucleotides, subsequently shrinking the total sequencing volume of the sample. However, the generation of optimal baits requires prior knowledge of the target virus, which is limited in the response against a novel virus. The primary objective of this analysis is to compare genome sequencing results from direct amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (i.e., the Liverpool or ARTIC PCR protocols) [7] with bait capture enrichment from COVID-19 patient swabs with markedly different viral RNA concentrations. Secondarily, we perform a genomic analysis for a) genetic relatedness and b) diagnostic PCR primer mismatch. ",

In the Wuhan-derived sample, the majority of read data was from the patient genome and therefore resulted in poor SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage and consensus, potentially due to the higher Ct value of the initial sample (i.e., less abundant or fragmented SARS-CoV-2 RNA). By contrast, sequencing data from the Iran-derived isolate consisted predominantly of SARS-CoV-2 molecules and produced a high coverage genome consensus (Table 1) . However, ARTIC amplification led to superior results for both the Wuhanand Iran-derived samples (Table 1) , strongly suggesting that the ARTIC protocol would be best for samples with lower viral loads. On examining the sequencing results of the Iran-derived sample more closely, we observed that the Liverpool amplification produced successful results with or without subsequent bait capture enrichment, while cDNA synthesis using random hexamers led to lower relative sampling of SARS-CoV-2 molecules in the sequencing library and poor genome coverage. However, bait capture enriched SARS-CoV-2 cDNA molecules in the sample, producing genome consensus and coverage on par with the Liverpool amplification approaches.

Amplification of the Wuhan-derived sample using Liverpool primers was limited to a few regions of the genome with 0-100x coverage. This is in contrast to the Iran-derived sample, which had >1000x coverage across >95% of the genome for all methods except the direct sequencing of cDNA (for which~99% of the genome still had 101-1000x coverage). On average, bait capture enriched the Liverpool amplifications by 1.2 fold and the direct cDNA samples by 19.6 fold, respectively. Although we did not perform secondary enrichment of ARTIC amplification products, these results illustrate that secondary enrichment is not important for PCR amplicons, but valuable for direct sequencing of cDNA. Notably, while ARTIC amplification led to the best overall results for the Iran-derived sample, read alignment revealed several regions with low read coverage (Figure 2) , including a 319 bp coverage gap within the orf1ab gene (Table 2 ). This region falls within ARTICv3 s amplicon 64 that has been widely reported to generate little to no sequence coverage [33] . In contrast, the Liverpool amplification produced a more even read coverage across the genome (Figure 2 ). sample more closely, we observed that the Liverpool amplification produced successful results with or without subsequent bait capture enrichment, while cDNA synthesis using random hexamers led to lower relative sampling of SARS-CoV-2 molecules in the sequencing library and poor genome coverage.

In contrast, the Liverpool amplification produced a more even read coverage across the genome (Figure 2 ). Mutation analysis of the well sequenced Iran-derived sample detected one synonymous substitution and four non-synonymous substitutions for the orf1ab gene, plus one non-synonymous substitution for the N gene (Table 2) . While positions 8653 and 28,688 overlap ARTIC PCR primers and could reflect the failed removal of primer sequences by the bioinformatics workflow, both were independently confirmed by the Liverpool amplifications and bait captured cDNA. All five substitutions were consistently supported by 100% of sequencing reads, except for L3606F in the orf1ab gene using the Liverpool amplification, the detection of which by BreSeq [20] was obscured by a deletion predicted by a minority of reads; nonetheless iVar [18] consensus generation supported L3606F. This location has been flagged for possible homoplastic sequencing artifacts [31] . Sequencing of cDNA (bait enriched or otherwise) and ARTIC amplification predicted an intergenic nucleotide substitution at position 29,742 in 100% of sequencing reads, yet this was not observed in sequences derived from the Liverpool amplification due to missing read coverage (Figure 2 ). This position is very close to the polyA tail and while not flagged for exclusion due to poor alignment [31] , manual inspection of the read alignments highlighted imperfect mapping of a minority of reads, so this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) should be viewed with caution. Finally, both Liverpool and ARTIC amplification methods had minority read support (10.9-22.8% of reads) for a deletion starting at position 11,074 or 11,082, which was not observed for sequencing of unamplified cDNA, but this region has been highlighted for Illumina-specific sequencing artifacts [31] .

While the Liverpool amplification primers provided a more even read coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, amplification using the ARTIC primers was superior for obtaining a complete genome sequence to the point where it was the only successful protocol for one of our samples. Yet ARTIC amplification had regions of low or missing sequence coverage not seen with sequencing of cDNA or the Liverpool amplification ( Figure 2 ). Additionally, low Liverpool and ARTIC coverage at positions 11,500 to~13,000 was associated with minority read support for a deletion in the BreSeq analysis, which was not supported by bait enriched cDNA sequencing. This region has been associated with artifacts of Illumina sequencing of amplicons [31] . Yet our standardized iVar-based pipeline (github.com/jaleezyy/covid-19-signal), compatible with and extending the Connor lab ARTIC nextflow pipeline (github.com/connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf), was able to overcome these regions of low coverage, favoring the majority reads to generate a final genome sequence. ARTIC amplification and sequencing resulted in a 319 bp gap within the coding region for the orf1ab gene (amplicon 64) so this would underpredict any SNPs in this region, while the Liverpool amplification was confirmed to miss a possible intergenic SNP due to missing coverage at the 3 terminal region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.",

Additionally, it is important for prioritizing virus isolates for subsequent analysis of glycosylation sites and other post-translational modification, as well as cell-culture experiments to investigate in vitro phenotypes. Notably, the prediction of glycosylation sites using NetOGlyc (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) found no differences between the original Wuhan genome (MN908947\u00b73) and our Iran-derived isolate. However, our work did detect mismatches for currently used diagnostics PCR primers, specifically in primers designed by the CDC and the Japanese NID. Clinical laboratories should be aware of this, and we suggest this should be part of ongoing genomic surveillance efforts. We also note that neither amplification method (Liverpool or ARTIC) was perfect, but the results indicated that amplification-free, bait capture enriched sequencing of cDNA is of high utility for the identification of amplification artifacts and may additionally be useful for direct sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from cell culture.",

Understanding the advantages and limitations of different protocols is essential to population-level whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples. Although the heterogeneity of this source of material may be a limitation, particularly for samples with low quantities and/or quality of RNA, it is the most feasible approach given the constraints of virus isolation. This approach also produces sequences most closely reflecting those within the host. However, we also acknowledge that this work is limited to two clinical samples, which give a preliminary outlook onto the efficacy of each protocol. Additionally, our study only investigated one sample type and evaluation of these protocols with other sample types (e.g., lower-respiratory tract samples) will be informative. Recently, Xiao and colleagues performed comparative studies on sputum, throat swabs, anal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs and reported that more viral reads were recovered from nasal swabs than any other sample type [35] , although it is not clear if they were using paired samples. This suggests protocol optimization for other sample types is necessary. Overall, standardization and quality controls are necessary for informative broad analyses and to enable DNA sequencing protocol implementation at regional sites of care for enhanced turnaround time to generate actionable data.",
