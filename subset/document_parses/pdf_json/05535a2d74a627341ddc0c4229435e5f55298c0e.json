Late-onset severe COVID-19 patients may respond to anti-inflammatory therapy without worsening the initial early viral infection. 3 We describe a case series of 15 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU who received corticosteroids in the context of CRS. Cytokine release syndrome was identified as worsening hypoxemia or vasoplegia with rising C-reactive protein (CRP) or interleukin-6 levels without alternative clinical explanation. The Research Ethics Board at our local site approved this retrospective case series.",

We found a significant clinical and biochemical association between corticosteroids and improved surrogate outcomes in late-onset CRS associated with COVID-19. Corticosteroids are indicated to treat CRS occurring from immune or chimeric antigen receptor therapy, but its use in weathering the cytokine storm in viral infection remains controversial, particularly if given early. 4 Other coronaviruses have an inverted ''V'' distribution of viral shedding, peaking ten days after the onset of symptoms and then decreasing rapidly. Consequently, the clinical deterioration occurring after ten days may be caused by dysregulated inflammation and not the virus itself, offering a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention. 4 Our report is limited by several important factors. There was no control group and therefore no randomization of intervention, we examined surrogate outcomes of uncertain clinical relevance, and there was likely selection bias in determining who received steroids and what dose they received. We report very few patients from a single centre, making it difficult to generalize our results to other hospitals even after consideration of the biases present. Additionally, exact criteria for CRS are not available and the prognostic importance of CRS in COVID-19 patients remains to be determined.",
