However, the mechanism of PF related to COVID (COVID-PF) is unknown. This study aimed to explore the key targets in the development of COVID-PF and the mechanism of D-limonene in the COVID-PF treatment. The differentially expressed genes of COVID-PF were downloaded from the GeneCards database, and their pathways were analyzed. D-Limonene was molecularly docked with related proteins to screen its pharmacological targets, and a rat lung fibrosis model was established to verify D-limonene's effect on COVID-PFrelated targets. The results showed that the imbalance between collagen breakdown and metabolism, inflammatory response, and angiogenesis are the core processes of COVID-PF; and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are the key targets of the treatment of COVID-PF. The ability of D-limonene to protect against PF induced by bleomycin in rats was reported. The mechanism is related to the binding of PI3K and NF-\u03baB p65, and the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/IKK-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway expression and phosphorylation. These results confirmed the relationship between the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and COVID-PF, showing that D-limonene has a potential therapeutic value for COVID-PF.",

In general, persistent inflammatory damage to lung tissue caused by various reasons develops into pulmonary fibrosis (PF) (1) and further leads to pulmonary dysfunction and reduced quality of life after recovery. Although PF changes are occasionally observed as sequelae of other respiratory viral infections, they appear to be more common after COVID (2) . For example, in 1-year followup studies, PF was observed in the lungs of 27.5% of SARS survivors (n = 97) (3) . Long-term follow-up studies have shown that many survivors of SARS-CoV infection show signs of fibrosis in their lungs (4) (5) (6) . MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection can also be responsible for PF (7, 8) . Pathological analysis revealed that the alveolar septum of MERS patients was destroyed and expanded, and type II alveolar epithelial cells proliferated and shed. The clinical manifestations and severity of COVID-19 are similar to those of SARS (9) . A large amount of evidence supports that COVID-19 can contribute to PF (10) . The pathological changes in the early lungs of COVID-19 can be manifested as viral interstitial pneumonia, suggesting that it is imperative to start anti-fibrosis treatment in the early clinical stage (11) . Pirfenidone (PFD) is a commonly used drug for the clinical treatment of PF, but it cannot effectively prolong the survival of patients (12, 13) . PFD has side effects of gastrointestinal reactions, rash, and photosensitivity (14, 15) . At present, the mechanism of occurrence and development of COVID-related PF (COVID-PF) is not yet clear. Due to this lack of therapeutic options, there is a critical need to understand the molecular pathways involved in the development of COVID-PF (16, 17) , thus helping to identify novel targets for therapy and develop new drugs.",

These endeavors will enable more comprehensive and systematic study for diseases. With a spurt of progress in high-throughput GeneChips and sequencing technologies in recent years, it has been made possible to reveal the gene expression profile of COVID-PF and the changes in PF tissue and cell key genes. On this basis, there have been successful examples in other fields to screen potential drugs by docking small molecular compounds with proteins according to their core differentially expressed gene proteins. D-Limonene is a terpenoid compound extracted from the essential oils of several citrus plants, and it is widely used in the food industry (17) . Systematic reviews and pharmacological studies have found that D-limonene can prevent and control respiratory system damage through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities (18) . It has also been reported that Dlimonene can improve the pulmonary tissue remodeling that occurs in animal models of pulmonary hypertension and asthma. Respiratory system damage and lung tissue structure remodeling are mutually causal and vicious circles and play a key role in forming COVID-PF. However, the mechanism of action of D-limonene on PF is unknown. This study aimed to analyze the key signaling pathways of the COVID-PF differentially expressed genes and explore the mechanism of D-limonene in a rat model.",

After being administered PFD and different doses of D-limonene, the expressions of PI3K, Akt, IKK\u03b1, and NF-\u03baB p65 decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 was upregulated. In addition, the expressions of PI3K mRNA, Akt mRNA, and NF-\u03baB p65 mRNA were downregulated (Figure 6C) , indicating that Dlimonene can inhibit the activation of the PI3K/Akt/IKK-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway in PF rats. The immunohistochemistry results also proved this (Figures 6D,J-L) , and the effect of D-limonene at a dose of 100 mg/kg was similar to that of PFD. The study of phosphorylated proteins found that BLM induced the phosphorylation of PI3K in the rat model and also induced the rapid and sustained phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308, Ser473, and NF-\u03baB p65 at Ser536. Different doses of D-limonene downregulated the expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT Thr308, and p-NF-\u03baB p65 Ser536 (Figures 6E-I) . PFD downregulated the expressions of p-AKT Thr308 and p-AKT Ser473 (Figures 6G,H) . However, we did not observe a significant change in p-AKT Ser473 expression in the D-limonene group ( Figure 6H ).",

            "text": "Coronavirus not only has a higher fibrogenic potential than common respiratory viruses but also makes patients more likely to enter a dangerous acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) state. Patients with ARDS require mechanical ventilation to maintain respiratory function during treatment to improve the patient's hypoxic state, and mechanical ventilation-related lung injury is a major adverse reaction caused by the ventilator to patients (21) . The harmful effect of mechanical ventilation is not only mediated by the systemic release of local inflammatory cytokines but also induced by mechanical stress, which can lead to the transformation of epithelial stroma and the release of fibrogenic mediators caused by cell stretching and mechanical ventilation, which then develops into PF (22, 23) . Therefore, the factors of continuous lung damage in the course of COVID-19 are complicated, and PF may become the main complication after the completion of this outbreak. Bioinformatics research suggests that inflammatory response, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and other biological processes and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway are closely related to COVID-PF. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (24) (25) (26) . Studies have shown that the PI3K/Akt pathway, as a form of \"adaptive strategy, \" is involved in the immune response process of the host cell to counteract viral invasion (27) . This partly explains the preference of COVID-PF as a complication and sequela of viral infection for PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Although COVID is not unique to humans, animal models of coronavirus infection show different disease characteristics than humans. Although several other animal models of SARS-CoV infection have been described, these models rarely show lethality (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . Although studies have predicted that the survival of lethally infected aged mice could be extended to the fibrotic phase of ARDS using sublethal infection, the model has clear fibrosis characteristics, which are very different from the clinical manifestations of human patients (33) . Therefore, this study selected BLM to induce PF in rats at the start of the study. Our study found that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the lung tissue of PF rats was significantly activated, consistent with the predictions of bioinformatics. AKT is the main effector kinase of the PI3K signaling pathway. AKT activated by phosphorylation has important biological significance. Many growth factors, hormones, and cytokines activate AKT by binding their homologous receptor tyrosine kinase or by triggering the activation of lipid kinase PI3K, thereby generating PIP3 in the plasma membrane of the cell. AKT binds to PIP3 through its PH domain, causing AKT to translocate to the cell membrane and phosphorylated by the double phosphorylation mechanism. PDK1, which is also translocated to the cell membrane due to its PH domain, can also phosphorylate AKT by activating the Thr308 site. The secondary phosphorylation of Ser473 at the carboxyl terminus of AKT is also necessary for activity and is performed by mTORC2 (34, 35) . Studies have confirmed that PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of PF, and blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway can reduce BLM-induced inflammation and fibrosis (36) . NF-\u03baB is a nuclear transcription factor that is involved in the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes. At rest, the NF-\u03baB dimer binds to I\u03baB\u03b1 and exists in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. Under the stimulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF-\u03b1 (37), IKK is activated to phosphorylate serine residues at specific sites of I\u03baB\u03b1 and then ubiquitinates and degrades. At the same time, Ser536 of NF-\u03baB p65 transcription activation domain can also be phosphorylated by IKK to enhance its transcriptional activity. In contrast, the process of LPS activation of NF-\u03baB p65 is initiated by upstream kinases such as PI3K/AKT (38, 39) . This study found that D-limonene can dose-dependently inhibit the expression of PI3K, Akt, and NF-\u03baB p65; can inhibit the upregulation of IKK-\u03b1 and the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1; and can inhibit the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT (Thr308 site), and NF-\u03baB p65 (Ser536 site), which is consistent with previous reports on the mechanism of action of D-limonene (40) (41) (42) .",

D-Limonene can downregulate the expression of fibrotic markers such as COL1A1, COL3A1, and \u03b1-SMA and can reduce the content of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF mRNA in tissues, which is of positive significance for COVID-PF and even ARDS in the middle and late stages. Although there are inherent difficulties in preparing animal models of COVID-PF as mentioned above, this study did not proceed directly on the relevant animal models, so only D-limonene can be called a \"potential\" effective natural compound. In addition, there are few studies on COVID-PF at present. The differential gene expression data collected in the public database may not fully reflect all the characteristics of COVID-PF. Moreover, due to factors such as lack of time, we have not yet established a sufficient number of pathologically confirmed COVID-19-related PF patient databases to support our research conclusions. The above items are the main limitations of this research. In the current imaging analysis of these patients, we found that their PF can show two patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia or non-specific interstitial pneumoniathese are two completely different outcomes. Therefore, studying the pathological characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19related PF in different populations and the therapeutic value of existing drugs for other fibrotic lung diseases on COVID-19-related PF should be the next research direction. Therefore, in future studies, we will continue to pay attention to the research progress of this disease in order to fully understand its pathogenesis.",

The ability of Dlimonene was reported for the first time to protect against lung fibrosis induced by BLM in rats. The mechanism is related to the binding of PI3K and NF-\u03baB p65 and the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/IKK-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB p65 signaling pathway expression and phosphorylation. Additionally, new insights are provided into the potential value of D-limonene in the treatment of COVID-PF. However, at this time, the research on the differential gene expression of COVID-19 leaves some room for improvement, so our research on COVID-PF cannot fully summarize the characteristics of COVID-19-PF. It remains to be further explored.",
