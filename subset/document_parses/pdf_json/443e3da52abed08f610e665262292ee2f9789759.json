From March 2020, we experienced the supply tensions in highly consumed medicines for the care of patients with COVID, so a new supply system was set up by the French Ministry of Health with a controlled distribution of these medicines between hospital establishments at national level, with a possible regional adjustment via Health Regional Agencies. Targeted drugs were sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents, massively used to manage severe COVID-19 pneumonia but also essential for anesthesia practice, namely: propofol, midazolam, cisatracurium, atracurium and rocuronium. The distribution key was then essentially based on the number of resuscitation beds (COVID and non-COVID), without initially taking into account the residual activity of anesthesia for urgent intervention. To also integrate the anesthesia component, which already existed at a small volume but which would regain importance with future gradual resumptions of surgical activities, the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy (SFPC) and the French Society of Anesthesia and Critical Care (SFAR) aimed to assess and proposed taking into account the ratio of these drugs between anesthesia activities (operating theaters-OT, and post-anesthesia care units-PACU) and critical care activities (intensive care units-ICU, etc.) for each establishment (private or public, with or without resuscitation activities) during the first COVID-19 wave in France.",

A shortage of at least one of the five drugs concerned by the survey was reported by 28% of establishments. Nineteen percent of establishments have received at least one specialty with a foreign labelling (not French). The reduced quantities observed overall in March 2020 for operating theaters, interventional units and PACU are related to the decrease in anesthesia activity linked to surgical activity, which was strongly reduced during this period. In parallel, we could see the significant increase in dispensations of the five drugs studied in critical care in connection with the treatment of COVID patients. The order of magnitude of this variation goes from quantity doubled for propofol and midazolam, and quadrupled for curares. This survey shows that the large increase in anesthesia drug consumption in critical care, appearing over a very short period and in a homogeneous manner across all establishments, was greater than the decrease observed on the surgical side. This observation was of utmost importance to calibrate distribution of stocks among hospitals between ICU and OT and to mitigate the impact of drug shortage on anesthesia activities. Indeed, there was no data at that time on the residual OR activities related to urgent surgical interventions.",

Prescriptions were reported on atracurium in anesthesia. We then observed the use of all curares in resuscitation to save or replace cisatracurium (without information on the usual practices of each establishment). We observed the same trend, increased distribution in intensive care, for propofol and midazolam but at a lower level. This difference in effect was probably due to co-administration of other sedative drugs to save propofol and/or midazolam (neuroleptics, benzodiazepine other than midazolam, alpha 2 agonists). Other services such as home hospitalization and palliative care have not been totally devoid of midazolam (the decrease can be explained by the saving strategies, which were implemented).",
