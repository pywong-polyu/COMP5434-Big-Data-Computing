To account for the infection stages of the asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals, the asymptomatic infected individuals were further disaggregated into three infection stages: (a) latent (b) infectious and (c) non-infectious; while the symptomatic infected were disaggregated into two stages: (a) infectious and (b) non-infectious. The simulation result shows that by the end of the current epidemic cycle without considering the possibility of a second wave, under the containment intervention implemented in Singapore, the confirmed number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic cases) is projected to PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.be 52,053 (with 95% confidence range of 49,370-54,735) representing 0.87% (0.83%-0.92%) of the total population; while the actual number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed and undiagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic infected cases) is projected to be 86,041 (81,097-90,986), which is 1.65 times the confirmed cases and represents 1.45% (1.36%-1.53%) of the total population. A peak in infected cases is projected to have occurred on around day 125 (27/05/2020) for the confirmed infected cases and around day 115 (17/05/2020) for the actual infected cases. The number of deaths is estimated to be 37 (34-39) among those infected with COVID-19 by the end of the epidemic cycle; consequently, the perceived case fatality rate is projected to be 0.07%, while the actual case fatality rate is estimated to be 0.043%. Importantly, our simulation model results suggest that there about 65% more COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore that have not been captured in the official reported numbers which could be uncovered via a serological study. Compared to the containment intervention, a mitigation intervention would have resulted in early peak infection, and increase both the cumulative confirmed and actual infection cases and deaths.",

The first is \"containment\", involving quarantine of specific individuals based on tracing from their contact to a known infected individual or their history of recent travel to a high prevalence country or region. \"Mitigation\" is a second strategy aiming to limit movement at the population level; social distancing ranges from limiting physical proximity between people to no less than one meter to community lockdown. At different points in the progression of COVID-19, many countries have implemented various policy strategies, with most applying a mixture of containment and mitigation to reduce disease burden, morbidity and mortality when faced with local exponential growth of infected cases, all whilst aiming to minimize social and economic disruption. An additional major consideration in policy discussions is how these interventions mitigates stress on healthcare systems so that essential medical care can be provided to non-COVID as well as COVID patients. This is the rationale for pursuing interventions that might not substantially reduce total numbers of infections but would rather \"flatten the curve\".",

In response, the Singaporean government adopted an aggressive containment strategy focusing mainly on swift and effective contact tracing and quarantine of individuals in order to prevent small clusters of COVID-19 infection from amplifying in a chainlike fashion into widespread community transmission. The containment strategy implemented by Singapore has been associated with a more moderate rise in number of infections than otherwise expected; the moderate number has allowed the Singapore health system to meet the needs of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, resulting in very few (25) deaths as of June 7, 2020. Given the extensive impact of COVID-19 globally, there is international interest to learn from best practices that have shown to work in controlling community spread to inform future epidemic outbreaks. This research aims to explore what the trajectory of COVID-19 infection would have been in Singapore had the government intervention not focused on containment, but rather on mitigation to inform future epidemic outbreak interventions.",

Following the identification of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the Singaporean government acted immediately to ensure the safety of their citizens [5] . Fig 1 shows the timeline of actions taken in Singapore in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Although contact tracing is by no means a new innovation, Singapore's aggressive and proactive approach, praised by the WHO, has led to the avoidance of a community-wide spread [7] . Upon receiving word of a newly diagnosed patient, contact tracers immediately embark on a labor-intensive attempt to identify people who have been in contact with infected individuals, thereby being able to find those who may themselves may be infected [6] . Because the incubation period of COVID-19 is relatively short, contact tracing must be swift in order to contain the outbreak. Security cameras, receipts, and work calendars are used to fill in the gaps in memory of those infected who are unable to recall their whereabouts. Launched on March 20, the Trace Together application was developed to facilitate contact tracing by monitoring users' locations and alerting any user who has come into contact with any individual who has tested positive for COVID-19. A detailed description of Singapore's approach to COVID-19 and COVID-19 cases is provided in the online only S1 and S2 Appendices in S1 File.",

To account for the infection stages of the asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals, the asymptomatic infected individuals were further disaggregated into three infection stages: (a) latent-the infection stage before becoming infectious; (b) infectious; and (c) noninfectious-when the virus is no longer viable [14] . Likewise, the symptomatic infected individuals were disaggregated into two infection stages: (a) infectious and (b) non-infectious. The main differences between the proposed modified SIR model presented herein and the SIDARTHE model are that: (a) our model has 7 health states compared to the eight-health state of the SIDARTHE model. (b) our modified SIR model further disaggregates the asymptomatic infected individuals into three infection stages, which is not the case for SIDARTHE model. (c) the modified SIR model disaggregates the symptomatic infected individuals into two infection stages, which is absent in the SIDARTHE model. We strongly believe that the amendment made compared to the SIDARTHE model will significantly improve the accuracy of the simulation model to predict the infection trajectory of COVID-19, and more importantly, help to estimate the actual COVID-19 infection cases. Briefly, the transmission dynamics as depicted in Figs 2 and 3 is as follows: through exposure to an infected individual, some of the exposed individuals become infected, and transition to the infected asymptomatic health state. At the asymptomatic health state, infected individuals go through three infection stages-latent, infectious and non-infectious [14] . All newly infected individuals move from asymptomatic latent state to asymptomatic infectious stage. During the asymptomatic infectious stage, some individuals will develop symptoms and transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic infectious state, while others will transition to non-infectious asymptomatic and eventually recover from the virus. Infected individuals in asymptomatic and symptomatic health state can be diagnosed through testing and move from undiagnosed to diagnosed health state. Non-infectious infected individuals (asymptomatic and symptomatic) will overtime recover and move to the recovered health state; infectious symptomatic infected individuals may either recover or die from the infection.",

But it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for individuals infected with COVID-19. For the purpose of this study, we are interested in projections over a relatively short time horizon (365 days) within which temporary immunity is likely still to be in place. As a result, we assumed a zero probability of becoming susceptible again after recovering from the infection over the simulation time, although anecdotal evidence of re-infection is found in literature [18] . In addition, our simulation model specifically makes a distinction between diagnosed and undiagnosed infected individuals. Our model, assume that only undiagnosed infectious individuals create infection and that due to proper isolation and compliance to strict rules diagnosed infectious individuals do not create infection.",

The reference case (Singapore Intervention), in which the model simulates containment interventions actually implemented in Singapore, closely tracked historical trends of COVID-19 infection from January 23, up to June 7, 2020 (see Fig 5) . Under the Singapore Intervention, by the end of the current epidemic cycle without considering the possibility of a second wave, the confirmed number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic cases) is projected to be 52,053 (with 95% confidence range of 49,370-54,735) representing 0.87% (0.83%-0.92%) of the total population; the actual number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed and undiagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic infected cases) is projected to be 86,041 (81,097-90,986), which is 1.65 times the confirmed cases and represents 1.45% (1.36%-1.53%) of the total population. A peak in infected cases is projected to have occurred on around day 125 (27/05/2020) for the confirmed infected cases and around day 115 (17/05/ 2020) for the actual infected cases. The number of deaths is estimated to be 37 (34-39) among those infected with COVID-19 by the end of the epidemic cycle; consequently, the perceived case fatality rate is projected to be 0.07%, while the actual case fatality rate is estimated to be 0.043%.",

Compared to projections of a model calibrated to actual Singapore data based on a prompt and aggressive containment strategy, the simulation results indicate that a mitigation approach would have resulted in early peak infection, and increased both the cumulative confirmed and actual infection cases and deaths. Importantly, our simulation model result suggests that there about 65% more COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore that have not been captured in the official reported numbers which could possibly be uncovered via a serological study. In addition, further modelling exploration suggests that: (a) assuming a possibility of reinfection in individuals will have limited impact on the simulation results; (b) a strategy that focuses on uninhibited spread of COVID-19 would delay the peak of infection and increase both the cumulative cases and deaths by orders of magnitude. In this counterfactual modelling exercise, we found that what seems to work to significantly decrease infected COVID-19 cases is the early implementation of containment interventions that focuses on meticulous and swift contact tracing and individual-level quarantine, in addition to standard health advice on hand washing, wearing of face mask, and social distancing. What our model suggests is that implementation of social distancing without contact tracing and individual-level quarantine does not work well. The policy implication based on insight from our simulation model is that general public health measures have to be applied together with targeted, aggressive and rapid containment in order to expect to substantially reduce the number of people infected with COVID-19 and consequent mortality, and should be the preferred intervention for managing COVID-19 and future epidemic outbreaks.",

In addition, contract tracing has to be swift to reduce the delay time from onset to isolation. It is important to note that Singapore was able to show early success in containment.",

Massive efforts are currently ongoing to isolate, test, sort, re-house and treat patients on-site at these dormitories. Most cases are being managed at community isolation facilities. As this population is relatively young with little co-morbidity, it is expected that the actual numbers of cases needing intensive care will be low and mortality also correspondingly low.

Second, to reduce the complexity of the model, migration dynamics of the Singapore population were not included in the model, though migration plays an important role in the spread of COVID-19. We note that individuals traveling into Singapore can be easily targeted for containment in comparison with larger countries with less easily controlled borders.
