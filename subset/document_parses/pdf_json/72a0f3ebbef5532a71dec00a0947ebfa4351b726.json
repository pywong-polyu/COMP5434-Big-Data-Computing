This paper presents two models healthy state and diseased state which shows how secretion of IL12 is responsible for parasite elimination and IL10 can jeopardize the parasite elimination and promote its survival. Epigenetic modification in the host IL12 and IL10 promoter can decide the fate of parasites. It was observed that reciprocal relationship exists between IL12 and IL10 and that is majorly controlled by a transcription factor NFAT5 from Rel family of transcription factors. By targeting this transcription factor at the cellular level, it might be possible to modulate the release of powerful pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby reducing parasite survival. The mathematical models developed here serves as a step towards finding a key component that can pave a way for therapeutic investigation.",

Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis (MCL) is a long-term disease caused by New World Leishmania spp., such as L. braziliensis, that can cause extensive facial disfigurement and tissue destruction in the mouth and nose. The vast majority of MCL cases are not fatal. Complications associated with secondary infections, on the other hand, may result in death. Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) infection caused by L. donovani/L. infantum is far more severe. It is frequently fatal if left untreated. It is caused by a systemic and progressive infection of macrophages in the reticuloendothelial systems or lymphoid organs, primarily in the spleen, liver and bone marrow (Karunaweera and Ferreira, 2018) .",

When a sand fly takes a blood meal, it injects metacyclic promastigotes at the bite site. This stage of parasite is the infective stage with morphology characterized by slender shape and is elongated, motile and present extracellularly. Neutrophils are the first cells to be recruited at the bite site. Neutrophils engulf these promastigotes, but due to their short lifespan, they undergo apoptosis and are thus proposed to act as \"Trojan horses\" used by parasites to hitchhike ride in order to silently enter macrophages, avoiding cell activation (Regli et al., 2017) . Inside the macrophage they divide and transform into amastigotes which infect the neighboring tissues. These amastigotes are small, circular and non-motile. When the sand fly takes blood meal from the infected individual, the infected macrophages are also taken up which burst and release amastigotes in the midgut of the sand fly. Later they mature and migrate to proboscis where they can infect another individual (Leta et al., 2014) .",

These cytokines promotes the synthesis of Nitric oxide (NO) by iNOS which is directly involved in eliminating parasite by killing intracellular parasites within the NO-producing cell as well as those in bystander cells via diffusion across cell membranes (Scott and Novais, 2016) . The response of pro-inflammatory cytokines is majorly controlled by IL10 as it is anti-inflammatory cytokine and has been reported to suppress the parasite killing and lead to its survival and persistence (Maspi et al., 2016) .

IL12 is known to induce IFN\u03b3 signaling through the JAK-STAT4 mediated pathway (Hamza et al., 2010) . IFN\u03b3 further initiates a signaling cascade mediated by JAK-STAT1 and upregulates IL12 production (de Groen et al., 2015) . Many transcription factors come into play for IL12 production such as IRF1, ICSBP, C/EBP and NFAT5 (Ma et al., 2015) . IL12p40 promoter has Nucleosome1 whose histone modification is important in order to produce IL12. Rel family proteins can bind at Nucleosome 1 and lead to production of IL12, among which, NFAT5 is also a transcription factor from the same family (Albrecht et al., 2004 ) (L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2001 . It can not only upregulate IL12 but also induce iNOS and NLRP3 inflammasome production (Buxad\u00e9 et al., 2012) (Cornut et al., 2020) NFAT5 is activated by Brx mediated p38 pathway that often functions when the osmolarity of the cell increases, a phenomena which happens during inflammation and also in case of Leishmaniasis (Kino et al., 2009) (Bogdan, 2020) . NFAT5 can not only promote parasite killing but it can bind at Sp1 binding site at IL10 promoter and inhibit its transcription (Choi et al., 2016) .",

TLR sensitive genes are activated by NFAT5. It does so by increasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL6 and TNF\u03b1 by recruiting NF\u03baB and c-fos to their promoter regions. NFAT5 promotes demethylation of H3K27me3 marks from promoter region of pro-inflammatory genes and facilitates recruitment of other transcription factors such as NF\u03baB and enhancers to accentuate their transcription. Sp1 is known to play a central role in IL10 expression (Brightbill et al., 2000; Lunazzi et al., 2021) . Its binding at IL10 promoter occurs when H3 phosphorylation on Ser10 at Nucleosome2 takes place (Zhang et al., 2006) . It lead us to the assumption and understanding that NFAT5 may induce chromatin remodeling at Nucleosome2 at IL10 promoter that consist of Sp1 binding site so that accessibility of Sp1 to IL10 Nucleosome2 region is hindered and IL10 transcription is hampered (Choi et al., 2016) .",

IL10 can target NFIL3 to bind 10 kb upstream of the IL12p40 transcriptional start site and inhibit its synthesis. HDAC3 is involved in IL-10-induced histone deacetylation of the IL12p40 promoter (Ma X et al., 2015) .

In murine leishmaniasis, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 are produced reciprocally in resolving or progressive infection, supporting the hypothesis that distinct T-helper subsets moderate the spectrum of this infectious disease (Heinzel et al., 1989) . Moreover, L. donovani uses specific histone lysine methyltransferases/demethylases to redirect epigenetic programming of M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3)/M(IL-10) genes for successful host establishment (Parmar et al., 2020) . Hence, epigenetics have created an arena for regulating reciprocity between different cytokines, which makes cytokine reciprocity an enticing domain to study the remodeling of the immune response.",

            "text": "The results suggest that as the levels of IL12 decreases and IL10 increases the phenotype of the macrophage changes and that hampers the NO secretion which correspondingly inhibits parasite clearance and infectivity. Through our mathematical models we observed that when IL12 levels are high during the initial response, IL10 levels were low which promoted iNOS secretion and parasite clearance but as the time progressed the parasite promotes changes in the macrophages which hampers IL12 secretion and promotes IL10 secretion. As the secretion of IL10 increases, the levels of IL12, NFAT5 and iNOS decreases suggesting that parasite survival machinery has been activated (Figures 1-3) . As, epigenetic regulation of host chromatin structure is influenced by the parasite (Afrin et al., 2019) , our data shows that NFAT5 can be a key regulator of epigenetic modification of cytokines and may play a role in parasite elimination. NFAT5 presumably promotes inhibition of IL10 secretion by inhibiting H3Ser10 phosphorylation that recruits Sp1 on Nucelosome2 at the promoter region and at the same time it promotes demethylation of H3K27me3 marks from promoter region of IL12 at Nucleosome1 and recruits other transcription factors on IL12 promoter axis. These epigenetic modifications can be one of the most important changes responsible for changes in the immune response during Leishmaniasis (Krayem and Lipoldov\u00e1, 2021) . Over the course of time parasite that have skipped the clearance tends to hamper the ability of important transcription factors such as NFAT5, 2STAT-1 to participate in IL12 secretion by regulating them. Leishmania parasite is known to activate SHP-1 to dephosphorylate NFAT5 and prevent IL12 secretion. Moreover, parasite for its own survival modulates the host epigenetics by promoting ERK mediated H3 phosphorylation that makes Sp1 binding site again accessible to Sp1 for binding at IL10 promoter region (Yang et al., 2007) (Zheng et al., 2020) . Since NFAT5 can now not bind at IL10 promoter by getting dephosphorylated by SHP-1, Sp1 can now access the modified H3 and carry out IL10 transcription (Figure 8 ). IL10 signaling promotes upregulation of IL12 inhibitors such as HDAC3 and NFIL3 which can now epigenetically and transcriptionally inactivate IL12 synthesis (Figures 9, 10) . Through PCA we tried to figure out key components which help in deciding the phenotype of the infected cell. The components of TLR2 and TLR6 mediated MyD88-NF\u03baB pathway plays an important role in the phenotype decision making as they are known for promoting cytokine signaling (de Veer et al., 2003) . Here, we also observed that IL12 and IL10 are principal components and they are of opposing nature hence, their synthesis and secretion levels will directly affect the parasite survival (Kane and Mosser, 2001) (Park et al., 2002) . Jak2 is a tyrosine kinase which is recruited to IL12R\u03b22, IFN\u03b3R2 to help in IL12 and IFN\u03b3 signaling (Bacon et al., 1995) . iNOS is also a principal component as it is directly participating in parasite clearance by converting free N2 from metabolic pathways to NO (Olekhnovitch and Bousso, 2015) . Another enticing aspect which came into the spotlight was transcription factors 2STAT-1 and NFAT5. Dimer form of phosphorylated STAT1 is well known in the literature for its ability to promote transcription of IFN\u03b3 (Bhardwaj et al., 2010) . It is also known to activate Th1 response against parasites (Kima and Soong, 2013) . NFAT5 is a member of the NFAT family of transcription factors which includes NFAT1, NFAT2, NFAT3 and NFAT4. These transcription factors are involved in osmoregulation of cells (Cen et al., 2020) . It has been reported that NFAT5 binds to IL12p40 promoter region and accentuates IL12p40 synthesis in response to parasites (Buxad\u00e9 et al., 2012; Tellechea et al., 2018) . Since NFAT5 is also known to bind to the IL10 promoter region where Sp1 binding site is present and hampers IL10 synthesis Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 784664 8 (Choi et al., 2016) , its dual functionality can not only help in increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine response but may also inhibit IL10 secretion so that parasite clearance can take place.",

IL12 helps in IFN\u03b3 synthesis and its secretion is important to maintain healthy phenotype of the cells (Park et al., 2002) , suggestive of the fact that for the parasite clearance IL12 is important. 2STAT-1 promotes synthesis of IFN\u03b3 as well as iNOS hence, STAT-1 is also promoting IL12 synthesis and promoting parasite clearance through iNOS upregulation (Bhardwaj et al., 2010) (Isnard et al., 2012) (Jayakumar et al., 2008) . NFAT5 is not only promoting IL12 synthesis but also inhibiting IL10 (Choi et al., 2016) . It also upregulates other processes which promote parasite clearance that is NLRP3 inflammasome production and iNOS secretion (Buxad\u00e9 et al., 2012) (Cornut et al., 2020) . Hence, NFAT5 has roles in promoting and inhibiting different processes which promote parasite survival. SHP-1 is a protein phosphatase which dephosphorylates NFAT5 (Yang et al., 2007) and therefore regulates NFAT5 activity in response to Leishmaniasis. Through our computational analysis we could infer that NFAT5 may promote epigenetic remodeling in IL12 and IL10 promoter axis where it upregulates IL12 production and decreases IL10 secretion. Simultaneously, over the course of time as the parasite struggles for its survival, it upregulates SHP-1 in a manner that NFAT5 is dephosphorylated and inactivated for loss of its epigenetic modification regulating abilities, thereby changing the cytokines level altogether and apparently parasite survives to infect the other cells. Thus, NFAT5 can be taken as a point of intervention to altogether investigate the parasite clearance regime.",
