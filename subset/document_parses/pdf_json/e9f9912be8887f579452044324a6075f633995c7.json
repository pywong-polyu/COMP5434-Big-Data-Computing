In particular, social networking services (SNSs) can easily spread information of uncertain authenticity and factuality. Although many studies have proposed methods that addressed how to suppress the spread of misinformation on SNSs, few works have examined the impact on society of diffusing both misinformation and its corrective information. This study models the effects of effort to reduce misinformation and the diffusion of corrective information on social disruption, and it clarifies these effects. With the aim of reducing the impact on social disruption, we show that not only misinformation but also corrective information can cause social disruption, and we clarify how to control the spread of the latter to limit its impact. We analyzed the misinformation about a toilet-paper shortage and its correction as well as the social disruption this event caused in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. First, (1) we analyzed the extent to which misinformation and its corrections spread on SNS, and then (2) we created a model to estimate the impact of misinformation and its corrections on the world. Finally, (3) We used our model to analyze the change in this impact when the diffusion of the misinformation and its corrections changed. Based on our analysis results in (1), the corrective information spread much more widely than the misinformation. From the model developed in (2), the corrective information caused excessive purchasing behavior. The analysis results in (3) show that the amount of corrective information required to minimize the societal impact depends on the amount of misinformation diffusion. Most previous studies concentrated on the impact of corrective information on attitudes toward misinformation. On the other hand, the most significant contribution of this study is that it focuses on the impact of corrective information on society and clarifies the appropriate amount of it.",

This campaign, which supported amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research, offered celebrities the choice of getting soaked by a bucket of ice water or donating to the ALS Association of America. Ice Bucket Challenge videos were viewed by 440 million people, and the campaign raised $220 million from 28 million people [6] .",

In this study, we define misinformation as information that contains errors, regardless of whether those spreading it actually intend to misinform others. According to Ten Brinke et al. [10] , the definition of social disruption is a situation in which the continuity is disturbed of processes that are vital to the functioning of society. These processes refer to both physical and socio-psychological aspects. Socio-psychological aspects are disruption of daily life, loss of trust in authorities, not knowing what to do, fear, etc. In this paper, we focus on socio-psychological aspects and define social disruption as a situation that people do not know what to do due to fake news.",

The most widely spread fake news favored Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton, and the most common type of fake news favored Trump, not Clinton. These facts suggest that the election's outcome might have been different without such fake news. The so-called \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory is another example of the impact of misinformation on SNS. It refers to a shooting incident at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., on December 4, 2016. The shooter believed this conspiracy theory that was spread on SNS, and he admitted that his violent reactions were influenced by it [9] .",

[11] , when there is a strong reason to believe misinformation, the effect of corrective information on people's misperceptions is weakened, and thus more detailed corrective information is needed to more effectively counter people's misperceptions. Corrective information can in fact be counterproductive and fail to dissuade those who do believe the falsehoods. This is called the backfire effect [12] . In this phenomenon, when people encounter information they do not want to believe, they do not change their original beliefs but instead even they strengthen them. Another method detects accounts that spread misinformation and then prevents those account's owners from engaging in such dissemination. In particular, since bots account for a large percentage of the accounts that spread fake news [13] , many studies have concentrated on methods that detect malicious bots [14, 15] .",

Sohn et al.

Taking the example of corrective information, it is more convincing to assume that people will make purchases even if the corrective information spreads, rather than that the corrective information spreads as purchases increase. This is because the idea that information about the existence of a misinformation would have caused people to anticipate a shortage of toilet paper and thus accelerate their purchases seems more likely than the opposite. Therefore, we consider the latter interpretation to be more convincing and likely, and assume that the importance is the magnitude of the impact of the increase or decrease in the number of users exposed to each piece of information on the toilet paper sales. Table 6 shows the coefficients, the p-values, and the t-values obtained from the principal component regression. a 1 , a 2 , and a 3 respectively denote the regression coefficients of the first, second, and fourth principal components, and b denotes the constant term. The p-values for all coefficients are less than 0.05. Fig 4 shows the regression results and Table 7 shows the coefficient of determination and the F-value of the model. The regression is highly accurate. Table 8 shows the importance of each variable. The estimated number of views of only the corrective information (x 1 ) is clearly the most important, followed by the estimated views of both the corrective and sold-out information (x 5 ). In other words, an increase in the number of users who saw the corrective information or the corrective and sold-out information accelerated the purchase of toilet paper, which would likely lead to a shortage.",
