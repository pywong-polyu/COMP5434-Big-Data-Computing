Methods: Single-center, quadruple-blinded RCT. Symptomatic Covid 19 outpatients (aged 18 to 60 years) with positive SARS-CoV2 nucleic acids test were randomized to active (n=150; \u2265 2x10 9 colony-forming units (CFU) of probiotic strains Lactiplantibacillus plantarum KABP022, KABP023 and KAPB033, plus strain Pediococcus acidilactici KABP021) or placebo (n=150), take orally once daily for 30 days. Oral acetaminophen was allowed and controlled as co-intervention. Primary endpoint included: i) proportion of patients in complete remission (both symptoms and nucleic acids test) or progressing to moderate or severe disease with hospitalization; ii) death rate and duration on Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Safety was assessed in all patients. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04517422). Findings: 300 subjects were randomized (median age 37.0 years [range 18 to 60], 161 [53.7%] women, 126 [42.0%] having known metabolic risk factors), and 293 completed the study (97.7%). Remission was achieved by 78 of 147 (53.1%) in the active group compared to 41 of 146 (28.1%) in placebo (P<0.0001; ARR=25.0% [95%CI 14.1-35.9%]), still significant after multiplicity correction for the primary endpoint. No hospitalizations or deaths occurred during the study, precluding the assessment of efficacy on these endpoints. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Replication studies with this probiotic formula are warranted.",

Most symptomatic patients typically display mild to moderate symptoms, even despite significant viral loads, 2 and their condition can be managed on an outpatient basis. Typical symptoms include dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, body aches, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, anosmia and ageusia. 3 Several risk factors have been identified for severe Covid19, including diabetes, hypertension, older age, being male and ethnicity. 4 However, no therapies have been approved for outpatients with Covid19 disease to date.",

Intestinal bacteria can potentially achieve distal effects on lung homeostasis through training of immune cells in the gut epithelium and their subsequent migration to the pulmonary epithelium, and/or through the permeation into the bloodstream of bacterial metabolites having distal immunomodulatory effects. 5, 6 Probiotics are defined as \"live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host\", and this definition entails the requirement of well-conducted studies in humans in the specified health indication. 7 Past meta-analyses have suggested probiotics may have a role in respiratory infections such as cold and influenza, but significant heterogeneity was noted between individual trials. 8, 9 This is to be expected, since many probiotic effects are strain-specific, particularly immune effects. 7, [10] [11] [12] Besides, safety issues are often poorly reported in probiotic trials, 13 further hampering a proper assessment of harms vs. benefits.",

Compared to placebo, we show that a 30-day intervention with this probiotic resulted in increased Covid19 remission at study endpoint (requiring both symptom clearance and negative nucleic acids test). Shortening of the duration of several symptoms, changes in humoral immunity against SARS-CoV2 (spike-binding IgM and IgG antibodies) and changes in lung abnormalities (as per chest X-ray imaging) were also achieved.",

Originally, remission was not considered for the primary endpoint. However, as the study progressed, it became apparent that no hospitalizations were occurring, and thus chances of observing a sizeable number of hospitalizations at the end of the study was low. Therefore, the principal investigator proposed adding remission (defined as negative RT-qPCR plus symptomatic remission) to primary outcomes to the Research Ethics Committee, while keeping other predefined categories to minimize changes. The principal investigator also proposed including the duration of specific Covid19 symptoms, namely fever (>37.5C), cough, headache, shortness of breath and body aches) as prespecified secondary endpoints, since these symptoms were already being recorded in the patient's diary and were used by doctors to track the overall symptomatic evolution of patients.

In fact, recent RCT in similar Covid19 outpatients, without the age and SpO 2 limits used in our study, found an incidence of hospitalization or emergency department visit of just 6% in the placebo group. 18, 19 Nevertheless, the significance achieved in remission (p < 0.0001) was well below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold for multiplicity of co-primary endpoints and was also robust to multivariate adjustment for baseline confounders. Moreover, post-hoc analyses showed the effect was consistent across study subpopulations based on age, sex, metabolic comorbidities, viral load at baseline and days from symptom initiation (all with p < 0.05).

Within two weeks of symptom onset, virus-specific antibodies against SARS-CoV2 start to increase, followed by decay of IgM and IgA while IgG can remain high for weeks and months. 26 In our study, spike protein-specific IgM were higher than IgG at baseline but this trend was reversed already on day 15. Probiotic intake resulted in further increase in SARS-CoV2-specific IgM and especially a twofold increase in IgG compared to placebo, suggesting a crosstalk between this probiotic and adaptive humoral immunity to a respiratory pathogen. The effect on multiple objective endpoints such as virus-specific humoral immunity, lung abnormalities and viral load against placebo supports a true effect of this probiotic on the GLA. Of note, this effect could be independent of significant changes in microbiome composition and due solely to a crosstalk between the probiotic and the host immune system. Microbiota-derived molecules, such as short chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, toll-like receptor (TLR), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) ligands, can act directly on local intestinal tissue cells, but also penetrate into circulation to tune immune cells in peripheral tissues. 5 Besides, some bacterial surface proteins are directly recognized by different types of antigen-presenting cells, 11, 12 which could result in systemic effects via migration of primed T-cells. In this regard, the genomes of L. plantarum strains KABP022, 023 and especially KABP033 code for one such protein (Supplementary Table S5 ). In Covid19, additional mechanism in GLA cross-talk could involve direct modulation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 expression in the gut: Intestinal ACE2 is known to be affected by SARS-CoV2 infection, lack of ACE2 is known to reduce tryptophan absorption via the neutral amino acid transporter B 0 AT1, 27 and tryptophan-derived metabolites play important roles in gut homeostasis and systemic immunity. 28 Future studies should aim at unravelling the precise mechanisms underlying the effect of the strains used in this study on adaptive immunity and the GLA.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations worth mentioning. First, no patients older than 60 years old were included in the study. However, the consistency of the effect across age subpopulations when splitting the study sample at the 50 years-old cutoff suggests the effects of this probiotic are not limited to young adults, but additional studies in older populations are warranted. Second, all subjects in the study were of Hispanic ethnicity, which has been associated to higher mortality in Covid19. 32 In our study, reduction of viral load in placebo group was slower than reported in similar studies where Hispanic subjects accounted for 50% or less of the study population. 18, 19 Accordingly, our study population could be regarded as more challenging, but replication studies should be performed in more diverse populations. Third, the 16S stool microbiome analysis is still ongoing at the time of writing. Microbiome analysis could provide clues about the mechanism of action of the probiotic formula used in this trial and/or reveal if baseline enterotype influences the effectiveness of the probiotic. However, microbiome changes are not required for a probiotic to be effective since activity could be due to crosstalk between the probiotic strains per se and the host's immune system. Results of microbiome analysis and digestive symptoms will be jointly reported in future publications. Fourth, the SARS-CoV2 strains affecting patients in this study were not determined.",
