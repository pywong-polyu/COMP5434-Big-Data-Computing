The article examines the significance of community cultural capital and the need for informal STEM institutions to engage more deliberately with the knowledge and lived experiences that youth bring to programs they participate in. In my response, I question whether the informal science institution of study had changed in response to these young people. As a 'science insider,' I explore how research experiences in informal science education institutions such as museums are tightly bounded by and connected with ancient European scientific practices that limit a deep embrace of community cultural wealth. If the aim is for youth to develop their science identities, then these informal science education institutions need to question what kind of science people they are asking youth to become. I consider how informal science education institutions might remake themselves as cultural refugia, where interrogation of the dominant Eurocentric norms of what science is can be challenged and transformed.",

And then the spring unfolded. First, I found myself cloistered and physically distant from friends, family, and colleagues, hiding from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Then, suddenly, I was walking cheek to jowl with thousands of people as my city, like so many, erupted in protests over ongoing police violence against Black people in the USA. When I was able to return to this reflective piece, I found myself thinking about connections between the challenge that Habig, Gupta, and Adams raise-the need for informal science educators and institutions to embrace and nurture the rich community wealth that youth carry-and the twin pandemics consuming my thinking and being. At the heart of addressing all of these challenges is a need for us to engage in radically reimagining our society, to walk through the 'portal' into a new, more just world (Roy 2020) .",

The authors focus on three participants of a multi-year informal science program based at the American Museum of Natural History. Through multiple interviews over several years, Habig, Gupta, and Adams explore how these individuals navigated their experiences in the program and then in their college years and early careers. They specifically examine the ways that the participants drew on their community cultural wealth in order to become science people. Factors that supported this process for the youth included both experiential program elements (e.g., experiences that expanded the realm of possibilities for youth; a continuum of STEM experiences that they were able to draw on) and interpersonal factors (e.g., building sustained networks in the STEM community; drawing on their cultural wealth to exhibit resilience in the face of obstacles to success).

The complexity for informal science educators and institutions that claim to be working toward an equitable scientific community is how to expand participation without forcing assimilation to dominant norms. This surfaces an inherent tension in the goals for equity and justice in science education-ideally, science education programs facilitate youth entrance into existing and tightly bounded scientific disciplines at the same time they help youth push at the edges and expand those boundaries. This means that on the one hand, informal science programs must be designed to expose youth to the language, culture, and practice of science in order to prepare them for success in the field, while on the other hand, they must equip youth to challenge those very institutional structures.",

When I began my career as a public-school math and science teacher nearly 25 years ago, I was primarily focused on finding ways for my students to enter science fields. It was not until more than a decade later, when I was an informal science educator using urban parks as classrooms, that I slowly began to recognize the flaws inherent in this approach. Working in this out-of-school space, I found that I got to know the youth in a different way than I ever did as a classroom teacher. Their personal interests, home lives, and communities were all regular topics of conversation that entered our discussions as we flipped rocks looking for salamanders or carried logs for erosion control and trail building. These experiences forced me to begin to dismantle many of my own views about what does and does not count as science. My evolving thinking is mapped as questions on sticky notes over my desk, marginal notes in my readings, and in discussions with colleagues that bend and frustrate. The dismantling of what science is is an ongoing process for me.",

This developed into weekly Zoom conversations (the go-to pandemic gathering space) that began on April 1, 2020 and continue to this day. We developed our own curriculum for these conversations-questions, readings, music, laughter, and the practice of walking and reflecting. We named our experiment #WalkingAloneandTogether and it has heavily influenced many of the ideas included in my comments here. My co-conspirators-Michelle King and Shimira Williams-are essential elements of my own community cultural wealth. Michelle King taught middle school history for 22 years and now, as a learning instigator and love activist, works in partnership with regional organizations to create equitable and empathetic learning opportunities for children and adults.

Central to their paper is the notion of science identity and pushing against deficit approaches in support of youth in their science identity development.

Recognition by other members of the scientific community is essential to this process and the use of scientific practices and norms is key to this recognition (Bricker and Bell 2014) . In their work, examining how women of color navigated entry into science, Heidi Carlone and Angela Johnson note that, \"Broadening students' participation in science requires close attention to the kinds of people we ask students to become as they participate in science activities\" (Carlone and Johnson 2007, p. 3) .

Each of the three participants recalled the impact of joining museum research teams and later engaging in research at the collegiate level. For example, Cody, one of the participants, described working on a botany project where he was able to develop his own research question, collect and analyze data, and share those results through a Young Naturalists competition. He links this experience with other research opportunities at the museum and ultimately at college. These science acts included developing testable questions and collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data-all practices that are codified in current school-based science education standards (Hoeg and Bencze 2017) . In this way, schooling practices, which often sharply define who gets characterized as a science person (Allen and Eisenhart 2017), may be reproduced in informal and out-of-school educational spaces where academic standards have increasingly been taken up in youth work (Halpern 2006) . The so-called authentic scientific research, like what the participants engaged in, is typically dominated by a Eurocentric approach to science that uses systemized methods to count and measure phenomena to help make sense of the world (Hoeg and Bencze 2017) . While research experiences like these have the potential to serve as entry points into the scientific community, they can also act as gatekeeping devices if and when they are defined solely by activities that are dominated by Eurocentric norms.",

For youth to enter this hallowed space, to join us as science people, requires that they adopt dominant norms.

I could then assess their observations and understanding of the world by examining how they conceptualize elements of the world as either living or nonliving. But the binary of living and nonliving, while ubiquitous in science education, is a cultural construct (Bang, Warren, Rosebery, and Medin 2013) . A binary and discrete classification system, such as living/nonliving, is foundational to Eurocentric conceptions of observation and understanding. This reaches back to Aristotle's Historia Animalium and Pliny's Natural History. It continues to be the standard in contemporary scientific institutions such as the American Museum of Natural History, the setting for Habig, Gupta and Adams' inquiry. Why does this history matter? I raise these historical connections because my own exploration of the European history of classification as a scientific practice has helped me to recognize that this approach-the approach I was trained in while getting my Master of Science in Botany-reflects my cultural understanding of the world, rather than a fixed set of scientific practices that must be adhered to.",

Perhaps, instead, we might observe soil as something else altogether, as a loving being with which we have a reciprocal relationship (Kimmerer 2013) .

In practice, the naming of plants and animals using tools such as Linnean classification does help make sense of the connections between and among many aspects of the world. I have shelves of field guides to all manner of flora and fauna using this approach and I gratefully turn to them often. What I am suggesting is that science educators and institutions need to recognize that practices like this are limited and limiting if presented to youth as the idealized way to be a science person. We might think we are disrupting deficit narratives by enfolding a youth's community cultural wealth into their educational experiences-and still demand that the ultimate adoption of a science identity means entering institutional, unyielding, Eurocentric scientific spaces. This is one of the pitfalls of the 'good intentions' that Habig, Gupta, and Adams discuss. Instead, science educators and institutions need to push at the edges of these bounded spaces so that their very shape begins to change.",

This is an idea that numerous Indigenous scholars, including Megan Bang, Oscar Kawagley, and Robin Wall Kimmerer, have been theorizing about and practicing. Informal science programs, which are often more flexibly structured to respond to youth interest than traditional school settings, have been shown to push at these edges and create space for youth to negotiate with and transform scientific practices (Barton and Tan 2010) . But this may be easier in an afterschool or community-based setting than in a large cultural institution, such as a natural history museum, where what counts as a so-called authentic research experience is tightly bounded and defined by the history of Eurocentric science practice. Because these institutions present themselves as and are perceived by the public to be authorities on science, it is imperative that they expand their internal definitions of and presentation about science in their programs (Dawson 2014a) .",

It means looking for where they contrast and where they are intertwined. This kind of work means embracing the 'and' (King and Williams, personal communications, April 1-September 10, 2020). What if informal science education spaces, from environmental education programs to natural history museums, designed themselves to be deliberately cultivated cultural refugia? The idea of refugia is adopted from climate science where it signifies a protected area where species are able to survive unfavorable conditions, such as glaciation, and then eventually repopulate the larger landscape (Bennett and Provan 2008) . How do we create the conditions within informal science education institutions so that they might serve as these refugia-as protected spaces designed for the interrogation and negotiation of science in ways that ultimately circulate out into the larger scientific community? This draws on notions of sanctuary in youth programs, not just for psychological safety, but as critical spaces to support youth identity development (Akiva, Carey, Cross, Delale-O'Connor, and Brown 2017) . In this way, science educators and institutions might support young people to not just become successful members within the existing scientific community, but to change the very nature of the field. This is the portal that science and science education must walk through: an examination and transformation of science itself.",
