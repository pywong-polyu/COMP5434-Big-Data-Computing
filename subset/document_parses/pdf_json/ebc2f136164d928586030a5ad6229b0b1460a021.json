Regular medications included methotrexate, folic acid, ramipril, thyroxine and paroxetine, as well as lansoprazole on an 'as required' basis, although the patient did not take any in the last month. The physical examination was unremarkable. Blood tests revealed acute kidney injury (AKI) with an increased serum creatinine at 245 \u03bcmol/L (baseline is 85 \u03bcmol/L). The only other abnormality noted was peripheral eosinophilia. Urine dipstick did not show proteinuria or haematuria. Renal ultrasound and immunology screen were both normal. The patient was started on intravenous fluids, with ramipril and methotrexate being discontinued. Renal biopsy showed a florid interstitial infiltrate with eosinophils, with no glomerular abnormalities and no chronic interstitial damage. The patient was commenced on steroids (prednisolone 60 mg daily). Serum creatinine improved to 90 \u03bcmol/L and peripheral eosinophilia resolved. She continued to take paroxetine and thyroxine on discharge, though ramipril, lansoprazole and methotrexate were not restarted. One month following this admission, the patient re-presented with serum creatinine at 250 \u03bcmol/L and a reoccurrence of peripheral eosinophilia. On this occasion, paroxetine was stopped, and the patient was recommenced on oral steroids (prednisolone 60 mg daily). A month later, and whilst on prednisolone 20 mg daily, the patient's serum creatinine has fallen to 130 \u03bcmol/L, and peripheral eosinophilia has once again resolved.",

[1] speculated as to the underlying pathophysiology. AIN associated with other vaccines has been described previously [5, 6] . It is very difficult to prove causality in the cases described here and those reported previously. Widespread SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is continuing worldwide, and many patients presenting with AKI will therefore have a history of preceding vaccination. We also acknowledge other potential triggers of AIN in our two cases, in particular the concurrent use of proton-pump inhibitors. However, underreporting is also possible, and clinicians may regard recent vaccination as almost universal and therefore not elicit a detailed vaccination history. It is also possible that milder cases resolve spontaneously and do not undergo renal biopsy. We suggest that clinicians take note of a possible association and obtain a detailed vaccination history when confronted with cases of otherwise unexplained AIN.",
