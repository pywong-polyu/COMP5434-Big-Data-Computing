The said diseases can be quite dangerous for countries and even for the whole world as the mode of transmission and transmission rate of such diseases increase. The literature needs mathematical modeling and subsequent analysis of such diseases. In the light of this information, TB-HIV/AIDS coinfection model was analyzed. To this end, the model was firstly extended to the Caputo-Fabirizo fractional derivative obtained using the exponential function. Then, uniqueness of solution was investigated by the help of the fixed-point theorem. Thereafter, the uniqueness of solution of the model was made by assuming certain parameters, and its stability analyzes were examined. Finally, numerical solutions of the mathematical model were made and its numerical simulations were shown.",

            "text": "The new corona virus identified on 13/01/2020 and named COVID-19, which is thought to have emerged from Wuhan city of China, has an impact on the whole world. Although many countries try to take precautions, the virus, which is thought to have been transmitted from animal to human, is also passed on from person to person very simply and quickly. According to two-month studies, its mortality rate is around 3%. Although its transmission rate is quite high, the mortality is lower compared to many other epidemics. Nowadays, many scientists are making great efforts to find an antivirus. Unfortunately, there is no definitive treatment for each epidemic, particularly the HIV-TB coinfection diseasese. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that can spread form person to person. TB is caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB bacteria spread into the air and usually affect the lungs. However, the bacteria that cause TB can attack any part of the body, including the kidneys, spine, or brain. If left untreated, TB can cause death. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that leads to HIV infection. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. HIV attacks and destroys the immune system's infection-fighting CD4 cells. Loss of CD4 cells makes it difficult for the body to fight infections and some cancers. Without treatment, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system and progress to AIDS. ART is recommended for everyone with HIV. ART cannot cure HIV, but HIV drugs may help people with HIV live longer and healthier. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission. Infection with both HIV and TB is called HIV/TB coinfection. Latent TB is likely to progress to TB disease in people with HIV. TB disease may cause HIV to worsen. Treatment with HIV drugs is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART protects the immune system and prevents HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. In people with HIV/TB coinfection, ART reduces the chance of latent TB to switch to TB. TB disease is one of the leading causes of death among people with HIV worldwide. In the United States, where HIV drugs are widely used, people with HIV receive less TB compared to many other countries. However, TB affects many people with HIV in the United States, especially those who were born outside the United States.",

            "text": "The literature includes very serious and important studies in this respect. Some of those studies are as follows: Sharma et al. [1] suggest that the treatment of HIV-TB coinfection requires strong commitment and a focused approach. They also concluded that proper use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to maintain immunity and treat HIV infection requires a high level of containment and adjustment to prevent TB. In their analysis, Gao et al. [2] showed that the prevalence of HIV/TB coinfection in China deserves special attention, and more attention should be paid to TB screening among HIV/AIDS populations for treatment of both diseases. Pawlowski et al. [3] showed that, in light of the information on the interaction mechanisms of the two pathogens, there are many gaps to be filled in order to develop preventive measures against the both diseases. McShane [4] has examined HAART's effects on TB in many aspects. Furthermore, an increased risk of TB in HIV-positive patients and differences in the clinical picture in the HIV-positive population suggest that a high degree of clinical suspicion should remain. Naresh [5] analyzed a nonlinear mathematical model for transmission dynamics of HIV and a curable TB pathogen in a variable-size population. It was shown that the positive coinfection balance is always locally stable, but it may be globally stable, indicating that the disease becomes endemic due to the continuous migration of the population into the habitat under certain circumstances. Datiko et al. [6] showed that HIV infection rate in TB patients and pregnant women was higher among study participants in urban areas, and found that the HIV infection rate in TB patients is associated with the prevalence of HIV infection in pregnant women participating in attending antenatal care (ANC).",

The reproduction number of the model was calculated to examine its balance stability. Zafar et al. [10] studied a fractional order nonlinear mathematical model to analyze and control the spread of HIV/AIDS. Both disease-free equilibrium E0 and endemic equilibrium E* were found and stability results were obtained using the stability theorem of fractional order differential equations. Kheiri and Jafari [11] presented a general formulation for a fractional optimal control problem (FOCP) in which state and co-state equations are given in terms of left fraction derivatives. Then, the forward/backward sweeping method (FBSM) was developed using Adams-type predictive-correction method to solve FOCP. The numerical calculations of Mallela et al. [12] model solution showed that the results of treatment programs aimed at reducing the total load of this co-infection largely depend on both the strength and the start time of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Khan et al. [13] discussed an analysis of the HIV-TB-infected model in Atangana-Baleanu fractional differential form, maintaining the importance of the HIV model. Besides, the model was also examined for existence and uniqueness of solution, Hyers-Ulam (HU) stability and numerical simulations assuming certain parameters.",

Our generalized model also describes two different waiting time distributions, which are an ideal waiting time distribution, as observed in many biological events, such as the spread of human infections.

In addition, the generalized model allows to explain the ideal waiting time distribution for the spread of infection. The Caputo-Fabrizio operator allows us to obtain precise information about how the biological process proceeds for long-term observations. In this study, the TB-HIV/AIDS mathematical model was extended to the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative operator and analyzed. Firstly, the existence of solution to the new model was examined with the help of the fixed point theorem. Then, the conditions under which the uniqueness of solution can be realized were analyzed and the stability analysis of the model was performed. Finally, numerical solutions were obtained and shown with simulations. Finally, we believe that we have extended the HIV-TB/AIDS coinfection model to the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative, creating a more complete and more realistic model.",
