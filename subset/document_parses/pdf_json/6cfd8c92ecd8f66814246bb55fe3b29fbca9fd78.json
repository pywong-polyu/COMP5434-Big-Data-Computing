It may be the idea of future clinical research to explore new therapeutic methods and realize the individualization and precision of HCC treatment. Here, the present study reported two cases of HCC patients achieved complete response (CR) by anti-PD-1 antibody therapy after bi-specific antibody conjugated CIK immunotherapy failure.",

Moreover, the specific recognition ability of CIK cells is limited, when CIK cells are diluted in vivo, they cannot be efficiently recruited to the tumor site. In this study, antibodies targeting the cancer-associated antigen Mucin 1 (MUC-1) or Glypican 3 (GPC-3) were chemically conjugated with CD3 antibodies that recognize T cells to form bi-specific antibody conjugated CIK cell to assist T cells in killing cancer cells. 11 Two patients achieved CR with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy post-progression on bi-specific antibody conjugated CIK immunotherapy, indicating this therapeutic regime could get good and long-lasting clinical responses. The exact mechanism of the antitumor response to this treatment regimen is still unknown, we hypothesize the following several underlying factors may play important roles. Firstly, CIK therapy not only increases the number of T lymphocytes in tumor microenvironment but also provides cytokines for existing tumor-infiltrating T cells, enhances the anti-tumor function of T cells, which is conducive to anti-tumor response. 12 Secondly, CIK cells may have synergistic effect with anti-PD-1 antibodies. It has reported reducing the expression of PD-1 in HCC cells could improve the sensitivity of CIK to HCC cells in nude mice and increase its anti-tumor activity. 13 After co-culture of CIK cells with gastrointestinal tumor cells, the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells or CIK cells were both up-regulated; blocking PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could not only block the immunosuppressive pathway, but also increase the expression of NKG2D, so improving the antitumor activity of CIK cells. 14 Thirdly, CIK therapy may increase the number of some important anti-tumor immune cells in the body, improving the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy and reversing its resistance.",

CD8 + T cells are the direct effector cells to kill tumors, which can release granzyme and activate the Fas/FasL pathway to promote tumor cell apoptosis through the recognition of T lymphocyte antigen receptor and tumor antigen. In terms of killing cancer cells, the function of CD8 + T cells is more important than that of CD4 + T cells. 15 One study focused on CIK combined with PD-1 for treatment of NSCLC have shown the combination therapy could increase CD3 + CD16 + CD56 + T cells, which play central roles in innate anti-tumor immune regulation, thus to reverse the drug resistance of anti-PD-1 treatment and enhance the clinical response of tumor patients. 11 After CIK treatment, the proportion of CD8 + T cells increased. On this basis, PD-1 antibody was used to block the inhibition signal of T cells, which may be one of the reasons for CIK sequential PD-1 treatment to achieve better curative effect.",

Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HCC cohort suggested that intratumoral CD8 + T cell infiltration was associated with better prognosis. 16 Macek Jilkova et al found that a lower baseline intratumoral CD4 + /CD8 + T cell ratio was associated with better survival and prognosis of HCC patients. 17 Higher baseline intratumoral PD-1 CD8 T cells were associated with better efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Further, Kamphorst et al found among non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received first and second courses of treatment PD-1 inhibitors, Ki67 + PD-1 + CD8 T cells increased in approximately 70% patients, PD-1 + CD8 T cell response was delayed or disappeared in 70% disease progression patients, and PD-1 + CD8 T cell response occurred in 80% clinical benefit patients within 4 weeks of treatment. 18 In summary, it could speculate that in HCC patients, CIK therapy may increase the proportion of certain immune cells, such as CD8 + T cells, thus enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. Due to the small number of cases, the exact mechanism of these aspects needs to be further studied.",
