A key modifiable risk factor for NCDS is high sodium intake (4). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a daily sodium consumption of less than 2 grams (or <5 g salt/d). If adhered to, this recommendation would prevent an estimated 2.5 million deaths from NCDs worldwide (3) . Dietary sodium comes from 3 distinct sources: packaged foods, food prepared outside the home (eg, restaurants), and additional discretionary sources (adding salt to foods prepared at home during cooking or eating) (4). However, sources of dietary sodium intake differ among populations. An understanding of cultural variation in diet and dietary practices that affect sodium intake has important implications for public health practice (4).",

This practice of using both salt and bouillon seasoning in meal preparation (8) has also been observed in metropolitan Atlanta among a sample of Nigerian women, the primary food-preparers for their households (9) . This indicates that this salt intake practice persists among Nigerians in the US. Considering that the bouillon seasonings used during food preparation already contain salt, hydrogenated oil, disodium inosinate, monosodium glutamate, and other additives (8), we believe that their combination with salt in meals likely increases sodium consumption above WHOrecommended levels (3). Moreover, monosodium glutamate has been implicated in increased risk of high blood pressure (10, 11) . Therefore, Nigerians in the US are at risk of high blood pressure because they maintain their traditional meal preparation practices (6) by combining salt with bouillon, which they can access in African stores that sell these seasonings (8) .",

The consumer awareness and education strategy focuses on individual knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding salt intake.

The domains are described in detail elsewhere (8) . When designing a culture-sensitive intervention at the community level to reduce salt intake, the PEN-3 model can be applied to address the combined use of salt and bouillon and explore alternative seasonings that contain no monosodium glutamate and very little salt and are therefore healthier. This process can be completed in 2 phases: the assessment phase (relationships and expectations domain, cultural empowerment domain) and the intervention phase (cultural identity domain to identify the point of entry of the intervention) (17) . The PEN-3 model has been used in health promotion and education programs to assess nutrition-related attitudes and identify channels for nutrition education among African Americans (18) , to explore barriers and facilitators to a healthy diet for parents of young children (19) , and to explore perceptions of dietary behavior and habits among US transnational African migrants and Congolese immigrants living in the US (20, 21) .",

For example, clinicians can ask about their diets (6), explaining that high sodium intake predisposes them to high blood pressure or makes blood pressure control more difficult for those with hypertension. Engaging both food markets and clinicians can make Nigerian women aware of the relationship between sodium intake and health and allow them to maintain their cultural preferences for taste and flavor while reducing the risk of chronic disease.",
