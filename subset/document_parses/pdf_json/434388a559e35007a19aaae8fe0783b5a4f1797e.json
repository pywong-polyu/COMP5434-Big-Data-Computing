Based on the statistics reported by John Hopkins University, 4.7M people worldwide and 84,054 people in China have been confirmed positive and infected with COVID-19, as of 18 May 2020. Motivated by the previous studies which show that the exposures to air pollutants may increase the risk of influenza infection, our study examines if such exposures will also affect Covid-19 infection. To the best of our understanding, we are the first group in the world to rigorously explore the effects of outdoor air pollutant concentrations, meteorological conditions and their interactions, and lockdown interventions, on Covid-19 infection in China. Since the number of confirmed cases is likely to be under-reported due to the lack of testing capacity, the change in confirmed case definition, and the undiscovered and unreported asymptotic cases, we use the rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases instead as our dependent variable. Even if the number of reported infections is under-reported, the rate of change will still accurately reflect the relative change in infection, provided that the trend of under-reporting remains the same. In addition, the rate of change in daily infection cases can be distorted by the government imposed public health interventions, including the lockdown policy, inter-city and .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

These two regression models, when combined with different time-lags (to reflect the COVID-19 incubation period and delay due to official confirmation) in air pollutant exposure (PM2.5), are used to fit the COVID-19 infection model. Our statistical study has shown that higher PM2.5 concentration is significantly correlated with a higher rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases in Wuhan, China (p < 0.05). We also determine that a higher dew point interacting with a higher PM2.5 concentration is correlated with a higher rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases, while a higher UV index and a higher PM2.5 concentration are correlated with a lower rate of change.

Second, the daily PM2.5 Pollutant Concentration are averaged over t days prior to the COVID-19 Infection.

In order to account for the interaction between the air pollutant concentration (PM2.5) and the meteorology, for each weather condition variable, an interaction term is included in the statistical modelling.Lockdown Policy: It is represented as a binary variable to indicate whether the city lockdown measure is imposed on a particular day or not.Inter-city andIntra-city Mobility: The effect of lockdown in Wuhan can be measured by three mobility indexes, representing the number of people moving into the city, moving out of the city, and moving within the city. The details of how the three indexes are defined are not publicly Baidu, Inc. Therefore, for data consistency, these indexes are normalized in the scale of 0 to 1. Moreover, to capture the relative change in mobility during the Chinese New Year (25 January 2020), for each index, we deduct the index recorded on one date in 2019 (the mobility from the index recorded on the same date in 2020, based on the number of days before and after the Chinese New Year, which, traditionally, is the period of intensive movement in China). Dummy Variable: Two dummy variables are introduced to account for the change in COVID-19 testing capacity and the definition on COVID-19 confirmed infection case definition in Wuhan. The concept model is shown in Eq (2). Linear Regression models are selected for modelling the relationship between the Rate of Change in COVID-19 Infection Case and the Air Pollutant Concentration (PM2.5). In addition, following the previous research capturing the relationship between air pollutant exposure and influenza, we adopt the generalized linear regression models covering both the negative Binomial Regression and the Poisson Regression. 6-8 These regression models, combined with different time-lags in air pollutant exposure (PM2.5), are used to fit the COVID-19 data. In total, 100 regression models have been constructed (see", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "Rate of Change in the Daily Number of Confirmed Infection Cases = Intercept + Air Pollutant Concentration + Air Pollutant Concentration* Meteorology Condition + Lockdown Policy + Intercity and Intra-city Mobility + Change in Testing Capacity + Change in Infection Case Definition + Error TermEq(2)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "cumulative number of confirmed cases and the Air Pollutant Concentration (PM2.5) at the daily level in Wuhan, China, are shown in Figure 1. The level of PM2.5 was on a decreasing trend after the city had entered into a complete lockdown from 23 January 2020 onwards. The mean PM2.5 Pollutant Concentration was 63 \u00b5g/m 3 and 39 \u00b5g/m 3 , before and after the city's lockdown, respectively. In addition, the case definition change exercised on 12 February 2020 (as indicated by the vertical line in Figure 1) led to a significant discontinuity in Wuhan's epidemic curve. Linear Regression, Negative Binomial Regression, and Poisson Regression models were used to fit the confirmed cases. Different lags of PM2.5 pollutant exposure are tested.

The interaction between the PM2.5 concentration and the dew point and the interaction between PM2.5 concentration and the UV index, are both significant (p < 0.1). A higher dew point and a higher PM2.5 concentration are correlated with a higher rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases, while a higher UV index and a higher PM2.5 concentration are correlated with a lower rate of change. Furthermore, as compared to the average PM2.5 concentration over multiple days, PM2.5 concentration of a particular day has a stronger predictive power for COVID-19 Infection. The best-fit lagged time in PM2.5 concentration is eight days. Based on this model, lockdown policy, and inter-city and intra-city mobility have no significant statistical correlation with the rate of change in COVID-19 infection cases in Wuhan.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "The list of regression models that are used to fit the confirmed infection cases data", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Regression </td><td>Dependent Variable </td><td>Air Pollutant Exposure </td><td>Number of Models </td></tr><tr><td>Linear </td><td>Daily Number of Confirmed Infection Cases </td><td>Current day </td><td>2 x (1+12+12) = 50 </td></tr><tr><td>Rate of Change in the Daily Number of Confirmed </td><td>Previous 1-12 days Averaged over previous 1-\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Infection Cases </td><td>12 days </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": ". https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106484 doi: medRxiv preprint", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Significant factors on COVID-19 infection in Wuhan (from 1 January to 20 March, 2020) Dependent Variable: The Rate of Change in the Daily Number of Confirmed Infection Cases in Wuhan Regression Model: Linear Regression BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under ais the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 26, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106484 doi: medRxiv preprint Notes 1.
