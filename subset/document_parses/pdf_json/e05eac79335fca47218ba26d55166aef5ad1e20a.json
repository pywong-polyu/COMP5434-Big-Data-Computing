We here propose an automatic morphological residual convolutional neural network (M-RCNN), exploiting the residual knowledge and morphological priors between various particle types. We also employ data augmentation to prevent performance deterioration caused by the extremely imbalanced problem of class distribution. Experimental results indicate that our morphological priors are distinguishable and beneficial to largely boosting overall performance. M-RCNN demonstrates a much higher accuracy (0.940) than the deep residual network (0.845) and support vector machine (0.821). This work provides an effective solution for automatically identifying wear particles and can be a powerful tool to further analyze the failure mechanisms of artificial joints. , from 2005. Her research areas cover nanotribology, nanostructure, nanotechnology of surface and interface, chemicalmechanical planarization, and water-based lubrication.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020 has made people care more about health problems. Indeed, not only these epidemic diseases but also chronic diseases should be brought to the forefront. Osteoarthritis (OA), mainly caused by the degeneration of joints, is one of the chronic diseases that has affected the individual quality of life both physically and socially. To treat severe cases, artificial joints, e.g., artificial hip joint [1] , artificial knee joint [2] , and artificial disc [3] , are needed to replicate the functionality of a normal and healthy joint [4] . Generally, the lifespan of artificial joints is designed to be 20-40 years [5, 6] . However, after long-term service in the human body, the articular surfaces will be worn and thus generate wear particles. It has been reported that the wear particles of artificial joint prosthesis may induce host response in the human body and cause a so-called \"particle disease\" [7] . Clinically, wear particles in the size of micrometers or less can lower bone density through osteolysis and further lead to aseptic loosening [8] , making particle related disease one of the top leading causes for prosthesis failure after long-term implantation [9] . Therefore, it is crucial to carry out failure analysis through identifying wear particles whose shape and surface morphologies are closely related to their generation mechanisms and wear conditions. However, analysis of these wear particles is a complicated task. Since the artificial joints are usually lubricated by tissue fluids (in vivo) or simulated body fluids (in vitro), extra isolation is always needed to remove the biomacromolecules impurities and purify the wear particles before characterization [10] . With several digestion and isolation protocols, scientists have evaluated the wear particles produced by different artificial joints recently. McMullin et al. [11] analyzed 750 wear particle images from the periprosthetic failed hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasties, and based on particle morphologies and according to commonly used terminology, classified them into three groups, i.e., fibers, flakes, or granules. Liu et al. [12] compared the wear particles generated from the implanted artificial joint (in vivo) and joint simulator (in vitro). They indicated that the typical morphologies of wear particles were spherical, block, tear, sheet, rod, and strip. In our previous study [13] , we also investigated the wear particles of artificial disc and summarized their representative morphologies as flake-like wear particles, spherical wear particles, aggregated wear particles, rod-like wear particles, and zonal wear particles. Indeed, each type of wear particle contains its specific information about wear processes and wear mechanisms. For instance, flake-like particles are contributed by abrasive wear and fatigue wear, spherical particles can be attributed to adhesion wear, aggregated particles are the products of several mechanisms, and rod-like and zonal particles are dominated by peeling and fragmentation after fatigue wear [13] . Therefore, finding the correct category of the wear particle not only helps understand the morphology of the particle itself, but also gives the information about wear status and wear mechanisms of the artificial joints [14] .",

It has been proposed that up to 2 \u00d7 10 8 wear particles are produced per year by the implanted artificial joint in patients [15] . Thus, we may be still far away from appreciating the full range of wear particles for which more useful wear information can be provided. Indeed, with the development of artificial intelligence, some neural networks have been employed to establish wear particle classifiers [16] [17] [18] [19] . For instance, a multi-level belief rule base system [20] and a linear support vector machine [21] were employed to optimize the wear information and classify wear particles. Wang et al. [17] proposed a two-level classification procedure: the first-level to determine the three classes by a back-propagation network and the second-level to further identity fatigue particles and severe sliding particles by a six-layer convolutional neural network. Peng et al. [22] developed a hybrid convolution neural network that mainly consisted of transfer learning and support vector machine techniques to identify four types of wear debris. However, most of them are not designed for the wear particles of artificial joints, and their efficiency and accuracy still need to be improved.",

It is suggested that the subsphaeroidal wear debris from the artificial hip joints took up the majority of the debris but shared a smaller percentage of the total volume, indicating the type distribution was imbalanced [12] . Eckold et al. [23] suggested that the majority of the morphological occurrences of wear particles from artificial discs was fibril. Regarding the artificial knee and hip joints, it was concluded that the particle morphology can be strongly influenced by the lack of experimental precision with different quantitative approaches and the in vivo wear particle distribution was not homogeneous owing to the clumping and clearing of particles through drainage [10] . When being recognized by a neural network, such imbalanced distribution poses a challenge for predictive modeling, as most of the machine learning algorithms used for classification were designed around the assumption of an equal number of examples for each class, meaning normal models may demonstrate poor predictive performance, especially for the minority ones [24] . Therefore, a specific recognition model is required to address the imbalanced sample size issue, which affects the accuracy of particle classification using a machine learning approach.",

To further alleviate the data imbalance problem, the remaining four highly geometric similarity classesthe flake, aggregated, rod-like, and zonal wear particles-are used to synthesize more training images by the data augmentation technique.

The data augmentation does not ruin the input pixel distribution which is vital information for the network to learn but only boost the data diversity especially for the minimum class. The process of data augmentation is guided by the following three steps. In order to ensure a uniform image size of all data imported into the M-RCNN in the training and test stages, we crop and downsample each subject to a uniform 256\u00d7256 image size with three channels. Secondly, we implement the Gaussian normalization on the pixels' intensity whose range changes from [0, 255] to [-1, 1] . This step aims to normalize the pixel intensity and further reduce variation among the pixels to avoid the performance deterioration of the model stemming from the non-uniform data range. Finally, we endow the classification model with the desired invariance and robustness for class imbalance problems by performing data augmentation to synthesize more input images that better represent input distribution.",

In the case of wear particles among different classes, due to the variations of camera orientations, resolution, and noise, we primarily perform the rotation, flip, noise, affine, and blur transformations (Fig. 2) . The rotation degree is in a range of [-90\u00b0, 90\u00b0] and represents the variation of camera orientations.

For the micro-average method, it computes the metrics based on the global confusion matrix to get the true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives of the system, by assigning equal weight on each data (not each class). The macro-average calculates the metrics independently based on the local confusion matrix of each class and then takes the average, assuming that the weight or contribution of each class is equal. The closer ROC value to 1, the better a classifier is [34] . As can be seen in Fig. 4 , although data augmentation has been applied to the ResNet model, its macro-average ROC area is only 0.68, which is just 71.6% of our M-RCNN algorithm. Indeed, the M-RCNN demonstrates the best performance from the ROC point of view. In addition, as presented in Fig. 5 , the features of wear particles extracted both by ResNet and ResNet+Aug models are mixed while the M-RCNN model we developed here can clearly separate the four resting classes in a large distance, indicating an excellent performance of our morphological model on features extraction.",

Future investigations could continue to analyze the generalization ability of M-RCNN by collecting much more wear particles or testing in other similar wear particles data.

One of the biggest challenges of the task is the imbalance distribution of each group. In this paper, we proposed a morphological residual convolutional neural network (M-RCNN) incorporating the morphological priors to solve the recognition problem under inhomogeneous distribution conditions. The morphological priors are extracted by the Canny detector to highlight useful structural and shape information, and then matched by the specific shape (spherical wear particles in this study) to pick out the geometry-different class. To further alleviate the data imbalance problem, the data augmentation technique is utilized to synthesize more training samples of the high geometric similarity classes. The M-RCNN is tested using a large number of wear particles images to show its better performance as compared with several available classification models which are suffered from class imbalance problems. Therefore, M-RCNN is a promising tool for the automatic artificial joint wear particle classification no matter how the distribution is and has the potential for applications in further tribological analysis of artificial joints.",

Based on this, model weights and offsets are iteratively updated and learned until the objective function reaches a satisfactory value.Moreover, we combine the predictions of the original model and morphological model to improve the generalizability and robustness. The original model means that the inputs are four original class images of wear particles where the morphological priors are only used to pick out the spherical particles. Different from the original model, the input of the morphological model is only morphological images (as shown in morphological feature extraction inFig. 3) without original images. For orginal model and morphological model, they both first take out the spherical particles from five classes and make a classification on remaining four classes wear particles.
