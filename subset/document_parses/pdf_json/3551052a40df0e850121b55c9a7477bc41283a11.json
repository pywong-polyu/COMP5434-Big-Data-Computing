The model clearly shows the plausibility of the formation of nanotips in high electric fields by atom diffusion. The results support the hypothesis that vacuum arcs in highfield environments may be caused by such spontaneous formations of nanotips.

In the no-field case, it can be seen that the small initial top {100} facet has actually decreased in size and the {211} facets have grown.Infigure 3(d), a field of 2.5 GV/m has been applied and the top {100} facet is now more prominent than in the case without field [figure 3(b)-3(c)]. The {211} facets are larger than in the initial case [figure 3(a)], but not much different to the no-field case.Figure 3(d) seems to roughly correspond to Fujita's stages (ii) or (iii).With an applied field of 20 GV/m, shown in figure 3(e), the {211} facets start to decrease and the the {110} facets start to grow, corresponding to Fujita's stage (iv).With an applied field of 30 GV/m [figure 3(f)], the {211} facets have completely disappeared and the {110} facets dominates, as also happened in Fujita's stage (v).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "field, t = 20 ns (c) No field, t = 100 ns (d) F = 50 GV/m, t = 20 ns (e) F = 60 GV/m, t = 8.6 ns (f) F = 60 GV/m, t = 20 ns", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "Perspective views of the hemispherical tip: (a) initial, (b)-(c) the same simulations after 20 ns and 100 ns, respectively, without field; (d) with a 50 GV/m applied field after 20 ns; (e) and (f) show the same tip with a 60 GV/m applied field after 8.6 ns and 20 ns, respectively.

The end result is that the {110} islands migrate towards the {100} edge in the same time as they grow in size. The tip itself will not grow in height (at this stage), but the {110} facets will grow sideways until they fill up the corners of the tip, where initially were {211} facets, and in the same time growing the corners of the top {100} facet. This is in contrast to the case with no field [figures 3(b)-3(c)], where the {211} and {110} facets grows and connects with the substrate, where new layers slowly form, making the tip wider. The top {100} facet, on the other hand, almost completely disappear.An slightly more pronounced {100} facet is also formed with an applied field of 60 GV/m after 8.6 ns, as shown in figures 3(h) and 4(e). This is in good agreement with the large {100} top facet Fujita and Shimoyama observed in their stage (vi), even though we have used higher fields than they reported. The obtained shape of the tip with the large {100} facet is clearly different than the tip shape obtained in the case with no field, figures 3(b)-3(c), indicating that the obtained evolution is truly an effect of the applied electric field.Continuing the simulation with the applied field of 60 GV/m until 20 ns, new higher structures are starting to build up on top of the {100} facet, as shown in figures 3(i) and 4(f).
