            "text": "U.S. political polarization is at a high point since the Civil War, and is a significant barrier to coordinated national action addressing climate change. To examine where common ground may exist, here we comprehensively review and characterize successes and failures of recent state-level decarbonization legislation, focusing especially on bipartisanship. We analyze 418 major state-government-enacted bills and 450 failed bills from 2015 to 2020, as well as the political contexts in which they were passed or defeated. We use bivariate analyses and regressions to explore correlations and partial correlations between the policy characteristics and political contexts of bills, and their passage or failure, their bipartisanship, and vote shares they received. Key results include (i) nearly one-third of these statelevel decarbonization bills were passed by Republican-controlled governments. (ii) Bipartisan or Republican co-sponsors disproportionately passed financial incentives for renewable energy, and legislation that expands consumer or business choices in context of decarbonization goals; Democrat-only co-sponsors disproportionately passed bills that restricted consumer and business choice, such as mandatory Renewable Energy and Efficiency Portfolio Standards (REEPS) and emissions standards. (iii) Bipartisan bills were disproportionately proposed in \"divided\" states, did not restrict consumer and business choice, had environmental justice components framed economically, and lacked environmental justice components framed either using academic social-justice jargon or non-neutrally with respect to immutable characteristics such as race. (iv) Bills that expand consumer or business choice were disproportionately enacted. Though climate change is a polarized issue, our results provide tangible insights for future bipartisan successes.",

            "text": "U.S. partisan elites started to polarize on environmental issues as early as the 1970s, but climate change was a low-polarization issue among the U.S. public until the 1990s, with equal fractions of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents reporting being \"worried\" about it in 1989 (see Egan and Mullin's 2017; Fig. 2A) . Public polarization of climate change then steadily increased from 1990 to 2015, but has slightly decreased since 2015 (Egan and Mullin 2017) . A majority of Republicans voters now support regulating CO 2 as a pollutant in every state except Wyoming (Mildenberger et al. 2017 ) and post-2016 polls have found over two-thirds popular support for several specific climate-mitigation policies (Burgess and Marshall 2020) . Elite polarization may also be somewhat abating, perhaps in response to popular opinion or perhaps responding to the increasing immediacy and salience of climate-related impacts. For instance, Republicans in the House of Representatives formed the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021, and the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucuses formed in both the House (2016) and Senate (2019; Citizens' Climate Lobby 2021). However, lobbying by fossil-fuel industries and other monied interests remains as an elite-level barrier to climate legislation (e.g., Oreskes and Conway 2011; Meng and Rode 2019; Stokes 2020) . Moreover, in contrast to climate change polarization, U.S. public polarization on \"culture war\" issues has sharply increased since 2015, as evidenced, for instance, by sharply diverging opinion trends on racial and gender issues, and on whether universities are beneficial to the country (Pew Research, 2018 , 2019a , b, 2021 , as well as the election and presidency of Donald Trump.",

The political heterogeneity of states allows us to observe legislative patterns across varying political contexts, and state-level actions can seed or inspire federal actions, as we discuss in Section 1.1 below. We focus on 2015-2020 legislation, starting in 2015 for reasons discussed above. We analyze 868 major state bills that have a potential effect of decarbonization (418 enacted, 450 failed), and examine which bill characteristics and political contexts correlate with bill success (i.e., whether it was enacted), and support and bipartisanship as measured by the percentage of \"yes\" votes in a state's lower House or assembly among enacted bills and bill party co-sponsorship.",

Distrust of scientists by conservatives also contributes to polarization, and is directly related to elite cues (McCright et al. 2013) , which can be especially influential in climate change polarization because understanding it requires scientific literacy (Egan and Mullin 2017) . Conservatives' distrust of scientists has been fueled in part by the ideological tension (McCright et al. 2013) ; in part by misinformation and special-interest-driven efforts to undermine scientific credibility (Mooney 2007) ; and likely also in part by the fact that climate scientists are overwhelmingly politically liberal (e.g., see Helmuth et al. 2016; Boykoff and Oonk 2018) and sometimes activist or partisan (Boykoff and Oonk 2018; Cologna et al. 2021 )-part of a larger pattern in academia (e.g., see Duarte et al. 2015; Cofnas et al. 2018) .

Partisanship has a strong affective dimension (i.e., partisans tribally dislike each other) (Iyengar et al. 2019) , and has become a dominant axis of Americans' personal identities (Mason 2016). For instance, only 6% of marriages in the U.S. occur between members of opposite political parties (Fisk and Fraga 2020) , and there is widespread opposition to cross-party marriage (Iyengar et al. 2012) ; experiments and surveys have found members of both parties widely willing to discriminate against each other in school and the workplace (Inbar and Lammers 2012; Iyengar and Westwood 2014) ; and-alarmingly-a 2019 study (Kalmoe and Mason 2019) found 20% of Democrats and 15% of Republicans respond affirmatively to the question: \"Do you ever think: we'd be better off as a country if large numbers of [Opposing party] in the public today just died?\". This affective polarization directly influences political support for climate policy and strengthens the influence of elite cues (Ehret et al. 2018; Merkley and Stecula 2020) . For instance, Ehret et al. (2018) found that their participants supported a climate policy less if they believed that the other party had proposed it. Conversely, affective mass polarization may also reduce elected officials' incentives to collaborate across party lines. This may be evidenced by, for instance, the increasing partisanship of congressional voting (Paisley 2016) , and the increasing use of the filibuster in Congress by the minority party (Klein 2012) .",

State actors are key drivers of U.S. climate legislation, and can seed federal legislative proposals. For example, Colorado General Assembly legislators signed a state law in 2019 that directs the state legislative council staff to establish GHG emissions reports to help assess the net impact of proposals on emissions within a 10-year period of enactment (H.R.1188 2019). In June 2020, congressional leaders in the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis released a similar proposal, The Carbon Cost Act (H.R.8613 2020). More broadly, state-and local-level climate action expertise and lessons learned were built into President Biden's \"Build Back Better\" climate plan and Cabinet (Ricketts et al. 2021 ). Legislation has been introduced and enacted in various degrees across the fifty state legislatures with differing levels of support from Democrats and Republicans since 2015 (Advanced Energy Legislation Tracker 2021). While a majority passed in Democrat-controlled state legislatures (Fig. 1A) , there are a number of notable exceptions that passed in historically Republican-controlled states (Table S1) .",

We do not include detrimental policies in our analysis (examples include Ohio HB6-see Roberts (2019)-and West Virginia HB2001-see Eik (2015)). We also exclude minor bills whose effects might be considered semantic (e.g., a minor definition change, a small change in legislative language that does not strengthen or retrench the original bill). Thus, we focus on major bills aimed at decarbonization.",

We do not include these bills, as we cannot make precise determinations about their likelihood of success. Though some bills that have remained in the introductory stage for a long period of time could be argued as effectively \"dead,\" we include bills in the failed category only if the Advanced Energy Legislation Tracker (AEL) classifies them as such.

Enacted bills co-sponsored only by Democrats have a bimodal vote-share distribution, with a sizeable fraction passing narrowly, whereas enacted Republican-and bipartisan-co-sponsored bills nearly always passed overwhelmingly (Fig. 1B) . This suggests that Democratic lawmakers often vote for climate-mitigation policies of both parties, while Republicans have a larger voting preference for their own bills. Relatedly, we find types of bills disproportionately supported by Democrats receive lower vote shares, on average (Table S9 : Fig. S11 ). Of the 393 enacted bills from the first data set, 206 had Democrat co-sponsors, 39 had Republican co-sponsors, and 140 had bipartisan co-sponsors.

Both measures show similar patterns: e.g., lower vote shares and less bipartisanship among bills restricting choice, having social justice indicators, and passing in Democrat-controlled states. However, the fact that Republican-co-sponsored bills had higher average vote shares than bipartisan bills (Fig. 1B) illustrates that these two measures are not perfectly correlated with each other.

Although our bivariate and logit models suggest that social-justice bills may face barriers to bipartisanship, we note that relatively few environmental-justice-related bills have been enacted since 2015 (145, including social justice indicator, economic justice indicator, and general progressivism Figure 2 shows that social-justice bills receive lower vote shares and have bipartisan co-sponsors less often than the other categories.",

These results broadly support hypothesis 3, with some nuances related to patterns of support for various financial policies. Figure S11 shows that some PACE laws and solar incentives are popular with Republican legislators, while a subset of other policies with financial components-including shared renewables-garner disproportionately more support from Democrats. This suggests that some financial incentives do not necessarily align disproportionately with conservative values. For instance, Hess et al.

In such a case, it is possible that combining REEPS and emissions standards with certain framing components that we found to have broader bipartisan appeal (e.g., expanded choice) could broaden the support for REEPS policies. To explore this, Table S12 shows passage rates and mean vote shares (among passed bills) for REEPS bills and emissions standards, grouped by their framing components (expanded choice, financial component, environmental justice).

The policies evaluated by Bergquist et al. (2020) are similar to our economic justice indicators classification of environmental justice components in decarbonization legislation. Indeed, we found economic justice bills passed in a bipartisan way significantly disproportionately, compared to no justice, in our logit models. However, environmental justice policies with social justice indicators (i.e., invoking academic jargon or non-neutral with respect to immutable characteristics) were not evaluated by Bergquist et al.

RPS is arguably the policy type that has been researched the most in terms of its effectiveness (e.g., see , Greenstone and Nath (2020) , Wiser et al. (2016) , and refs. therein), though newer programs like PACE (one recent study on PACE program impacts on California's economy-Rose and Wei 2020), shared renewable projects, and an assortment of financial incentives have not been heavily studied from a state or national level relating to estimated emissions reductions. Additionally, future research on this topic could gauge whether preliminary policies such as task forces, studies, and pilot programs are developed into long-lasting policies and programs.",

We found that a number of bills pass in Republican-controlled state legislatures, certain characteristics are associated with bipartisan co-sponsorship and higher vote share totals, and some pass more than others. Bipartisan bills since 2015 take on different characteristics and are intended to serve a variety of functions, but are disproportionately present in divided states, and are likely to include expanded choice and economic justice indicators, and lack social justice indicators (though exceptions to these patterns exist). Our results show what types of bills have passed in different political and partisan contexts, which could inform efforts to scale up climate mitigation nationally.",
