Even more than getting ill themselves, GPs were concerned that they might become virus transmitters and put their patients at risk [15] . These are all good arguments in favor of the absolute necessity of reducing the number of consultations, ideally by canceling or postponing unnecessary treatments and consultations. These concerns are also reflected in the results of the present study. We found the largest decrease in consultations and referrals issued for ENT specialists, who are exposed to a higher risk of becoming transmitters of the virus due to the nature of treatments of the throat and upper airways, the areas where the highest virus load is found. Therefore, further research is needed to reveal whether or not and if yes how intensively the older population was more severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Mangiapane et al. [29] demonstrated that remote telephone and video consultation increased considerably in Germany during the lockdown. Such consultations were included in our analyses as well. It can be assumed that the reduced consultation rate in combination with a higher percentage of remote telephone or video consultation makes it more difficult for practitioners to detect new incident diseases as compared to the common and in-person face to face consultations. However, it remains to be seen whether the downturn in the detection of incident diseases will be partly compensated for by an upturn later this year or whether it will result in adverse",

In addition, special circumstances in 2019, such as the wave of influenza that was averted in 2020, may have biased the results. Finally, the database does not allow for the establishment of a patient-related connection between different specialists. Therefore, double reporting of patients' diagnoses cannot be precluded. ",

Such organizational adjustments automatically lead to reduced consultation rates and treatment capacities.However, the demonstrated decrease is not only caused by organizational adjustments according to the recommendations for practices and the perception and burden of the physician specialists.Patients themselves have likely promoted decreasing trends. The acceleration of COVID-19 cases in China in December 2019 and Italy in January 2020 was widely reported in the worldwide press. When the first studies emerged that reported that older people are at a higher risk of complications in the clinical course of COVID-19 and are more likely to die[9,31], the older population became aware and very concerned about the seriousness of the situation. Betsch et al.[32] revealed that more than 70% of the population were (very) concerned about COVID-19 at the beginning of March and hence very early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it can reasonably be assumed the sharp and unprecedented decrease was caused by patients' and physicians' concerns, in combination with the organizational adjustments of the healthcare sector.Kostev et al.[33] furthermore demonstrated that the prescription rate of cardiovascular and diabetes therapies increased significantly before the COVID-19 lockdown in Germany and that the increase was largest for the age group 18 to 40 years and smallest in patients aged 80 years or older. The tremendous decrease in April and May in our analysis is likely not generalizable to the entire population, including the younger population. However, receiving less likely continued treatments and diagnoses of incident diseases could have a significant impact on the health of older populations.",

The novel and COVID-19 related challenges required organizational changes in practice management and consultation strategies that aimed to avoid or postpone unnecessary consultations, especially with older patients that are most at risk of COVID-19, and to increase remote telephone and video consultation. As a result, physician consultations, specialist referrals, and hospital admissions decreased tremendously during the COVID-19 lockdown. In particular, the decrease in the detection of incident diseases was larger than the consultation rate, probably caused by a tremendous increase in the proportion of remote telephone and video compared to in-person consultations during the lockdown. It is of vital importance to analyze compensatory effects, like an increased consultation and disease detection rate, probably emerging subsequently after COVID-19 related lockdowns, as well as long-term effects of the altered utilization and disease detection rate in the older population.",
