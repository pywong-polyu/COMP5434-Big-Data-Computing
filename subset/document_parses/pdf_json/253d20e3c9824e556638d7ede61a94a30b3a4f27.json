We replicate these results in a second, pre-registered study (N = 1000; April 2020), and find that results are similar when considering partisanship, rather than political ideology. In both studies we also find evidence that political polarization extends beyond attitudes, with liberals consistently reporting engaging in a significantly greater number of health protective behaviors (e.g., wearing face masks) than conservatives. We discuss the possible drivers of polarization on COVID-19 attitudes and behaviors, and reiterate the need for fostering bipartisan consensus to effectively address and manage the COVID-19 pandemic.",

It's like playing with fire\u2026 Please work across party lines, across ideology, across beliefs, across any differences for that matter. We need to behave. That's how we can defeat this virus.\" (Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization, 2020, p. 6) As countries around the world are designing policies and legislation to fight and contain a global pandemic, over half a million deaths have been recorded due to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with almost a quarter of those deaths occurring in the United States alone (CSSE, 2020) . In the absence of a scalable vaccine or effective antiviral treatment, scholars have increasingly noted the important role of the social sciences in evaluating public opinion and the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing, and self-isolation. Crucially, the effectiveness of these interventions not only depends on an emerging scientific understanding of viral transmission dynamics (Zhang, Li, Zhang, Wang, & Molina, 2020) but also on the degree to which people voluntarily adopt and coordinate their behavior in the population at both local and global scales. As the Director-General of the WHO warns, increasing political polarization presents a direct threat to the effective management of the pandemic.",

The \"asymmetry\" hypothesis (Jost, 2017) suggests that as compared to liberals, there are defining motivating psychological features of the conservative ideology that make conservatives more likely to prefer a sense of order and structure, be less tolerant of uncertainty, more motivated to justify unequal economic systems, and be more likely to deny science and endorse fake news and conspiracy theories (Jost et al., 2003; Jost, van der Linden, Panagopoulos, & Hardin, 2018; Mooney, 2012; . To this extent, evidence has indeed suggested that between 1974 and 2010, trust in science has only declined among conservatives (Gauchat, 2012) . In fact, in 2010, a Nature editorial noted that, \"[t]he anti-science strain pervading the right-wing in the United States is the last thing the country needs in a time of economic challenge\" (Nature, 2010, p.1).",

As a result, other research has offered contextual explanations such as that the degree and direction of political polarization over science may depend on the issue (Rutjens et al., 2018) . One prominent example of this is the Anti-Reflexivity Hypothesis which suggests that, compared to liberals, \"conservatives will show significantly less trust in, and support for, science that identifies the environmental and public health impacts of economic production\" (McCright, Dentzman, Charters, & Dietz, 2013, p.1) . We note that this view is not inconsistent with the theory of system justification (Jost, 2020) , as policies that highlight the environmental and public health impacts of economic production typically call for social change and challenge the status quo. Accordingly, some research suggests that the aversion is therefore not inherent to science, but rather to what the science implies for public policy (Campbell & Kay, 2014) .",

In other words, we expect to find significant asymmetries on the COVID-19 pandemic response. First, from a \"bottom-up\" point of view, political ideology is often defined as the beliefs and values people hold about the way society is and how it should be (Jost, 2006) . The global pandemic has required radical changes in the way that society is structured particularly in terms of social and economic relations. Social distancing, self-isolation, travel restrictions, and the closing down of schools and shops has had significant negative impacts on the economy (CBO, 2020; Nicola et al., 2020) , directly challenging the status quo and organization of the economic system. Relatedly, governments around the world have put in place legislation that directly curtails the rights of individuals, including economic and personal freedoms. For example, in the United States, stay-at-home orders were issued in 42 states (Mervosh, Lu, & Swales, 2020) . These measures directly challenge key dimensions of conservatism, including a strong preference for the status quo over social change, prioritization of individual freedom over collective egalitarian goals, and a desire for minimal government intervention (Jost, 2020; Stenner, 2009) . Research on other issues with implications for public health, such as climate change, has found that, although science denial comes in many forms, denial is united by, \"shared opposition to governmental regulatory efforts\" (Dunlap & McCright, 2011, p. 144) . In other words, from a contextual and issuespecific point of view, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic response would elicit more support from liberals as opposed to those who hold conservative political worldviews.",

Moreover, studies find that far right-leaning media (e.g., Fox News, Breitbart) has particularly facilitated the spread of misinformation about the coronavirus as compared to the mainstream media (Motta, Stecula, & Farhart, 2020) . Despite calls for bipartisanship, the Republican and Democratic parties have also presented differing pictures of the threat posed by the virus and its potential policy solutions. Throughout February and March 2020, President Trump consistently downplayed the virus, describing it as \"mild\" and \"under control,\" while opposition leaders warned that the crisis was far worse. In fact, Bernie Sanders, an early 2020 Democratic presidential contender, described the pandemic as, \"on the scale of a major war,\" (Glueck & Ember, 2020; Leonhardt, 2020) . In April 2020, President Trump tweeted \"LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\" as part of a controversial attempt to encourage conservative protestors to roll back stay-at-home orders in three states with Democratic governors (Martelle, 2020). In turn, Democrats, including Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, heavily criticized the Trump administration for its handling of the pandemic (Edelman & Smith, 2020) .",

Preliminary research supports this view, as there is evidence that people on opposite sides of the political aisle in the US are treating the virus differently. For example, a Pew research poll conducted in late March 2020 reported that 78% of Democratic party supporters considered the virus a major threat to the health of the US population, compared to only 52% Republicans (Pew, 2020) . A recent large-scale analysis of tweets by members of the U.S. House and Senate during the COVID-19 pandemic confirms high levels of polarization in elite communication to the public, with congressional Democrats discussing the pandemic more frequently and emphasizing threats to public health more so than Republicans (Green, Edgerton, Naftel, Shoub, & Cranmer, 2020) . These findings further strengthen the hypothesis that concern and support for COVID-19 are lower among U.S. conservatives compared to liberals in the U.S.",

As has been well documented in the psychological literature, attitudes do not always translate into behavior (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977; Petty & Bri\u00f1ol, 2020 ). In the current research, we therefore investigate reported protective behaviors-such as hand washing and wearing face masks-to better understand the extent to which partisan differences can contribute to concrete public health outcomes, such as infection rates and, ultimately, deaths from the virus. We report the results of two US surveys examining the association between political orientation (both ideology and partisanship) and beliefs about COVID-19, trust in range of institutions relevant to COVID-19, and self-reported individual behavior.",

On the one hand, it is possible that fundamental psychological motivations underpinning ideology influence perceptions of COVID-19 risk. For example, Choma, Hanoch, Gummerum, and Hodson (2013) report that liberals, compared to conservatives, express greater concern over risks which pose a threat not just to the individual but to society as whole, for example, smoking, pesticides, and handguns. The authors suggest that this difference may arise from liberal's greater endorsement of moral foundations pertaining to the harm and care of others (Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2009 ). In the context of COVID-19, research has also found that egalitarian-as opposed to individualistic worldviews-are strongly associated with higher coronavirus risk perceptions .",

            "text": "On the other hand, conservatives' relative ambivalence over COVID-19 might simply arise from the political messaging of President Trump and other Republican party elites who, at the time of the surveys, consistently downplayed the threat posed by the virus in press conferences and tweets (Yamey & Gonsalves, 2020) . As shown in our analysis of trust in Governors (Study 2) individuals express greater trust in the political elites on 'their side' at the state level, in agreement with previous research examining trust in elected officials in the US (e.g., Citrin & Green, 1986; Morisi, Jost, & Singh, 2019) . Assuming that conservative attitudes are influenced to some degree by elite messages, political discourse is therefore a possible avenue by which conservative attitudes might be aligned with public health targets. As trusted sources among the right, the President and other Republican leaders are in a privileged position to influence conservatives' opinion on the virus and urge an evidence-based course of action towards limiting the spread of the virus (e.g., following WHO and CDC guidelines on social distancing). At the time of writing, the Republican leadership has not been forthcoming with such recommendations (Dearen & Stobbe, 2020; Yamey & Gonsalves, 2020) . In fact, analyses of tweets from members of the U.S. House and Senate reveal strong polarization in elite communication on the issue, with Democratic elites emphasizing threats to public health while Republican elites focus more on business impacts and blaming China (Green et al., 2020) . Other research also finds a high degree of polarization on Twitter with users from liberal-leaning states being highly critical of political elites whereas users from conservative-leaning states consistently promote hashtags in support of the President and are less likely to promote health preventative behaviors online (Jiang, Chen, Yan, Lerman, & Ferrara, 2020) . As the current studies show, Republicans and conservatives place a great deal of trust in the President and government and are therefore are more likely to form a perception of the virus that aligns with the President's talking points. As noted by Jacquet, Dietrich, and Jost (2014) , conservative attitudes on a range of social issues are likely a result of both \"bottom-up\" psychological and \"topdown\" situational mechanisms in concert (see also Jost, Federico, & Napier, 2009 ). Future research is needed to disentangle the relative contribution of each pathway in influencing COVID-19 attitudes.",

Put another way, individuals ascribe less weight to risks requiring value-incongruent mitigation solutions. Campbell and Kay (2014) outline that conservative denial of climate change impacts as a form of solution aversion; right wing individuals are motivated to deny climate risks not necessarily because they don't understand the science but because acknowledging them would be to implicitly acknowledge the need for government interventions (e.g., carbon taxes) which conflicts with free-market values (a key component of U.S. conservative ideology; Azevedo, Jost, Rothmund, & Sterling, 2019) .",

Government restrictions on individual freedom of movement and business operations are key plank of the public health response to the virus. Through a process of motivated reasoning, conservative Americans may be drawn to the conclusion that the virus is not a great threat, negating the need for unpalatable government interventions. Indeed, previous research has found that individualistic worldviews (favoring individual rights over government intervention) were a consistent, negative correlate of COVID-19 risk perceptions in the U.S. and several other countries . As a potential intervention to counteract solution aversion, Campbell (2018) suggests \"ideological affirmation\"-or acknowledging the importance and value of an individual's ideological position before proposing a solution. Future experimental research could explore the efficacy of this approach in reducing political polarization on the COVID-19 pandemic response.",

A key limitation of the current research is its cross-sectional nature, which limits the inferences that can be made regarding the causal direction of the effects. To ensure the robustness of the strong and significant partisan differences observed here across a range of different measures and operationalization's of political orientation, we conducted two separate national surveys (one pre-registered) about one month apart. Although it is unlikely that the virus engendered a major shift in individuals' political ideology given that ideology is a relatively stable construct in adults (Peterson, Smith, & Hibbing, 2020; Sears & Funk, 1999) , it is possible that over the longer term the threat the virus poses to public health and the economy may shift Americans towards a more conservative political stance. For example, Duckitt and Fisher (2003) provide experimental evidence that dangerous and threatening environments push people towards conservative social values. Indeed, after the 9/11 World Trade Centre bombings, U.S. politics and Americans' personal political views gravitated towards the conservative end of the ideological spectrum (Hersh, 2013; Nail & McGregor, 2009 ). Lastly, we note that the extremity of these results may be specific to the dynamics of U.S. politics. Public opinion is less likely to become heavily polarized when elites are in consensus. For example, in contrast to the United States, Canadian political elites and the public have shown a unique level of cross-partisan consensus on COVID-19 (Merkley et al., 2020) .",

Consistent with Study 1, liberals' average score on the behavior index was significantly higher than conservatives (M lib = 7.22, SD = 2.78; M con = 6.05, SD = 3.17; M diff = \u2212 1.17, 95CI [\u2212 1.73, \u2212 0.61], p < .001, d = 0.39) and moderates (M mod = 6.47, SD = 3.09; M diff = \u2212 0.75, 95CI [\u2212 1.33, \u2212 0.18], p < .05, d = 0.26), indicating that liberals report engaging in more protective behaviors. There was no significant difference between moderates and conservatives (M diff = \u2212 0.42, 95CI [\u2212 1, 0.16], p = .20, d = 0.13).",
