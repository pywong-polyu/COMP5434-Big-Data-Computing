            "text": "There are many patient factors that correlate with age that increase the risk of a patient having a hip fracture, including osteoporosis, frailty, decreased mobility, living in an institution, polypharmacy, etc. [11] A study that compared Canadian and Swedish incidence rates showed that osteoporotic hip fracture past the age of 50 occurred at different age intervals between men and women. The Canadian data demonstrated that 90.6% of these fractures in women occurred over the age of 70 years old, while it only attributed to 79.8% for men. [12] In addition to age, female sex has been associated with an increased risk for hip fracture. [11] [12] [13] [14] This difference is commonly correlated to the incidence of osteoporosis as a result of hormonal changes postmenopause. [13] One study of postmenopausal women demonstrated a significantly increased risk of osteoporotic fractures in women over the age of 70 years old, which interestingly did not correlate with the age of menopause onset. [13] 1.5. Mechanical fall A very common mechanism of injury that results in a hip fracture is a low energy fall, or a fall from standing height, in an individual over the age of 65 years old. [15, 16] This is also evident in the types of medications and diseases that seem to be positively correlated with an increased incidence of hip fracture. For example, individuals with motor impairment, such as in Parkinson disease, are at higher risk for falls and therefore higher risk of hip fracture. [17, 18] 1.6. Previous low energy fracture A history of a previous low energy fracture is a strong indicator for hip fracture as an indicator of an individual's bone integrity and falls risk. Across the globe, various research studies support the increased incidence of hip fracture in the female population over 60 years old following distal radius, proximal humerus, or vertebral fractures. [19] [20] [21] This finding is less evident with mixed populations, and there is some evidence that disputes this correlation. [22] A history of previous hip fracture has also been cited as a risk factor for subsequent contralateral fracture. [23] [24] [25] [26] The studies describe a significant increased risk of contralateral hip fracture in the first 2 years and a persisting risk for the subsequent 10 years. [24] [25] [26] [27] One study cited that 50.7% of contralateral fractures occurred within the 2 years following the first hip fracture. [27] Although many of the population with second hip fracture had increased risk due to increased age, female sex, poor mobility status, or living in an institution [23, [27] [28] [29] [30] ",

Individuals at increased age who have had a mechanical fall and are unable to weight bear, are the patients most at risk for hip fracture. Therefore, these parameters are highly sensitive but have variable specificity. The ages of hip fracture patients, once organized into 5-year groupings, demonstrated significantly more risk attributed to the >80 years age group. It is possible that this age category represents the timing when the overall frailty of patients reaches a threshold point, evident by the increased prevalence of nonvertebral, nonhip fracture in this population. [32] Previous studies have demonstrated no significant difference in fall occurrence between age groups <80 years versus >80 years. [33] Interestingly, a study from Italy demonstrated that patient cohorts younger than 84 years old were demonstrating a decline in prevalence of hip fractures. [34] Historically, there was an increased prevalence of fragility fractures past the age of 65 years old. [12] Our study echoes the findings of the Italian study by demonstrating a postponed age of increased risk. This shift may be as a result of the changing demographics of the early geriatric population. There are some arguments for improved overall health in this demographic compared with earlier generations as well as better understanding of risk factors and medications to manage bone integrity. [35] The highly specific parameters of the test included pain with hip rotation and externally rotated and shortened. Patients with noticeable deformity such as a shortened and externally rotated leg may be an obvious hip fracture patient. In contrast, pain with hip rotation will be highly specific for both displaced and nondisplaced hip fractures.",

This strategy will improve patient outcomes by reducing time-to-surgery delay times.
