            "text": "The novel coronavirus has created one of the biggest social and economic challenges in recent decades. Since a critical issue in overcoming a large-scale pandemic involves finding effective treatments for the disease, there is typically urgent pressure on the health-care sector to develop innovations to combat the pandemic. Recently, scholars have argued that repurposing -that is, reusing an existing innovation in a different context -allows for such rapid innovation responses and can reduce costs, as the groundwork has already been laid. In this paper, we compare these benefits with the considerable disadvantages associated with innovation repurposing, including lowered barriers to entry, which can lead to declining average quality and duplicate work. Using data on 2,456 COVID-19-related clinical trials initiated between December 2019 and July 2020, we find that merely one-third of the trials actually investigated drugs or vaccines, whereas the rest focused on diagnostics and crisis management issues. In the trials concerning drug testing, we find that drug repurposing is a predominant innovation strategy, but many trials tested the same (combination of) drugs. This indicates an inefficient use of resources and reductions in the average variety and novelty of clinical trials. Furthermore, the small percentage of biopharmaceutical firms involved in the search for COVID-19 treatments raises the question of whether firms may have insufficient incentives to redirect innovation efforts to respond to the pandemic. Our paper contributes to crisis management research, the nascent debate on COVID-19, and the emerging literature on innovation repurposing.",

Due to protective measures imposed by governments around the world, many areas of public and economic life were severely restricted (Pereira et al., 2020) . In doing so, most governments were striving to balance the threat of overburdening their health-care systems against the individual and economic freedoms they constrain. A critical part of overcoming the pandemic involves developing an effective drug or vaccine that cures or protects against COVID-19 (Dhama et al., 2020) . This is reflected in high expectations on the 2 R&D Management 2021 part of the health-care sector to quickly develop appropriate treatments (Baden and Rubin, 2020) .

Previous literature on crisis management has focused either on describing how firms can respond to organizationspecific crises, such as corporate scandals (Chandler et al., 2020; K\u00f6nig et al., 2020) , or on macroeconomic challenges, such as economic downturns or terrorist attacks (e.g., Mainiero and Gibson, 2003; Williams et al., 2017) .

First, the economic incentives for developing a treatment for COVID-19 are unusually high in view of the global need for an effective drug or vaccine. Without such treatment, it would be irresponsible to fully levy the social distancing measures in place (Cohen and Kupferschmidt, 2020; Hill et al., 2020) . Second, there is an exceptional time pressure, which is amplified by the fact that the first effective treatment yields the highest economic benefits, while subsequent products are overshadowed by the first mover (Porath, 2018) . Third, the otherwise high regulatory hurdles in the industry are minimized due to the public need for medication, which significantly reduces the otherwise lengthy and costly approval process (Rome and Avorn, 2020) . Taken together, these factors result in an exacerbated competitive situation coupled with high economic incentives. Thus, COVID-19 represents a novel situation for innovation management that provides unique insights into the responsiveness and adaptability of R&D processes in organizations.",

However, this strategy comes at the expense of inefficiency and coordination problems. More specifically, we propose that repurposing is associated with low barriers to entry. When combined with high economic incentives, these low barriers of entry lead to a multitude of uncoordinated actions that cause redundancies and inefficiencies as organizations seek low-hanging fruits and quick wins. As a result, public pressure to promptly innovate can provoke a bustle which, instead of increasing purposeful innovation, fosters mere quantity but deteriorates the average quality of results. Furthermore, the inherent focus of repurposing on application rather than basic research can also prove detrimental for scientific advances in the long run.",

Our analyses show that slightly above 30% of the clinical trials in our sample test drugs, while only a small fraction of around 2% tests vaccines. The remaining trials often focus on understanding the disease, finding diagnostic tools, or assessing the wider impact of the pandemic. Among the clinical trials related to drug testing, repurposing plays a prominent role and we find that the most frequently tested drugs have either been approved as treatments for other diseases or have been previously tested for other diseases. Repurposing strategies are mainly used in clinical trials that come from countries with lower GDP per capita, and that are sponsored by hospitals, governments, and device manufacturers as opposed to biopharmaceutical firms. An alarming finding from our study is that a large proportion of COVID-19 trials test the same treatments or drugs, creating a thicket of redundant, uncoordinated, and costly testing, while reducing the variety that would be required for an effective, broad-based repurposing strategy (Sleigh and Barton, 2010; Allarakhia, 2013) . Another consequence of the high proportion of repurposing trials is the scarcity of research in completely new treatments that could combat the virus in a more targeted and effective way.",

            "text": "Our paper contributes to the literatures on crisis management and innovation repurposing in three important ways. First, in terms of crisis management, we highlight that exceptional innovation pressures can distort incentives toward an unfocused actionism that creates costly redundancies and may reward small wins rather than effective problem solving (Williams et al., 2017) . In relation, our paper could also be of interest in the debate on 'grand societal challenges' (Ferraro et al., 2015;  R&D Management 2021 3 George et al., 2016) as it shows how a major societal challenge is tackled under enormous time pressure. In addition, we contribute to the emerging literature on innovation repurposing, which has received scarce attention in the management literature (Andriani et al., 2017; Kucukkeles et al., 2019) and is in need of empirical evidence and theoretical development. From an empirical standpoint, we extend the prior focus on repurposing drugs for orphan diseases and accidental discoveries to the context of a large-scale pandemic in which repurposing is used as a purposeful strategy. From a theoretical point of view, our paper demonstrates the double-edged nature of innovation repurposing by highlighting the inherent trade-off between the speed and cost of innovation versus the loss of average variety and novelty. Finally, our findings also contribute to the ongoing public debate on COVID-19, and our analyses can provide decision makers with relevant insights for improving crisis management and creating appropriate economic incentives. In particular, we suggest that a better coordination among clinical trial sponsors could reduce costly duplicate efforts while a clearer prioritization of novel developments could promote more diversity in the types of treatments tested. This applies to testing drugs that have proven ineffective in various studies, such as hydroxychloroquine, but which have been further tested in various subsequent clinical trials with public funding.",

            "text": "The traditional innovation management literature is primarily concerned with the question of how organizations can innovate to gain a sustainable competitive advantage (Tushman and Anderson, 1986; Lengnick-Hall, 1992) . At its core, this literature deals with the emergence of innovation stemming from the purposeful recombination of existing and new elements (Henderson and Clark, 1990; Kaplan and Vakili, 2015) within and outside of an organization (March, 1991; Chesbrough, 2003) to address specific needs of individuals and organizations. A common assumption in this line of work is that the need for innovation primarily stems from competitive pressure and the need for organizations to grow and survive in the marketplace by reaping the benefits of temporary monopoly rents generated by innovations (Schumpeter, 1912) . Significantly less attention has been paid to situations where the pressure to innovate does not arise from an organization's need for growth and profit, but from an exogenous crisis, such as a pandemic, that exacerbates specific innovation needs and imposes significant constraints in terms of timing and the direction of innovation. In the past, such 'innovation crises' have often arisen in times of war. For example, the Manhattan Project, which aimed to develop the first nuclear bomb, was born out of the Second World War (Lenfle, 2011) . Other examples are the invention of radar technologies or the precursors of the computer (Rau, 2005) . These situations are distinctive from regular innovation processes because they typically force high urgency; often allow access to lavish public funding; and bring together actors across institutional boundaries, such as academia, government, and industry. In turn, this constellation of necessity and the pressure to act, available resources, and recombination of knowledge hold the potential for groundbreaking discoveries.",

Repurposing means that a known solution to a similar problem is transferred to a new context (Allarakhia, 2013) . Repurposing has gained considerable traction in recent years, expressly in the context of biopharmaceutical innovation (Chong and Sullivan, 2007; Toney et al., 2009; Neuberger et al., 2019) . In view of the considerable risks, time, and costs associated with drug development (DiMasi et al., 2016) , biopharmaceutical firms are turning more to such 'exaptations' as a means of speeding up the development process, while simultaneously reducing associated costs and regulatory hurdles (Breckenridge and Jacob, 2019; Polamreddy and Gattu, 2019) . A classic example is Sildenafil, originally intended for the treatment of angina pectoris (chest pain) but re-used as a therapy for erectile dysfunction (Viagra \u00ae ) due to its side effect of prolonged erections (Simsek et al., 2018) . Apart from these 'accidental' discoveries, repurposing can also be employed more strategically. For instance, repurposing has been hailed as a solution to urgent innovation needs, especially with regard to rare diseases that are historically underfunded due to the small market size and the resulting difficulty of covering the innovation costs (Muthyala, 2011) .",

In particular, the risk of repurposing is that performance and fit for the problem may be lower because the original innovation was developed with a different objective in mind. There is also the peril that repurposing diverts resources toward incremental innovation at the expense of more novel and radical innovations (Banbury and Mitchell, 1995) . Furthermore, repurposing is based on a broad trial and error approach in which a variety of existing solutions are applied to a new problem (Cheng et al., 2018) . Thus, repurposing resembles the search for a needle in a haystack and may come at the expense of not developing a profound understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms. In addition, investing in repurposing may be less attractive than de novo drug development as repurposed drugs tend to have a shorter exclusivity period (e.g., three instead of 10 years in the United States) and lower profit margins due to the availability of generic drugs (Pushpakom et al., 2019) . Finally, biologists and pharmacists may also be deprived of important insights from preclinical basic research, which can provide valuable information about the treatment's underlying mechanisms and a better understanding of the nature of a disease (Oprea et al., 2011; Strittmatter, 2014; Kesselheim et al., 2015) .",

In fact, experience shows that repurposing strategies have been deployed in previous epidemics, such as with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Dyall et al., 2014) . Moreover, given the acute burden on the health-care system induced by COVID-19, we expect that a high number of nontraditional players, such as hospitals and government agencies (as opposed to biopharmaceutical firms and research institutes), will be involved in clinical trials because they are at the forefront of the pandemic.

Figure 4 reports the number of different intervention types relative to the cumulative number of trials over time. Overall, Figure 4 indicates that the distribution across different intervention types is stabilizing after some oscillation right after the beginning of the pandemic. The figure suggests that many COVID-19 trials test specific treatments, with the proportion of drug trials, which varies between slightly above 15% and around 30%, increasing over time to reach just over 30% of all clinical trials by the end of July 2020. The consistently high proportion of drug trials reflects the strong need for effective treatments to alleviate the viral symptoms and shorten hospitalization periods. Trials related to monitoring the spread of the disease and describing its symptoms continue to play a prominent role throughout the initial phase of clinical research on COVID-19. However, the share of this type of clinical trial decreases over time and reaches less than 15% of cumulative trials by the end of July 2020. Interestingly, more than 15% of the COVID-19 trials deal with secondary indications, such as physical and mental health problems, resulting from pandemic-related socioeconomic lockdowns, fears of infection, and prolonged hospitalization. While many policy makers and the public hope for the rapid development of an effective vaccine, our results show that by the end of July 2020, only around 2% of COVID-19 trials were testing vaccines. Although the number of clinical trials of vaccines has gradually increased with the progression of the pandemic, the number of such trials relative to the total number of trials remains rather low. This seems to suggest that vaccine development requires highly specialized competencies, which only a few players in the field possess.",

In particular, the concentration on hydroxychloroquine, the most commonly used drug in COVID-19 drug trials, may not pay off. While scientific evidence is developing rapidly, trial results published since April 2020 have raised questions about the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (Scavone et al., 2020; Wiersinga et al., 2020). In addition, the US Food & Drug Administration (2020b) issued a warning in June 2020 because it fears severe side effects from using hydroxychloroquine. Despite this academic evidence and the regulatory concerns, hydroxychloroquine remains the most widely tested medication for COVID-19 and is being tested in 83 additional new trials that started between May 2020 and the end of July 2020.",

Thus, as external pressure increases, repurposing is becoming more dominant as a crisis response. Moreover, the GDP per capita is negatively related to the probability that a clinical trial tests a repurposed drug, which indicates that repurposing is a viable strategy for low-income countries where the financial resources for de novo drug development may not exist. We also see that the probability of de novo drug development increases if the sponsor is a biopharmaceutical firm, whereas device manufacturers, hospitals, or governments will more likely resort to drug repurposing.

            "text": "In this study, we set out to understand how organizations innovate in crisis situations, with a focus on the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Based on data from COVID-19-related clinical trials, we find that organizations are focusing on repurposing drugs as an immediate response to the health-care needs resulting from the viral pandemic. Despite the benefits of repurposing, we also see that many trials are testing the same drugs and pursuing similar strategies, indicating an inefficient use of resources and a duplication of efforts. The sheer mass of clinical trials also creates an impenetrable thicket and makes it difficult to identify truly novel and unique trials that follow high academic and clinical standards, especially since many trials are sponsored by nontraditional and potentially less experienced players. This can be problematic as it may inhibit policy makers from supporting the most promising approaches. From a theoretical point of view, our study contributes to the emerging literature on innovation repurposing in management (Andriani et al., 2017; Kucukkeles et al., 2019) . Although our empirical focus is on the health-care sector, the idea of repurposing could also be relevant in other contexts, including semiconductors (e.g., the use of Raspberry Pi computers in various environments), engineering (e.g., the use of drone technologies for passenger aviation), and software development (e.g., the redeployment of code) (also see Dew et al., 2004; Andriani and Carignani, 2014) . Even in the context of biopharmaceutical innovation, our study is instructive because it shifts the focus in existing research on repurposing drugs for rare diseases and accidental discoveries toward the systematic use of repurposing strategies in response to a viral pandemic, thus providing an interesting contextualized comparison. More broadly speaking, understanding when and why organizations are innovating through repurposing can help to understand the dynamics of innovation and provide Figure 5 .

We expand this conception of a crisis by introducing the idea of 'innovation crisis,' which we understand as specific innovation demands that unexpectedly shift organizational attention to a new area. Such situations are particularly interesting because they show how organizations can adapt to unforeseen contingencies to effectuate immediate responses.

This is problematic because these duplicate clinical trials consume resources that could be better employed in different trials to increase variety and thus the likelihood of finding an effective treatment. A potential explanation for the lack of coordination could be that many clinical trials are confined to individual countries or conducted by a single institution, which may reduce information exchange between actors and explain the number of similar clinical trials. This problem could be spurred on by politically motivated and nationalist pressure from governments to give priority to local research and development. Moreover, as many organizations are working toward the same goal, the competitive landscape is becoming increasingly confusing, making it difficult for actors to keep track of new scientific evidence and promising avenues for future research.",

            "text": "In addition, the concentration on rapid success might also crowd out solutions that are more likely to be long-term oriented and create a 'first-past-thepost' mentality. In the end, this reduces economic incentives for developing truly novel innovations out of a fear of being too slow or having to compete against multiple alternative products. This would be the case, for example, if a sufficiently effective and inexpensive repurposed drug is brought to the market prior to the launch of a novel drug that takes much longer to develop and incurs higher costs. In this scenario, any follow-on product would have to compete and potentially share the market with the first mover, a prospect that reduces the ex-ante incentives to enter the market at all. An empirical indication for this problem could be the fact that biopharmaceutical firms, which traditionally introduce the majority of medical innovations, are woefully unrepresented in clinical trials related to No study is without limitations and ours is no exception. The explorative approach of our study focuses on understanding how organizations respond to an unexpected crisis event that calls for rapid innovation. In view of the limited previous work in this field, we decided against testing a specific theory and instead focused on uncovering latent patterns in a descriptive way. This explorative approach naturally calls for future research to identify the causal mechanism of repurposing in light of a specific theory (Hambrick, 2007) . The literature on exaptation might be especially promising in this regard (Cattani, 2005; Andriani and Carignani, 2014) . Follow-on studies could, for example, explore the role of firms' experience, their internal resources and capabilities, network structures, and international collaborations as potential drivers of repurposing. Apart from studying organizational-level drivers, it might also be interesting to explore how different innovation demands can shape repurposing strategies. This could include factors, such as market pressure and the role of regulators in facilitating repurposing and fast-tracking this process. More specifically, it is likely that repurposing drugs to treat orphan or rare diseases (Kucukkeles et al., 2019) is motived by a strong cost-saving logic and, therefore, might differ fundamentally from repurposing strategies used in the context of a pandemic where speed is much more critical and potentially a major driver for the decision to rely on repurposing.",

It would also be interesting to see which organizations rely on repurposing strategies, whereas others prefer novel development. In untangling the causal mechanisms, organizational resources, and capabilities, as well as intellectual property rights, could play a central role. Therefore, we see our paper as an impetus to further explore the role of repurposing in innovation research. Despite its limitations, our study carries some relevant implications for policy makers. In view of the relatively small number of biopharmaceutical firms involved in the search for COVID-19 treatments, the question arises as to whether firms have sufficient incentives to enter the market. There are two reasons that suggest this might not be the case. First, firms may not be able to patent a repurposed drug because the knowledge is already in the public domain. Therefore, profit margins are relatively low. Second, the 3-year exclusivity periods for repurposed drugs in the United States, the largest pharmaceutical market, may be too short to provide incentives for clinical trials of repurposed drugs, as firms still have to conduct expensive phase 3 clinical trials (Pushpakom et al., 2019) . This suggests that policy makers should consider revising incentive schemes to provide motivations for firms to shift internal resources from alternative options to the development of treatments for an imminent pandemic. In view of the long drug development cycles (DiMasi et al., 2016) , it seems to be of paramount importance to provide long-term incentives and public support to conduct continuous and large-scale research for treatments against viruses to be more reactive and more quickly react in the event of a crisis.",

First, the exponential growth rate and rapid development of clinical trials in a pandemic suggest that managers need to act quickly if they want to enter the market. For example, remdesivir was among the first clinical trials launched for COVID-19 and was the first to receive regulatory approval in the European Union. A late market entry could mean that competitors reap most of the benefits, although a follow-on product might later prove more effective. Second, managers must also be aware of the risks associated with rapid innovation in a health-care crisis. If a treatment shows unexpected side effects that only occur later, the legal and reputational damage could be irreparable. Third, there is, of course, a strong moral responsibility in responding to a pandemic. Although economic benefits play an important role when entering a market, a major crisis in the health-care sector may also require a strong commitment as part of a firm's larger responsibility to society (Jones and Wicks, 1999) . In recent years, people have become increasingly aware of how firms respond to a crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic should be no exception (Wang et al., 2021) .",

We show that repurposing is a double-edged sword that increases speed, but at the same time promotes a dynamic that creates inefficiencies and redundancies. The challenge for crisis management is to create selective incentives for innovation and at the same time improve coordination between actors to enable a broad search for repurposed innovation.",
