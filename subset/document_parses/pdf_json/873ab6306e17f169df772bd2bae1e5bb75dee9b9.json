Lack of an effective treatment for kidney disease-associated pruritus often leads to many problems for these patients and makes it difficult to choose an appropriate treatment. e purpose of this evidence-based hypothesis is to share the scientific reasons and related mechanisms in order to claim that lettuce could be useful in the treatment of uremic pruritus. is hypothesis is based on studies related to lettuce and its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, sedative, hypnotic, nephroprotective, potassium balancing, and blood purification properties. As a result, we suggest that lettuce could be a good choice for improving and reducing uremic pruritus due to its certain characteristics. Although proof of this hypothesis requires further clinical trial studies, this hypothesis can nevertheless lead to formulating an appropriate therapy for uremic-induced pruritus. By conducting a molecular docking study, we investigated the interactions between nineteen natural bioactive components of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and human kappa opioid receptors. e in silico docking studies revealed that most of the ligands showed better antipruritic efficacy than gabapentin. Gamma-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, and campesterol demonstrated the highest binding affinities toward the target protein.",

In general, effective treatments for this condition are very limited due to the small number of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, most of which were not conclusive in offering a successful treatment. In addition, the lack of effective treatment is due to an incomplete knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this condition [5] . e pathogenesis of CKD-aP remains unclear. Studies have shown that parathyroid hormone, histamine, and calcium and magnesium salts were effective in its pathogenesis. Newer hypotheses have focused on opioid receptor irregularities and inflammation as the possible causes of CKD-aP. Accordingly, itching can be very difficult to control because treatment options are limited. e most important treatment approaches are (a) gabapentin, (b) \u03bc-opioid and \u03ba-opioid receptor antagonists, (c) drugs with anti-inflammatory action, (d) phototherapy, or (e) acupuncture [6] [7] [8] .",

Severe inflammation can lead to damage and destruction of host tissues in various diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairment disorders, brain atrophy, and cancers). In general, overactive macrophages can cause extensive tissue damage. It is widely known that macrophages release inflammatory mediators including cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria [9, 21] .",

Table 1 shows that gabapentin interacted with the active site of the target protein through hydrophobic interactions with Val230, Ile290, and Ile294 residues and hydrogen bindings with Asp138. Interestingly, these are the residues involved in the interactions with different components of Lactuca sativa L., such as gamma-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, campesterol, alpha-tocopherol, and thiamine.",

Molecular docking simulation as an in silico approach was used to analyze the interaction between natural components of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and kappa opioid receptor to determine the effectiveness of this natural herb in the treatment of CKD-aP. is study showed that most of the components of lettuce have a considerably high binding affinity compared to gabapentin as an antipruritic drug. Gamma-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, campesterol, alpha-tocopherol, alpha-lactucerol, riboflavin, and thiamine had the best docking scores. However, further studies, especially well-designed controlled randomized clinical trials and cohort studies, are recommended to prove this hypothesis in the clinical setting.",
