            "text": "At present, population aging poses substantial economic challenges to nearly all of the governments of the world. Pension systems face a series of difficulties mainly due to incomplete contribution records, increased life expectancy, and uncertainty over future market fluctuations. Moreover, pension systems must be sustainable, adequate, and equitable to satisfy the demands and preferences of people and offer them a plan suitable for the present era of rapid change. As a consequence, it is necessary to search for a general solution to pension system issues. The main paths towards such a solution proposed thus far are to reduce monthly pensions, to increase voluntary contributions, to delay the retirement age, and to increase worker output [1] . One way in which the pension system has met the challenges mentioned above has been to shift from models in which employees rely on social security under defined benefit (DB) pension plans to a system in which employees must rely on their own savings and investment decisions to fund their retirement, a system known as a defined contribution (DC) plan. In the latter system, employees are responsible for financing their own retirement. Moreover, the current approach to the investment problem is based on life-cycle plans [2, 3] , whereby investors should allocate a larger share of their long-term savings to stocks when they are young and decrease this allocation as they approach retirement age. Life-cycle funds reduce the stock exposure of the fund as the target maturity date approaches. Adopting them as default investment options in DC pension plans might help a significant number of individuals, particularly those with lower levels of education, wealth, and income because, as argued in [4] , members of these groups exhibit a high degree of inertia in their contribution and investing decisions.",

            "text": "In particular, and to overcome the problems derived from the increase in the elderly population and overall life expectancy, the Mexican pension system has experienced several reforms in recent decades. In 1997, Mexico reformed its DB plan and implemented a DC plan based on a mutual fund system in which the so called Investment Societies Specialized in Retirement Funds (SIEFOREs, for its acronym in Spanish) manage different investment funds with different risk exposure profiles. Until 2004, the official investment policy of the SIEFOREs was restricted to investing only in Mexican government and corporate debt securities; but in that year a new regulation enabled SIEFOREs to include Mexican equity. In 2007, the investment policy changed again and began to follow a life-cycle investment profile. Since then, SIEFOREs have been allowed to invest in international stocks and in real estate. Five categories of SIE-FOREs were available until 2019, with type 5 being the riskiest one with a portfolio consisting primarily of equities and international debt, and type 1 being more conservative and diminated by bonds [5] . For a review and analysis of this pension system with data up to 2014, the reader is referred to [6] .",

The main difference between the multi-fund model and TDF is the investment process. In the multi-fund model, at a certain age, the worker migrates between funds, which are characterized by having a different investment regime and a different risk exposure. In TDF, the individual makes an initial investment and continues to contribute throughout his or her working life. The investor's objective is then to maximize his or her pension benefits during retirement [9] . In TDF, the investment portfolio is restructured reducing its share of risky assets as the worker approaches the retirement date. This implies that the worker's resources stay in the same fund (unlike the DC system in which funds were transferred from one SIEFORE to another), the long-term investment strategy of which is adjusted with respect to risk exposure and the age of the employee.",

In addition to risk, the worker's retirement date and income prospects at retirementthe replacement rate (RT)-and contributions over time are crucial in determining the allocation trajectory of the fund. Thus, the most recent regulation in Mexico, implemented on the 13th of December 2019, poses a rather interesting dynamic optimization problem whose optimal glide-path is fundamental. Some restrictions are imposed on this glide-path by regulation. For instance, the newly managed funds need to contemplate the savings of the particular generation. Additionally, the glide-path must have a horizon of 161 quarters, which amounts to approximately 40 years. Finally, regulation establishes the investment limits for each asset class in time. For example, a maximum of 60% of the total resources available can be invested in equity during the first quarter; but this figure falls to 15% in the last quarter. The traceability of investments is not defined and depends on various variables inherent to the profile of the workers such as savings rate, contributions, and demographic profile, among others factors.",

Thus, we should prefer the approach of a life-cycle pension plan with age-based and risk-based characteristics. Unfortunately, the traditional approach of the mean-variance portfolio analysis of Markowitz [10] does not provide scientific support for the horizon-based investing approach to asset allocation that characterizes life-cycle funds [4] . The reason is that mean-variance analysis assumes that investors live in a parsimonious world of constant risk and return. A TDF pension fund must address the challenges of implementing state-of-the-art life-cycle optimization techniques to incorporate the long-term investment horizon while also accounting for the periodic contributions of the investor to adequately model the pension funds in a TDF system.",

Then, we can choose a solution that meets the particular risk aversion of the investor, similar to the optimal frontier of Markowitz [10] . Note that J(t) is the objective function that we will seek to optimize under the specific investment limits or restrictions listed in Table 2 applied to the assets of Table 1 .",

As customary, we take the Box-Cox transformation with \u03bb = 0 as the logartithmic transformation. The parameters {\u03b1 i , i = . . ., q} capture the impact of past returns on the variance. In this sense, they are considered the ARCH part of the model. The influence of past returns of the volatily process is modulated by the function f and the power parameter \u03bd. The main reason to include f in this formulation is to allow for asymmetric responses so that negative and positive returns have a different impact on the volatility. This asymmetry, also known as leverage, is an important part of financial theory. Parameters a, b, c, and \u03bd allow for a flexible specification of the asymmetric effect. Finally, the parameters {\u03b2 j , j = 1. . ., p}, known as the GARCH part of the model, measure the influence of past volatilities on the present one.",

Parameter \u03d5 takes on value, say, \u03d5 1 if S t = 1 and value \u03d5 2 if S t = 0. A very similar model, which uses Eq (13) but omits the term a S t and only deals with asymmetry in the variance specification, was introduced some years later by [27] and labeled Threshold Asymmetric Autorregressive SV (TA-ARSV) model. Later, in [28] the TA-ARSV is again put forward as a modelling strategy and applied to precious metal returns. According to the authors, and based on a selected sample of returns of financial stock and three precious metals, the TA-ARSV is more sensitive to asymmetries and more capable of measuring the leverage effect when compared to the A-GARCH, T-GARCH, A-ARSV, and ARSV models. Like GARCH processes, threshold SV models have been applied in several fields and capture the statistical regularities of different financial instruments and price processes. For example, the leverage effect of spot prices in the energy market have been studied in [29, 30] . The model was also successfully applied to stock markets in [27, 31, 32] , to daily average prices of energy products in [33] , and to predict crypto and wold currencies in [34] . While all these models may be appropriate for modelling certain forms of the leverage effect in volatility, they offer no distinct advantage over the f-GARCH asymmetric models for our modelling purposes. In this paper we focus thus on returns generated by Eq (12) and seek to optimize the investment trajectories based on them. Different approaches to portfolio optimization and hedging using GARCH type models and asymmetric correlations can be found in, for example, [35, 36] .",

Consequently, any non-zero value of T Yshuffled !X(k, l) is due to small sample effects. The work of Dimpfl et. al. [46] improves the bias correction by adding an inferencial perspective to the estimated information flows. They proposed to use the Horowitz's approach [47] , who bootstraps the modelled Markov process. The idea is to simulate process Y based on the calculated transition probabilities, where the dependencies between Y and X are destroyed, but the dynamics of the series Y is not changed. Transfer entropy is then estimated using the simulated time series.

In this way, the normal distribution specification for the innovations is replaced by the non-parametric adjusted distribution of the empirical data. In the GARCH case, we followed a parametric approach with z t * N(0, 1).",

Under this transformation if a ETE value is bigger than zero then it is set as one, otherwise, the ETE value is kept as zero. It is worth noting the TPR is very low, while TNR reaches values above 0.9 for all forecasting strategies. At this point, we can argue that neither model have enough power to preserve the TPR, while all of them maintain a high TNR.

The experiments were performed using MATLAB 2015 over a computer with 64GB of RAM and an Intel Core i9-9900K processor. The parameter \u03b1 for the constraints (11) is fixed to 0.03 in the experiments since this is the best value with respect to the smoothness of the solutions. Furthermore, the weights \u03b3 for the variance in the objective function were considered in such a way that in the initial 22 periods are fixed to zero and in the last periods the weights increase linearly with the condition that must sum one. These values were considered in this way because it is expected that at the beginning the retirement fund can be exposed to risk in order to increase the wealth; but at the last periods the wealth of the people should be assured so it must face lower risk. Finally, the initial amount of money x (0) is generated considering one unit distributed uniformly over the assets. Finally, the algorithm takes 2 hours and 45 minutes, in average, to obtain the solutions of each experiment, which is relatively low considering that the inversion strategy is computed over 40 years. Fig 6 shows the efficient solutions for the experiments E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6 and E7, respectively. As can be seen, there is no significant difference among the solutions; the biggest difference can be observed in E7, which has a similar wealth; but a greater variance. The experiments show that for the SBBS, GARCH and EGARCH model there is not a significant change in the value of the variance in the respective experiments, although it is expected that the Multi experiments provide better estimations of the covariance matrices since they are estimated for each period in the investment horizon.

In this paper, we have shown that an adequate mixture of statistics, econometrics, and dynamic optimization provides a step forward in the solution to this problem. Specifically, we assumed a dynamic self-financing portfolio and minimized risk, as measured by weighted volatility, in each period. We evaluated the performance of this method using long-horizon bootstrap forecasts of each individual asset in the portfolio for three different volatility specifications as well as a stationary block bootstrap simulation as a baseline model for comparison purposes.",

Indeed, the SBBS, GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1) and GJR-GARCH(1,1) experiments reveal very similar glide-paths so that the overall structure of the investment is maintained. This is a very desirable property of the model since it suggests we do not need to worry about model uncertainty when forecasting volatility. The optimal investment was also robust to the model employed for the correlation matrix of the returns.",

Nevertheless, the glide-paths found at the highest Sharpe ratio show the most parsimonious solution in the sense of the best trade-off between wealth and variance. In particular the GARCH(1,1) experiment with fixed historical covariance matrix represents the best solution in terms of risk aversion.",

In long-range multi-step optimization, the most important matter is that the dependencies of the assets are maintained. Thus, we could relax some stylized assumptions about financial returns in order to reduce the complexity of the forecasting models and instead focus on improving the optimization strategy. This is certainly something that should be studied in future work systematically. Also, interesting future research may include even more realistic settings possibly including contributions and withdrawals as well as tax commissions and their practical implications in the replacement rate on the Mexican pensioners.",
