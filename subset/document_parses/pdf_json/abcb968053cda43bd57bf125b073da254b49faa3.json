            "text": "Background: Dendritic cells (DCs) comprise a valuable target for immune-modulation in food allergy (FA). Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has immunomodulatory capacities and may influence the outcome of DC antigen presentation. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the implication of MALAT1 in FA remain unclear. Methods: BALB/c mice were sensitized to ovalbumin in accordance with a model of FA protocol and injected with adenovirus. After modeling, immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the jejunal tissues of FA mice and hematoxylin-eosin staining and toluidine blue staining were performed to detect inflammation and mast cell numbers. Ovalbumin-sensitized mice were monitored for symptoms of diarrhea and rectal temperature. Immature DCs were stimulated by oxidized low density lipoprotein to trigger their maturation. Results: MALAT1 was found highly expressed in mice with FA, and its silencing relieved allergic reactions with reduction in intestinal inflammatory cells and mast cells in FA mice. MALAT1 aggravated symptoms by downregulating zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36). MALAT1 also downregulated ZFP36 expression to promote interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion by DCs and maturation of DCs, with increased serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG1 levels. Conclusion: Together, these data suggested that therapeutically blocking MALAT1 in FA could reduce the severity of FA by decreasing secretion of IL-6 by DCs and suppressing the immunomodulation of Tregs.

            "text": "Food allergy (FA) is an immune reaction caused by antigens from innocuous food protein antigens. 1 Oral antigen-induced allergies are frequently elicited by immunoglobulin (Ig) E and mast cells. 2 An epidemiological study has reported that FA is increasingly prevalent worldwide and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. 3 Such increase can be attributed to environmental alterations, which include lower exposure to protective factors (eg, farming conditions) and increased exposure to risk factors (eg, pollution). 4 The interplay of genetic and environmental factors has been implicated in allergic diseases and environmental factors may act by modulating epigenetic mechanisms that interact with an individual's genetic background. 5 The diagnosis of FA is mainly dependent on medical history and tests for sensitization, while component-resolved diagnostics is potentially applied for improving diagnostic accuracy. 6 Treatment modalities under current investigation are closely associated with immunotherapy and related strategies have been explored for the prevention of FA. 7 Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in immune-modulation in allergies and antigen presentation. 8 Based on the marked difference between antigenic environments, ie, host \"self\" antigens vs foreign or pathogen-associated \"non-self\" antigens, DCs are classified into steady immature DCs (iDCs) and fully mature DCs presenting as two major States. 9, 10 The discrepancy between immature and mature DCs is partially manifested as alterations at the phenotypic and functional levels. [11] [12] [13] Unlike iDCs, DCs positively modulates surface maturation ligands (CD80, CD83, and CD86) along with the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule and secrete cytokines in which the balance between inflammatory or immunostimulatory cytokines, interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2, and immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is dependent on the environmental context. 14 In normal and healthy conditions, iDCs can impair adaptive immune cells to maintain immune tolerance from attacking host antigenpresenting cells. 15 Specifically, blocking regulatory T cell (Treg) function can promote FA 16 and DCs are antigenpresenting cells can regulate the immunomodulatory functions of Tregs by secreting IL-6. 17 Therefore, we planned to determine the molecular mechanisms engaged in regulating DCs and Tregs in FA.",

Type-2 immune responses are detected in individuals with allergic diseases, such as asthma and FA, and lncRNAs are involved in type-2 immune responses in both clinical and pre-clinical disease settings. 35 Upregulated Circ_MALAT1 has been associated with increased DC maturation and consequent enhanced immune responsive functions. 36 DCs are important immune cells that release proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and express T cell immunoglobulin. 37 Moreover, MALAT1 can induce DCs maturation markers including CD83 and IL-6 in atherosclerosis, where aberrantly expressed MALAT1 mediates ox-LDL-treated iDCs. 31 In FA mice, we further examined MALAT1 expression, and found high expression of MALAT1 in FA, while silenced MALAT1 by sh-MALAT1 reduced diarrhea and normalized rectal temperature. Nevadensin potentially alleviates food hypersensitivity by upregulating rectal temperature, suppressing the development of diarrhea, and reducing the level of serum-specific IgE in OVA-allergic mice. 38 Therefore, reduced diarrhea and normalized rectal temperature might represent relieved allergic reactions induced by silenced MALAT1. Notably, Th2 cells and innate lymphoid cells are capable of releasing cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), among which IL-4 and IL-13 activate B cells to class-switch to IgE and exert roles in allergic inflammatory tissues. 39 In our study, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels were reduced after silencing of MALAT1 in FA mice. Mast cells are the main sources of biologically active mediators that contribute to the pathological and lethal phenomena that can occur in allergic responses including anaphylaxis. 40 Silenced MALAT1 decreased the number of mast cells in FA mice. Taken together, our experiments demonstrated that in FA mice, silencing of MALAT1 relieved allergic reactions, accompanied by suppressed maturation of DCs. The intestinal Treg response is crucial in the development of oral tolerance and protection against IgE-mediated food allergies. 41 Increased CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg frequency in the spleen indicates alleviated symptoms ",
