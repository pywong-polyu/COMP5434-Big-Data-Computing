Household COVID-19 infections significantly reduced home-based stimulation by 0.10 SDs (95%CI: -0.18,-0.01), positive parenting behaviors by 0.14 SDs (-0.21, -0.01), and increased parenting stress by 0.07 SDs (0.02, 0.12). The impact on home-based stimulation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof was most pronounced when the mother herself had a COVID-19 infection (-0.16; -0.29,-0.04). Parenting stress responded most strongly to mother or child COVID-19 infections. Effects were relatively short-lived, only children's infections' on parental stress was still detectable 2 weeks after initial infection. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 infections cause substantial disruptions in children's home environments -additional short-term support for families with acute infections could attenuate the negative impact on children's home environment during the pandemic.

Declines in mental health have been documented in several countries (Xiong, Lipsitz et al. 2020) , particularly during the first pandemic shock in the first half of 2020. Sustained declines in mental health were reported especially for deprived neighborhoods and mixed race (Pierce, Hope et al. 2020 , McKnight-Eily, Okoro et al. 2021 , Pierce, McManus et al. 2021 , Tausch, e Souza et al. 2022 , Wong, Leung et al. 2022 . The adverse impacts were found to be stronger among women, more so in childbearing age (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) , people living with young children, people being infected with COVID-19, and people in areas of local lockdown and with financial difficulties. Mental health has long been recognized as key risk factor for healthy child development (McPherson, Lewis et al. 2008) . Caregiver mental health is critical especially at developmental periods at younger ages, when the brain is particularly sensitive to environmental inputs (Shonkoff, Garner et al. 2012 , Black, Walker et al. 2017 , Berens and Nelson 2019 .",

There, to account for potential impact of the reporting of COVID-19 infection between lagged time points, models were additionally adjusted for immediate (Lag0) and intermediate time points Gunasekara, Richardson et al. 2014) . For the relatively short study period of 50 weeks, we assumed that demographic factors were constant. We accounted for subject level clustering issues and heteroscedasticity using cluster-robust standard errors. The resulting estimates can be interpreted as causal as long as the exact timing of the infection is independent of other predictors of the outcomes of interest.",

Those infections were not found to have significant persistent effects on outcomes of interest on subsequent follow-up weeks (i.e. 2 and 4 epidemiological weeks later). Similar results were found for households that reported COVID-19 related symptoms, although less pronounced for positive parenting and an indication of a persistent effect on parenting stress (supplement Table s7 ). Assessing effects for individual household members showed that homebased stimulation was only significantly reduced when the mother had a COVID-19 infection (-0.16; -0-29,-0.04), and when the infection was immediate (i.e. same week as reduced stimulation) (Figure 3 and details in supplement Table s8 ). Effect size gave some indication that the child being COVID-19 positive might be of some relevance; the association failed statistical significance but contributed to the weighted average negative effect of household COVID-19 infections.

Our findings are in line with previous reports, that were generally on ecological level or used ecological exposure (i.e. COVID-19 status was derived from societal presence of public policies such as governmental preventive measures). Changes in circumstances and perceptions during COVID-19 outbreak were consistently, across different countries, shown to negatively affect relaxation time, child rearing, partner aggression, domestic violence and emotional abuse, sense of unfairness in mothers with young children, depressive symptoms, anxiety, adverse childhood experiences, job loss and financial strain (Brown, Doom et al. 2020 , Fabbri, Bhatia et al. 2020 , Lawson, Piel et al. 2020 , Zhang 2020 , Calvano, Engelke et al. 2021 , Croda and Grossbard 2021 , Kimura, Kimura et al. 2021 , Lee, Ward et al. 2021 , Ortega Pacheco and Martinez Rudas 2021 , Wong, Wai et al. 2021 . A majority of parents also reported to be negatively affected by social distancing and closure of childcare J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f facilities (Calvano, Engelke et al. 2021) . Furthermore, negative impact of COVID-19 distress on childhood emotional and behavioral problems were found to be mediated by negative parenting practices (Hails, Petts et al. 2021) . These previous studies and our findings are also in line with prior reports on impacts of other public health crises on (mental) health and individuals' well-being (Earls, Raviola et al. 2008 , Mucci, Giorgi et al. 2016 . While other studies predominantly showed these patterns relating to the perceived presence of COVID-19 in the general public, our study assessed the effects of actual presence in the household, suggesting that the impact is more accurately capturing what is directly affecting the household. Furthermore, evidence suggests that ethnic groups are disproportionally affected and women and less favored Brazilian communities are more severely affected by COVID-19 stressors (Brown, Doom et al. 2020 , Lins-Filho, Ara\u00fajo et al. 2020 , Croda and Grossbard 2021 , Souza, Souza et al. 2021 ). Our study did indeed confirm and elucidate in depth the burden on the mother during this pandemic. Data on fathers or other caregivers in the household to contrast against maternal outcomes was, however, not available in our study.",

This seems plausible as distinct spatiotemporal patterns by states were reported (Castro, Kim et al. 2021) . We consider the sample that was based on an ongoing RCT to have a good representativeness of the more vulnerable population of Boa Vista, i.e. all pregnant women classified as vulnerable were eligible for the RCT but only participants on treatment were then used for the present study; the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f assignment to treatment was, however, randomized and we expect no selection bias here. The sample was on an active intervention to improve parental behaviors and we anticipate our associations on subject level to be similar or more pronounced in the comparable population without intervention. Should the intervention turn out to be effective in improving parental behaviors, we can assume that these behaviors in the (untreated) vulnerable population of Boa Vista were generally less favorable; i.e. the intervention might have offset some of the COVID-19 impact we found. Similarly, we expect a fair but somewhat limited generalizability to other vulnerable communities in Brazil and comparable emerging countries. Studies in other countries showed that similar parenting interventions increased positive parenting behaviors (Aboud and Yousafzai 2015) ; Brazil's response to the pandemic was (during the study period) among the less restrictive ones globally (Neiva, Carvalho et al. 2020) , and areas with more restrictive measures may have placed more (perceived) stress on households.",

Given the relatively short follow-up period of 50 weeks, we assume to have adjusted adequately for demographic variables that we believe to be consistent. Despite these steps to arrive at unbiased results, we cannot rule out presence of residual confounding as we did not collect additional information on potentially relevant subject level behaviors or events. Fixed effects estimates are derived only from subjects for whom change was present as this approach uses the variation within individuals to account for time-invariable confounding. Despite the longitudinal nature of the study design J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and data analysis, reverse causality cannot be fully ruled out. However, it seems unlikely that on subject level, parental behaviors affect reporting positive COVID-19",

It is also important to highlight that the empirical strategy applied here does not allow us to identify the total impact of Covid-19 and accompanying measures on parenting behavior and children's home environment: our empirical strategy is based on a comparison of families under the same external stress, and thus identifies only the additional changes in this outcomes triggered by acute infections in the household. Composite behaviors were used to better capture global constructs of parent competency and child interaction and increase statistical efficiency regarding relatively low numbers of active COVID-19 infections. While individual questions for the composite outcomes were adapted from validated scales, the positive parenting index and stress composite were not validated as such. To capture different constructs of parenting behaviors and attitudes but also minimizing the response burden in the frequent assessments, only few questions were used for each construct which did not reflect the validated scale domains fully. Future studies should ensure using full scales or sub-domains to better understand the psychometric properties of these constructs. Furthermore, the presented composite associations cannot be presumed to relate to all components equally. We did, however, test some lower level constructs to explore whether the effects are consistent and disparate, albeit with reduced statistical power.",

The data collection was administered via phone and relied on self-reporting of main outcome and exposure variables. Phone surveys are prone to ownership bias and some of the poorest RCT participants who did not have access to a phone at the time of the present study were not included. Self-reporting is generally prone to recall bias, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f whereas we'd expect a limited impact on results as all questions were covering events of the past 7 days maximum. We cannot rule out that responses were to some extent biased towards social desirability which could have attenuated the strength of our findings. We'd expect this to be non-differential regarding the main exposure of presence of COVID-19 in the household and it would such not affect the main associations presented. We used the SARI surveillance protocol to assess Brazil's COVID-19 trends which is likely to have underestimated the overall pandemic spread in absolute numbers. The SARI surveillance protocol has included the test for SARS-CoV-2 starting in the 12th epidemiological week 2020 but by definition no mild cases were captured, and therefore patterns reflect only severe COVID-19. Also, a recent report showed that while COVID-19 spreads fast in Brazil, there were distinct patterns of burden by state (Castro, Kim et al. 2021 ).",

Both praising and showing affection for the child were frequent (at least 95% of observations), regardless of household COVID-19 infections. On average, shouting (36.2% vs. 29.7%) and hitting (11.5% vs. 8.1%) the child was more prevalent in households with COVID-19 infections; similarly, parenting burden and doubt appeared on average higher in infected households while home-based stimulation appeared lower.Time trends of SARI reported COVID-19 cases showed substantial variability over the study period, with the lowest reported numbers in week 45, 2020 and the highest in week 12, 2021 (Figure 1). Visually, trends of aggregated household COVID-19 symptoms appeared similar to SARI reported data, albeit with a lag of several weeks. Correlations for bivariate time series suggested that over the full study period changes in SARI reported COVID-19 cases in Brazil preceded changes in proportion of COVID-19 symptoms in our cohort by 8 weeks, as indicated by the strongest correlation at that lagged time point (Figure s1). Correlations were weaker for household COVID-19 infections confirmed by tests. Neither positive parenting nor parenting stress displayed a clear trend over the study period (p for linear trends were 0.697 and 0.233, respectively) (Figure 2). The average number of reported home-based stimulation increased consistently over the study period (average increase of 0.01 SDs per week, CI95% 0.009 to 0.012, pvalue: <0.001). The cohort COVID-19 test positivity was highest near the beginning of the data collection, reaching almost 80% in epidemiological week 30 2020, and on average roughly halving for the second half of the study period (Figure s2). A positive COVID-19 infection per household had an immediate and significant negative effect on home-based stimulation (estimated SD change; 95%CI: -0.10; -0.18,-0.01), positive parenting behaviors (-0.14; -0.21, -0.01), and parenting stress",

Unfavorable individual parenting behaviors shouting (OR; 95%CI: 1.37; 1.09, 1.72) and hitting the child (1.57; 1.14, 2.15) were increased in the presence of household COVID-19 infections, most pronounced when others than mother or child in the household were infected. Effect sizes indicated that positive models for COVID-19 infections at immediate(Lag0)and intermediate time points (Lag2) (i.e. potential COVID-19 infections at time points between exposure and outcome) somewhat decreased effect sizes in general but did not change the findings (i.e. persistent associations remained non-significant) found an immediate negative effect of household COVID-19 infection on maternal caregiving behaviors and children's early home environment. Maybe unsurprisingly, the impact of acute infections was most pronounced when the primary caregiver was the person affected, with substantial reductions in home-based child stimulation and positive parenting practices, and increased maternal parenting stress. Infections of the children showed a similar impact but statistically weaker results, while infections of other household members appear relevant only for positive parenting practices. Furthermore, COVID-19 manifested as general symptoms reduced the investigated maternal parenting outcomes in a similar fashion.",
