In recent years, video games and their potential positive effects on stress relief have been researched and \"relaxation\" has been an important keyword in marketing a certain kind of video game. In a quasi-experimental design, this study investigated the increase of average daily player peak (ADPPs) for the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period and if this increase was significantly larger for relaxing games in contrast to non-relaxing games. Results showed a medium-sized increase of ADPPs over all types of games but no difference between relaxing games and non-relaxing games. These results are discussed in regards to their potential of presenting gaps between the current theoretical models of the influence of video games on mental health and actual observed player behaviour.",

Besides the direct physical health consequences, which most commonly involve fever, coughs, and breathlessness, the pandemic negatively impacts mental health and psychological wellbeing to a not negligible extent. This does not necessarily include a direct infection with the virus but may rather be due to overall social and personal difficulties arising from the crisis, such as financial losses, uncertainty about the future, and public health measures like social distancing and contact restrictions. Common mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress [2] [3] [4] , with the latter being amongst the most frequently reported adverse consequences in the global population. For instance, Salari et al. [3] identified a stress prevalence of 29.6% in the general population as a reaction to the pandemic, based on a meta-analysis of 5 studies with a total sample size of over 9,000 individuals from various countries. High rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic have also been identified in a systematic review by Xiong et al. [4] , who incorporated data from several regions in Asia, Europe, and America in their analyses.",

Since the 1970's, there have been extensive reviews about the consequences of stress-inducing life events on psychological health, describing various risks such as developing depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders, or even schizophrenia [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Stress has not only been shown to have a negative impact on mental health, but also on behavioural variables, such as drinking, smoking, and violent behaviour [10] [11] [12] [13] -variables that in turn adversely influence health and wellbeing. Greenberg et al. [14] further collected literature describing the emotional and cognitive changes that resulted of stress, giving more context to the dangers of stressful life events for mental health. Besides that, plenty of studies have reported an inverse relationship between stress and subjective life satisfaction, providing evidence of the unfavourable influences that stress has on psychological wellbeing [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

            "text": "These various and severe adverse health consequences demonstrate the importance of ways to reduce psychological distress. One promising method that gained popularity in recent years are video games. More and more studies provide arguments that link the role of video games to mental health improvements. As an example, casual video games (e.g., pinball, card games) have been shown to reduce physical stress responses, and with that psychological consequences of stress [19] . Similarly, Holmes et al. [20, 21] and Iyadurai et al. [22] noted the potential of Tetris to reduce flashbacks after trauma exposure in PTSD patients, showing that even pathological stress responses can be mitigated by playing video games. Systematic reviews on the topic further underpin the potential of video games to improve general mental health outcomes, including stress relief [23-26]. Indeed, there is an increasing interest for video games that go beyond the mere purpose of being entertaining-commonly referred to as serious games. More and more health practitioners rely on the health and educational benefits of such games, validating their therapeutic incremental value [27] . More importantly, there is evidence that people systematically play video games for recovery purposes or after straining situations [28], with middle-aged adults even citing stress relief as a main reason to play [29] . These findings can be extended to a wider group of participants: Ferguson and Olson [30] for instance identified stress relief as a common game play motive among children, while Mazurek et al. [31] reported similar results in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Reinecke et al. [32] further highlighted the special role of actively playing video games as compared to passive media exposure in eliciting the experience of recovery. This growing interest in playing video games for recreational purposes also becomes apparent in search trends on popular video game distribution services. On the Steam platform for example, users can tag games with specific attributes they believe are appropriate for this game. Frequently applied tags become featured categories in the Steam Store, which can be used by players to discover relevant games. The tag \"relaxing\" as such a category yields now over 2,800 results in the Steam Store, providing further evidence of relaxation as a common player experience.",

Based on reports describing a growing interest in digital activities during the pandemic, it was hypothesized that the peak number of daily players averaged over the time period March to November 2020 increased compared to the average daily player peak (ADPP) from March to November 2019 (i.e., before the outbreak of the pandemic). The daily peak number of players was selected for averaging in order to represent a game's popularity, thereby operationalising demand. As there is evidence that recreation is a desired player experience, particularly in stressful times, a higher rise in ADPPs for relaxation games was expected as compared to games not associated with relaxation. While there is no consent on an exact beginning of the pandemic and countries showing different progressions regarding reported cases and institutional consequences, March 2020 was reported as the beginning of stress-related effects in many studies [2] [3] [4] and official public consideration of stress-related concerns made by the World Health Organization (WHO; [39] ).",

For these games, ADPPs were calculated for the time period March to November 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period), and for March to November 2020 (COVID-19 period). Games for which there were missing values in ADPPs for any of the months in the observed time period were eliminated beforehand, resulting in 4,147 remaining applications. In addition, games were deleted from the dataset when released after February 15, 2019, leaving 2,929 games in the dataset. This was done in order to allow for a minimum 2-week warmup period during which player numbers might not yet be representative of the actual popularity of the game. Furthermore, games with an average peak of less than 3 players per day for the 2019 time period were excluded from the dataset, resulting in 2,379 remaining games.",

The selection of games followed pre-defined coding criteria and was conducted by both researchers, regularly checking for inter-coder agreement. As an overall criterion, the application had to be a game; demos and other software (e.g., developer tools or utilities) were excluded. For the test group, additional selection criteria were as follows: (1) the game must be tagged as 'relaxing', which included 208 games; (2) a detailed analysis of trailer, game description, and further tags must not lead to the conclusion that the game is not primarily relaxing. To be included in the test group, a game therefore must not show any of the following: (a) Other mood tags, such as 'funny' or 'emotional' are tagged with a higher priority than 'relaxing'. While relaxing games might also include elements that evoke other moods, this was a important step to ensure the experimental group only included games that are prioritise their role in relaxing players over evoking other moods, such as sadness, melancholy, or excitement and humor. After this step, 178 games remained in the test group. (b) Gameplay appears to be action-heavy and intense. After analysing trailer, descriptions, and other promotional material on the Steam Page, games with a high action focus that might be considered relaxing for some, but are generally not designed as a \"relaxing game\" were excluded. After this step, 169 games remained in the test group. (c) Main elements of the game contain horror, sexual or mature content, or similar characteristics not considered compatible with the main aim of providing a relaxing experience for the player, but rather other emotional aspects that might for some be considered relaxing. Through this procedure, 143 games were identified for the test group (relaxing games). For the control group, 2,124 possible games remained in the dataset. Extreme outliers with more than 7 standard deviations from the mean were further removed from the dataset, leading to 2,216 games in total, with 138 relaxing games, and 2,078 non-relaxing games. It should be noted that test and control group were exclusive, meaning that all games identified as relaxing games were eliminated from the control group pool. This procedure was chosen to have replicable and controlled methods to categorize game characteristics based on how they are presented and described in Steam. Forming groups made it possible to compare a unique subset of games associated with relaxation with a control group to examine effects.",

This was done in order to reduce covariate imbalances between test and control group, thereby avoiding a confounded assignment of games to the respective group. Data pre-processed with matching generally produce more robust inferences that are tied to fewer assumptions as compared to nonmatched data [43] . The current data set was thus matched based on ADPP in the pre-COVID-19 period (March to November 2019) as the covariate. Matching was achieved using a greedy nearest neighbour algorithm. With this method, each test unit is assigned one control unit, based on the smallest distance in propensity scores between both units. Greedy matching was chosen as it takes the closest match for each value in the test group, which has been shown to perform very efficiently with datasets containing a large pool of control units to chose from [44, 45] . The matching procedure led to a final dataset of 138 games in each the control group and test group. A detailed overview over the selection process can be seen in Fig 1. A preliminary power analysis uncovered the need of 210 participants to reveal a medium-sized effect with a power of 1-\u03b2 = 0.95. Because non-experimental data needs generally more conservative analyses, the final sample size of 276 was deemed appropriate to reveal a medium-sized effect.",

            "text": "Just as there is not much doubt about the behavioural changes that resulted from the pandemic, the literature provides a huge amount of convincing evidence regarding the changes relating to mental health, specifically psychological stress [2] [3] [4] . Multiple studies associated the COVID-19 related increased screen time and decreased physical activity with mental health problems (e.g. [52, 53] ). The pandemic itself and consequences of the lockdowns for people's lifestyles have been identified as risk factors for psychological problems. However, more and more recent studies provide arguments that link the role of video games in specific not to a mental health danger, but to mental health improvement and protections against such risk factors (e.g. [19, 20, 25]). It further seems that people are more and more drawn to video games as a way to actively recuperate from stressful events [28, 29] . While the present findings do not hold any information about why people play more during the pandemic, the increased numbers of daily players across all games do not contradict this particular view. It is however important to note that this overall increase might not be related to COVID-19 but rather represent a naturally expected increase of ADPPs independent from the pandemic, but possibly related to factors such as reduced cost or increased accessibility of technology. As S1 Fig shows, ADPP peaks for most game seem to lie in 2018 with a big decrease in ADPPs for all games between 2018 and 2019. It is very much possible that the pandemic had an effect on this trajectory from 2019 onwards that seems to invert a decreasing trend, its significance does however appear insignificant considering the the overall variation in ADPPs over time and the unexplained decrease of ADPPs after 2018, which might represent multiple reasons, such as a natural decrease in interest after a few years post-release. In any case, the data does not allow for conclusive attribution of observed trends. Not only is it questionable to assume the pandemic had a large effect on player increase, the presented data shows no support for the assumption that that people would play even more games associated with relaxation to cope with the stress caused by the pandemic.",

            "text": "Therefore, the overall effect might just be a product of natural interest variation, although more available free time during the pandemic might also explain some of the variance reversing the declining trend on ADPPs over time. Due to lockdown restrictions more time is spent at home, so it is quite natural to expect more time spent on common indoor activities, such as video games. While it makes sense to think of video games as ways to counter the mental strain caused by the pandemic, it is important to control for variables like increased boredom due to the restrictions. It might even be argued that natural interest decline can be seen as a simpler explanation, especially considering that no difference between relaxing games and control games was found. Future research investigating the overall rise in video game player peaks should therefore make sure to control for variables like boredom and natural interest decline to better explore how much video games are actually played for the potential mental health benefits. It might be that the vast majority of players do not play video games as a way to relieve stress, but rather because there is not much else to do. If this is the case, an important followup question would be: Why are people not playing more as a way to decrease stress? This is a question that has many potential implications for the game industry and players alike. As the view of video games as a way to reduce stress is quite a new direction, it could be that people are just not aware of the potential positive effects or that these effects are not convincing enough to change actual behaviour. Another explanation would be the perception of the current game catalogue that is considered \"relaxing\". There might be limited appeal of this type of game that includes mostly simulation, adventure, and casual games (see Table 2 ), even if these games are seen as emotionally profitable. In summary, there is definitely room to research these assumptions to get a more complete picture of how games are viewed and why games are played, which also might hold further information about potential strategies in marketing and designing games specifically for relaxation (i.e. serious games). It is however important to note that the present findings do not hold strong evidence for or against any theory on why people are playing games, so further research is clearly necessary to explore this.",

            "text": "It might therefore still be true that stress relief is an important selling point for video games, especially in very stressful times. If this is the case, another perspective to explain the data might emerge if relaxation from video games is not seen as specifically seeking out relaxing video game elements and styles, but relaxing from playing any video game, regardless of style or genre. A wide variety of individual differences regarding physiological stress-responses have been reported [54] and emotion regulation technique effectiveness is also known to be highly dependent on individual differences [55, 56] . Game elements that consistently fall under the definition of \"relaxing\" might therefore not mirror what individual people find relaxing and seek out. One possible counter-argument could be the amount of mostly violent action games in the control group (see Table 2 ), which may not help to reduce stress, but rather cause it (e.g. [57, 58] ). Recently, more research has been conducted that demonstrates the importance of individual differences in response to violent games (e.g. [59, 60] ) and even shed light on important elements with a positive relation to mental health. For example, Collins and Cox [61] found that action games and shooters have the largest effect on after work recovery than any other genre. Moreover, social interactions and support have been identified as important factors moderating positive effects of video games on mental health [60, 61] . In fact, social interactions have consistently been shown to be an important buffer against the negative impacts of stress (e.g. [62] ), which also relates to social components within otherwise violent video games. Maroney et al. [63] for example argue that all types of games provide means to reduce negative states, depending on individual stress-coping mechanisms, and provide again more evidence for the importance of social interactions as a mediator for these effects. As COVID-19 does not only lead to more stress, it also leads to less social interactions, so it makes sense that there is an increased demand for games with social components, which also might lead to a more regulated stress-response. In other words, we might not just relax with games that are specifically made for relaxation purposes.",

However, it can be argued that the possibilities provided are relevant research topics that are worthwhile to investigate. In fact, one of the biggest findings is the lack of clarity regarding the results. On the one hand, it is still perfectly reasonable to believe that video games have an important role in relieving COVID-19-related stress, while on the other hand there seems to be a gap between theoretical assumptions and actual player behaviour that needs to be filled by experimental studies.

As no randomization was possible and a quasi-experimental design was chosen, it might be the case that a naturally lower statistical power could have influenced the reported results. Measures like the reported effect size of the overall ADPP increase must be interpreted with caution, as these could behave differently (and often more conservative) than the respective measures for parametric tests. The limited sample size also limits the probability of revealing very small effect sizes that still could be relevant for data containing video game players all over the world. To have a more precise picture of the discussed effect, a large-scale experimental study would be appropriate, although the informational gain might not be worth the effort. Another characteristic of this study is the restriction to Steam and to a certain player base. Steam is only a part of the whole video game industry and does not reflect players on consoles or mobile devices. Because relaxing games were limited in ADPPs and controls were matched, most of the most popular games with hundreds of thousands of daily players had to be excluded. As a result, this study provides insights about a specific type of game and may not be generalizable for other platforms. It also does not reflect types of players, which could also be an interesting target for further examination. Rather, this study explores the effect of game characteristics and has limited implications for overall player behaviour, as observations were games and not individual players. Methodological limitations are however a consequence of this data-driven approach, which is essential to make sense of the theoretical assumptions that are more and more emerging. These issues can only be solved by conducting even more empirical studies, in the best case experimental studies, to really inform about how well certain theories translate to the real world. Because the games were categorized into fixed groups with considerable in-group variance, it becomes also apparent that game research is in need of more work towards game aspect classification. For example, relaxation could be seen as a continuous dimension, representing players' perceived value of having a relaxing experience with a game, which would open the door to new analysis tools, such as linear regression models. Before this is possible, obtainable and valid measures need to be established to turn game characteristics into valid constructs for experimental data analysis. The present study provides an example of how to form controlled and distinct groups that can be compared, which gives more insight into differences and similarities, but is restricted to the nature of the groups.",

Instead, the results should be interpreted in regards to their informational value when it comes to the gaps that are currently present within this field. More data-driven approaches should be applied to address these gaps and connect the various theories with actual gaming practices. ",
