            "text": "Thermography is described as 'a scanning technique which gives a photographic display of the temperature differences of the surface of the body'. 1 Human health is strongly correlated with body and tissue temperature, which is within a narrowly defined range in healthy individuals under standardised environmental conditions, so deviations may indicate pathological processes, physical abnormalities or defects. The infrared radiation emitted by the surface of the body allows a measurement within a specific wavelength by an infrared detector. 2 Hence, thermography was considered a promising new imaging technology in the 1970s, but subsequently disappeared due to immature technology and misinformation. 3 Thanks to the immense technical development since then, thermography today has continuously expanded its range of application and, though not as an imaging technique, has recently proven its practicability in the mass use for temperature measurements in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 However, the possible applications go far beyond the simple measurement of body temperature. Deviations in surface temperature can have many causes, such as inflammation, malignancies and infections. Here, thermography offers a non-invasive imaging option that could complement and expand the spectrum of Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The planning and conduction of this scoping review follows the recognised standards of the Joanna Briggs Institute. \u25ba The final results of this scoping review will be reported according to the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews'. \u25ba Given the expected volume of literature and the independence of the outcomes of this scoping review from the size of the included studies, a minimum sample size of 25 individuals per group studied was established. \u25ba Due to the nature of a scoping review, no formal quality assessments of included studies and thus no recommendations for specific areas of application can be made.",

            "text": "Open access medical imaging, even in areas that otherwise or previously could not be imaged or could only be inadequately imaged, for example, Raynaud's phenomenon, gout and arthritis. 2 Moreover, thermography could at least in part, replace or supplement radiation-based methods or those requiring a great deal of costly technical equipment or specific expertise. 2 Thermography opens up many new possibilities in preventive diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, in diabetic complications or rheumatic diseases. 5 6 The expanding capabilities of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning open up unprecedented sophisticated application possibilities for technologies such as thermography, where large amounts of digital data are generated during each examination, far exceeding the capacities of any analysis by the examiner. 7 The medical scientific interest in thermography is constantly growing, as can be seen from the increasing number of published articles. The number of systematic reviews on this topic is also steadily increasing. In November 2021, 39 protocols of ongoing reviews were found in the PROSPERO database with the keyword 'thermography'; investigating the use for breast cancer screening, temporomandibular disorders, diabetic foot, Raynaud's phenomenon, body or skin temperature measurement, vascular diseases, musculoskeletal injuries, breast reconstructive surgery, ischaemia in scleroderma, pulp vitality and auxiliary diagnosis in dentistry, back and neck syndromes, diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa, facial paralysis, diabetic complications, spinal cord injury, outcome assessment in striae treatment, burns healing, detecting tendinopathy or risk of tendon injury, osteomioarticular overload, orofacial pain, pain in Parkinson's disease, early detection of pressure ulcers, delayed-onset muscle soreness, skin temperature following total knee arthroplasty, orthopaedic and bone or joint trauma and finally thermography for the non-invasive-assessment of microvascular structure and function in cardiovascular disease. 8 This breadth of application also supports the development of the use of artificial intelligence described above, and so some specific use cases have already been developed, such as diagnosis of skin cancer and breast cancer screening. 9 10 The number of articles published annually also shows that thermography is widely researched. A computerassisted literature survey of publications on thermography in 2017 listed 1038 articles in Scopus and Embase, and an additional 15 notes or abstracts in 'Thermology international', the organ of five international thermography associations. 11 The medical fields to which the most publications could be attributed were surgery, physiology and endocrinology, cancer, radiology and nuclear medicine and pathology and forensic science. In 2020, the literature survey of the thermography associations focused on applications related to the COVID-19 pandemic and identified 149 articles that reported temperature measurements for fever screening or preventive measures. 4 In some application areas, such as the contactless measurement of body temperature, thermography is already state-of-the-art. However, in many other areas, it is still considered an outsider method. For a breakthrough with regard to a broad application in the entire medical field, a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of the current state of knowledge and development is still missing. But the latter is indispensable for further development and acceptance of this examination method. Technological progress both in terms of thermographic devices and in terms of possible subsequent image processing and evaluation by artificial intelligence opens up great opportunities and possibilities for a wide-ranging use of this non-invasive methodology in the medical-diagnostic field. Therefore, a structured survey for a deeper understanding of the current meaning of thermography and the state-ofthe-art is necessary to identify targeted research areas that will advance the use of this promising technology will be done.",
