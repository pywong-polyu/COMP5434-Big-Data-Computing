This remains true considering both social factors and depression, despite a well-established link between these factors outside of nature exposure studies [23] . For example, a diverse range of social factors, such as social support, social networks and social connectedness, have been associated with depression risk [24] [25] [26] . In many cases, such social health benefits may be at least partially obtained within people's neighborhoods [27] , and neighborhood and community social factors have been previously associated with depression risk [28, 29] . Despite these findings, results remain mixed regarding neighborhood social factors in nature exposure-depression studies [17, 30, 31] . For instance, Cox and colleagues found evidence of both increased social cohesion and reduced depression with increasing nearby nature exposure [17] , while others found social factors played a very minor role in the nature exposure-depression relationship [30] . These mixed results and the disproportionately low focus on social health outcomes and factors in urban nature exposure studies, necessitates further research into the relationships among urban nature exposure, social factors and depression.",

The amount of nature exposure can be quantified by considering its duration, frequency and intensity. For instance, Shanahan and colleagues (2016) used a nature-dose framework that included each of these three aspects to examine the amount of nature exposure in relation to depression among other health outcomes [18] . Despite examples such as this, most observational studies examining depression risk commonly use metrics that primarily characterize the intensity of urban nature exposure such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [30, 32] , tree canopy cover [33] or the ratio of greenspace within a buffer [19] . Metrics such as these can easily quantify greenness over large sample areas using remote sensing methods and are, therefore, often employed in urban nature-depression risk studies. However, these metrics derived from remote sensing methods can only measure the intensity of urban nature exposure. The other two aspects concerning nature exposure amount (i.e., duration and frequency) have been less extensively studied and have mixed results regarding depression risk [11, 18] .",

Urban nature exposure characteristics include, for example, types of nature-based activities and the intentionality (i.e., incidental vs. purposeful) of nature exposure [20] . One such purposeful nature-based activity is gardening. Favorable associations have been found not only between gardening activities and depression itself [34] , but also factors related to depression risk such as stress [35] and social cohesion or interaction [36] . However, most studies that examine the relationship between gardening and depression either specifically target groups of gardeners [34, 36] or specifically vulnerable groups of society, such as those already diagnosed with depression or other mental health disorders [37] [38] [39] , people with disabilities [40, 41] , refugees [42] or the elderly [43, 44] . Often, studies involve interventions, such as horticultural therapy, that have defined treatment goals and are specifically designed to treat people with depression or other health issues [35, [37] [38] [39] 44, 45] . This is not the same as 'typical' gardening, which involves gardening in or around one's own home or in community or allotment gardens, usually without the structure of guided activities or intentional therapy. To our knowledge, few cross-sectional studies have examined the relationship between gardening behavior and depression risk in a general urban population (but see e.g., [43] with a focus on allotment gardeners and [40] that focuses on people with disabilities but does not preferentially target gardeners).",

This is because sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors often relate more strongly to health than nature exposure, for instance green space availability [46] . For example, age has long been a well-accepted risk factor for depression due to the cumulative effects of other health issues attributed to aging [47] . However, the relationship between other sociocultural factors, such as migration history and depression risk, is less clear. There are many potential stressors, such as language barriers, reduced social networks and loss of previous profession or social status, associated with migration that could lead to mental health issues such as depression [48] . While not unanimous, some studies have found migrants and those with a family migration history are at greater risk of depression than their nonmigrant counterparts [49] [50] [51] . Additionally, studies examining the relationship between specifically generational migration history and depression risk have yielded mixed results [50, 51] . For example, some studies found first-generation migrants have a greater depression risk compared to second-generation migrants and non-migrants [50] , while others found second-generation migrants are more at risk of depression than first-generation migrants [51] . Furthermore, despite possible benefits of urban nature exposure for people with a migration history [42, 52, 53] and garden-based intervention projects targeted towards migrant populations [53] , there are a lack of studies examining generational migration history and its association with nature exposure in the general urban population.",

Stuttgart is Germany's sixth largest city with over 609,000 residents and a population density of 3067 residents per square kilometer [54] . Approximately 45% of these residents have a migration history [54] . To target the general urban population of Stuttgart, we distributed our questionnaire into postboxes of residents and by approaching pedestrians in two neighborhoods. Printed media rather than online techniques were used to include many different people, for example those with lower German or English comprehension skills or those without easy internet access. Additionally, selected neighborhoods in Stuttgart had slightly higher proportions of self-migrants (both 33%) than the average for Stuttgart (25%) [54] . With this higher migrant population, we aimed to capture a more representative sample of Stuttgart residents, as residents with a migration history are often under-represented in general population surveys [55] . Questionnaires were distributed to pedestrians on both weekdays and weekends covering the 12 h period from 8 am to 8 pm. When pedestrians were approached, the applicable COVID-19 hygiene regulations were followed by trained staff (i.e., minimum two-meter distance, masks, regular sanitation of hands and equipment). In total 364 questionnaires were returned, the majority (84%) of which were from pedestrians with a 56% acceptance rate.",

Following standard procedure, responses to the WHO-5 were summed and multiplied by four to calculate a score out of 100.

Next, to consider both urban nature exposure variables together in addition to sociocultural factors that may influence this relationship, a multivariate logistic regression model with depression risk as the response was created. As some predictor variables had more than two levels, generalized variance inflation factors (GVIF) adjusted for degree of freedom were calculated, and a threshold of adjusted GVIF <2 used to assess and avoid multicollinearity. The best fit model was selected using the calculated Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as guidance and included five predictor variables: gardening behavior, greenspace visit frequency, neighborhood socialization frequency, migration history and age. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were then calculated and plotted using this best fit logistic regression model. To examine the bivariate relationships between migration history and urban nature exposure and social interaction individually, Pearson's Chi-squared tests were conducted and bivariate mosaic plots visually examined to assess the directionality of these relationships. Cramer's V was then calculated to estimate effect sizes for the significant associations indicated by the Chi-squared tests. Finally, a stratified analysis according to migration history examining the significance of associations between gardening behavior and depression risk was also conducted for additional background information; the estimated p-values resulting from these Fisher's Exact Tests are presented in Table A2 .

Different to our cross-sectional study, many of these are intervention studies that explore the effectiveness of horticultural therapy on at-risk populations, such as the elderly or those with pre-existing mental health disorders [37, 39, 44] . For example, a study conducted on clinically depressed participants found horticultural therapy significantly lowered depression scores and this improvement was maintained three months after the intervention [39] .

Interestingly, educational background may also affect motivations to garden, as a recent study found that participants with less formal education were more likely to garden for recreational and health reasons and spent twice as long gardening per week as those with more formal education [64] . This is important to consider within the context of our study because, while we did not include educational background in our final multivariate model, the majority of our sample population attended university, which may have affected our results. Nevertheless, the results of our study support the idea that 'general' gardening, outside of any professional therapeutic context, may have a therapeutic or protective effect, as being a gardener was associated with decreased odds of being at risk of depression. However, the cross-sectional design of this study does not allow for the establishment of causation. Therefore, it is also possible that those at risk of depression are less likely to garden. This is feasible, as neglecting interests and hobbies is often a symptom of depression [65] .",

One notable exception conducted by Wood and colleagues (2016) found gardeners experienced significantly less depression than non-gardeners [34] . However, it should be noted that this study specifically targeted allotment gardeners and not other types of gardeners, nor the general public and was part of a larger case-control study. Nonetheless, our results are in line with those from Wood and colleagues (2016) in addition to other crosssectional studies that examined gardening behavior and health outcomes that encompass depression, such as mental health [36] and well-being [66, 67] . While mental health and well-being are not the same as depression risk per se, questionnaires used to assess these health outcomes often include depression or symptoms of depression as an aspect within their assessment [68, 69] . It should be noted that we relied upon responses to the WHO-5 to assess depression risk and did not ask if participants were medically diagnosed with depression. However, as many people with depression are likely undiagnosed [70, 71] and the WHO-5 has sufficiently high sensitivity to be used as a valid screening tool for depression [59] , we believe this was an effective method to determine depression risk.",

However, many of these studies used greenspace metrics that quantify the intensity of nature exposure amount rather than its other dimensions, such as duration or frequency [19, 30, 32, 33] . Studies that examined specifically frequency of urban nature exposure and depression have yielded mixed results [11, 18] . For example, Cox and colleagues (2018) found that frequent greenspace visits in urbanized populations was associated with a reduction in depression [11] , while another study indicated that duration of greenspace visits but not frequency was associated with lower rates of depression [18] . As our results indicated only a marginally significant association between greenspace visit frequency and depression risk, it is possible that duration or intensity of exposure may have provided more insight concerning the amount of urban nature exposure and depression risk for our sample.",

Although the beneficial relationship between positive social factors and depression is well-established outside of urban nature studies and are often considered to be potential mediators in the relationship between nature exposure and depression, studies have yielded mixed results [17, 23, 31] . One potential reason that socialization frequency was not associated with depression risk in our study could be attributed to the selection of our social variable -frequency of socialization with neighbors. We specifically focused on a neighborhood social factor because neighborhood and community social factors, such as social cohesion, have been previously associated with depression [28, 73] . However, inconsistent results regarding neighborhood social factors and depression risk have also been reported [74] and it is possible that our focus was too narrow to adequately represent social interaction in a way that would significantly affect depression risk in our sample. Additionally, while we focused on the frequency of social interaction with neighbors, results from some studies suggest that quality of social interactions, rather than quantity, is more protective of depression risk [26, 75] . In this context, it should also be noted that the study at hand was conducted in the summer and early autumn of 2020 within the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, social interactions with neighbors, for example while gardening in yards or on balconies, may have been a primary source of social contact when other social situations were still limited. However, insights into possible behavior shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic are just beginning to be explored, and participants may have had reduced social contacts during this time or even associated negative emotions with social interaction due to fear of infection [76] , despite low infection rates during this phase of the pandemic in the study area [77].",

Our results are contrary to some studies that have found first-generation migrants have a greater depression risk than second-generation or non-migrants [50] . Indeed, there are potential stressors such as language barriers, reduced social networks and loss of previous profession or social status associated with migration that could lead to mental health issues, such as depression [48] . However, there are also factors that may have negative health consequences for specifically second-generation migrants, for example, experiencing emotional conflicts between their familial culture and the culture of their birth country (see e.g., [51] ). In support of this, and similar to the results of our own study, Ruiz-Castell and colleagues (2017) found that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was highest in second-generation migrants, followed by first-generation migrants and then non-migrants [51] . Additionally, first-generation migrants may sometimes experience a health boost, but then this health benefit tends to decrease the longer the migrant is in the new country and second-generation migrants typically have a worse health status than first-generation migrants [78] .",

No significant associations in relation to migration history and greenspace visit frequency nor frequency of socialization with neighbors were indicated. However, our results did reveal a significant association between migration history and gardening behavior with a small to medium estimated effect size. Visual assessment of this plotted relationship suggested that a smaller proportion of participants with a migration history were gardeners compared with non-gardeners. Although we did not examine motivations behind gardening behavior, there are several factors that could contribute to the negative association between migration history and gardening behavior. For example, it is possible that people with a migration history are less likely to have time or space at home to garden and may not live near or be informed about community gardens. A study targeting Mexican women who migrated to the USA found they performed fewer gardening activities than women from their home state in Mexico. They cited being less confident and knowledgeable about gardening and a lack of adequate space as reasons for not gardening in their new country of residence [79] . While the context of this study differs from the one at hand, it is possible that these factors may also contribute the relationship between migration history and gardening behavior seen here.",

            "text": "There are several notable strengths of this study. First, we considered understudied aspects of urban nature exposure amount and characteristics in relation to depression risk. Many previous cross-sectional studies focused primarily on the intensity of urban nature exposure [19, 30, 32, 33] , rather than other aspects of nature exposure characteristics or amount. By using 'gardening behavior' and 'greenspace visit frequency' as exposure metrics, the results of this study provide a unique insight into the relationship between urban nature exposure and depression risk. Additionally, this is one of few studies that has examined the relationship between gardening behavior and depression risk in a general urban population. While mental health benefits of targeted gardening programs, such as horticultural therapy, are extensively studied [37] [38] [39] 41, 44] , there are few studies examining gardening behavior and depression risk more generally. In the few cross-sectional studies that have examined, this relationship differs from ours, as they targeted populations with disabilities [40] , specific groups of gardeners [34] , or did not examine depression risk per se but rather mental health or well-being more generally [36, 66] . Finally, studies examining aspects of gardening behavior and migration history are diverse and include research on potential benefits of gardening for people with a migration history [42, 80] , attitudes towards gardening [79] , effects of gardening intervention projects [42, 53] and even species composition of gardens in relation to migration history [64] . To our knowledge, however, we are among the first studies that examined if migration history is associated with gardening behavior in a general urban population. Based on our initial insights, the relationship between migration history and urban nature exposure, including gardening behavior, could be addressed in even more detail in future studies.",

            "text": "There are also several limitations to this study. First, this study's cross-sectional design only provides a snapshot of the actual situation and does not allow for causal inference. Another potential limitation is that we only included a limited number of predictor variables in the multivariate model due to the sample size. Additionally, some predictor variables, such as neighborhood socialization frequency and greenspace visit frequency, were restructured to have two levels, which likely led to the loss of some statistical variance but allowed more predictor variables to be included in the multivariate model. While this helped ensure the reliability of the model by avoiding overfitting, including predictor variables with more levels as well as additional predictor variables would have allowed for a more fully adjusted model, potentially offering more insight. Including more predictors describing socioeconomic status would have been particularly relevant, as socioeconomic status may be associated with the amount of time and space (at home) available to urban residents for gardening. It should also be noted that although educational background, one indicator of socioeconomic status, was not included in the multivariate model, the majority of our sample was university educated, which could be a potential source of bias in this study. Additionally, while we did consider greenspace visit frequency as an understudied urban nature exposure metric, we did not consider the motivation behind greenspace visits (i.e., purposeful versus incidental visits). Future studies could include the characteristic of intentionality of greenspace visits in combination with frequency for a more robust consideration of this aspect of urban nature exposure. Furthermore, while we included a social factor in our analyses, we did not conduct a formal mediation analysis among urban nature exposure, neighborhood social interaction and depression risk. Therefore, although our results offer insight into individual aspects of this relationship, this pathway was not examined in its entirety. Finally, we also recognize the rather large errors for migration history in the logistic regression model and resulting odds ratios. This suggests high within-group variation that could be attributed to the fact that we only differentiated between generational migration history (i.e., self-migration history versus family migration history) despite migration being a broad term that includes people of many distinct backgrounds with diverse experiences. Future studies should consider more specific aspects of migration history to better understand its role in the relationship between urban nature exposure and depression risk.",

            "text": "In an urbanizing world, nature exposure is decreasing whilst the prevalence of mental health disorders, such as depression, is increasing. Depression is the most prevalent mental health disorder in Europe, and as many people with depression are left untreated or even undiagnosed [70, 71, 81] , a better understanding of urban nature exposure-depression risk relationships could contribute towards large mental health benefits. Three main pathways-mitigation, restoration and instoration-have been proposed to describe how urban nature exposure may affect mental health [20] [21] [22] . While there is a growing evidence base supporting these pathways, disproportionately few studies have examined aspects related to the instoration pathway concerning urban nature exposure, social factors and depression risk. Additionally, although urban nature exposure is complex in itself, most studies focus primarily on the intensity of nature exposure in relation to depression risk. Therefore, in a cross-sectional study targeting a general urban population we examined the relationship between understudied aspects of urban nature exposure and depression risk while also considering sociocultural factors. Our results indicated that being a gardener was associated with decreased odds of being at risk of depression and that gardening behavior and depression risk varied according to generational migration history. While our results are not causal, they support the idea that to help ensure healthier cities, public initiatives that enable gardening for all citizens, including people across diverse backgrounds and those without private garden access, should be supported. The results of this study further highlight the importance of considering both people's sociocultural backgrounds and urban nature exposure in more detail to help plan for and support healthier cities in the future.",
