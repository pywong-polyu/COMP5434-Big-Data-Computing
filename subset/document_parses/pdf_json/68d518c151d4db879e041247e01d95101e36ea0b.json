The present study makes an initial attempt at, and provides a model for, understanding the pandemic's influence on Trump support. The study employed a mixed experimental and correlational design and surveyed separate samples of adults (N = 1,763) in six waves beginning March 23, 2020 and ending June 1, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to report their Trump support either before or after being reminded of the pandemic with a series of questions gauging their level of concern about it. Results revealed complex and dynamic effects that changed over time. Depending on survey wave, the pandemic seems to have lowered Trump support among Democrats, while (marginally) raising it among independents. Republicans' reactions also changed over time; of particular note, Republicans who were more concerned about the pandemic reported higher Trump support after being reminded of the pandemic in its early stages, but this effect reversed by the time the economy began reopening (coinciding with a dip in Trump's approval ratings). Although the correlational results in the present study did not converge neatly with the experimental results, the combined experimental and correlational approach has the potential to increase researchers' confidence in the causal effects of salient national and international events on political attitudes.",

Social science theories can be used to generate multiple (conflicting) predictions about this, and although the 2020 U.S. presidential election results are known, it is not clear what, if any, role the pandemic played in Trump's defeat, and there is evidence to support both a negative effect of the pandemic on Trump support [1] , and a positive one [2] prior to the election. The present study provides additional data that social scientists might use to help understand, retrospectively, the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on Trump support among the US electorate, and prospectively, the potential effects of future disasters on major elections.

Such a crisis, with its startling death toll, would likely represent a massive ongoing mortality salience induction, creating widespread death anxiety. According to terror management theory (e.g., [3] ), this would tend to increase defensive political polarization. Existential fears lead people to seek refuge in their beliefs and attitudes about the world, which provide a comforting sense of meaning and understanding, order, structure, predictability, and control [3, 4] . In other words, existential concerns lead people to cling more tenaciously to assuaging worldviews. In this case, one would expect the pandemic to increase conservatives' Trump support, while decreasing liberals' Trump support.",

For example, some evidence suggests that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. and the ensuing precarious national security climate could have bolstered support for incumbent George W. Bush's reelection [7, 8] . The conservative shift phenomenon is also consistent with some theorizing about the psychological roots of political conservatism; for example, conservatives' emphasis on robust domestic law enforcement and national security matches well with beliefs that the world is a fundamentally dangerous and unruly place [9] . According to this logic, the unsettling long-term disruptive effect of a pandemic might be expected to cause a bump in Trump support across the political spectrum, as people gravitate toward the perceived comfort of a continuation of stable governance, especially when led by a president whose party (and personality) are associated with strength, law, and order.",

Immediately prior to the 2012 U.S. presidential election, the massive tropical cyclone \"Sandy\" made landfall, causing much speculation as to its effect on the election results. Some data suggest that in the early aftermath of the stormwhen media reports showed Obama exhibiting leadership of the disaster recovery efforts, including a highly publicized collaboration with New Jersey's Republican Governor Chris Christie-Obama received increased support, especially among conservatives [11] . This could reflect the rallying of some parts of the electorate around the incumbent during a time of uncertainty, and it is also consistent with an attentive electorate explanation. However, by election day, when news reports increasingly featured the devastating consequences of the storm, voters for whom it was salient expressed lowered support for Obama [11] , suggesting that, in a sense, he was being blamed for the fallout, consistent with a conservative shift phenomenon or \"blind retrospective\" voting.",

Indeed, Heersink et al. found evidence for this both in historical data and in their analysis of responses to support for Obama after Sandy. Specifically, Sandy appeared to have hurt Obama's standing among voters in counties that were initially disposed against him, but not in Obama-friendly counties.

This phenomenon has already been found to apply to information regarding COVID-19, which became a politically polarized issue relatively early in the pandemic, influenced in part by messaging by political leaders [16] .

To account for potential changes over time, the study included 6 separate, brief surveys of~300 US residents each. The first 5 surveys were spaced one week apart starting just days after the commencement of widespread \"lockdowns\" in the US. The final survey occurred 6 weeks after the end of the first series, when the nation had begun reopening the economy. Because it is impossible to conduct a true experiment (i.e., one cannot randomly assign people to a universe without the pandemic), my analytic approach follows the mixed experimental and correlational design suggested by Hart [11] . Participants were asked about their concern and exposure to media about the pandemic, along with their support for President Trump. Correlating concern and exposure to Trump support provides one way of assessing a possible effect. However, the order of the topics was counterbalanced, so that approximately half the participants were effectively primed with pandemic awareness prior to reporting their Trump support. (The correlational results in this study suggest that answering pandemic questions first did not affect the correlation between pandemic concern and Trump support, and there was no main effect of priming condition on pandemic concern.) This provides a more rigorous test of the causal effect. If the experimental and correlational findings converge, it increases confidence that there is an actual causal effect.",

In the early stages of the pandemic lockdowns, concerned and attentive Republicans for whom it was salient reported elevated Trump support, but by the June 1 reopening, that tendency had reversed, perhaps due to disapproval with Trump's handling of the pandemic over time (and potentially compounded by another salient national event, the police killing of Minnesota resident George Floyd and subsequent widespread protests). On June 1, approval of Trump's handling of the pandemic response was considerably lower than during the first five weeks of the study in late March and early-mid April (e.g., according to Fivethirtyeight.com, the net approval rating was -10.5 on June 1, compared with an average of +.82 on the other 5 days of the study), when he was suggesting that the country might return to normal by the Easter holiday. Overall, it appears that the pandemic initially caused a \"rally 'round the flag\" or worldview defense/partisan retrospection effect (or both) among Republicans, but that widespread criticism of Trump's performance might have reversed these effects by June 1, consistent with an attentive electorate model.",

It may be that when they are actively thinking about the pandemic, they \"rally 'round the flag,\" or shift to more conservative views. It is not clear why those tendencies would be opposite when simply correlating pandemic concern with Trump support. It could be that there is a third variable at play-for example, concerned individuals might represent a different \"type\" independent, or perhaps they are more generally anxious.

There was again no effect on April 6, but on April 13, pandemic priming actually increased Trump support F(1, 64) = 4.00, p = .05, \u03b7 p 2 = .059 (M = 2.61, SD = 1.73 vs. M = 3.58, SD = 2.03). There was again no effect on April 20. There was no significant effect in the June 1 \"reopening\" survey, but there was a noticeable trend consistent with the positive effect of pandemic priming observed on April 13, F(1, 66) = 1.78, p = .19, \u03b7 p 2 = .026 (M = 2.86, SD = 1.89 vs. M = 3.50, SD = 2.02).",
