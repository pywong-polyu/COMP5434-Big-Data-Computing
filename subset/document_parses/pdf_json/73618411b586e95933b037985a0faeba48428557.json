It can occur unilaterally or bilaterally. In unilateral cases, the right side is more affected. The prevalence rate of microtia ranges from 0.83 to 17.4 per 10,000 [1] . In the ENT outpatient clinic, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital, Jakarta, there were 207 microtia ears in 2008-2014, and 173 ears underwent surgery in the patients aged from 6 to 12 years of age. Between 2017 and 2018, there were 32 new microtia cases, aged between 1 month and 14 years. Male babies have been more frequently affected than female babies (2:1).",

Microtia surgery has been proved to lower psychological stressors which may impact the mental development of children with microtia [2] . Hearing habilitation for infants and children with microtia who are still in developing age should be performed without waiting for reconstructive surgery. One of the options for microtia hearing habilitation that is commonly used in Indonesia is the installation of bone conduction hearing aid. However, this method is ineffective due to several obstacles such as the difficulty in obtaining the correct hearing aid input, transducer pressure (which makes it unstable on bones), the occurrence of skin laceration due to transducer pressure, and its higher cost than air conductive hearing aids. Another option is the installation of a bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA), which is even more expensive and requires surgery. In addition, complications can also occur after the BAHA implantation surgery [3] [4] [5] .",

            "text": "When children become old enough to undergo ear reconstruction surgery, hearing habilitation can be assisted by performing atresiaplasty. Hearing improvement becomes one of valuable outcomes of microtia reconstruction surgery [2] . About 64% patients gain significant hearing improvement after atresiaplasty. This result remained stable for up to three years post-surgery. Most patients who did not develop their hearing function had a severe degree of microtia. Severe malformed middle ear and stenosis of the ear canal are associated with a negative impact on auditory development [2, 6] . However, atresiaplasty is also often a dilemma since it can result in restenosis of the ear canal. Ear canal restenosis is caused by circumference wounds (360 \u2022 ) that can cause contractures as well as fibrosis of the soft tissue around the wound. These factors cause the amplification effort to be hampered so that the patient still has hearing problems after the reconstruction procedure [7] .",

            "text": "Hearing amplification technology development is needed to overcome these obstacles, especially for infants and children. Cartilage conduction hearing aid (CCHA) developed by Hosoi and colleagues provides new hope and can be an alternative option for overcoming hearing amplification problems in microtia cases [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Cartilage conduction is a newly suggested transduction form whose characteristics are different from air and bone conductions. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] CCHA has several advantages such as sound clarity, sound localization, and more stable connection between the transducer and the cartilage surface [20] [21] [22] . The transducer can be attached to the cartilage part in humans via a special double-sided tape. As previous studies stated [12, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , CCHA can be used for sound transmission even in aural atresia. Most issues with bone conduction (BC) hearing aids are related to the properties of the transducer and the form of conduction. For cartilage conduction (CC), the transducer is designed to vibrate the aural cartilage rather than the skull bone; therefore, it is small and lightweight. By inserting the transducer into the cavity of the concha, a headband is not needed for fixation. It is held in place by the combination of its own weight and the stiffness of the concha cartilage. In addition to its cosmetic advantages, the fixation of a CC transducer is more comfortable and convenient than that of a BC transducer [12] . This alternative conduction method may solve the issues related to BC hearing aids.",

The transducers were placed on the tragal area which consist mostly of cartilage. CCHA adjustments was performed based on functional gains. Unaided and aided thresholds were measured in the same day by sound field test, and functional gains were obtained. Speech audiometry assessments were also performed by calculating speech recognition threshold (SRT) and speech discrimination score (SDS). The intensity level at which the patient could correctly repeat 50% of spondee words (single words which comprise two syllables with equal emphasis placed on each syllable) was measured and defined as SRT. The SRTs should correspond roughly to the average pure tone audiometry thresholds at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz.

It should be explained that the results of behavioral audiometry in patient one are inconsistent during the three months of the examination sessions. The patient's emotions during examination sessions were unstable. The same condition also happened to patients four and five, who were not cooperative. However, at the last session, the behavioral audiometry was successfully conducted in patient four, as the results were reliable.

For unilateral fitting cases, the largest functional gain was 46.25 dB observed in the left ear of patient nine. A statistical test was performed to evaluate the outcome significance. Firstly, a Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to evaluate data normality for subjects with less than 50 samples. As the P value is higher than 0.05, data distribution was normal and mean and standard deviation were used to present the data. Secondly, parametric statistical test was performed. Based on the paired T-test, mean difference of functional gain obtained was 26.9 \u00b1 2.3 dB (95% CI). It was concluded that there is a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) in the average hearing threshold between unaided and aided conditions. (Table 3) .

They reported that microtia and aural atresia patients aged 8-10 years (boy) and 11-13 years (girl) had a high incidence of social problems in the form of interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, and hostility. This also occurred in the microtia and aural atresia patients in our study, which consisted of 6 girls and 4 boys, with an age range of 9-19 years, so that only 6 patients could undergo pure tone audiometry. As an alternative procedure, behavioral audiometry was performed for 8 patients (12 ears), while 2 other patients, aged 10 and 9 years, were still unable to undergo behavioral audiometry. In these two patients, bone conduction ABR, allowing the identification of the type and the degree of conduction hearing loss, was performed to assess the cochlear integrity [29] . Due to psychosocial problems, the two subjects could not complete another audiological test session. However, the parents of both subjects still wanted to participate in the installation of the CCHA, and both subjects felt better subjectively after using CCHA.",

Unfortunately, the ear canal was substantially absent in the atretic ears, and these measurements cannot exactly reflect the signal transmission to the cochlea. Technological developments in objectively evaluating the performance in the atretic ears are necessary since a suitable candidate for CCHA is a patient with aural atresia. Subject parents reported that the CCHA unit was very light, relatively small in size, and that it therefore looks better cosmetically. Most of the subjects used double-sided tape for fixation of transducers and hearing aid units; only two subjects could use the ear-chip type transducer. Sound transmission is quite good with the use of double-sided tape and does not cause pressure on the skin attachment. The similar audiometric outcomes have been reported by Nishimura et al. [12] . The style of the transducer fixation using double-sided tapes and the type of aural atresia had no significant influence on the functional gains [12] .",
