In the three-tiered CMS hierarchy, spine surgery was included in tier 2a, along with a recommendation to \"consider postponing surgery\" for \"non-urgent spine\" and \"elective spine\" procedures [8] . Deferring these services conserves beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE), and essential workforce and was therefore a priority for hospitals preparing for or experiencing a surge of patients with COVID-19. Postponing elective surgeries may have minimized additional risk of exposure through social distancing, further protecting patients and healthcare workers. The CMS recommendations outlined several factors that surgeons may consider, including patient risk, availability of beds, staff and equipment, and the urgency of the procedure, but they lacked a clear framework to assist operative decision-making.",

How could we protect the vital medical workforce and ensure the safety of COVID-19-negative patients admitted for urgent-emergent surgery? How could we screen for disease when testing capability lagged testing demand, and how could we safely reintegrate essential staff after a period of quarantine or illness? Every surgery was accompanied by specific anesthetic risks which needed to be mitigated for optimal outcomes. However, unique additional challenges had to be addressed when caring for spine surgery patients during the surge phase of the pandemic. How could pre-operative evaluation and optimization be achieved while respecting social distancing orders? Could we safely use steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 patients?

At the time of writing, we continued to function as a specialty care musculoskeletal treatment center, but between March 17 and June 8, 2020, all elective surgical procedures were postponed. Our new secondary function was to support our partner institutions in New York City by accepting COVID-19 patients, citywide orthopedic trauma patients, and general medical and surgical patients, where such admissions would free capacity at other hospitals and assist broader efforts to redistribute care for COVID-19 patients. This represented a unique care model, but one which could be replicated in other cities as a solution to balancing care for COVID-19 patients with ongoing surgical needs of patients in the community. Where hospital systems lack a dedicated freestanding building, separation of patients by COVID-19 status may be achieved by designating restricted areas within a hospital.",

Early in the pandemic, the risk factor screening focused on recent travel to affected countries and symptoms of concern.

If surgery was indicated, we evaluated risk factors related to the predicted postoperative course and expected requirements for hospital resource consumption. These included ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, anticipated blood loss and probability of transfusion, need for consults from allied medical and pain management services, and length of stay. The appropriateness of a home discharge destination was also considered. If resources were available and/or the patient was deemed low medical risk/at low risk of requiring resources, a secondary assessment of COVID-19 status was performed. This assessment considered the patient's known or suspected status and recognized risk factors for poor outcomes associated with COVID-19 (male gender, age over 65 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary conditions) [2, [27] [28] [29] . If the patient was low risk for testing positive for COVID-19 and for having major complications of COVID-19, surgery was recommended. Conversely, if the patient had complex medical needs with anticipated lengthy post-operative stay, significant resource consumption, and the necessary resources were not guaranteed, delaying surgery was recommended. Patients with known positive status and/or symptoms of COVID-19 required further special consideration. Here, the decision to operate was made according to the risk of delaying surgery versus the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Consensus from the peri-operative team was required. In all cases, a careful discussion was held with the patient to present specific risks of having surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, including nosocomial infection and unpredictable availability of resources. For particularly challenging decisions in COVID-19 patients, we included a consultation from our bioethics and palliative care services, in which goals of care were defined with the patient and family members.",

To balance the risk between anticipated difficult intubation and spread of the virus, we recommend a rapid sequence asleep FOI be performed by the most experienced practitioner available. If the assistance of the ear, nose, throat surgeons is planned for the surgery itself, these personnel should be present during anesthetic induction and intubation. If performed, a single-use, disposable fiberscope is preferred. Where an awake FOI cannot be avoided, the airway should be topicalized, appreciating that transtracheal blocks and delivering local anesthetics via atomizer substantially raise the risk of cough and aerosolization of respiratory droplets. Irrespective of the strategy selected to secure the airway, a closed suction system should be used together with the minimal number of suctions possible to manage airway Although the unanticipated difficult airway is omnipresent irrespective of coronavirus status, preparation for the cannot-intubate-cannot-ventilate scenario should be more extensive, since help is limited and time for additional providers to don PPE may be significant.",

Although the latter technique has advantages for preventing coughing and bucking on emergence from anesthesia, this should be discussed between the anesthesiology and surgical teams and agreed on a case-by-case basis. There can be a significant delay to full neurological examination after deep extubation, and the technique may not be suitable for anterior cervical procedures.

NSAIDs can also cause nephrotoxicity, which is more likely in patients with critical illness, and may be exacerbated by fever and dehydration [30] . Although biologically plausible, at the time of writing, there is no evidence to demonstrate the association between NSAIDs and worse COVID-19 outcomes [15] . Indeed, patients with COVID-19 might benefit from symptomatic relief that NSAIDs can provide. Likewise, patients with spinal pathology which does not meet the criteria for essential surgery may have significant relief of musculoskeletal pain with NSAIDs. Pending further research and evidence to the contrary, a reasonable approach would be to continue NSAID therapy with close monitoring of renal function and low threshold to discontinue medication if COVID-19 symptoms present or worsen during the pre-operative phase.",

Donors should be asked a series of screening questions and subject to a temperature check before donation. In a recent advisory to blood collection establishments, the FDA recommended patients could report a post-donation diagnosis of COVID-19. Blood establishments could also consider tracing and removing blood products collected in the 28 days prior to diagnosis or symptom onset [24] .",

Where possible, it is reasonable to defer surgery to conserve resources, consistent with nationally declared public health goals. At the same time, it should be acknowledged that spine surgery is often not truly elective in nature, and symptoms can progress so that an elective case without prompt intervention becomes urgent or emergent. We propose that decision-making about operative intervention should be made on a case by case basis, accounting for patient status and the risks and benefits of delaying surgery, the availability of resources at the time of the proposed surgery, and the safety of practitioners and patient if surgery is performed. In making these difficult decisions, patient preferences and meticulous post-discharge planning are essential to optimal outcomes.",

Chief among these include the volume of patients whose surgeries were delayed, how many patients are now prepared to present for surgical interventions, the type of and indication for surgery, and how the delay affected disease course and progression. Of particular relevance for spine surgery, the effects of delaying elective surgery on pain and opioid consumption should be quantified and patients who required escalating doses of opioids should be identified. Finally, for patients with COVID-19 who undergo spine surgery, general and spine-specific outcomes should be described.",
