Infrared thermography (IRT) of the thorax might provide a new method of high specificity to select swine affected with lung alterations for further diagnostics. In this study, layer thickness of different tissues was determined in frozen thorax slices (FTS) by computed tomography (CT) and then related to skin temperatures measured by IRT in healthy pigs. The aim was to determine appropriate regions of interest (ROI) for evaluation of IRT images. Organ layer thicknesses measured in CT images correspond to those measured in FTS. Temperature differences between lung ROIs and abdomen ROIs were positively correlated with lung layer thickness at certain localizations, and negatively correlated with the thickness of the thorax wall and of inner organ layers. Reference values of differences between skin temperatures were established for two ROIs on the thorax with potential practical use for lung health status determination.

As a basis for future development of IRT in pigs for the diagnostic of respiratory diseases, most appropriate ROIs for temperature measurements were determined. In future studies, a successful detection of gross pathological lung lesions in pigs by IRT under suitable ambient temperature conditions might be possible (Siewert et al., 2010b) . In general, infrared imaging is a simple and quick method for the measurement of the surface temperature distribution. Measurement results of IR cameras with uncooled microbolometer chips are generally influenced a) by the surrounding temperature, b) by the time interval between power-on and measurement as well as by, c) a time-dependent drift error (Hartmann and Fischer, 2001) . For this reason difference temperatures were measured between two ROIs on the body surface as a practical approach to overcome these technical device errors. A precondition to measure temperature differences between different ROIs is the specification of two anatomical localizations which can be repeatedly found in the IRT image. At these anatomical localizations ROIs can be positioned. Difference imaging eliminates off-set errors which vary between different IRT images.
