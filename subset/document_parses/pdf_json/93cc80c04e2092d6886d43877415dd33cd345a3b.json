To analyze this argument, we must follow up the same participants of the Ivermectin group ( Figure 5 ), who passed from the weekly dose to a monthly dose PO 0.4 mg/kg and were followed for 56 days (8 weeks). During these 56 days, most of the healthcare workers discontinued progressively the Ivermectin on their own will, for nonspecific reason ( Figure 6 ).
