Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 can interact with the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and is able to suppress the LPS-induced production of several inflammatory cytokines that are highly relevant to the prevention of immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

More than 200 countries or regions around the world have reported to have confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number is still in a rapid increase, indicating that this novel coronavirus has posed a severe global health threat. Under the current circumstance of the absence of the specific vaccines and medicines targeting SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to discover effective therapies especially drugs to treat the resulting COVID-19 disease and prevent the virus from further spreading. Considering that the development of a new drug generally takes years, probably the best therapeutic shortcut is to apply the drug repositioning strategy (i.e., finding the new uses of old drugs) [1] [2] [3] to identify the potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 of existing drugs that have been approved for clinical use or to enter clinical trials. Those existing drugs with potent antiviral efficacy can be directly applied to treat COVID-19 in a short time, as their safety has been verified in principle in clinical trials.",

Our in silico screening process followed by experimental validation revealed that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may serve as a potential drug candidate to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays demonstrated that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner and with no obvious cytopathic effect, and the efficacy of CVL218 can be further enhanced by a drug combination with another anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidate favipiravir. In addition, our surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assay indicated that CVL218 can interact with the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with a high affinity. Moreover, we found that in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CVL218 is able to suppress the LPSinduced production of several inflammatory cytokines, which have been reported previously to be of high relevance to the viral pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially for those intensive care unit (ICU) patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the data present in this study and previous known antiviral effects of PARP1 inhibitors reported in the literature, we also discussed several putative mechanisms of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities for CVL218 to be involved in the treatment of COVID-19. Overall, our results indicated that the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 identified by our integrative drug repositioning pipeline may serve as an effective therapeutic agent against COVID-19.",

We first constructed a virus-related knowledge graph consisting of drug-target interactions, protein-protein interactions and similarity networks from publically available databases (Methods). Knowledge graph is a network containing entities (e.g., drugs and targets) and their relations. Three different types of nodes (i.e., drugs, human targets, and virus targets) within the knowledge graph were connected through edges describing their interactions, associations or similarities to establish bridges of information aggregation and knowledge mining. We then applied a network-based knowledge mining algorithm, called CoV-DTI, to predict an initial list of drug candidates that can be potentially used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Fig. 1b and Methods). Next, we further narrowed down the list of drug candidates with the previously reported evidences of antiviral activities based on the text-mining results from the large-scale literature texts, which were derived through a deep learning based relation extraction method named BERE 4 ( Fig. 1c and Methods), followed by a minimum of manual checking. After that, we used the connectivity map analysis approach 5 with the gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infected patients 6, 7 to further refine the list of drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1d and Methods).",

We first performed ten-fold crossvalidation on all virus-related drug-target interactions (DTIs) from our collected data to evaluate the prediction performance of our network-based knowledge mining algorithm CoV-DTI. To mimic a realistic scenario in which the goal is to predict the drug candidates for novel virus targets, we randomly split the virus targets into ten folds and masked the labels of one fold for testing. All the negative samples with unknown DTI labels were used during training when computing the Bayesian personalized ranking loss (Methods). The receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curves and the curves of recall scores with respect to a list of top k drug candidates predicted by our model CoV-DTI and DTINet, 8 our previously developed network-based DTI prediction algorithm which served as a state-of-the-art baseline method, were obtained by averaging the predicted scores from five repeats of ten-fold cross-validation ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Our crossvalidation results showed that CoV-DTI achieved an area under the ROC (AUROC) score of 0.8273, which was 8% higher than that of DTINet. In addition, over 50% of the drugs known to act on a virus target can be accurately predicted by CoV-DTI from the top 200 drug candidates, with a better performance compared to DTINet. All these cross-validation results demonstrated that our computational method CoV-DTI can make reasonably accurate predictions on the reconstructed virus-related knowledge graph.",

For example, chloroquine, an FDAapproved drug for treating malaria, 9 which was previously reported to exhibit micromolar anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro, 10 was also repurposed to target the same virus by CoV-DTI. Gemcitabine, which was originally approved for treating certain types of cancers, 11 was also predicted by CoV-DTI to target SARS-CoV and can be further validated by previous in vitro studies. 12 Cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor approved as an immunomodulatory drug, 13 which was previously observed to block the replication of SARS-CoV, 14 can also be successfully predicted by our approach. Among the top list of predicted drugs against MERS-CoV, miltefosine, which was approved for treating leishmaniasis, 15 had been previously identified to have anti-MERS-CoV activities. 16 Chlorpromazine and imatinib, which were used for treating schizophrenia 17 and leukemia, 18 respectively, were also selected by CoV-DTI as anti-MERS-CoV drugs and can be validated by previous in vitro evidences. 12 Thus, the above retrospective study illustrated that our computational framework is able to predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus.",

We then focused on this drug class and selected those drug candidates with both potential efficacy and acceptable pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles for further investigation. We first noticed that PJ-34 was the most preferred drug derived from our computational framework, as both our network-based knowledge mining algorithm CoV-DTI and connectivity map analysis pointed to this drug (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1 ). After checking the clinical status of PJ-34, we found that it only reached the preclinical trial stage (DrugBank ID: DB08348, 19 ) which may raise the concern about its safety issue and thus limit its timely application for the current clinical usage against COVID-19. Therefore, we compared the molecular characteristics between PJ-34 and other PARP1 inhibitors that had been already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or at least entered the clinical trials (Methods), and found that rucaparib and CVL218 (mefuparib) share the highest similarities with PJ-34. Considering the poor accessibility of rucaparib in the lung tissue (https://www. ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/rubraca), it may be hard to apply this small molecule in treating the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we mainly selected CVL218 to conduct further experiments, and this drug was later validated to exhibit a much better tissue distribution with high concentration in lung (see Supplementary Materials for more details). We also included olaparib, the first FDA-approved PARP1 inhibitor, in our further analyses, as this drug also achieved a high rank in our connectivity map analysis using the transcriptomic data of COVID-19 patients (Table 2) .",

The initial drug set for screening contains 6255 drug candidates, mainly including 1786 approved, 1125 investigational, and 3290 experimental drugs. The number of drug candidates after each filtering step is also shown. Knowledge graph: a network containing entities (e.g., drugs and targets) and their relations. b The network-based knowledge mining module. Seven individual networks containing three types of nodes (i.e., drugs, human targets and virus targets) and the corresponding edges describing their interactions, associations or similarities are first constructed based on the known chemical structures, protein sequences and relations derived from publically available databases. Then a deep learning based method, which learns and updates the feature representation of each node through information aggregation, is used to predict the potential drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. c The automated relation extraction module. The structure of each sentence from the literature texts is first learned from the encoded word features using the Gumbel tree gated recurrent unit technique. 4, 96 Then the learned sequence structures as well as the corresponding encoded word features are fed into a relation classifier to automatically extract the relations between two entities from large-scale documents in the literature. d The connectivity map (CMap) analysis module. The transcriptome profiles of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) or the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from the SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV infected patients and healthy persons are compared to derive the query gene expression signatures, which are then correlated to the drug-perturbed cellular expression profiles in the connectivity map 5 to filter out the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates. For transcriptome data of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, PBMC samples were provided by three patients and three healthy volunteers, and BALF samples were collected from three patients and two healthy volunteers. For transcriptome data of SARS-CoV infected cells, PBMC samples from ten patients and four healthy volunteers were included in our analysis CoV-2 replication. Nevertheless, CVL218 showed a much higher inhibition rate than olaparib. More specifically, olaparib inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication by 15.31% at a concentration of 3.2 \u03bcM, while CVL218 reached 34.64% reduction at a concentration of 3 \u03bcM.",

Remdesivir, which has entered the clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT04257656), was also tested in this assay for comparison. In particular, compared to the DMSO control group, both CVL218 and remdesivir showed potent antiviral activities during the fulltime procedure of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2d ). In addition, this time-of-addition assay indicated that CVL218 can partially work against the viral entry and significantly inhibit the replication of virus post-entry, while the remdesivir can only function at the post-entry stage (Fig. 2d , e). All together, results of the above in vitro assays indicated that CVL218 can be considered a potential therapeutic agent for treating COVID-19.",

We found that, while favipiravir exhibited no inhibitory activity and CVL218 showed an inhibition rate of 36% at the experimental concentrations, the combination of both CVL218 and favipiravir achieved a significantly higher inhibition rate (64%, Fig. 2f ).

In this SPR assay, we also tested another two PARP1 inhibitors, including PJ-34 and olaparib, and two related anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, including remdesivir and arbidol, for their possible binding to SARS-CoV-2-N. As expected, no binding was observed for remdesivir and olaparib (Fig. 3d , e). This result was consistent with the known facts that remdesivir mainly performs its antiviral activity by targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronavirus 25 and arbidol was originally designed to inhibit the virus-host cell fusion against influenza virus. 26, 27 Among all the three tested PARP1 inhibitors, including CVL218, PJ-34 and olaparib, CVL218 exhibited the highest binding strength towards SARS-CoV-2-N with a dissociation constant (K D ) of 3.1 \u03bcM (Fig. 3a) . On the other hand, PJ-34 displayed a much lower binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2-N (K D = 68.1 \u03bcM), which was about 22-fold lower than that of CVL218 (Fig. 3b) . Surprisingly, we observed no binding signal with SARS-CoV-2-N for the PARP1 inhibitor olaparib (Fig. 3c ).

[30] [31] [32] On the one hand, the extra synthesis of cytokines may promote to viral infection. For example, a previous study showed that IL-6 blockage can reduce viral loads and enhance virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in the Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model. 33 In addition, it was previously reported that IL-10 can facilitate West Nile virus (WNV) infection in mice, and its knockout can diminish the WNV infection. 34 On the other hand, the overproduction of cytokines may cause inflammatory injuries to human tissues. For example, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection can promote the upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, and thus lead to airway inflammation and lung immune injuries. 35, 36 Moreover, the excessive synthesis of cytokines was found to be highly related with the deleterious clinical manifestations under the infection conditions of many other viruses, such as tick-borne virus (TBV), 37 influenza A virus (IAV), 38 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 39 These findings indicated that inhibiting the overproduction of cytokines may offer a beneficial strategy to protect against viral infections. 40 Recently, a number of studies on the clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19 patients had shown that several proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and others, are significantly elevated especially in those ICU patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, causing excessive activated immune response. [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] The pathological relevance of these cytokines in SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated that their blockade may alleviate the inflammatory response and thus provide a feasible therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Although the LPS-induced expression of IL-10 was not downregulated by 3 \u03bcM CVL218 treatment after 6 h, it was dramatically reduced after 24 h (p-value < 0.001), indicating that IL-10 may responde to CVL218 treatment in a time-dependent manner (Fig.  4c, d) . Both 3 \u03bcM and 1 \u03bcM CVL218 after 6 h and 24 h of drug treatment led to a significant decrease in the concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 compared to their original expression induced by LPS (p-values < 0.01 for the 3 \u03bcM groups and p-values < 0.05 for the 1 \u03bcM groups, Fig. 4e-h) . In addition, the inhibitory effects of 1 \u03bcM CVL218 were generally weaker than those of 3 \u03bcM CVL218, indicating the dose-dependent inhibition of CVL218 on the LPSinduced expression of cytokines. In comparison, the olaparib treatment at both 3 \u03bcM and 1 \u03bcM exhibited no significant inhibition to the LPS-induced stimulation of all four cytokines. All these results demonstrated that CVL218 can significantly suppress the LPS-induced elevation of cytokines in a dose-and time-dependent manner, and thus provided an in vitro evidence to support CVL218 as a potential therapeutic agent for targeting the proinflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

We showed that the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our integrative framework exhibits effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and thus can be used as a potential drug candidate for treating COVID-19. We also validated that CVL218 can interact with the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that CVL218 may inhibit viral replication mainly through acting on the N protein and thus impeding its normal functions. To our best knowledge, this is the first antiviral drug candidate proposed to target the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, which thus may provide a novel mechanistic solution to the treatments of COVID-19. Benefited from the distinct antiviral mechanism of CVL218 compared to other drug candidates targeting at COVID-19, we proposed that the efficacy of CVL218 against SARS-CoV-2 infection can be enhanced by combinatorial usage with other drug candidates, and experimentally validated the drug combination effect between CVL218 and favipiravir.",

            "text": "Based on the data present in this study and the previously known evidences about the antiviral effects of PARP1 inhibitors reported in the literature, we propose several potential mechanisms to support the involvement of the CVL218 in the treatment of COVID-19 (Fig. 5) . First, it has been known that, during the life cycle of the coronavirus, PARP1 inhibitors may inhibit the viral growth through suppressing viral replication and impeding the binding of the nucleocapsid protein to viral RNAs, 47-50 which can also be supported by our SPR assay results. Second, PARP1 inhibitors have been previously reported to play a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response by modulating the expression of proinflammatory factors such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and downstream cytokines and chemokines. [51] [52] [53] [54] Also, it has been shown that the overactivation of PARP1 promotes energy (NAD + / ATP) consumption and drives cell death, exacerbating the inflammation response. [51] [52] [53] 55 PARP1 inhibitors thus may repress the NF-\u03baB-mediated proinflammatory signals, and reduce energy failure and subsequent cell death induced by necrosis, hence providing a clinical potential for attenuating the cytokine storm and inflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Third, ADP-ribosylation is a conserved post-translational modification on the nucleocapsid proteins across different coronavirus lineages, implying that it may have an important regulatory role for the structure packing of viral genome. Several previous studies have demonstrated that PARP1 is critical for viral replication. 49, 56, 57 For example, PARP1 has been reported to interact with hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (IAV) and promote its replication by triggering the degradation of host type I IFN receptor. 58 In addition, the ADP-ribosylation of adenoviral core proteins has been shown to display an antiviral defense mechanism. 48 Therefore, intervening the ADP-ribosylation mediated interplay between PARP1 and viral proteins may be another important pathway for PARP1 inhibitors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of course, to thoroughly understand the anti-SARS-CoV-2 roles of CVL218 and other PARP1 inhibitors, more experimental studies and direct (clinical) evidences will be needed in the future.",

This can be explained by multiple potential mechanisms, including the direct interaction between CVL218 and viral N protein (Fig. 5a) or the inhibition of PARP activity by the compound (Fig. 5c) . Although the second hypothesis cannot be excluded without further experimental validation on the effects of PARP1 deficiency on NP expression, we propose that the first hypothesis (i.e., direct CVL218-NP interaction inhibits viral RNA replication) mainly accounts for the downregulation of NP expression by CVL218 treatment, mainly based on our experimental results. In particular, our antiviral assays demonstrated that only CVL218 but not olaparib inhibited viral replication (Fig. 2a) , suggesting that the antiviral effect was likely due to a mechanism which is not shared by both compounds. While both CVL218 and olaparib are known to inhibit PARP activity, only CVL218 was shown to bind NP by our SPR experiments (Fig. 3) . According to the above reasoning, it is more likely that CVL218 regulated the NP expression through direct interaction with NP and thus suppressing viral RNA assembly and replication.",

In addition, reduction and functional exhaustion of T cells have also been observed in COVID-19 patients. 43 Therefore, blocking the overactive inflammatory response may serve as an effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, particularly for those ICU patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. According to a recent study, both innate and adaptive immune responses are activated in COVID-19 patients and the overproduction of cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 is likely to be involved in cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). 67 Figuring out the specific immune cell subsets which these cytokines belong to could benefit our understanding about the pathology of severe COVID-19 patients and design of novel therapies targeting this disease. Recently, tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody drug targeting IL-6, has been shown to have therapeutic potential for the treatment of COVID-19, 68 which also highlights the vital role of anti-inflammatory response in current therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Our in vitro study has shown that CVL218 can effectively inhibit the production of several inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS in PBMCs, including IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, which are highly related to the pathogenic characteristics of COVID-19 (Fig. 4) . This finding indicates that CVL218 may also possess a good anti-inflammatory profile that is specifically applicable to those severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 4 , CVL218 exhibited significant activity of antiinflammatory effects while another PARP inhibitor olaparib did not show such an effect. One possible reason is that CVL218 exhibited better selectivity to the members of PARP family compared with olaparib, [69] [70] [71] and thus CVL218 and olaparib may modulate different regulatory pathways of the inflammatory response. In addition, it still remains controversial whether the enzymatic Fig. 5 The putative mechanisms for CVL218 as a PARP1 inhibitor to combat the COVID-19 disease, derived based on the data present in this study and the known antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors previously reported in the literature. a Schematic diagram showing the possible antiviral mechanisms of PARP1 inhibitors in the life cycle of coronavirus in human cells. PARP1 inhibitors have been previously reported in the literature to suppress viral replication and imped the binding of nucleocapsid protein to viral RNAs, thus preventing the virus infection. [47] [48] [49] [50] b Potential protective effects of PARP1 inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19. The anti-inflammation effects of PARP1 inhibitors may be achieved through two possible molecular pathways. The first one is to modulate the expression of pro-inflammation factors such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1, IL-6 and downstream cytokines and chemokines. [51] [52] [53] [54] The second possible pathway is to prevent the overactivation of PARP1 and thus avoid the depletion of NAD + and ATP, and the consequent cellular energy failure and cell death caused by necrosis. [51] [52] [53] [54] c The potential antiviral effects of PARP1 inhibitors through suppressing the ADP-ribosylation of viral proteins and intervening the host-pathogen interactions, thus resulting in the inhibition of viral replication 48, 49, 56, 57 activity of PARP1 is required for activating NF-\u03baB. [72] [73] [74] Collectively, we hypothesize that the PARP1 inhibitors CVL218 and olaparib may play different roles in regulating the inflammatory pathways. PARP1 inhibitors are originally used for targeting the homologous recombination repair defects in cancers, and mainly categorized as oncology drugs. Thus, it would generally need more safety data to justify any repurposing of PARP1 inhibitors for non-oncology indications. Fortunately, there are numerous existing preclinical and clinical studies on repurposing PARP1 inhibitors into non-oncological diseases, including the aforementioned acute diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stroke) 75 and chronic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and vascular diseases). 75, 76 All these evidences indicate the possibility of repurposing PARP1 inhibitors as a safe therapeutic agent to treat the current acute lung disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic data in rats and monkeys shown in our study indicate that CVL218 possesses an acceptable safety profile to be repositioned for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 purpose. Moreover, CVL218 has been approved to enter Phase I clinical trial in 2017 for cancer treatment (Registration Number: CTR20190906). The preliminary data from the Phase I clinical trial have shown that CVL218 is well tolerated in ascending dose studies at doses as high as 1000 mg QD and 500 mg BID, and no Grade II and above adverse events have been observed, which indicates that CVL218 is also quite safe and well tolerated in human.",

Such a tissue specific enrichment in lung may bring an extra advantage for CVL218 to be used for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 purpose, as lung is the therapeutically targeted tissue for COVID-19. Moreover, the high-level distribution in lung may also suggest that only a low dosage is needed to ensure the therapeutic efficacy of CVL218 against SARS-CoV-2, which may further reduce the risk of adverse events.

First, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically close to that of SARS-CoV, with about 79% of sequence identity, 98 and the M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and E (envelope) proteins of these two coronaviruses have over 90% sequence similarities. 99 In addition, the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are highly similar. 100 In particular, we collected the gene expression profiles of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from three SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (NGDC: PRJCA002326) 6 and PBMC samples from ten SARS-CoV infected patients (GEO: GSE1739). 7 For samples from SARS-CoV infected patients, the raw gene expression values were first converted into logarithm scale, and then the differential expression values (z-scores) were computed by comparing to those of healthy persons using the same protocol as described in ref. 5 that is,",

The p-values for all the genes with measured expression values during the analysis were also computed based on the z-scores. For samples from those SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, due to the limited sample sizes (i.e., three samples for the healthy, three PBMC and two BALF samples for the infected patients), using z-score for differentially expressed gene analysis can be inaccurate and misleading. This is because the MAD mentioned above can be of high variance when the number of healthy samples is low (i.e., three), resulting in inaccurate estimation of the z-score. Here we mainly used the fold-change to analyze the differential expressed genes, which was obtained from the original paper. 6 The up-and downregulated genes were determined by p-value <0.01 and sorted according to the z-score/log2-fold-change values. We used the connectivity map (CMap), 5 which contains the cellular gene expression profiles under the perturbation of 2428 well annotated reference compounds, to measure the associations of gene expression patterns between SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV infected patients and the reference compound-perturbed cells. The connectivity map scores were computed based on the up-and downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV infected patients using the web tool (https://clue.io/query). Under the hypothesis that the gene expression pattern resulting from the perturbation by a therapeutic compound should be negatively correlated with that resulting from the coronavirus infection, we selected those compounds that have significant negative connectivity map scores, that is, the list of drug candidates predicted to treat the coronavirus infected patients was obtained by selecting the compounds with the connectivity map scores <\u221290, which was suggested by the original paper. 5 Comparing molecular characteristics between PARP1 inhibitors We compared the molecular characteristics between PJ-34 and other available PARP1 inhibitors that are FDA-approved or in clinical trials, including niraparib, rucaparib, veliparib, nicotinamide, olaparib, iniparib, theophylline, talazoparib, and CVL218.

Only healthy animals were used for experimental purpose. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution study in Sprague-Dawley rats was approved by Center for Drug Safety Evaluation and Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences. A total of 144 Sprague-Dawley rats with each sex were used for toxicity study. Animals were randomly separated into four groups (18/sex/ group). CVL218 was administered at doses of 20, 40, 60, and 160 mg/kg. For all the groups, 20 rats (10/sex/group) were randomly selected and euthanized at day 28, and their sections of various tissues and organs were obtained and frozen. Ten (5/ sex/group) animals were euthanized after a 28-day drug free period, and their sections of tissues and organs were obtained and frozen. Six (3/sex/group) were euthanized after the blood samples were obtained. For pharmacokinetic and toxicity evaluation, clinical symptoms, mortality and the animals' body weight were examined. Serum (0.5 mL) was collected to analyze toxicokinetics at different timepoints post drug administration. The plasma concentration-time data were analyzed using a noncompartmental method (Phoenix, version 1.3, USA) to derive the pharmacokinetic parameters.",
