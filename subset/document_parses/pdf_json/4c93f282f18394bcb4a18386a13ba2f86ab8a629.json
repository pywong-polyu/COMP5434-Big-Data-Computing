The newly identified coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 outbreak, which is a real threat to human health and life. The world has been struggling with this epidemic for about a year, yet there are still no targeted drugs and effective treatments are very limited. Due to the long process of developing new drugs, reposition of existing ones is one of the best ways to deal with an epidemic of emergency infectious diseases. Among the existing drugs there are candidates which are potentially able to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thus infection with the virus. Some therapeutics target several proteins, and many diseases share molecular paths. In such cases, the use of existing pharmaceuticals for more than one purposes can reduce the time needed to design new drugs. The aim of this review was to analyse the key targets of viral infection and potential drugs acting on them, as well as to discuss various strategies and therapeutic approaches, including the possible use of natural products. We highlight the approach based on increasing the involvement of human deaminases, particularly APOBEC deaminases in editing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This can reduce the cytosine content in the viral genome leading to the loss of its integrity. We also indicate the nucleic acid technologies as potential approaches for COVID-19 treatment. Among numerous promising natural products, we point out curcumin and cannabidiol as good candidates for being anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.",

            "text": "The first coronavirus, the Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), isolated from chicken embryos, was described in the 1930s [1] , and the first coronaviruses infecting human, designated HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were reported in the 1960s [2, 3] . Since the discovery of the first family member, coronaviruses have attracted more and more attention from around the world. This is due to emergence of the dangerous human diseases caused by three viruses of the family; SARS-CoV-1 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1), MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), and lately identified SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) [4] . In humans coronaviruses are responsible for infection of upper and lower respiratory tract [5] . In most individuals symptoms evoked by HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are mild [6, 7] , and hence until 2002 coronaviruses were considered relatively simple nonfatal pathogens. The approach to coronaviruses radically changed at the end of 2002 when SARS-CoV-1 and caused by it SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) appeared [8] . The world was completely surprised by emergence of coronavirus causing not typical severe pneumonia, and shocked by the fact of outbreak of such a disease in the 21st century [9, 10] . With the advent of another coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, also responsible for severe pneumonia in humans [11] , it became clear that such pathogens could pose a very serious threat to health [10] . MERS, besides sharing with SARS, such a clinical feature as severe atypical pneumonia, is also associated with acute renal failure and gastrointestinal problems [12] . SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, caused epidemics which had considerable associated mortality; about 10% and 35%, respectively (MERS-CoV is still active) [13] . In late fall 2019, a novel acute respiratory disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared, the origin of which has not yet been established. It is more transmissible compared to SARS and MERS, characterized by asymptomatic carriers, long latency period, high infectivity, and relatively high mortality; about 5% [13, 14] . The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that, like SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, primarily targets the lower respiratory system. However, apart from causing pneumonia, infection with SARS-CoV-2 may also result in the failure of various organ functioning [15] .",

Yet development of targeted drugs are time consuming and so far, life supportive care and symptomatic treatment remain the only alternative. Repurposing of existing therapeutics and strategies seems to be the best option for treatment the clinical symptoms of the infection such as cough, fever and difficulty in breathing, to combat the disease. Apart from therapies based on commercially available pharmaceuticals, approaches using natural metabolites and therapeutic nucleotides as well as plasma and monoclonal antibodies seem to be interesting strategies. In this work we review these strategies and analyse drugs involved in them, along with their viral and host cellular targets.",

In Coronavirinae virions are spherical. They can also be rod-shaped like in Bafinivirus or constitute a mixture of both, with rod-shaped particles bent into crescents (Torovirus). The particles are decorated with surface projections (the \"peplomers\" or \"spikes\"). In electron micrographs the spherical shape generates an image resembling the solar corona. Therefore the name \"coronaviruses\" was coined. Coronaviridae family belongs to Cornidovirineae suborder belonging to the order named Nidovirales [17, 18] . Phylogenetically Nidovirales are subdivided into: alpha, beta, delta and gammacoronaviruses. Alpha and betacoronaviruses are the human pathogens [19] . So far, seven coronaviruses are identified to infect humans. Apart from the betacoronaviruses responsible for severe diseases (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), there are four other (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) which cause common cold [13, 20] .",

SARS-CoV-2 begins its life cycle through binding to the host cell receptor ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) followed by the virus membrane fusion with the host cell membrane, activation of the attached S protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and entry into the cell. Then SARS-CoV-2 releases its RNA which is translated into the two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The polyproteins undergo proteolysis yielding numerous viral nonstructural proteins. After formation of replicase-transcriptase complex, a series of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) are produced by transcription and finally translated into the viral structural proteins. In the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and Golgi, virions are formed by assembling the viral structural proteins with genome. The virions are then transported and released from the cell.",

Two-thirds of the viral RNA located in the cytoplasm undergo translation by the host cell protein translation system, into two large polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The remainder part is subjected to transcription into a set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) [28] .

M pro of SARS-CoV-2 contains the cysteine and histidine catalytic residues in its active centre. As a monomer, M pro is basically inactive, it undergoes autocleavage [44] before processing the overlapping polyproteins. In the resulted homodimer both protomers are almost orthogonally oriented to each other [45] . They consist of three domains and are bond to each other through N-terminal finger situated between the II and III domain. This finger is engaged in the formation of the substrate-binding site situated in a cleft between the I and II domain [41, 46] . The residues 8-101, 102-184 and 201-306 are parts of the domains I, II and III respectively. The residues 185-200 constitute a loop which connects domains II and III [46, 47] . Two mutations Thr285Ala and Ile286Leu identified in SARS-CoV-2 M pro seem to be behind the higher activity of the enzyme comparing to M pro of SARS-CoV-1 [41] . Interesting topological feature of SARS-CoV-2 M pro was recently found by Estrada [43] . It reflects the enzyme capacity to transmission of perturbations across its domains through interactions of the long-range.",

The process occurs between the S1 and S2 units of the S protein and enable entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the target cell. [50] . The SARS-CoV-2 spike has a sequence of basic amino acids which is recognized and cleaved by furin [51] . S protein is formed as a precursor which trimerizes, and it appears as a trimer in mature viruses.

It was also observed that the postfusion structure possesses N-linked glycans which may be indicative of a protective role against the host immune response [48] . The subunit S2 is involved in fusion of the viral membrane and host cellular membrane. During the fusion the S2 subunit adopts three main conformational states; prefusion native state, prehairpin intermediate state, and ensuing postfusion hairpin state [34] . It was discovered [50] that in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 four amino acid residues were placed between the subunits S1 and S2, and that their presence affects the S protein cleavage. Consequently, S protein shows the unique furin cleavage site located within the S1/S2 domain between the residues 682 and 685, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f overlapped with the insertion [50] . Lately it was shown that the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is able to bind linoleic acid in three binding pockets [54] . This stabilizes a locked S conformation and reduces ACE2 interactions in vitro. Synergistic effect of remdesivir supplemented with linoleic acid on suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication was also demonstrated. In human epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, addition of linoleic acid markedly reduced the dose of remdesivir necessary to inhibit viral replication [54] . This suggests that the linoleic acid-binding pocket within S of SARS-CoV-2 constitutes promising target for potential drugs.",

In the enzyme active site three residues: Cys112-His273-Asp287, which are located at the interface of the subdomains thumb and palm, form the catalytic triad [64] . The action of PL pro is based on the catalytic cycle of cysteine protease. In this cycle, Cys112 acts as a nucleophile, His273 acts as an acidbase, and Asp287 paired with histidine promotes Cys112 deprotonation [64] . Although PL pro of SARS-CoV-2 and PL pro of SARS-CoV-1 share 83% sequence identity, the enzymes exhibit different host substrate preferences; the SARS-CoV-2 protease preferentially cleaves the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 (regulator of host innate immune pathways), while PL pro of SARS-CoV-1 predominantly targets ubiquitin chains [62] . Taking into consideration the functions performed by PL pro it seems to be clear that its inhibition can lead to dual therapeutic effect; suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection and promotion of anti-viral immunity.",

For example, the drug was proposed to be an efficient inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [106] , although another study demonstrated that treatment of patients with COVID-19 with this drug is not associated with expected results [107] . Overall, there are no strong data to support the use of umifenovir to improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients [102] . Favipiravir and remdesivir (Fig. 7) are antiviral agents acting as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors [97, 108] , the enzyme involved in transcription and replication of the viral genome. Favipiravir selectively and strongly inhibits this enzyme in numerous RNA viruses including a wide range of influenza viruses, Ebola and Lassa viruses [97, 108] . showed health benefit for patients treated with favipiravir with regard to control group of patients to whom another drug was administered [109] . Favipiravir is currently in clinical trials. The first two phases of the research ended with promising results [97] . Recently, in silico studies focused on identification of favipiravir structural analogues potentially active against SARS-CoV-2 were performed, and 2-oxo-1H-pyrazine-3-carboxamide (Fig. 7) was concluded to be an excellent drug candidate which can be more effective than favipiravir [108] . It is worth noticing that favipiravir differs only from its chosen analogue in a fluorine atom attached to the heterocyclic ring.",

Selectivity over cellular adenosine triphosphate and delayed chain termination at position i+3 are key steps in the mechanism responsible for RdRp inhibition by remdesivir [112] . On the basis of results obtained with regard to inhibition mechanism, remdesivir was defined as a direct-acting antiviral agent [112] . Remdesivir was designed to treat Ebola virus disease, however the drug exhibits a wide spectrum of activity against RNA viruses including MERS and SARS-CoV-1 [114] [115] [116] [117] . Recently it was shown that the drug has moderate clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 [118] .

The mechanism of action of dexamethasone against SARS-CoV-2 is not clear [97] , however, since COVID-19 is associated with lung injury, the drug appears to be able to affect the lung damage caused by inflammation and thus reduce progression to respiratory failure and death. Nevertheless using of dexamethasone during the early phase of the viral infection might result in increased viral replication and aggravate the disease. Currently, dexamethasone is used in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in United Kingdom. A preliminary report shows that the use of dexamethasone led to lower mortality among patients who required mechanical ventilation or received oxygen, but not among those who did not receive respiratory support [119] .",

This can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the failure of multiple organs. Moreover, curcumin was demonstrated to decrease expression not only of the mentioned cytokines but also other mediators of inflammatory processes, which are involved in regulation of the immune cells activity and promotion of the lung fibrosis [137, 138] . Apart from showing inhibitory activity against pro-inflammatory molecules, curcumin is able to positively influence anti-inflammatory cytokines regulation: it upregulates anti-inflammatory IL-10 [140, 141] . As a polyphenolic antioxidant which in its molecule, apart from hydroxyl groups, contains \u03b2-diketone moiety, the compound acts also as a ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) scavenger [137] . It effectively removes ROS and inhibits the lecithin peroxidation. It also inhibits the ROS induced oxidative damage to DNA. Recently it was reported that curcumin opposes the effect of ROS on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [142] .",

The studies, in which molecular docking were used, showed that resveratrol has binding affinity > -7 kcal/mol. In addition, the application of molecular dynamics simulations taking into account the aquatic environment showed that resveratrol binds to the S protein: ACE2 receptor complex [148] .",

Cannabidiol comes from the cannabis species, is not a psychoactive compound, but has many desirable biological activities. It has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and chemopreventive properties. Cannabidiol was shown to block IL-6, one of the proinflammatory cytokines, in models of inflammatory diseases [150] . Massive production of interleukins: IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17, is associated with the occurrence of cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19. Nasal administration of a synthetic double-stranded RNA viral analogue (Poly (I: C)) was shown to simulate the symptoms of severe infections causing ARDS and cytokine storm [149] . They also showed that administration of cannabidiol downregulates the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ameliorates the clinical symptoms of Poly I:C-induced ARDS. These results suggest that cannabidiol can play protective role during ARDS, and that its using for treatment of COVID-19 can be considered. However further studies are required to evaluate the cannabidiol therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Since its first detection at our knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, has been becoming more and more comprehensive. This virus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, have dominated the work of the entire scientific world in an unprecedented global effort. Despite this, there is still no drug specifically aimed at COVID-19 treatment. Such a situation should not be surprising; development of new drug is not a simple process that requires several safety efficacy analyses which are time-consuming. What is more, SARS-CoV-2 inoculation into the host cells makes this process even more challenging due to the fact that potential drug cannot cause strong site effects to the host. On the other hand, there is the urgent need for developing remedial agents that could be applied to overcome the pandemic. For solving these problems knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology is necessary. Fortunately researchers have already gained some insight. Due to their huge effort, molecular details of infection mechanism, ways of the virus transmission between people, as well as in which it affects the human body are currently known. However, SARS-CoV-2 infects not only a respiratory system but also blood vessels, causing thrombosis [151] and strokes [152] . COVID-19 can result in gastrointestinal, neurological, renal, and cardiovascular complications. Numerous druggable targets associated with the virus main structural proteins and enzymes implicated in the key steps of its life cycle were indicated, and various drugs are used for COVID-19 treatment. Yet, the effectiveness of these pharmaceuticals is far from being satisfactory. Among the different therapeutic approaches we want to stress the strategy that implies increase in the involvement J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of deaminases belonging to ADAR and particularly to APOBEC group, in editing of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Such a strategy could further reduce the already low cytosine content in the viral genome leading to the loss of its integrity and, in a consequence to defeating the virus. Also strategies based on nucleic acid technologies can prove to be useful due to ability of therapeutic nucleotides to inhibit translation by targeting genes. These approaches have huge potential, however the designing and preparation of appropriate siRNA, Ribozymes or ASO is a complicated process due to the need to ensure the stability of the synthesized nucleic acids and to develop modes of their delivery to the selected target. With regard to specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2, natural products could be a good base for their development.",

When SARS-CoV-2 infects the human cells, enzymes from the both families may potentially act on the viral RNA in a similar way to their action on the host RNA. In the genome of SARS-CoV-2 the content of the cytidine (C) is very low (18.39%), while the uridine (U)content is high (32.12%)[91]. Earlier it was shown that genomes of several other Coronaviridae members, among them of those infecting humans, exhibit the similar property[92]. Among the Coronaviruses: HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, BCoV, IBV, HCoV-229E, TGEV, MHV, PEDV and SARS-CoV-1, the genome of HCoV-NL63 was characterized by the lowest GC content equal to 34%, and by a very high content of U (39%) comparing to only 14% of C[92]. Moreover, genomes with the lowest amount of C (HCoV-NL63, HCoVOC43 and BCoV) were found to have the highest U content and vice versa.[92].Indeed, taking into account all these results together with the nucleotides content in the genome of SASRS-CoV-2, it seems clear that the composition of nucleotides in the genomic positive RNA strand of various representatives of Coronaviridae family has a common feature: U is the most abundant nucleotide while G, and particularly C are underrepresented.",

They act by creation of double-stranded structures through formation of the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds with the target complementary DNA or RNA sequences. Involved in the bonding with target RNA, they induces its cleavage or inhibit maturation of mRNA. This may result in the inhibition of the translation processes[129]. Studies performed with modified ASOs used against different respiratory viruses showed promising results. Specific three peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) were designed against specific sequences in the SARS-CoV-1 genome[130]. Studies performed with the ASOs suggested their therapeutic potential against the virus infection[131].Large genome of SARS-CoV-2 potentially offers numerous targets for therapies based on nucleic acid technologies. Combinatorial approach to the COVID-19 problem was suggested[16]. This approach implies application of technology wherein a cocktail of multiple oligonucleotides against key region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is used. Such a strategy increases the chance of obtaining a satisfactory therapeutic effect. Similar approach is already used in the fight against HIV[16], however its application as a strategy against SARS-CoV-2 would require taking into account completely different biology of this virus comparing to the retrovirus.The biggest difficulty with the use of technologies based on nucleic acids is associated with the delivery of therapeutic nucleotides to target cells in vivo. The question is how the nucleotides could be introduced into the lungs, and how could they be delivered in amount sufficient to stop the infection or at least alter its clinical course, and provide clear health benefits. In the body fluids nucleic acids undergo enzymatic digestion. They have highly charged nature which made impossible crossing the cell membrane in the free diffusion process.
