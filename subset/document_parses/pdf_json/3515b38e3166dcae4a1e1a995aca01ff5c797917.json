This has led to cTn serving as an effective tool for clinical decision making in various situations [1] [2] [3] . In fact, robust evidence indicates the association between elevated cTn level and adverse events [3] [4] [5] [6] . This association was also found in populations without a specific diagnosis [7] . Hence, myocardial injury, defined by elevation of cTn above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, has become an entity in itself, extended from a prerequisite for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction [8] .",

In these patients, increased cTn levels were associated with high mortality [5, 7, 13] . In addition, it was reported that myocardial injury detected at admission was related to higher mortalities, regardless of the cause of admission [14, 15] . Since an enormous array of clinical conditions, from kidney disease to anemia, may affect the occurrence of myocardial injury, it is anticipated to be higher in patients requiring hospitalization [8] . However, treatment strategy in patients with incidentally diagnosed myocardial injury at admission remains unclear. The role of the cardiologist has demonstrated clinical significance in cardiac care units and for patients with type 2 myocardial infarction [16, 17] . In this regard, we evaluated the role of the cardiologist in the treatment of patients with myocardial injury detected at hospitalization for noncardiac cause.",

This cohort was extracted from the institutional electronic archive system using the \"Clinical Data Warehouse Darwin-C\", built for investigators to search and retrieve deidentified medical records that contain over 4 million patients with more than 900 million laboratory findings and 200 million prescriptions. This system uses a unique personal identification number for the mortalities apart from our institutional identification, and consistently updates and confirms with the National Population Registry of the Korea National Statistical Office. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, and functional capacity of patients were organized based on admission notes and nursing charts during hospital stay by independent investigators who were blinded to mortality. From this registry, we enrolled the patients with cTn elevated above the 99th percentile upper reference limit at admission by laboratory blood tests. We divided them into those who were consulted by the department of cardiology and those who were not.",

The lowest limit of detection was 6 ng/L, and the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit was 40 ng/L, as provided by the manufacturer. The comorbidities were curated based on admission notes and administrative data using the International Classification of Diseases-10 codes [18] . Poor functional capacity was defined by the measurement of exercise tolerance before surgery lower than 4 [19] . The primary endpoint was the mortality during the first year, while the 30-day mortality was also compared.",

Differences between the groups were compared with the chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the t-test or the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, as applicable. Kaplan-Meier curves for mortalities were constructed and compared using the log-rank test. In the crude population, Cox regression analysis with multivariable adjustment was used to compare mortality, and the results were reported as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Variables that were retained in the multivariable adjustment model were age, sex, admission for scheduled operation, heart failure, diabetes, renal disease, poor functional capacity, and cardiac symptoms. We generated a propensity-score-matched population to further reduce selection bias while maintaining balanced confounding variables between the two groups. For propensity-score matching, we used caliber widths of 1.5 of the pooled standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score on all available variables, and generated 1:2 individually matched populations without replacement. In the matched population, an absolute standard mean deviation of <10% of variables between the groups was deemed a successful balance between the two groups. The study power of analysis based on sample size was calculated, and was 0.83 and 0.99 when the estimated HR was 0.7 and 0.6, respectively [20] . Additionally, we performed subgroup analysis to estimate the interaction between the observed association and variables such as sex, diabetes, admission for scheduled operation, poor functional capacity, and cardiac symptoms.

An association between high-intensity medical staffing and reduced mortality was previously demonstrated, but mostly in the critical care setting [6, 16, [25] [26] [27] . Explanations for this association include full attention to patient status and the ability to recognize and manage events promptly [26] . In a recent report on patients with type 2 myocardial infarction, mortality did not differ based on cardiologist evaluation, despite an enormously higher prevalence of risk factors in patients who were evaluated by cardiologists [17] . Considering these inherent differences in risk between the groups, this result can be interpreted as an improvement of outcome by cardiologist evaluation. In our study, the cardiologist evaluation group also had a higher incidence of cardiac risk factors and underwent more frequent cardiac evaluations and therapy including increase of dose and frequency of cardiovascular drug administration that were reported to be beneficial in cardiovascular patients. These management factors were deemed to have affected the lower mortality for the cardiologist evaluation group despite a higher incidence of underlying risk factors and postoperative myocardial infarction.",

In the propensity-score-matched population, mortality of the cardiology consultation group remained lower with more frequent cardiovascular treatments. The fact that cardiovascular treatment in the cardiologist evaluation group remained higher than in the no cardiologist group even after balancing the differences of variables between the two groups supported our explanation that improved clinical outcomes may be dependent on an appropriate cardiac evaluation and medical treatment. Another possible explanation for our result was that patients with clinically silent myocardial injury at admission might be neglected in the no cardiologist evaluation group. Overall, the results of the current study correlated well with previous studies, and emphasized the role of the cardiologist.",

Generally, ischemic injury is assumed to be an acute event, and hence relevant studies are mostly focused on short-term mortality, rather than long-term outcomes [6, 14, 27] . So, our result for the long-term follow-up suggested the possibility that improved mortality may not be fully dependent on myocardial injuries that are caused by ischemia. Considering noncardiac origins such as sepsis, chronic kidney disease, stroke, or pulmonary embolism, myocardial injury that is incidentally detected at admission may reflect the poor state of the general condition in some patients, and these patients could be vulnerable to cardiac manifestation. Anticipative cardiac management in these patients may offer improved long-term clinical outcomes.",

Despite rigorous statistical adjustments with propensity-score matching, unmeasured variables could not be corrected. Secondly, cTn was not a routine evaluation at admission to our institution. It was selectively measured based on discretion of attending clinician, so there is a possibility of selection bias. Moreover, the cardiologist evaluation was also selectively performed at the discretion of the attending clinician, and treatment strategies might have differed between the cardiologists. Therefore, generalization of our results to other populations should be prudent. Despite these limitations, our study showed that the involvement of a cardiologist can reduce mortality in stable patients with cTn elevation at admission.",
