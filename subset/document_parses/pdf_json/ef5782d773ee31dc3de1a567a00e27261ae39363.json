The main contribution is the simultaneous consideration of different levels of data aggregation: individual, national and welfare system. This allows conclusions to be drawn on the effects of variables linked to sociodemographic characteristics, gender equality and welfare systems. The empirical estimation utilised microdata from the World Values Survey (2005/09 and 2010/14) and the United Nations Development Programme. Results suggest that the European senior citizens appear to believe that they are more equal than the official statistics of their countries indicate. Men are more likely to participate in professional and education activities; women are more likely to be involved in religious organisations. Welfare systems influence volunteering behaviours. The promotion of macro-policies for gender equality could be important for increasing participation in non-profit organisations.",

Active aging could be promoted by social participation in community through volunteering. Volunteering in elderly people has positive effects (Gil-Lacruz et al., 2018; Krause & Rainville, 2018) . Among its benefits, research has revealed that senior volunteers are more protected from health risks related to retirement and physical inactivity than those who do not volunteer (Gil-Lacruz et al., 2019; Wilson & Musick, 2012) . According to data of Volunteurope report (2012), the percentage of elderly people in volunteering varies substantially among the European countries, with high rates in the Netherlands (20%), and low rates in Greece (3%). Specifically, Boccacin and Lombi (2018) found that older women volunteer more in Poland, Ireland, and Spain, while older men in Belgium, France, and Germany.",

The conceptual approach frequently used is the theorical framework of social learning (Bandura, 1969) . The explanation is that people reproduce and imitate observed gender role models. Although the literature reviewed shows that women are more involved in volunteering than men (Mesch et al., 2006; Wymer, 2011) , this result loses intensity when socio-economic factors are controlled, such as income level and family composition (Hook, 2004; Taniguchi, 2006) . These differences suggest that certain individuals and macrosocial factors may exert a marked influence on senior volunteering between genders. Nevertheless, as noted by Gil-Lacruz et al. (2019) , studies conducted in countries have been focused on the positive effects related to volunteering (e.g., well-being, health, and satisfaction), ignoring others individual and macrosocial factors that account for civic engagement. Consequently, in the current research, the main objective is to analyze the individual and contextual determinants of senior volunteering, especially those that are gender-related, and on their interaction with macrosocial-level predictors.",

We only examinate the effect of formal volunteering in different organizations in our study because it defines direct activities and can more accurately be measured. Nichols and Shepard (2006) have shown that the relationship between voluntary participation and age corresponds to an inverted U: volunteering peaks in middle age and then begins to decline, whereas Wymer (2011) notes that volunteers are often older. According to life course theories, in middle age, volunteering has to do with family and work roles such as stable jobs and parenting that increase interest in the community (Flanagan & Levine, 2010) . The values of predisposition to change can influence older adults to volunteer (Ariza-Montes et al., 2017) . Motivations and personality traits, such as extraversion, appear to be relevant in deciding to volunteer (Kwok et al., 2013) . Other factors such as the sense of belonging to the community are decisive in being a volunteer among the elderly (Pozzi et al., 2014) . However, the factors that influence how seniors choose to volunteer are not conclusive, more research is needed to strengthen their participation (Boccacin & Lombi, 2018; Gil-Lacruz et al., 2019) .",

These results vary depending on the type of activity. Some categories have strong gender norms, while in other areas gender differences would not be relevant (Fyall & Gazley, 2015) . A recent European study has found a positive relationship in the decision to volunteer in awareness and social justice activities for women, while in professional activities for men (Gil-Lacruz et al., 2018) . This may be due to social expectations about what activities are appropriate for women and men (see West & Zimmerman, 1987 , for a further review of ''doing gender'').",

Due to the socially expected role of men as breadwinners, unemployment inhibits men's volunteering as they devote their time to seeking paid employment to fulfil their role as primary breadwinner (Taniguchi, 2006) . In contrast, unemployed women may find participation in volunteer organizations more acceptable, as long as their family members are well cared for (Taniguchi, 2006) . However, women devote more hours to household chores than men and provide more informal support (Hook, 2004) , so these additional responsibilities may hinder women's access to volunteering and their time to volunteer.

Therefore, welfare systems cannot be reduced only to the product of the unilateral extension of a single factor, such as income inequality, size of the non-profit sector, diversity, education or industrialization (Esping-Andersen, 1990), but they represent broad social structures comprising complex interrelationships between social institutions and cultural, social and economic factors.",

As explanatory determinants, two further interactions were considered: gender and subjective and objective equality measures. The interactions between the variables allow conclusions to be drawn on the relationship between the gender equality measures and the volunteering decisions of men and women. Model 3 added information on welfare systems (Nordic, Continental, Mediterranean and Eastern). The fact that the estimates were stable (in estimated value and significance) was a guarantee of robustness.

In the descriptive data, men were shown to be more involved with volunteering than women, which was statistically significant in the estimates of general volunteering and its different types.

Social advancement is mostly experienced by younger age groups (Shantz et al., 2019; Wemlinger & Berlan, 2016) . The older age groups we analyze have already experienced a strong degree of gender socialization (Lott, 1981) . This allows us to explain why these improvements are not reflected in the older ones. In relation, Einolf (2011) found that gender differences in volunteering still exist among the youngest. Consequently, the importance of gender roles in any age group remains. The attitude towards gender equality and GII are associated, as predicted, with higher ratios of volunteering. In more egalitarian contexts men are more likely to approach traditionally female organizations, while women are less likely to approach traditionally male organizations. This means that the advancement is more progressive for men in unpaid employment. The subjective measure is positively correlated for men in general volunteering, and for women in professional and political activities. Nevertheless, it is not supported by objective measurement. Therefore, the objective barriers faced by women in accessing instrumental organizations continue to exist (Fontanella et al., 2020) . Inglehart and Norris (2003) explain that in countries with less objective gender equality, women's political activism is suppressed due to strong female role beliefs, which reduces the likelihood that they will volunteer in professional and political organizations. Consequently, attitudes in advancing equality among women is not enough. It is necessary to extend them to the entire population, as well as to achieve objective markers of progress.",
