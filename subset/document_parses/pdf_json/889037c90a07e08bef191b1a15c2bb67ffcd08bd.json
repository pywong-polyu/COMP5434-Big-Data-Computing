However, during such health disaster events, stakeholders tend to give more precedence to the socio-economic and biomedical health consequences at the expense of mental health. Meanwhile, studies show that regardless of the kind of disaster/antecedent, all traumatic events trigger similar post-traumatic stress symptoms among survivors, families, and frontline workers. Thus, our study investigated the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms among survivors of the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease that plagued the West African sub-region.",

Most recently, two more outbreaks were reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The first started in May 2018 at the Equateur region of DRC and lasted for two months with 58 cases, and 27 deaths reported [2] . The second DRC outbreak started in August 2018 at North Kivu region and is ongoing [3] with 3453 cases (3310 confirmed and 143 probable) as well as 2273 deaths and 1169 survivors reported as of 31 st March 2020 [3] . However, the recent Ebola virus disease outbreak that shook the foundations of already fragile health care systems primarily occurred between 2014-2016 in three West African countries namely Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea [4] . Its unprecedented nature resulted in a substantial increase in human suffering and deaths. According to WHO, an estimated 28, 646 confirmed cases and 11, 322 deaths were recorded within that period [4] . Several factors were attributed to this large-scale spread of the EVD. Apart from the resources constraints and already challenged healthcare systems in these West African countries [5, 6] , sociopolitical and cultural factors unique to the region [7] contributed significantly to the spread of the EVD virus. Despite the unprecedented EVD outbreak and its associated mortality and morbidity rates, it also recorded the highest number of survivors in the history of Ebola outbreaks. An estimated 10,000 people in the three West African countries survived the epidemic, according to WHO estimates [8] .",

Thus, whether war victims, soldiers, victims of war disasters, first responders, or patients, the resulting post-traumatic psychological impact of these events is indistinguishable [10] [11] [12] . Unfortunately, it seems direct survivors/ patients of health disasters like Ebola tend to receive lesser public health and policy attention than the other disaster events. This trend is no surprise as war veterans or war crimes are often perceived positively as national heroes or victimized minority groups, respectively. In contrast, survivors of health disasters such as infectious epidemics and pandemics can often be tagged with social suspicion and negative stigmatization. Post EVD survivors do not only face the traumatic experience of suffering from the disease but also have to deal with community fear and social stigmatisation issues within a society devastated by the outbreak [13, 14] . Earlier epidemiological studies have documented the link between mental health problems and infectious diseases outbreaks [15, 16] .",

For instance, in 2015, a World Bank report noted that as of the time of the Ebola outbreak, the number of mental health workers (including psychiatrists) in the local population was as low as 1 in 6 million in Sierra Leone and 1 in 25,000 in Liberia [19] . This evidence exemplifies the tremendous need for both additional resources and novel approaches in outreach and treatment of mental health burden in West Africa. Also, one of the major reasons for the devastating Ebola outbreak was the initial slow response from international health partners [21, 22] . Even when the support finally comes, current Western post-disaster health aid to tackling African epidemics seem to prioritize the biomedical interventions to the neglect of mental health [21, 22] . This predominantly biased biomedical public health approach to postdisaster interventions may lead to inequitable distribution of health resources in these affected regions. Also, international humanitarian donor agencies that prioritize funding for a biomedical response over a complementary mental health one may continue to feed into a persisting biomedical-first approach at the expense of alternatives that incorporate mental health needs of survivors [21, 22] .",

Also, as victims of health crisis do not only have to deal with the stress and trauma of surviving the illness but also the community stigmatizing reaction to them for falling ill, contact tracing can be affected during critical health disasters. Therefore, the goal of this study is to draw attention to the health crisis-induced post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms among survivors pandemics and epidemics, especially those in poorer countries. Our specific aim is to provide a meta-analysis effects estimates of the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms (per the definition of the DSM-5) among African EVD survivors.",

Thus, this meta-analysis presents a quantitative estimate of the prevalence of the above symptoms among EVD survivors. Providing this evidence could support clinical and policy efforts to improve post-health crisis interventions and resources allocation to mitigate the mental health impacts for survivors, families, and frontline workers.",

Furthermore, a follow-up comprehensive hand search was carried out to enable us to capture grey literature, including thesis and dissertation works. Our exhaustive and rigorous search of literature helped to reduce the risk of leaving out important studies that could affect the quality of our meta-analysis conclusions [26] . Also, to ensure replicability, the same key terms were used across all the databases, including \"post-traumatic stress disorder \ufffd \", \"post-Ebola syndrome \ufffd \", PTSD, Ebola, \"Ebola Virus \ufffd \", \"Ebola disease \ufffd \", \"Ebola hemorrhagic fever\", survivor, \"Ebola survivor \ufffd \", Africa \ufffd . We identified these key terms from relevant literature and MeSH terms in the various databases. We performed the searches on 14 January 2020.

We did not include a specific age restriction for participants studied. However, we restricted our definition of anxiety, depression and insomnia to the one given by the DSM-5 [17] . Thus, we focused on studies that included any of the specified symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia per the DSM v5 definition due to that there was a paucity of existing literature. Another caveat was that only studies that provided raw frequency or proportion data on any of the known anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms [17] and demographic information among Ebola survivors were included. This restriction was added to allow us to conduct proportional effect size meta-analysis and diagnostic analysis on the included studies. For studies meeting the inclusion criteria but for which data could not be obtained in the article or the journal supplementary files' database, we contacted the authors via email to obtain raw data. Only a few of the authors contacted responded, and a couple still had the relevant data. Thus, we decided to restrict our analysis to only studies with complete data.",

A cut-off of 2 was chosen due to the small number (i.e. <25) of studies within each stratum (ibid). We then used the Leave-one-out diagnostic test [34] to further confirm the effect of each study on the overall mean and estimate for the observed summary proportion by removing each study in a step-wise manner (ibid).

Specifically, we used Eager's unweighted regression test because the traditional test is critiqued to have no theoretical justification [37] .

Anxiety was assessed via medical reports and standardized questionnaires. Fig 2a shows the individual study and pooled proportion effect estimates. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in these studies was 0.14 (99% CI: 0.05-0.30; \u03c7 2 = 45.91; I 2 = 94.63%; p < 0.01) among the EVD survivors, implying a significant level of anxiety. The absence of publication bias strengthens this finding (see Fig 2c) . Most of the studies fell in the funnel plot within the 99% confidence interval and an Egger's [29] unweighted regression test (p = 0.12) showed a lack of asymmetry. Also, a sensitivity analysis using the Leave-one-out technique [27] produced effect estimates ranging from 0.13 (99% CI: 0.05, 0.28) through to 0.11 (99% CI: 0.05-0.22), showing a minimal influence of any individual study on the overall proportional effect estimate (see Fig  2b) . Thus, a significant prevalence of anxiety is found. ",

Generally, our meta-analysis revealed findings regarding the presence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among Ebola virus disease survivors. Of the 13 studies involving 3042 Ebola virus disease survivors, a significant percentage of them reported anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms. We found an estimated anxiety prevalence of 14% (99% CI: 0.05-0.30) among EVD survivors. Also, a significant proportion, 15% (99% CI: 0.11-0.21) of the survivors reported depression. However, there was a higher prevalence of insomnia, 22% (99% CI: 0.13-0.36) among EVD survivors. Our results are slightly higher than what was reported in a recently published threecountry study that found a 10.7%, 9.9% and 4.2% prevalence in anxiety among Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea respectively [53] . It is interesting to note that, studies that are restricted to only Ebola survivors tend to report lower estimates of anxiety, depression and insomnia compared to those conducted among the general population. In contrast to what we found, previous studies that reported on the mental health consequence of post-disaster occurrences in Sierra Leone showed a higher anxiety prevalence of 48% (95% CI: 46.8% to 50.0%) among the general population [54, 55] . Although the reasons for the low prevalence estimates in these symptoms specifically among Ebola survivors are unclear, at the population level, researchers attributed the higher prevalence of people with mental health problems to region of residence, experiences with Ebola and perceived Ebola threat or knowing someone quarantined for Ebola [54, 55] .",

However, in contrast to the global estimate of 21% of depression among EVD survivors [23] , our study only revealed a 15% pooled prevalence. We believe that the difference in proportions estimated could be due to the fewer number of studies used and our restriction to only studies in the African region. Similarly, with regards to insomnia, our prevalence estimates of 22% are lesser than a global estimate of 34% among EVD survivors [23] . We also attribute the differences in estimates to our regional restriction and fewer number of studies used in this meta-analysis. Taking the preceding into perspective, we believe these findings should be interpreted and applied with the needed caution.",

Accordingly, our study reveals, survivors of regional and global health crises such as EVD survivors are at an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. There is thus the need to scale up mental health services as a joint effort in combination with the normal biomedical health responses when faced with health disasters. Such coordinated efforts will demand comprehensive collaboration between governments, health professionals, donors, civil society, communities, and patients and their families to cater for vulnerable populations such as EVD survivors as recommended by the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme [60] .",

            "text": "First, although the recent outbreak has provided many new insights and a lot of new data, methodologically sound studies are still scarce. For instance, a majority of the studies used a cross-sectional design which prevents the establishment of a cause-effect relationship between EVD and anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms. Thus, the heterogeneity in our proportion estimates of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms may simply be due to differences in the study designs, data quality, and/or demographic variations in various study samples. Also, the higher number of cross-sectional studies affects our ability to draw cause-effect conclusions from our results. Secondly, as indicated, most of the articles we assessed did not compare EVD survivors to a control group. Therefore, we could not calculate measures of association (relative risks, odds ratios, etc.) between EVD and anxiety, depression and insomnia among survivors. Unfortunately, we contacted the authors but were unable to obtain the required data from the respective authors of the various studies assessed. Thus, we report our findings tentatively and advise readers to do likewise. We recommend that studies with more robust designs (e.g. cohort studies and case-control studies) should be conducted to establish the association between EVD and anxiety, depression and insomnia. Thirdly, there were no data on the severity of Ebola illness in all the papers assessed. Thus, our study could not distinguish between individuals who have these symptoms from others who do not. Finally, there were also differences in whether symptoms were based on clinical diagnosis or self-report. The mode of assessment of EVD patients' mental health symptoms was not uniform. While some studies reported the use of a standardized questionnaire, others reported medical reports as well as clinical assessment. The differences in measurement instruments and concerns about the quality of data prevent comparability of the studies we assessed.",

By highlighting the prevalence of mental health needs among EVD survivors, we hope this evidence supports policy and clinical efforts in allocating appropriate resources to mitigate the mental health impacts among survivors, families, and frontline workers during health disaster events (e.g. EVD and the current SARS-CoV-19 pandemic). We believe that providing program interventions, including organized mental health outreach activities, will go a long way to help EVD survivors navigate anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms and improve their quality of life. However, similar to current mental health intervention efforts for veterans, a comprehensive and collaborative effort between relevant stakeholders is needed to achieve a successful complementary biomedical and mental health approach to health crisis survivors' in the future. Currently, few robust longitudinal studies examine the links between EVD and anxiety, depression and insomnia among survivors especially in Africa. Thus, we recommend robust longitudinal studies, including cohort and case-control studies, to help establish causal associations between EVD and anxiety, depression and insomnia as well as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
