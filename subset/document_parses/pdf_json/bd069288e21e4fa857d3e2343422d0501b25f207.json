However, health research capacity in LMICs remains limited [2] . Therefore, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Lancet Commission on Hypertension Group, Resolve to Save Lives (RTSL), and the World Hypertension League (WHL) came together with a shared goal of increasing opportunities for LMIC researchers to systematically evaluate cardiovascular disease initiatives and share their results with the scientific community through publication in the peer reviewed literature [3] .",
