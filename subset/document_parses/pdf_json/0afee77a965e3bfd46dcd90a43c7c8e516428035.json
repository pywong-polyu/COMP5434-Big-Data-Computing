            "text": "Publons' former mission statement d was clear (Figure 1 ), namely, to use experts to speed up research. However, the term 'expert' was removed from the mission statement in 2018 ( Figure 1B and C), e which suggests that the quality/ standards bar has been dropped rather than raised as anyone, including non-experts, can be valid peer reviewers at Publons, indicated by the fact that three of the biomedical journals f who offer reviewer recognition with Publons accepted a dog as an editor in a sting operation. g They were EC Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, h Journal of Community Medicine & Public Health Care, i and Journal of Tobacco Stimulated Diseases. j On the other hand, the use of stings is unscholarly because it involves intrinsic false and misleading elements by the individuals conducting the operation. 9 In an editorial, Nassi-Calo`1 0 remarked that the acquisition would enable editors to spot fake peer reviewers 'by associating citation data from authors with their reviewing records in Publons'. Associating citation data with reviewing activity, we argue, could be used to develop a new metric, or another perverse incentive 11 that would add pressure to already exploited and pressured academics. Our argument is reasonable if one examines more closely a previous viewpoint by Smith 12 and another more recently by Wilkinson and Down. 13 Smith stated: 'Publons does not reward its users for the number and impact of published papers; instead, it ranks users [and institutions] on the basis of the number of papers they have peer reviewed', 12 while Wilkinson and Down 13 suggested that universities can capture the quantity of peer review their researchers are already conducting. However, are there not risks in rewarding the quantity of peer review over its quality? 8 Smith further noted that Publons' service will encourage scientists to contribute to the peer review process because many scientists like him could be 'embarrassed to broadcast to everyone that [they] have published more papers than [they] have peer reviewed'. Arguments by Nassi-Calo`and Smith that some potentially 'predatory' journals offer peer review recognition with Publons, as demonstrated above, raise important questions that we have sought to answer. If Publons can depend on editors to spot fictitious peer reviewers, then it might be able to weed out predatory peers, 14 but if Publons rewards the quantity, rather than the quality of peer review, how will Publons and Clarivate Analytics improve it? How will journals and their editors, who failed to spot a fake editor, 15 be able to effectively detect fake peer review? As co-winners of the 2017 ALPSP Award, k one would expect Publons to engage with academics and the public to provide concrete answers to such concerns. These concerns became more tangible, as was highlighted by a study that identified over 6,000, from a total sample of 183,743, 'predatory' reviews (i.e., reviews of Cabell-blacklisted 'predatory' journals) on Publons. 16 There have been some notable achievements by both parties. Just prior to the acquisition, Clarivate Analytics partnered with ImpactStory (Figure 2 . The website where that announcement was made has been scrubbed clean, raising concerns about the erasure of documents that were publicly available, without any suitable explanation (B). The erasure of that press release further calls into question whether the partnership is still valid and active.

Reviewer Connect', which was described as a powerful tool to revolutionise editorial workflows for publishers o that combined 'Publons' exclusive peer review database with the [.] Web of Science author and citation index'. Reviewer Connect was developed to enable all publishers and journals, regardless of which peer review submission system they use, to 'find, screen, and connect with expert peer reviewers'. p On 2 May 2019, Publons partnered with Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science ResearcherID. q However, unlike open peer review, traditional peer review reports are blind, not open access, so their quality cannot be verified. 17, 18 Suggested changes to Publons to improve peer review transparency There are several clearly positive aspects of Publons for authors who serve as reviewers, the most evident being a visible, public 'reward', in the form of recognition, for their effort as peer reviewers. Nonetheless, we recommend that Publons negotiates with publishers to ensure that all peer review reports are converted into open reports as this could validate the peer review activity of authors. 19 Publons could also expose those who falsely claim to be peer reviewers of prestigious journals, so credits could be annulled for that author. Although Publons' COVID-19 index r might assist experts to make sense of the flood of COVID-19 research, will critical reviews be encouraged by open review comments, and will negative scores for papers and preprints be permitted by Publons?",
