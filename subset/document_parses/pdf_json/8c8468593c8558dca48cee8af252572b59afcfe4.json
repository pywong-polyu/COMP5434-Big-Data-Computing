The authors highlight the signs and causes of the recession of 2020 as well as the actions taken to stabilize the economy in Russia. The necessity of finding an adequate response to the high risks of bankruptcy of the enterprise, the destruction of supply chains and sales of products, failure to fulfill payment obligations is noted. To solve the problem, theoretical research methods were used: systematization and generalization, the study of documents and activity results when identifying problems and finding ways to solve them, generalization of experience. The article suggests using scientifically based approaches as a means of making managerial decisions. In order for anti-crisis measures to be balanced and effective, it is proposed to use a variety of possibilities of quantitative analysis, mathematical modeling, strategic choice, econometric forecasting, and solving optimization problems.",

The economic crisis of 2020 arose against the backdrop of a confrontation between leading oil exporters and was exacerbated by the negative economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. The resonant effect of these causes led to grave consequences. The collapse in oil prices in March of this year led to a significant weakening of the ruble and a decrease in the financial transactions profitability. The spread of viral infection caused the collapse of a number of industries, airlines, travel companies, goods importers from China. The Russian economy showed signs of a recession: a long-term decline in business activity, a decrease in production volumes, an increase in unemployment, etc.",

According to the results of the first quarter of 2020, relatively low inflation rates remained: consumer price growth amounted to 2.4% in annual terms, including 2% for food products. The average per capita cash income for the first quarter is estimated by the Federal State Statistics Service at 31.2 thousand rubles per month. However, this is only the beginning of the process. The introduction of a self-isolation regime at the end of the first quarter of 2020 reduced consumer spending on a number of goods to almost zero, which led to an almost complete loss of income by entrepreneurs. Small and medium-sized businesses began to incur significant losses. The list of the Russian economy sectors most affected by the spread of a new coronavirus infection according to data for April 18, 2020 includes 38 types of economic activities [9] , including air transportation, leisure and entertainment organization, sports activities, hotel business, catering, retail trade in non-food products, etc. As a result, unemployment has been recorded. Enterprises transfer part-time employees and send them on unpaid leave. Further decrease in the income level of the population, expected in the second quarter of 2020, can be considered as an extremely negative factor for the country's economy. Against the background of this alarming dynamics, the government is developing an anti-crisis measures system of state support in the economic and social spheres: granting delays in paying taxes and contributions, increasing minimum wages and unemployment benefits, developing supplementary employment programs, subsidies for the payment of salaries and rents, extending reporting deadlines, a decrease in the supervisory burden, a reduction in the premium rate, a moratorium on bankruptcy, relief in licensing and other licensing procedures, direct payments from the budget, etc. Government support measures are likely to have a stabilizing effect. However, each enterprise in these conditions is forced to independently and efficiently look for ways to survive, retain staff, established business contacts. This article will discuss some methods of making managerial decisions to preserve production in crisis conditions.",

It is clear that this forced and extreme measure has negative prospects both for laid-off employees and for the enterprise itself in the future. The social responsibility of the business encourages management to search for and use measures to retain staff, such as: changing the schedule of staff, reallocating employees, making paid holidays, sick leave, switching to part-time work, retraining staff, and expanding staff qualifications. If there is no alternative to staff reductions, staff optimization should be carried out as sparingly as possible: by transferring to subsidiaries, using early preferential pension programs and compensatory payments.

To determine the parameters of financial transactions, property and risk assessment, statistical methods of financial and economic calculations are used. Financial calculations are a tool not only for fixing, but also for assessing market expectations of various financial outcomes (discount and interest rates, exchange rates, payback ratios and performance standards, tax rates, insurance premiums, margins, annuities, etc.), performed, as a rule, in conditions of uncertainty and risk, taking into account future gains or losses. Simple types of financial calculations cover calculations of bank interest, deposit, borrowing and tax rates, rental, collateral, leasing, lend-lease, social payment rates and benefits, usually determined by directly assigning their sizes. More sophisticated methods are used to analyze contractual insurance, investment, exchange, currency, trust, and other transactions in the face of uncertainty and risk. This also includes the calculation of the outcomes of special financial transactions, their unfixed benefits or losses, transactions with securities, forward, futures and options transactions, factoring and forfaiting, exchange and all over-the-counter transactions carried out in conditions of extreme uncertainty and, therefore, complete risk [6] . A special place among the methods of mathematical support for management is occupied by decision-making methods in situations of uncertainty or risk, studied by game theory. This is a mathematical theory that develops recommendations on the most rational course of action for each of the participants in a situation where their interests are opposite (in a conflict situation) with repeated occurrence. Participants in conflict situations may agree on joint actions or act independently from each other, communicate their decisions to other participants or not inform about them. At the same time, none of the parties can fully control the situation. So, from the position of game theory, setting the price of a product in a competitive environment is a conflict. It is beneficial for the conflict participant to set the maximum price, but at the same time, a competitor's price reduction can lead to an outflow of customers and a decrease in revenue. In conflict situations, each player seeks to find the best action strategy for himself, having only a general idea of the set of response actions acceptable for the partner. Another type of conflict occurs in a situation of uncertainty, when one of the partners acts randomly (the so-called games with nature). Methods for choosing the optimal strategy in games with nature of is one the most effective decision-making tools in a crisis economic situation.",

The need to take decisive anti-crisis measures puts into action previously unused opportunities, solutions and communications in the field of management, science, technology, finance, education, etc. When choosing methods for stabilizing a business, much attention is paid to production optimization methods, a significant part of which is based on the use of qualitative methods, advanced management experience, and the other part is based on quantitative approaches. In a difficult socio-economic situation, an entrepreneur, businessman or leader has a reliable means of assistance, which are economic and mathematical methods. In their arsenal there is a variety of opportunities for quantitative analysis, mathematical modeling, strategic choice, econometric forecasting, solving optimization problems.
