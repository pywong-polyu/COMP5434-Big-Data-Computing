The green scatterplot trend line represents new HCC absences per day secondary to either not wearing full PPE with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 or symptom development concerning for COVID-19. During the early phases of the pandemic, the presumption was that there was not substantial community transmission. It was believed that suspected patients could be screened and appropriately grouped based upon symptoms, travel, and exposure history. What resulted was a cohort-based PPE approach where HCCs used full PPE only when treating higher risk patients. As COVID-19 cases increased, it became difficult to adequately screen patients based on what was an evolving symptom profile alone, especially critically ill patients who were initially triaged to resuscitation rooms. Concurrently and as the increased disease prevalence became evident, a more targeted testing strategy ( Figure S1 ) rapidly expanded to encompass a broader group of patients ( Figure S2) , which led to variability in testing. Patients who were not identified and tested during an initial HCC encounter, and thus were not initially evaluated in full PPE, were sometimes tested by a subsequent HCC and found to be positive.",

After implementing a robust, triage testing protocol where full PPE was required for every patient encounter and testing was performed preceding patient rooming in the main ED, there were no more exposure-related HCC absences despite continued increases in COVID-19 diagnoses (Figure 2 ). The substantial initial number of HCC absences may have been prevented with broad and consistent use of full PPE during the early stages of the pandemic, with transition to a more targeted approach after the disease presentation and local community prevalence was better quantified. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Many of the early absences described were in asymptomatic HCCs who had an exposure. Initially, our institutional policy dictated all exposures without full PPE required a 14-day home quarantine. This accounted for 39% of the total absences ( Figure 1) . The policy was revised on March 20 allowing for asymptomatic HCCs to return to work with a mask. This resulted in a brisk decrease in total HCC absenteeism ( Figure  2) . Anticipating and planning for extra HCC coverage at institutions that have implemented more conservative return-towork policies may ensure adequate HCC staffing.",

            "text": "The institutional policy regarding testing HCCs was quite variable over time given testing shortages. Initially, only those HCCs who were symptomatic were tested, but the implementation of this policy remained somewhat variable. Most COVID-19 tests for HCCs took days to result. The protocol for HCC testing initially categorized tests for HCCs as outpatient tests, and often did not prioritize them over inpatient tests. Waiting for a negative test result caused delays in return to work for many HCCs. Implementing rapid testing that prioritizes are several areas of intervention that potentially could have decreased the number of absences, despite the large increase in new COVID-19 patients. These include patient isolation and PPE strategies, patient and HCC testing protocols, institutional policies on HCC exposures, and travel restrictions. Figure 2 depicts HCC absenteeism during March 2020 with a superimposed timeline of significant events during this month. Total HCCs absent are represented in gray. New patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ED are represented in black per the day in which the patient was tested in the ED, which was not always the day in which their test resulted. The blue scatterplot trend line represents the date that HCCs who were not wearing full PPE were exposed to patients with COVID-19. There was typically a discrepancy between date of exposure and date of absence given the delay in patient test results. The yellow scatterplot trend line represents new symptom development concerning for COVID-19 in HCCs. Some of those HCCs were initially asymptomatic after an exposure and HCCs may decrease days absent overall. 20 Others have suggested implementing more frequent temperature checks for employees, as well as creating teams of clinicians who always work the same shift to minimize interactions between teams. 21 Of those who required an absence, 39% had engaged in domestic or international travel, and all were symptomatic. Interestingly, 80% of the HCCs who tested positive for COVID-19 had a travel history (Figure 1 ). Early HCC travel restrictions could lessen the number of HCC absences due to travel-associated transmission during pandemics.",

Median HCC age was 32 years (interquartile range 28-39), and median number of days absent was four (interquartile range 3-7). While 16 (57%) of the total absences were secondary to a known exposure, 12 (43%) were symptomatic without a known exposure. A total of 25 (89%) absent HCCs received COVID-19 testing (N = 5 positive [20%]; N = 20 negative [80%]) with test results returning in 1-10 days. Eleven (39%) symptomatic HCCs had traveled domestically or internationally in the prior 30 days. Conclusion: Emergency departments should anticipate substantial HCC absences during the initial surge of a pandemic. Possible interventions to mitigate absences include early and broad use of PPE, planning for many asymptomatic HCC absences secondary to exposures, prioritizing HCC virus testing, and mandating early travel restrictions.
