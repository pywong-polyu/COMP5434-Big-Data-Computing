Since then more than four million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported around the globe. The current gold standard for etiological diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis of respiratory tract specimens, but the test has a high false-negative rate due to both nasopharyngeal swab sampling error and viral burden. Hence diagnostic imaging has emerged as a fundamental component of current management of COVID-19 patients. Currently, highresolution computed tomography (CT) is the main imaging tool for primary diagnosis and evaluation of disease severity in patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging has become a safe bedside imaging alternative that does no expose the patient to radiation, and minimizes the risk of contamination. Although the number of studies to date are limited, LUS findings have demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, comparable to those of chest CT scans.

Similarly, at the visceral pleura-lung air boundary, approximately 0.5 cm deeper and between upper and lower ribs in adults, almost all (> 99.9%) of the incident ultrasound is reflected back, leaving little to image beyond pleura (Aldrich 2007; Arbelot et al. 2020; Bouhemad B. et al. 2007 ). The result is that in a normally aerated lung, the only detectable structure is the pleura, visualized as a highly hyperechoic horizontal line (pleural line) ( Figure 1 ). This boundary appears as white band (lung/pleural line) measuring up to 2 mm (Koegelenberg et al. 2012) . Movement of visceral pleura over parietal pleura produces lung sliding, which makes the this white band appear dynamic.

The reasons for these lines are not completely understood, but are multifactorial; possibly they represent acoustic channels of varying shapes and sizes generated by altered peripheral air-tissue space caused by pathological conditions. In essence, B-lines define discrete laser-like vertical hyperechoic reverberation artifacts that arise from the pleural line extending to the bottom of the screen without fading, moving synchronously with lung sliding. These B-lines are often visible in the images and are indications of abnormality, but they are not specific to a single pathology. However, clinical information accompanying imaging can help to distinguish different pathologies represented by B-lines. For example, the B-lines in a pregnant woman's lung sonogram, forming a pattern of vertical lines radiating into the lung tissue, indicated severe pulmonary edema, complicating previously undiagnosed pre-eclampsia (Zieleskiewicz et al. 2013 ). This presentation would not be associated with pulmonary fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as they are typical pathologies of advanced age. Similarly, cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by regular, laser-like, bright B-lines, particularly evident bilaterally on the lung bases (due to the gravitational effect on cardiogenic edema), without spared areas, and the pleural line is regular (Dietrich et al. 2016) . Conversely, in inflammatory lung disease such as viral pneumonia (including early stages of COVID-19), the pleural line is usually irregularly thickened (blurred), and with a characteristic distribution: monofocal or multifocal, patchy or inhomogeneous involvement, surrounded by spared areas and with no gravitational distribution.

When the density of the peripheral (subpleural) lung parenchyma increases, but not to the extent that it reaches consolidative state, as often happens in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) including COVID-19-induced ARDS, ultrasound examination shows a white area in which no horizontal reverberations (A-lines) nor separated Blines are visible ( Figure 5 ).

The patient was admitted to the emergency department with fever, cough, asthenia, headache, myalgia, and photophobia for one week. The patient denied any travel during the prior months, but reported a history of contact with several Chinese people (none with documented COVID-19 infection) and Italian people from the City of Bergamo, currently considered a high-risk area for COVID-19 infection. His on-air oxygen saturation was 90% and low-flow oxygen therapy was started. The patient was evaluated with a portable lung ultrasound performed with 3.5 MHz convex probe. The portable device was used to minimize the risk of contamination and subsequent nosocomial spread despite its lowerquality images, compared to more advanced ultrasound imaging systems. The thorax was scanned at bedside using the 12-lung-areas approach: anterior superior and inferior, lateral superior and inferior, posterior superior and inferior, bilaterally. Lung ultrasound examination clearly documented signs of interstitial-alveolar damage with bilateral, diffuse pleural line abnormalities, subpleural consolidations, white lung areas, and thick, irregular vertical artifacts (B-lines). Spared areas were present bilaterally, mixed with pathological areas. In addition, the team reported a control case, imaged with the same device using the same ultrasound settings, performed during the same ED shift on a 38-year-old woman with high-grade fever, diffuse muscle and joint pain and cough, coming from a high-burden coronavirus area in Northern Italy, who eventually tested negative for COVID-19.

Observations included: whether the pleural line was smooth, continuous or interrupted; the distribution, number and fusion of Blines in the peri-pulmonary area of both lungs; the echo, location, shape and range of peripulmonary lesions; whether there was air bronchogram sign, or air bronchogram sign in the consolidation; and blood flow in the consolidation. All twenty COVID-19 patients reported by Huang et al (Huang et al. 2020) had a history of risk factors, suggestive symptoms, and positive blood testing. The pathological status of reported patients ranged from mild focal to severe bilateral interstitial patterns and lung consolidation. In terms of LUS findings, most cases showed a patchy distribution of interstitial artifactual signs such as single and/or confluent vertical artifacts, and small white lung regions. Subsequently these patterns extend to multiple areas of the lung surface, and further evolution of the disease is represented by the continued patchy appearance of small subpleural consolidation along with associated areas of white lung. These conditions present as fused B-lines and scattered B-lines (waterfall signs) in the imaging. The pleural line is unsmooth, discontinuous or interrupted. The subpleural lesions show patchy strips, and nodule consolidation, in which the air bronchogram sign can be seen. The involved interstitial tissues show obvious thickening and edema, the pleura shows localized thickening, and there is localized pleural effusion around the lesions. More consolidations, especially in a gravitational position, with or without air bronchograms, and their increasing extension along the lung surface indicate disease progression to a phase of respiratory insufficiency requiring invasive ventilator support. It was observed that pleural effusions are uncommon. During the recovery phase of COVID-19 the reappearance of A-lines was observed. In COVID-19 patients, the lesions were mostly located in the posterior fields of both lungs (Huang et al. 2020). Multiple discontinuous or continuous fused B-lines (waterfall sign) under the pleural line (Figure 6 a), or diffused B-lines (white lung sign) with disappearing A-lines (Figure 6 b) were observed. The B-lines had blurred edges and no bifurcation signs. The origin point of the subpleural lesion was more obtuse (convex array probe) compared with that of Blines of pulmonary edema, as shown in Figure 6 c. High-frequency ultrasound showed that the pleural line was unsmooth and rough, as shown in Figure 7 a, and interrupted as shown in Figure 7 b, mainly due to the decreased gas content and sound wave reflection in the subpleural alveoli and interstitial lesions. Multiple small patchy consolidations were observed in the subpleural lesion, as shown in Figure 8 a, and strip consolidation was shown in Figure 8 b and c.
