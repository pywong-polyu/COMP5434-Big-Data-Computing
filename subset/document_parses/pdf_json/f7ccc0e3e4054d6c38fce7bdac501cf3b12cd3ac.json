Besides the clinical benefits, they are thought to be less costly than the injectable-containing regimens, for both the patient and the health system. STREAM is the first randomised controlled trial with an economical evaluation to compare all-oral and injectable-containing 9-11-month MDR-TB treatment regimens. Methods and analysis Health system costs of delivering a 9-month injectable-containing regimen and a 9-month all-oral bedaquiline-containing regimen will be collected in Ethiopia, India, Moldova and Uganda, using 'bottomup' and 'top-down' costing approaches. Patient costs will be collected using questionnaires that have been developed based on the STOP-TB questionnaire. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the cost utility of the two regimens, from a health system perspective. Secondary objectives include estimating the cost utility from a societal perspective as well as evaluating the costeffectiveness of the regimens, using both health system and societal perspectives. The effect measure for the cost-utility analysis will be the quality-adjusted life years (QALY), while the effect measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis will be the efficacy outcome from the clinical trial. Ethics and dissemination The study has been evaluated and approved by the Ethics Advisory Group of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and also approved by ethics committees in all participating countries. All participants have provided written informed consent. The results of the economic evaluation will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Trial registration number ISRCTN18148631.",

MDR-TB is a form of tuberculosis (TB) caused by bacteria that cannot be treated with two of the most powerful, first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. Globally, in 2017, there were a little over half a million people with TB resistant to rifampicin, and out of these, 82% had MDR-TB. 1 The WHO's End TB Strategy is among the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. It was adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2014 with the aim of reducing TB deaths by 90% and new cases by 80% between 2015 and 2030, as well as reducing to zero the number of households incurring catastrophic costs due to TB by 2020. Currently, global TB incidence is falling at 2% per year, which is Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The economic evaluation of STREAM will be the first study to estimate the costs incurred by both patients undergoing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment and the healthcare system within a phase III randomised controlled trial. \u25ba The detailed costing and analysis in four different settings will provide valuable insights into the timings and drivers of the costs associated with implementation of a 9-month all-oral bedaquilinecontaining regimen. The study will generate important evidence needed for future policy decisions and the shaping of targeted interventions. \u25ba The trial setting means that additional research costs (e.g. costs for collecting pharmacokinetic samples, social support costs paid for by the study) that would not be incurred in a routine setting will be incurred. These research costs will be separated out and eliminated from the costing analysis. Additionally, the experience of participants and delivery of health services (e.g. frequency of visits) will in places, inevitably deviate from routine practice, with implications for patient and health system costs. Though we will attempt to adjust for these differences in analysis, guaranteeing no interference may not be possible.",

Careful evaluation of alternative treatment strategies is vital to ensure the most effective and feasible approaches are implemented. The December 2019 WHO rapid communication recommends the use of shorter, all-oral, bedaquiline-containing regimens for patients with MDR-TB. 3 It seems that all-oral regimens, as opposed to those containing injectables, are becoming the preferred option for treatment of MDR-TB as data from the South African TB programme had suggested them to improve patient outcomes. Replacing the injectable with bedaquiline resulted in better treatment success and better adherence. 3 Besides the clinical benefits, it is also thought that the all-oral treatment leads to lower costs from a health system and patient perspective. 4 It is therefore crucial to test these hypotheses via an RCT in multiple settings. Furthermore, to date, no phase III trial has included an economic analysis of the 9-month bedaquiline-containing regimen, making it difficult for policymakers to assess the economical and financial impact. STREAM is the first randomised phase III trial to include such an analysis, to compare the all-oral, bedaquiline-containing and injectable-containing 9-11month MDR-TB treatment regimens.",
