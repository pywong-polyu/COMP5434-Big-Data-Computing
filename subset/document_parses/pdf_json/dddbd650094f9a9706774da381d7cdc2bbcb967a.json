The most common clinical characteristics were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%) [4] . The single-cell RNA sequencing datasets indicated that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung type II alveolar cells, colon colonocytes, ileum ECs, and proximal tubule cells [5, 6] . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urine, blood, anal swab, and oropharyngeal swab from nine patients with COVID-19 who were retested by qRT-PCR [7] . The above evidence revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can affect respiratory system, digestive system, hematological system, and urinary system which were associated with the clinical features of COVID-19. Moreover, the single-cell transcriptome analysis identified that ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) genes are relatively high coexpression in podocytes and proximal tubule cells [8] .",

The authors were connected to clarify vagueness or absence of the data, and related data were extracted by consensus if the authors were unavailable.2.4. Data Synthesis and Analysis. The Review Manager meta-analysis software, version 5.3 was applied to analyze the indicators. The standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous data. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated for dichotomous data. Heterogeneity was estimated through the chi-square test and Higgins I 2 test. A fixed-effect model was applied if the studies were sufficiently alike (P > 0.10); otherwise, a random-effects model was employed. A Z score was calculated to detect the overall effect, with significance set at P < 0.05. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot if the number of included studies > 10. Study Selection. The process of study selection was showed inFig. 1. After filtering, COVID-19 patients were divided into severe and nonsevere groups in 28",
