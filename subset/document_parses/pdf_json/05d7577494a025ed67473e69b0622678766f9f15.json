            "text": "The red alga Kappaphycus striatus is economically important food species and extensively cultivated throughout most tropical parts of the world as a source of carrageenan. In this note, the primary structure of a new lectin KSL from this alga was elucidated by the rapid amplification method of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends, which consists of 267 amino acid residues distributed in four tandem-repeated domains of about 67 amino acids and sharing 43% of identity. The calculated molecular mass from the deduced sequence was consistent with that of natural KSL (27,826 Da) determined by electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry. The primary structure of KSL showed high similarity to those of the high mannose N-glycan specific lectins from marine red algae, ESA-2 from Eucheuma serra, EDA-2 from Eucheuma denticulatum, KSA-2 from Kappaphycus striatum, KAAs from Kappaphycus alvarezii and SfLs from Solieria filiformis, and from microorganisms, BOA from Burkholderia oklahomensis, MBHA from Myxococcus xanthus, OAA from Oscillatoria agardhii and PFL from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Furthermore, KSL showed anticancer effects against five carcinoma cell lines, HT29, Hela, MCF-7, SK-LU-1 and AGS, in a dose-dependent manner with the IC 50 values of 0.80-1.94 \u00b5M, whereas its inhibition activities on cancer cells were not detected in the presence of yeast mannan, an inhibitor against lectin KSL. The cultivated red alga K. striatus could also be a good source of functional lectin(s) for application as anticancer agents.",

            "text": "A new lectin KSL from red alga K. striatus was purified by a combination of extraction with aqueous ethanol, ethanol precipitation, gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography with the yield of 25.1 mg from 1 kg of the frozen algal powder ( Table 1 ). The relative molecular mass of the lectin was estimated to be about 28,000 Da in both nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE conditions, indicating that lectin exists in monomeric form (Fig. 1a) . By electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry, the molecular mass of KSL was determined to be m/z: 27,826 Da (Fig. 1b) , which agrees well with the apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa observed in SDS-PAGE. The hemagglutination activities of KSL were not inhibited by any of the monosaccharides but strongly inhibited by yeast mannan with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 1.9 \u03bcg/ml, which has high-mannose type N-glycans in the molecules, indicating that the lectin is specific for high-mannose N-glycans. The cDNA of KSL consisted of 1066 bp containing 76 bp of 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR), 804 bp of an open reading frame (ORF) and 186 bp of 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) (Fig. 2) . The ORF coded a polypeptide of 268 amino acids including an initiating methionine. The primary structure of KSL has four tandem-repeated domains, consisting of 67 amino acids each and the domains share 43% of identity each other (Fig. 3 ). KSL contains one cysteine residue at position 253 (Fig. 2) , which did not appear to be involved in disulfide bond formation. The calculated molecular mass of the deduced amino acid sequence in KSL cDNA was 27,825.2 Da, which was consistent with that of KSL (27,826 Da) determined by ESI-MS (Fig. 1b) . Small variations around these molecular masses were observed, suggesting the presence of adduct formations. The 20 N-terminal amino acid sequence of KSL, which had been determined by Edman degradation found in the deduced amino acid sequence of KSL cDNA. represents an initiation methionine. The stop codon TAA is shown as an asterisk. The italicized and non-italicized numbers represent the positions of nucleotides and amino acids, respectively KSL shared high similarity with sequences of the highmannose binding lectins from the eukaryotic marine red algae and the prokaryotic microorganisms found in the database (Fig. 4) , including ESA-2 from E. serra (GenBank accession no. P84331), EDA-2 from E. denticulatum (Gen-Bank accession no. LC057379), KSA-2 from K. striatum (GenBank accession no. LC057282), KAA-1 and KAA-2 from K. alvarezii (GenBank accession no. LC007080 and LC007081, respectively), SfL-1 and SfL-2 from S. filiformis (GenBank accession no. C0HL89 and C0HL90, respectively), BOA from B. oklahomensis (GenBank accession no. AIO69853), MBHA from M. xanthus (GenBank accession no. M13831), OAA from O. agardhii (GenBank accession no. P84330) and PFA from P. fluorescens Pf0-1 (GenBank accession no. AIO69853). KSL showed 98.1%, 94.0%, 98.9%, 99.3%, 98.5%, 81.7% and 79.0% of sequence identity with ESA-2, EDA-2, KSA-2, KAA-1, KAA-2, SfL-1 and SfL-2, respectively, whereas bacterial lectins BOA, MBHA, OAA and PFA showed lower sequence identities to KSL with values of 57.0%, 59.8%, 63.6% and 62.9%, respectively. All contain four tandem-repeated sequences of about 67 amino acids, except OAA and PFA which are composed of only two tandem-repeated homologous domains. The seven amino acid residues per a single repeat domain \"WGGREGP\", which interact with mannopentaose of a branched oligomannosyl core of Man 8 /Man 9 in BOA [16] were absolutely conserved in all the repeated domains among lectins, except only a replacement at position 259 of proline by alanine in the fourth repeat domain of KSL, which was not found out among these lectins (Fig. 4) . The structural kinship suggested that these lectins might have similar high-mannose binding specificities and biological activities.",

KSL at doses of 0.5 \u00b5M, 2.5 \u00b5M and 4.0 \u00b5M showed a reduction of cell viabilities remained at 41.7% (P = 0.019), 11.9% (P < 0.01) and 9.7% (P < 0.01) for HT29; 53.5% (P = 0.036), 12.2% (P < 0.01) and 9.9% (P < 0.01) for Hela; 55.8% (P = 0.042), 12.8% (P < 0.01) and 10.5% (P < 0.01) for MCF-7; 48.7% (P = 0.024), 15.9% (P < 0.01) and 14.3% (P < 0.01) for AGS; and 39.0% (P = 0.016), 5.0% (P < 0.01) and 3.1% (P < 0.01) for SK-LU-1 cells, respectively, as compared to the controls at 0 \u00b5M of KSL ( Recently, increasing interest has been shown in marine lectins because of their pro-apoptotic, cytotoxic and antiproliferation effects over different cell lines. These lectins present high specificity for the large number of glycoprotein receptors on tumor cell membranes [1] [2] [3] . ESA lectins from red alga E. serra inhibited the growth of HeLa and Col201 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma) at the concentrations above 1.2 \u00b5g/ml and caused the complete death of Colo201 cells at 30 \u00b5g/ml (approximately 1.07 \u00b5M). Nevertheless, MCF-7 cells had relatively high tolerance for ESA, and the cell viability was maintained above 40% even at the high doses [17] . SfL lectins from the red alga S. filiformis showed the induction of the apoptotic cell death on MCF-7 cells with value of IC 50 = 125 \u00b5g/ml (approximately 4.5 \u00b5M) [11] . PFL lectin from bacterium P. fluorescens Pf0-1 presented also a significant effect on decreasing the viability of MKN28 cells (human gastric cancer) at dose of 0.5 \u00b5M or higher by 72 h [18] . Although these lectins share repeated domain structures and high-mannose binding specificities, but they differ from each another in amino acid sequences, which may lead to subtle differences in the degree of their inhibiting activities [11, 17, 18] .",

Similar case has been reported for PFL lectin, its effect on MKN28 cells was inhibited in the presence of yeast mannan [18] . Sugahara et al. [17] verified that the cell viability induced by ESA lectins was decreased after the treatment of Colo201 cells with \u03b1-mannosidase, \u03b2-mannosidase and endoglycosidase H to cleave high mannose type sugar chains on cell surface. These data combine with the recent reports on the presence of the high-mannose structures on the surface of Hela and MCF-7 cells [19] [20] [21] corroborate that the lectins interacted with cancer cells through their surface mannose branches. Therefore, the anticancer activity of KSL is able to specifically bind fluorescens Pf0-1. The identical amino acids are indicated by shading. Residues underlined are amino acids of the carbohydrate binding sites according to Ref. [16] , except position 259 of alanine in the fourth repeat domain of KSL between lectin and high-mannose oligosaccharides present on the surface of the cancer cells. The results suggested that KSL has the potentiality to represent broad activities against anticancer cells possessing high-mannose glycans on their surface. However, to obtain a better understanding of anticancer effect, we need studies furthermore in details of each cell line. It is important that anticancer lectin is isolated from a globally cultivated edible algal species and will become a strong tool by being supplied in bulk for application.",
