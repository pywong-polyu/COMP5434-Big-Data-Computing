Conclusion Postponement of cancer screening due to COVID-19 has resulted in a backlog of individuals needing to undergo structural examination of the colon. The experience during the initial COVID-19 surge with urgent evaluation of the colon for transplant patients prior to transplant suggests that CTC can be done in a lower risk manner as compared to other structural examinations. The procedural profile of CTC is advantageous during this pandemic as maintaining social distancing and preserving healthcare supplies including PPE are of paramount importance. CTC is an important option to utilize in the screening armamentarium to allow effective screening of average risk asymptomatic individuals in the COVID-19 era.",

CTC images are acquired by a single healthcare worker (typically a CT technologist) who is briefly in close proximity to the patient while inserting a small flexible catheter a short distance into the rectum. The CT technologist can monitor colonic insufflation while standing > 6 feet away from the patient and then moves to the CT control room for the remainder of the procedure thus maintaining social distancing. CTC is performed with disposable equipment, the filter on CTC catheters prevents contamination of the insufflator, and technologists have minimal contact with stool when disposing of the tubing at the conclusion of the examination. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in stool samples of patients with COVID-19 infection [7, 8] . Although the risk of spread by fecal aerosolization is unknown, use of appropriate PPE as per institutional policies for possible aerosol generating procedures (example, N95 mask) is suggested to reduce the risk of healthcare worker infection.",

Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and directives from state officials resulted in the postponement of elective procedures including cancer screening at facilities to prevent community spread and to preserve the healthcare workforce, facilities, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for an anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients [2] . Additionally, the American Cancer Society recommended that individuals should not go to a health care facility for routine cancer screening at the beginning of the pandemic in the USA [3] . As the pandemic has evolved, concerns to handle the surge have eased and a phased reopening has begun in some states with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services noting that \"it is important to restart care that is currently being postponed, such as certain procedural care\u2026, chronic disease care, and, ultimately preventive care\" [4] .

As CTC is a theoretical aerosol generating procedure (along with esophagrams, upper GI fluoroscopic studies, and contrast enemas), until more is known about fecal transmission, CTC should be performed with PPE as recommended by institutional guidelines for potential aerosol generating procedures [28] .",

The experience during the initial surge with urgent evaluation of the colon for transplant patients prior to transplant suggests that CTC can be done in a lower risk manner. The procedural profile of CTC is advantageous during this pandemic as maintaining social distancing and preserving healthcare supplies including PPE are of paramount importance. CTC is an important option to utilize in the screening armamentarium to allow effective screening of average risk asymptomatic individuals in the COVID-19 era. 2. CTC has a lower risk of colon complications such as perforation as compared to optical colonoscopy with lower likelihood of requiring an inpatient bed during the pandemic. 3. CTC is performed without sedation so there is no need for another person to accompany or drive the patient to the imaging center thus promoting social distancing. 4. No risk of an adverse reaction to anesthetic with resultant need for hospitalization during the pandemic and sedative medications are preserved for other patients. 5. CTC is easily scheduled as an early morning appointment for vulnerable patients. 6 . Curbside check-in is available to decrease time in a waiting room at some imaging centers. 7. Shorter procedural time (15-20 min) , with no need for pre-procedure IV placement or post-procedure monitoring reduces time in a healthcare facility. 8. Less direct contact with fewer health care workers (e.g., one CT technologist and/or one radiologist is intermittently in the CT suite during the exam). 9. Decreased need for personal protective compared to optical colonoscopy as more healthcare workers are required for optical colonoscopy (e.g., endoscopist, anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist, nurse(s) for IV placement and procedural and post-procedural monitoring). 10. CTC can better triage patients for polypectomy or surveillance depending on lesions found as compared to stool-based tests and can better detect precancerous lesions as compared to stool-based tests.",
