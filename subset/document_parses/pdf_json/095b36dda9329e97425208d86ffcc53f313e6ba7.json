His respiratory rate was increased, oxygen saturation was 88-90% with 15 lpm of oxygen, and there was tenderness in the epigastric. Laboratory results showed an increase in leucocyte 15.100/\u03bcL; D-dimer 14.04 mg/L and Albumin 1.4 g/dL. A contrast abdominal CT scan was performed, infarction was found in both kidneys and no abnormalities in other abdominopelvic organ (Fig. 2) . Abdominal pain was suspected due to mesentery ischemia caused by hypercoagulation because ischemia was seen on the kidneys, whereas renal arteries are bigger than mesenteric arteries. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular weight heparin 25,000 IU/day were administered; with the addition of tramadol 100 mg/day to reduced the pain and third-generation of cephalosporin antibiotic as bowel decontamination. On the next day, the patient felt less abdominal pain, d-dimer decreased to 8.54/\u03bcL and the medications were continued.",

After the peritoneum was incised, air came out of the peritoneal cavity and the bowel was soaked in brownish liquid and reddish black feces. We explored it and obtained about 200 cc of brownish liquid. During the surgery, we found necrosis in two locations: first, we found a round necrosis, 3 cm in diameter, yellowish black in antimesenterial site. In the second location, 20 cm whole intestinal necrosis was found at 1 m from the first site (Fig. 4) . We did bowel resection at each site of necrosis and end-to-end anastomoses by using manual suturing (Fig. 4) . The surgery duration was approximately 2 h and at the end of the surgery, intraabdominal drain was placed to help further evaluation of re-perforation occurrence. The histology showed a small bowel tissue with multiple microthrombus in submucosa, extensive haemorrhagic infarction and perforation (Fig. 5) .",

This association is thought to be because SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor found in alveolar epithelial cells in the lung, and these receptors are also detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells resulting in infection and local viral replication, and increase cytotoxic effect [4, 5] . In addition, some authors also think that organ damage in some COVID-19 patients may be caused by severe systemic inflammation caused by upregulation of cellular and natural immunity. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the activation of T lymphocytes and the inflammatory signaling pathway which ultimately results in the release of multiple proinflammatory cytokine, such as granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [6] . This cytokine cascade can eventually result in extensive cell damage, necrosis, and injury to multiple organs and may partly explain the different multisystem symptoms in patients with confirmed viral infections, including gastrointestinal necrosis [6, 7] .",

This serious condition is often fatal and can lead to vascular occlusion, colitis, obstruction, or infection. In adults, the most common cause of intestinal necrosis is acute mesenteric occlusion, and, less commonly are, perforation, chronic ischemia, inflammatory disease and other mechanical disorders [8, 9] . In our case, the bowel necrosis we found had patent blood vessels and did not involve mesenteric necrosis, therefore, we think that it might be due to microvascular thrombosis and the inflammation associated with hypercoagulability in this patient. A case reported by Gartland et al. also found a similar case in which a patient with COVID-19 had complaints of abdominal pain and developed intestinal necrosis [10] . Several studies have recently investigated the association between COVID-19 and hypercoagulability which is usually characterized by high d-dimer [11, 12] . Some patients may show prolonged thrombin time and prothrombin time, and shortened aPTT. Several other studies have shown aPTT prolongation in patients with confirmed COVID-19 [12] .",
