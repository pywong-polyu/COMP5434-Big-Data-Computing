The elbows and trochanters were the least reported sites to have acquired PUs. Contrary to this study, heels have also been reported as the most common site [15, 16] . People with disabilities usually have catheters or other devices inserted for procedures during their stay, which may account for them being the least affected by PUs; however, further studies need to be conducted to determine why some areas of the body are more prone to PUs than others. The number of cases decreased with the increase in length of stay, which is interesting as no reason can be brainstormed to back up the trend. Less number of patients who stayed for more than 40 days were included in this study. Further studies should be conducted on these patients after they are discharged and shifted to long-term care facilities to correlate the length of stay and the incidence of HAPUs.

Rather than focusing on the treatment of PUs, which costs huge amounts, preventive measures should be encouraged and taught in all healthcare settings and the community. Certified wound care nurses should be hired or trained, who would implement the already introduced policies and pressure ulcer prevention protocols of the facility. PU care plans should be developed, and immobilized patients should be regularly assessed for the risk factors of PUs. The Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses Society (WOCN) recommends minimizing/eliminating pressure, friction, and shear, regular positioning, prophylactic dressings in at-risk patients, and using incontinence skin barriers such as creams, ointments, and film-forming protectants in addition to optimum nutrition [29] .",
