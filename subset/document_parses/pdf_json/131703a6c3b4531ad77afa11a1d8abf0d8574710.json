From the beginning of the outbreak until April 30, 2020, over 90,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Iran. Due to socio-economic problems of this disease, it is required to predict the trend of the outbreak and propose a beneficial method to find out the correct trend. In this paper, we compiled a dataset including the number of confirmed cases, the daily number of death cases and the number of recovered cases. Furthermore, by combining case number variables like behavior and policies that are changing over time and machine-learning (ML) algorithms such as logistic function using inflection point, we created new rates such as weekly death rate, life rate and new approaches to mortality rate and recovery rate. Gaussian functions show superior performance which is helpful for government to improve its awareness about important factors that have significant impacts on future trends of this virus.",

            "text": "On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization [WHO] was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia which related to coronavirus family. At first, a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China causing severe respiratory disease including pneumonia. It was originally named Novel Coronavirus and this virus causing the infection has been named by The World Health Organization (WHO)-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (The faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, 2019). SARS-CoV-2 is spreading between people globally and WHO (2019) has announced that on August 16, 2020, there have been over 21 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including over 761,000 deaths. The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is adversely affecting societies and economies of countries across the globe such as increasing the unemployment rate and decreasing production. According to the results of a survey study, conducted by Imam Sadiq University, in relation to the beginning of the outbreak, 65% of the economic enterprises declared that they cut back their production, while only 4% stated that their activities increased (Iranian Students' News Agency [ISNA] , 2020). According to an another survey study by ISPA (Iranian Student Opinion Polling Center) in Tehran, about 70% of the respondents said that their household incomes had declined, due to the unfavorable effects of the coronavirus on the economy (Iranian Students' News Agency [ISNA] , 2020). Without urgent socio-economic responses, global suffering will escalate, jeopardizing lives and livelihoods for years to come. Development trajectories in the long-term will be affected by the choices countries make now and the support they receive.\" (United Nations Development program, 2020) .",

The laboratory, hospital, and epidemic characteristics of patients with coronavirus were found out and used to identify patients in and out of the ICU using the screening method of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan (Huang et al. 2020) .

Descriptive and prescriptive analytics is done on these rates and then predictive analytics was performed with applying machine-learning algorithms. In our results, Gaussian functions are the best method to predict the outbreak since it has enough power to estimate its curve, peak and end. These analytics are needed to find out how effective were policies for prohibiting COVID-19 spread by the government including isolation or closing markets have been made to diminish commuting and traffic have been chosen.",

Second, using results together with rates, help us understand reality alongside analyses to perceive situations accurately and how much can we trust predictions because great or poor rates. Other works like (Fanelli and Piazza 2020; Anastassopoulou et al. 2020 ), used algorithms like simple susceptible-infectedrecovered-deaths (SIRD), and scenario-based analysis may not be the best view for forecasting situations just because of time-series datatype. Hence, we have to do more to justify our predictions. In the descriptive phase, this research h is trying to survey recovered deaths, active confirmed growth rate, and define new weekly rates like the life rate. Analysis of mortality and recovery rates are discussed and the peak of disease is determined. In the predictive analytics phase, not only the cumulative distribution of cases is discussed to predict the peak and end of the disease, but also some functions are defined to resemble the case numbers curve.",

Iran's mortality rate has come under the global mean and is continuing under this line. Also, the recovery rate in Iran has some problems as said before, and has a lot of variation around the mean rate.
