            "text": "Internet memes have emerged as an increasingly popular means of communication on the Web. Although typically intended to elicit humour, they have been increasingly used to spread hatred, trolling, and cyberbullying, as well as to target specific individuals, communities, or society on political, socio-cultural, and psychological grounds. While previous work has focused on detecting harmful, hateful, and offensive memes, identifying whom they attack remains a challenging and underexplored area. Here we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we create a dataset where we annotate each meme with its victim(s) such as the name of the targeted person(s), organization(s), and community(ies). We then propose DISARM (Detecting vIctimS targeted by hARmful Memes), a framework that uses named entity recognition and person identification to detect all entities a meme is referring to, and then, incorporates a novel contextualized multimodal deep neural network to classify whether the meme intends to harm these entities. We perform several systematic experiments on three test setups, corresponding to entities that are (a) all seen while training, (b) not seen as a harmful target on training, and (c) not seen at all on training. The evaluation results show that DISARM significantly outperforms ten unimodal and multimodal systems. Finally, we show that DISARM is interpretable and comparatively more generalizable and that it can reduce the relative error rate for harmful target identification by up to 9 points absolute over several strong multimodal rivals.",

Besides being popularly used to express benign humour, Internet memes have also been misused to incite extreme reactions, hatred, and to spread disinformation on a massive scale. Numerous recent efforts have attempted to characterize harmfulness (Pramanick et al., 2021b) , hate speech (Kiela et al., 2020) , and offensiveness (Suryawanshi et al., 2020) within memes. Most of these efforts have been directed towards detecting malicious influence within memes, but there has been little work on identifying whom the memes target. Besides detecting whether a meme is harmful, it is often important to know whether the meme contains an entity that is particularly targeted in a harmful way. This is the task we are addressing here: detecting the entities that a meme targets in a harmful way.",

Essentially, the meme in Fig. 1a harmfully targets Justin Trudeau directly, while causing indirect harm to Canadians and to Muslims as well.

An end-to-end solution requires (i) identifying the entities referred to in the meme, and (ii) deciding whether each of these entities is being targeted in a harmful way. To address these two tasks, we perform systematic contextualization of the multimodal information presented within the meme by first performing intra-modal fusion between an external knowledge-based contextualized-entity and the textually-embedded harmfulness in the meme, which is followed by cross-modal fusion of the contextualized textual and visual modalities using low-rank bi-linear pooling, resulting in an enriched multimodal representation. We evaluate our model using three-level stress-testing to better assess its generalizability to unseen targets.",

            "text": "Misconduct on Social Media. The rise in misconduct on social media is a prominent research topic. Some forms of online misconduct include rumours (Zhou et al., 2019) , fake news (Aldwairi and Alwahedi, 2018; Shu et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2020 ), misinformation (Ribeiro et al., 2021 Shaar et al., 2022) , disinformation (Alam et al., 2021; Hardalov et al., 2022) , hate speech (MacAvaney et al., 2019; Zhang and Luo, 2019; Zampieri et al., 2020) , trolling (Cook et al., 2018), and cyber-bullying (Kowalski et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2021) . Some notable work in this direction includes stance (Graells-Garrido et al., 2020) and rumour veracity prediction, in a multi-task learning framework (Kumar and Carley, 2019), wherein the authors proposed a Tree LSTM for characterizing online conversations. Wu and Liu (2018) Facebook (Kiela et al., 2020) introduced the task of classifying a meme as hateful vs. non-hateful. Different approaches such as feature augmentation, attention mechanism, and multimodal loss re-weighting were attempted (Das et al., 2020; Sandulescu, 2020; Zhou et al., 2021; Lippe et al., 2020) Web-entity detection along with fair face classification (Karkkainen and Joo, 2021) and semisupervised learning-based classification (Zhong, 2020) were also used for the hateful meme classification task. Other noteworthy research includes using implicit models, e.g., topic modelling and multimodal cues, for detecting offensive analogy (Shang et al., 2021b) and hateful discrimination (Mittos et al., 2020) in memes. Wang et al. (2021) argued that online attention can be garnered immensely via fauxtography, which could eventually evolve towards turning into memes that potentially go viral. To support research on these topics, several datasets for offensiveness, hate speech, and harmfulness detection have been created (Suryawanshi et al., 2020; Kiela et al., 2020; Pramanick et al., 2021a,b; Gomez et al., 2020; Dimitrov et al., 2021; Sharma et al., 2022) .",

The targeted entities are coarsely classified into four social groups: individual, organization, community, and the general public. While these coarse classes provide an abstract view of the targets, identifying the specific targeted person, organization, or community in a fine-grained fashion is also crucial, and this is our focus here. All the memes in this dataset broadly pertain to US Politics domain, and they target well-known personalities or organizations. To this end, we manually re-annotated the memes in this dataset with the specific people, organizations, and communities that they target. Extending Harm-P (Ext-Harm-P). Towards generalizability, we extend Harm-P by redesigning the existing data splits as shown in Table 1 . We call the resulting dataset Ext-Harm-P. It contains a total of 4,446 examples including 1,594 harmful and 2,852 non-harmful; both categories have references to a number of entities. For training, we use the harmful memes provided as part of the original dataset (Pramanick et al., 2021b), which we re-annotate for the fine-grained entities that are being targeted harmfully as positive samples (harmful targets). This is matched with twice as many negative samples (not-harmful targets). For negative targets, we use the top-2 entities from the original entity lexicon, which are not labeled for harmfulness and have the highest lexical similarity with the meme text (Ferreira et al., 2016) . This at least ensures lexical similarity with the entities referenced within a meme, thereby facilitating a confounding effect (Kiela et al., 2020) as well. For the test set, all the entities are first extracted automatically using named entity recognition (NER) and person identification (PID) 2 . This is followed by manual annotation of the test set.",

We chose CLIP as a preferred encoder module for contextualization, due to its impressive zero-shot multimodal embedding capabilities. At first, valid entities are extracted automatically, as part of the process of creating training/validation sets. Then, for each meme, we first obtain the contextualized-entity (CE) representation by fusing the CLIP-encoded context and the entity representation. CE is then fused with BERT-based (Devlin et al., 2019) embeddedharmfulness (EH) encoding fine-tuned on the OCR-extracted text and entities as inputs. We call the resulting fusion output a contextualizedtext (CT) representation. CT is then fused with the contextualized-image (CI) representation, obtained using the CLIP encoder for the image. We, henceforth, refer to the resulting enriched representation as the contextualized multimodal (CMM) representation. We modify the multimodal lowrank bi-linear pooling (Kim et al., 2017) to fuse the input representation into a joint space.",

All results we report are averaged over five independent runs. Evaluation Strategy. With the aim of having a realistic setting, we pose our evaluation strategy as an open-class one. We train all systems using under-sampling of the entities that were not targeted in a harmful way: using all positive (harmful) examples and twice as many negative (nonharmful) ones. We then perform an open-class testing, for all referenced entities (some possibly unseen on training) per meme, effectively making the evaluation more realistic. To this end, we formulate three testing scenarios as follows, with their Harmful (H) and Non-harmful (N) counts: Baseline Models.

GRU, XL-Net: For the unimodal (text-only) systems, we use GRU (Cho et al., 2014) , which adaptively captures temporal dependencies, and XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) , which implements a generalized auto-regressive pre-training strategy. Experimental Results. We compare the performance of several unimodal and multimodal systems (pre-trained or trained from scratch) vs. DISARM and its variants. All systems are evaluated using the 3-way testing strategy described above. We then perform ablation studies on representations that use the contextualized-entity, its fusion with embedded-harmfulness resulting into contextualized-text, and the final fusion with contextualized-image yielding the contextualizedmultimodal modules of DISARM (see Appendix B for a detailed ablation study). 7 This is followed by interpretability analysis. Finally, we discuss the limitations of DISARM by performing error analysis (details in Appendix C). All Entities Seen During Training: In our unimodal text-only baseline experiments, the GRUbased system yields a relatively lower harmful recall of 0.74 compared to XLNet's 0.82, but a better overall F1 score of 0.75 vs. 0.67 for XLNet, as shown in Table 2 . The lower harmful precision of 0.65 and the not-harmful recall of 0.52 contribute to the lower F1 score for XLNet. 7 We use the abbreviations CE, CT, CI, CMM, EH, and MMLRBP for the contextualized representations of the entity, the text, the image, the multimodal representation, the embedded-harmfulness, and the multimodal low-rank bilinear pooling, respectively.",

Fig. 5 shows the attention maps for an example meme. It depicts a meme that is correctly predicted to harmfully target the Democratic Party by DISARM and incorrectly by ViLBERT. As visualised in Fig. 5a , the harmfully-inclined word killing effectively attends not only to baby, but also to Democrats and racist. The relevance is depicted via different color schemes and intensities, respectively. Interestingly, killing also attends to the Democratic Party, both as part of the OCRextracted text and the target-candidate, jointly encoded by BERT. The multimodal attention leveraged by DISARM is depicted (via the CLIP encoder) in Fig. 5b , demonstrating the utility of contextualised attention over the male figure that represents an attack on the Democratic Party. Also, DISARM has a relatively focused field of vision, as shown in Fig. 5c , as compared to a relatively scattered one for ViLBERT (see Fig. 5d ).

However, in our case, we do not train such models from scratch; rather, we fine-tune them on a relatively small dataset. We trained all our models using PyTorch on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, with 32 GB dedicated memory, CUDA-11.2 and cuDNN-8.1.1 installed. For the unimodal models, we imported all the pre-trained weights from the TORCHVISION.MODELS 8 , a sub-package of the PyTorch framework. We initialized the remaining weights randomly using a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.02. We train DISARM in a setup considering only harmful class data from Harm-P (Pramanick et al., 2021b). We extended it by manually annotating for harmful targets, followed by including non-harmful examples using automated entity extraction (textual and visual) strategies for training/validation splits and manual annotation (for both harmful and nonharmful) for the test split.",

In contrast, EH yields an impressive F1 score of 0.55, and a harmful recall of 0.41. This relative gain of 7% in terms of F1 score could be due to the presence of explicit harmfulness cues. The complementary effect of considering contextual information can be inferred from the joint modeling of CE and EH, to obtained CT, that enhances the F1 score and the harmful recall by 2% and 3%, respectively (see Table 5 ). Unimodal assessment of CI performs moderately with an F1 score of 0.51, but with a poor harmful recall of 0.15. MMLRBP, towards joint-modeling of CE and CI yields a significant boost in the harmful recall to 0.52 (see Table 5 ). On the other hand, MMLRBP-based fusion of EH and CI yields 0.54 F1 score, which is 1% below that for the unimodal EH system. This emphasizes the importance of accurately modeling the embedded harmfulness, besides augmenting with additional context. A complementary impact of CE, EH, and CI is observed for DISARM with a balanced F1 score of 0.6 and a competitive harmful recall value of 0.69. ",

Much better performance is observed for unimodal setups including EH, and its joint modelling with CE with improved F1 scores of 0.56 and 0.58, respectively, along with the harmful recall score of 0.56 and 0.57, respectively. CI based unimodal evaluation again yields a moderate F1 score of 0.53 (see Table 5 ), along with a poor harmful recall of 0.19, which shows its inadequacy to model harmful targeting on its own. For multimodal setups, the joint modelling of CE and CI benefits from MMLRBP based fusion, yielding a gain of 7% and 13% in terms of F1 score and harmful recall, respectively. This confirms the importance of contextual multimodal semantic alignment. Correspondingly, joint multimodal modelling of EH and CI regresses the unimodal affinity within the EH. Finally, DISARM outperforms all other systems in this category with the best F1 score of 0.64, with a decent harmful recall score of 0.7. The experimental results here are for comparison and analysis of the optimal set of design and baseline choices. We should note that we performed extensive experiments as part of our preliminary investigation, with different contextual modelling strategies, attention mechanisms, modelling choices, etc., to reach a conclusive architectural configuration that show promise for addressing the task of target detection in harmful memes.",

This is also analogous to a fundamental challenge associated with detecting implicit hate (MacAvaney et al., 2019) . In this particular example, despite modelling contextual information explicitly in DISARM, it misclassifies this meme anyway. Even though the context obtained for this meme pertains to its content (see Fig. 6 ), it does not relate to global racial prejudice, which is key to ascertaining it as a harmfully targeting meme. Moreover, besides context, visuals and the message embedded within the meme do not convey definite harm when considered in isolation. This error can be inferred clearly from the embeddedharmfulness, contextualised-visuals, and the visuals being attended by DISARM as depicted in Fig. 6a, Fig. 6b , and Fig. 6c , respectively. On the other hand, as shown in the visual attention plot for ViLBERT in Fig. 6d , the field of view that is being attended encompasses the visuals of Kamala Harris, who is the person of colour that i sbeing primarily targeted by the meme. Besides the distinct attention on the primary target-candidate within the meme, ViLBERT could have leveraged the pre-training it received from Conceptual Captions (CC) (Sharma et al., 2018), a dataset known for its diverse coverage of complex textual descriptions. This essentially highlights the importance of making use of multimodal pre-training using the dataset that is not as generic as MS COCO (Lin et al., 2014) , but facilitates modelling of the complex real-world multimodal information, especially for tasks related to memes.",

According to Pramanick et al. (2021b) , a harm can be expressed as an abuse, an offence, a disrespect, an insult, or an insinuation of a targeted entity or any socio-cultural or political ideology, belief, principle, or doctrine associated with that entity. The harm can also be in the form of a more subtle attack such as mocking or ridiculing a person or an idea.Another common understanding 9,10,11 about the harmful content is that it could be anything online that causes distress. It is an extremely subjective phenomenon, wherein what maybe be harmful to some might not be considered an issue by others. This makes it significantly challenging to characterize and hence to study it via the computational lens.Based on a survey of 52 participants, Scheuerman et al. (2021) defines online harm to be any violating content that results in any (or a combination) of the following four categories: (i) physical harm, (ii) emotional harm, (iii) relational harm, and (iv) financial harm. With this in mind, we define two types of referencing that we have investigated in our work within the context of internet memes: (i) harmful and (ii) non-harmful.",

A prominent way of harmfully targeting an entity in a meme is by leveraging sarcastically harmful analogies, framed via either textual or visual instruments (see Fig. 7a ).2. There could be multiple entities being harmfully targeted within a meme as depicted in Fig. 2 . Hence, annotators were asked to provide all such targets as harmful, with no exceptions.3. A harmful targeting within a meme could have visual depictions that are either gory, violent, graphically sensitive, or pornographic (see Fig. 7b ).4. Any meme that insinuates an entity on either social, political, professional, religious grounds, can cause harm (see Fig. 7c and 7d).5. Any meme that implies an explicit/implicit threat to an individual, a community, a national or an international entity is harmful (see Fig. 7d and 7e).6.

At the same time, non-harmfully referenced organizations includes the Biden camp and the Trump administration, which are mostly leveraged for harmfully targeting (or otherwise) the associated public figure. Finally, communities such as Mexicans, Black, Muslim, Islam, and Russian are often immensely prejudiced against online, and thus also in our meme dataset. At the same time, non-harmfully targeted communities such as the Trump supporters and the African Americans are not targeted as often as the aforementioned ones, as we can see in Table 6 .The above analysis of the lexical content of the memes in our datasets largely emphasizes the inherent bias that multimodal content such as memes can exhibit, which in turn can have direct influence on the efficacy of machine/deep learningbased systems for detecting the entities targeted by harmful memes. The reasons for this bias are mostly linked to societal behaviour at the organic level, and the limitations posed by current techniques to process such data. The mutual exclusion for harmful vs. non-harmful categories for community shows the inherent bias that could pose a challenge, even for the best multi-modal deep neural systems. The high pervasiveness of a few prominent keywords could effectively lead to increasing bias towards them for specific cases. At the same time, the significant overlap observed in Table 6 for the enlisted entities, between harmful and not-harmful individuals, highlights the need for sophisticated multi-modal systems that can effectively reason towards making a complex decision like detecting harmful targeting within memes, rather than exploit the biases towards certain entities in the training data.

Trump and the Republic Party have memetext length distributions similar to the non-harmful category: skewing left, but gradually decreasing towards the right. This suggests a varying content generation pattern amongst meme creators (see Fig. 8 ). The meme-text length distribution for Biden closely approximates a normal distribution with a low standard deviation. Both categories would pre-dominantly entail creating memes with shorter text lengths, possibly due to the popularity of Biden amongst humorous content creators. A similar trend could be seen for the Democratic Party as well, where most of the instances fall within the 50-75 memetext length range. The overall harmful and nonharmful meme-text length distribution is observed to be fairly distributed across different meme-text lengths for Mexican. At the same time, the amount of harm intended towards the Black community is observed to be significantly higher, as compared to moderately distributed non-harmful memes depicted by the corresponding meme-text length distribution in Fig. 8 .",
