            "text": "Nonresponse is a common problem in survey sampling. Appropriate treatment can be challenging, especially when dealing with detailed breakdowns of totals. Often, the nearest neighbor imputation method is used to handle such incomplete multinomial data. In this article, we investigate the nearest neighbor ratio imputation estimator, in which auxiliary variables are used to identify the closest donor and the vector of proportions from the donor is applied to the total of the recipient to implement ratio imputation. To estimate the asymptotic variance, we first treat the nearest neighbor ratio imputation as a special case of predictive matching imputation and apply the linearization method of Yang and Kim (2020). To account for the non-negligible sampling fractions, parametric and generalized additive models are employed to incorporate the smoothness of the imputation estimator, which results in a valid variance estimator. We apply the proposed method to estimate expenditures detail items based on empirical data from the 2018 collection of the Service Annual Survey, conducted by the United States Census Bureau. Our simulation results demonstrate the validity of our proposed estimators and also confirm that the derived variance estimators have good performance even when the sampling fraction is non-negligible.",

However, in addition to collecting this information, many surveys request and produce sets of compositional variables (details) that sum to a total, such as a breakdown of total expenditures by type of expenditure or a breakdown of total income by source. Examples from the United States Census Bureau include the 2020 Current Population Survey's Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement which defines total household earnings as the sum of total wages and salaries, farm income, and self-employment income and the 2018 Services Annual Survey (SAS) which requests detailed breakdown of the sampled business' reported total expenditures by expenditures on annual payroll, fringe benefits for employees, and expenditures on software, among other categories.",

Furthermore, there are often true zeros that differ across units. These limitations make it difficult to develop feasible parametric imputation models for each individual detail item and motivate the usage of hot deck imputation instead. Hot deck imputation -sometimes called \"donor imputation\"obtains replacement values for nonresponding (or missing) data items by matching a donor record containing valid data to a recipient record containing invalid or missing data, imputing the missing values from the donor record (Andridge and Little, 2010; Beaumont and Bocci, 2009 ). Kalton and Kaspryzk (1982) recommend using the same donor to impute sets of compositional details to preserve inter-item relationships in the multinomial data. To ensure additivity as well, it is sensible to use some form of hot deck imputation to impute the vector of proportions from a matched respondent (donor), then derive the imputed values for each imputed item by multiplying the (donated) proportion by the nonresponding recipient's total (Bankier et al., 2000; Little et al., 2008; Andridge and Thompson, 2015) .",

However, it is possible that the multinomial distribution of the details could be related to unit size. In this case, the unit size should be incorporated into the hot deck matching procedure. The simplest version selects the \"nearest\" donor using a suitable distance function such as unit size or -as in this case -the total, assumed available for all donors and recipients. Since the total is univariate, the absolute value of the difference is a natural distance function, yielding estimates that are asymptotically unbiased (Yang and Kim, 2020) . Hereafter, we refer to the imputation process that selects the nearest neighbor as donor and imputes the sets of donor proportions as the nearest neighbor ratio imputation (NNRI) method.",

This program collects aggregate and detailed revenues and expenses from a stratified sample of business firms with paid employees in selected industries in the services sector. Given a lack of auxiliary data, weak historic reporting, and a high reported zero rate, developing good predictive models for each individual detail item collected by the SAS is perhaps infeasible. That said, there are verifiable predictors of the set of detail items i.e., the multinomial distribution, specifically the industry in which the firm is classified, the tax-exempt status of the firm, and the size of the firm as measured by total revenue or total expenses. For example, a finance business will often report high proportions of total expenses in all three personnel cost categories, a scientific business is unlikely to report costs from temporary or leased employees, and a full-service restaurant would likely report most of its expenses from gross payroll and expensed equipment, materials, costs, or supplies.",

Auxiliary data are often available for direct substitution of missing or invalid totals (Beaumont et al., 2011) or for modeling. Consequently, reported totals are generally validated (edited) and imputed when necessary early in the editing process, and missing values are imputed with very strong models. Not only are they made available for all units for subsequent hot deck imputation, such totals are usually \"goldplated\" against further changes (Sigman and Wagner, 1997) .",

            "text": "In contrast, the queried sets of compositional details are generally collected for statistical reporting purposes, not accounting purposes, and are therefore not readily available (Willimack and Snijkers, 2013) . Indeed, it is likely that the reported percentage distributions are more reliably reported than the values themselves. For example, when interviewing a non-probability sample of large businesses, Willimack and Nichols (2010) learned that \"company reporters resorted (sic) to estimation strategies rather than leaving items unreported (i.e., blank). Moreover, they only used estimation schemes when company data did not include the type of detail requested on the report.\" This dovetails with the findings presented in Andridge and Thompson (2015) via a proxy pattern-mixture model analysis of selected items collected by the SAS: when annual payroll was used as the single predictor of total sales in a ratio imputation model, the fraction of missing information (FMI) values were close to zero, indicative of extremely accurate imputation models, whereas the FMI values for collected detail items using total sales as the sole predictor were near one (the maximum value). Finally, deriving hot deck imputed values by multiplying the recipient's total by the corresponding nearest-neighbor ratio is frequently used in business surveys (Beaumont and Bocci, 2009 ). In such positively skewed distributions, donating a ratio instead of a total guards against substitution of an overly large or small value from the respondent \"nearest neighbor.\" Of course, this phenomena is not confined to business surveys. For example, the 2019 ASEC reports the U.S. median income as $68, 703 \u00b1 ($904); the 95 th percentile is $270, 002 \u00b1 ($4, 831).

To make statistical inference, we derive the asymptotic linearization of the NNRI estimator, which allows us to decompose the asymptotic variance of the NNRI estimator into two components accounting for sampling and matching. Based on the asymptotic variance formula, we propose an alternative variance estimator by approximating these components by parametric or nonparametric approaches. We show the theoretical guarantees for the plug-in variance estimator. The proposed variance estimator is easily applied to a variety of probability sampling designs and accounts for non-negligible sampling fractions.",

Section 3 derives variance estimation for the NNRI estimator. In Section 4, we apply the proposed variance estimator to empirical expenditures data for reference year 2018 from a subset of industries surveyed in the SAS. The studied data are typical of many business surveys, in that many units report a total but may not provide the associated detail items, especially when the item definitions are complex or the number of requested detail items is large (Willimack et al., 2000) . The SAS uses a stratified simple random sample without replacement (SRS-WOR) design with high sampling rates in several strata. The empirical application highlights the differences between our proposed variance estimator from a naive variance estimator but does not provide insight into its statistical properties. Consequently, Section 5 investigates the finite-sample performance of the proposed over repeated stratified SRS-WOR samples via a simulation study patterned off of Andridge et al. (2021) . We close in Section 6 with some general observations along with directions for future research.",

As mentioned in Section 1, the key items collected by SAS are total revenue and total expenses; detailed breakdowns of these two totals items are requested from all sampled firms.

For total receipts and total expenses, the independent variables are either a highly correlated data item from the same reference period or historic data for the same item. The model for detail items use the corresponding totals item (reference period only). Thompson and Washington (2013) evaluated these imputation models in two of the sectors included in the SAS, explicitly fitting weighted no-intercept linear regression models within industry using respondent data to assess model fit (i.e., the PARAM1 method). For the totals, the ratio imputation models were appropriate, with adjusted-R 2 consistently above 95%. Given such strong predictors, the nonresponse adjustment is robust to the assumed response mechanism and should decrease the variance (Little and Vartivarian, 2005) . However, the results for the details items were far less convincing, with adjusted-R 2 values often well-below 75-percent and non-significant slopes (\u03b1 = 0.10). The weak predictive power of this ratio imputation approach is exacerbated in the 2020 data collection year, as many businesses were closed or had business limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not surprisingly, the SAS program managers were interested in exploring other imputation methods for these detail items, which are historically less frequently and reliably reported than their associated totals and whose imputed values are generally more difficult to independently validate.",

However, using modeled residuals for \u03c3 2 e appears to underestimate the variances, as evidenced by frequency of variance ratios with values less than one.

Despite its poor performance in this simulation study, the nonparametric method remains appealing due to its flexbility. It is possible that the model fit and estimation might be improved with a different choice of basis functions, although we would not recommend utilizing either variation with the studied industries in Section 4.

Model determination is not completely straightforward: in both the empirical application and our simulation, the frequently reported detail items tend to be strongly associated with the total, whereas the relationship between rarely-reported detail items and the total is less obvious. Nevertheless, our simulation studies provide fairly promising results in terms of bias and coverage, even with some model misspecification. In practice, one would expect that methodologists would develop and validate any implemented models after careful data analysis before implementing the proposed variance estimator.",

First, we limited ourselves to uniform and lognormally distributed size variables in our study and restricted the response mechanisms to tractable MCAR or MAR models. Thus, the sensitivity of our variance estimator to more complex MAR models or even to non-random response mechanism bears study. Second, if the proportion of recipients to donors is large, then NNRI may repeatedly use the same donor, yielding insufficient variation within each imputation cell. Andridge et al. (2021) propose a modification of the NNRI method that addresses this issue in a multiple imputation framework; it would be useful to develop a single imputation analogue. Third, in practice, many auxiliary variables can be used to determine nearest neighbors, in which case, dimension reduction is necessary to mitigate matching discrepancies. Several techniques such as propensity score (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983) , prognostic score (Hansen, 2008) , or their combination (Yang and Zhang, 2020) can be potentially adopted in the NNRI framework. Finally, this paper considers only population totals. However, extending the current framework to general parameter estimation is also feasible (Yang and Kim, 2020) . Given that hot deck imputation is used to create realistic microdata (as well as macrodata), such extensions are especially compelling topics for our future research.",

Thus, these data represent ideal conditions for the proposed NNRI variance estimators. However, business data population such as the SAS industry populations discussed in Section 4 are generally positively skewed. Consequently, we consider two lognormal distributions. The second population scenario exhibits mild deviations from the required compact support requirement, while respecting the convex support requirement (similar to the 517210, 541210, and 713110 industries' total expenses distributions discussed in Section 4). The third population scenario creates finite populations that do not exhibit the compact support requirement of Assumption 3, but resemble 221122 and 621410 industries' total expenses distributions presented in Section 4. Thus, the two lognormal population scenarios provide insights into the empirical results while testing the robustness of the proposed variance estimation approach.",
