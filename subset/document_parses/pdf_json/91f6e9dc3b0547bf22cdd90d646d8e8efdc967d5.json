While there is an abundance of genetic association studies in controlled medical settings, there is a paucity of studies with a naturalistic design in real-life clinical practice in patients with comorbidities and under multiple drug treatment regimens. African patients are often burdened with communicable and noncommunicable comorbidities, yet the application of pharmacogenomics in African clinical settings remains limited. Using warfarin as a model, this study aims at minimizing gaps in precision/personalized medicine research in African clinical practice. We present, therefore, pharmacogenomic profiles of a cohort of 503 black Africans (n = 252) and Mixed Ancestry (n = 251) patients from Southern Africa, on warfarin and co-prescribed drugs in a naturalized noncontrolled environment. Seventy-three (n = 73) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 29 pharmacogenes were characterized using a combination of allelic discrimination, Sanger sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and Sequenom Mass Array. The common comorbidities were hypertension (43-46%), heart failure (39-45%), diabetes mellitus (18%), arrhythmia (25%), and HIV infection (15%). Accordingly, the most common coprescribed drugs were antihypertensives, antiarrhythmic drugs, antidiabetics, and antiretroviral therapy. We observed marked variation in major pharmacogenes both at interethnic levels and within African subpopulations. The Mixed Ancestry group presented a profile of genetic variants reflecting their European, Asian, and African admixture. Precision medicine requires that African populations begin to capture their own pharmacogenetic SNPs as they cannot always infer with absolute certainty from Asian and European populations. In the current historical moment of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also underscore that the spectrum of drugs interacting with warfarin will likely increase, given the systemic and cardiovascular effects of COVID-19, and the anticipated influx of COVID-19 medicines in the near future. This observational clinical pharmacogenomics study of warfarin, together with past precision medicine research, collectively, lends strong support for incorporation of pharmacogenetic profiling in clinical settings in African patients for effective and safe administration of therapeutics.",

Moreover, for pharmacogenomics to be implemented in routine medical practice, genetic variation type and frequencies ought to be established not only for a given prescribed drug but also for all other commonly co-administered drugs.

Very few African populations have been studied for the genetics of warfarin response, yet warfarin use now encourages the use of pharmacogenetics algorithms (Asiimwe et al., 2020) . It is our contention that such algorithms generated with little or no data from African populations may not be effective in Africans because of quantitative and qualitative differences in important pharmacogenomic variants that affect warfarin response (Ndadza et al., 2019b) . In the era of precision medicine, pharmacogenomics has an important role, thus the growing need to genetically characterize a wide range of different African ethnic groups.",

Herbal medicines together with food interactions are cited numerously as one of the main causes of unstable International Normalized Ratio (INR) Gohil and Patel, 2007) . Importantly, the lack of knowledge on herbal medicines should not always be viewed as a negative on herbal medicines, but should be viewed as a gap in indigenous knowledge translation (Dandara et al., 2021) .

CY-P1A2*1C was higher in our study cohort among the black Africans when compared to the Mixed Ancestry (Table 3) and was similarly higher than in global populations such as the Europeans and African Americans. Both CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 expression are regulated by the transcription factors pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). The genes NR1I2 and NR1I3 encode PXR and CAR, respectively. Both PXR and CAR have been implicated in variation in EFV plasma levels in South African patients (Swart et al., 2012) . NR1I3 rs2307424 was associated with increased levels of EFV and hence increased risk of CNS adverse drug response (Swart et al., 2012) . This polymorphism occurs at a significantly lower frequency in African patients (Swart et al., 2012) than in European and Asian patients, likewise this trend was observed among the black African warfarin patients (Table 3) . Polymorphisms NR1I2 rs2472677, rs6785049 and NR1I3 rs3003596 and rs2502815 were all associated with reduced EFV plasma levels in South African HIV/AIDS patients. The presence of these polymorphisms is postulated to increase expression of CYP2B6 and CYP1A2, hence increasing metabolism of EFV and lowering its concentration in the blood. NR1I2 rs2472677C>T occurs at a significantly higher frequency in African populations than in both Asian populations, implying the failure of viral suppression maybe higher in African patients with HIV on warfarin treatment coprescribed EFV, than their European and Asian counterparts.",

CYP2C8 variants show ethnic bias with CYP2C8*2 occurring at a frequency of 21% in black African patients co-prescribed warfarin. However, *2 is rare in individuals of European descent and occurs in 7% of the Mixed Ancestry South Africans. CYP2C8*2 (rs11572103) is associated with lowered intrinsic clearance of the enzyme's metabolites and may therefore be an important variant in African populations, especially those with less European admixture. Similarly, CYP2C8*3, another CYP2C8 variant with lowered activity, is rare in African populations, but occurs in 20% of European populations (Daily and Aquilante, 2009 ). CYP2C8*4 (rs1058930), another variant associated with low enzyme activity, is rare in African populations, but occurs at a frequency of 1% in European individuals.",
