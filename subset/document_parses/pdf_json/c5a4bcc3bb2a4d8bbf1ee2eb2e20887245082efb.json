What this paper adds \u2022 This paper adds evidence-based knowledge how virtual instructional teams, and their instructors navigated the broken connectivity situation when a global external health crisis forced students to transition from campuses to home environments in the middle of the collaboration project. \u2022 It offers practical ideas how faculty used technology to connect with students and maintain class community in cases of inequal access to technology from home environments by using multiple platforms, and both, computer, and mobile enabled communication. \u2022 It offers examples of student-centered, coaching-like teaching strategies and how these were applied when the global health crisis affected students in instructional teams. Implications for practice and policy \u2022 The study offers implications for development of digital pedagogies for future; specifically, how to develop students' virtual intelligence and to promote intercultural awareness and collaboration skills in future higher education. \u2022 The pandemic experiences shed additional light on the need to develop and acquire soft skills among students, for them to be able to navigate struggles and crisis in global, digital real workplace.",

With globalization, the expectations for employees to master work and communications in global teams are intensifying (Society for Human Resource Management, 2019). But no one anticipated the impact of COVID-19, which caused one of the fastest workplace adaptations in the history of societies, moving many organizations and teams entirely to remote work. While many organizations are still navigating the transformation, universities face the challenge of helping students acquire skills for the global digital workplace: virtual teamwork, project management, business communication and intercultural competence. The emergence of the global pandemic in 2020 reinforced the need for online experiential learning. Many students cannot take advantage of hands-on international experiences by participating study abroad programs due to due to financial constraints, and presently the pandemic restrictions have made such experiences rare even for the most privileged ones. Therefore, instructors are increasingly turning to internationalization-at-home (IaH) as an alternative (Dietrich, 2020) . Collaborative online international learning (COIL) programs are an example of such efforts. COIL projects involve students around the globe working virtually on collaborative technologies for several weeks up to an entire semester. By doing so, students gain indispensable experiential learning for future employability (Starke-Meyerring, 2010).",

Over nearly a decade, this modest venture of three faculty members developed into a global virtual team project involving more than 500 students from sixteen institutions in seven countries in 2020. This project can be embedded as a COIL element to any course to offer students online experiential learning of virtual work, project management and intercultural communication skills. The project engages students in active learning online in a collaboration project with peers from other universities around the world for six weeks (Bonwell & Eison, 1991; Harris et al., 2020) . Students are assigned to virtual teams, each student from a different location and institution, often representing different course curricula. Using team collaboration platforms and video conferencing tools available for free, such as Slack and Zoom, teams research and write a report on a business case. This temporary, virtual teaming around a real client project with members from geographically dispersed locations addresses the need to develop virtual and cultural intelligence as well as digital communication savviness in preparation for the digital and global workplace.",

In many countries, universities were forced to close campuses and switch to online delivery. Project X itself did not change since it already was a virtual collaboration project. Nevertheless, most students found themselves facing disruptions and challenges caused by campus closures, such as access to technology and space when working from home. Although there was no alteration due to the online transition in Project X itself, the attending faculty members and their students were in a unique position to observe how a crisis affects global teams and to experience how online collaboration tools were used to maintain emotional and personal connection during the disruptive global health crisis. More importantly, post-pandemic world will see more online environment than before, and these lessons from the pandemic world will be even more relevant to the emerging new hybrid workplace.",

This paper takes a cross-disciplinary approach and draws on research of organizational teams and virtual work to explore the adaptations of teamwork and teaching strategies in Project X during the COVID-19 crisis. The results demonstrate how maintaining emotional and personal connections and ensuring co-presence through technology during disruptive events helped participants to successfully accomplish the Project X during the early weeks of COVID-19 crisis. These results are discussed and put into the context of existing research, elucidating practices that may be useful in technologyenabled collaboration in remote learning programs and experiential teams through times of crisis. Additionally, implications are drawn for digital pedagogies and teaching strategies to help students develop soft skills to navigate the digital workplace and build competencies for global collaboration in organizations.",

Dependence on digital instead of face-to-face communication creates challenges such as how to understand each other without the cues that face-to-face meetings provide, how to work across cultural differences, how to build trust and relations amongst team members you have never met and perhaps never will (Crisp & Jarvenpaa, 2013; Lee et al., 2020) .

Many campuses were closed around the world and instruction was forced to go online where technology infrastructure allowed, nearly overnight. The pandemic and the consequential shift towards remote work can be seen as an opportunity to rethink instruction and learning strategies in higher education. It may be argued that more research is needed on pedagogical and technological designs to construct online learning spaces in general (see, eg, Duvall et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2013) . While there is research on class designs embracing active learning and on use of inclusive tools and techniques in synchronous and asynchronous student online collaborations (see, eg, Bouhnik & Deshen, 2014; Harris et al., 2020; Lage et al., 2000; Montelongo & Eaton, 2020) , more research is needed to address sudden disruptions in such online collaborations; how to develop inclusive teaching strategies to address inequalities among students in terms of crisis effects and experiences, and how to use educational technologies to maintain emotional and personal connections during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Due to the lack of studies on virtual teams in educational settings during an external crisis, this research utilizes studies in organizational settings regarding managing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in remote teams. Hacker et al. (2020) provided insights on the role of technology in building connectivity during the pandemic crisis lockdown measures. Wang et al. (2021) explored work-from-home (WFH) early in the COVID pandemic and identified four kinds of challenges: work-home interference, communication related challenges, deferment and isolation. Virtual team researcher Gibson (2020) collected data on practices that office teams used to combat the negative impacts of transitioning to remote work during the lockdowns. Sudden social distancing practiced in many Asian, European and North American countries in the early weeks of the pandemic may have resulted in inequality, isolation, and hopelessness on the individual level, Gibson (2020) noted. Inequality may include differences in access and preparedness to use technology or be associated with professions that cannot be carried out remotely. Social distancing is fundamentally contradictory to the basic human need for belonging through connection with one another, and thus may lead to a sense of isolation. The social and psychological effects of the health crisis may in turn to feelings of hopelessness (Gibson, 2020) . Gibson (2020) observed three clusters of positive practices that workplace teams used in fighting back the negative effects of social distancing: inclusion, co-presence and vitality. Inclusive organizational practices have the potential to combat inequalities while understanding different parties based on their unique experience, socio-economic context and various skills to connect with means of technology in order to \"cultivate a sense of belonging\" (Gibson, 2020, p. 165) . Co-presence, in turn, refers to interpersonal social contacts through use of technology, such as virtual coffee hours with colleagues while working from home (Abel & McQueen, 2020) . Co-presence offers opportunities to turn social distancing into distant socializing via the use of technology, creating a sense of psychological, physical, and social proximity. Connecting with others can give a sense of energy, forming a source of vitality. Gibson (2020) coined these three clusters of practices to combat the negative effects of the pandemic crisis into the concept of care-in-connecting.",

The faculty team including 19 professors shared the objective of providing students a global virtual teamwork experience to develop digital communication and intercultural competencies and integrated Project X in their various business communication courses for six weeks. The project was embedded in their syllabi and was thus compulsory for all students who enrolled in a course that included the Project X. Students received a grade for Project X at the end of the project, which was evenly split between individual participation points and the final report team grade. In order to participate, professors agreed to make Project X account for at least 10% of the final course grade. The motivation behind making the project substantially contribute to the individual student's course grade was to increase student commitment to the work of the project. The professors synchronized instruction in terms of project assignments used to scaffold learning in teams during the six-week project. They also shared assessment criteria to grade the final reports produced by the teams. At the start of the project, all students from the participating classes were randomly assigned to global virtual teams. Each team consisted of 5-6 students from different universities and represented two to four different countries. After the project ended, the hosting classes typically resumed to the regular instruction mode, either in person, hybrid or online format. Due to the pandemic, all hosting classes remained in a remote learning mode.",

Care-in-connecting was operationalized as team belonging, which was measured with two survey items drawing on Allen and Meyer's (1990) affective commitment scale: I felt emotionally invested in my team, and I felt strong belonging to my team (\u03b1 = 0.87). The 90 teams were classified into low-belonging teams, medium-belonging teams and highbelonging teams based on the responses to items on the questionnaire. The lowest 30 teams for these items were categorized as low-belonging teams (M = 3.18; SD = 0.46), the middle 30 teams as medium-belonging teams (M = 4.15; SD = 0.23) and the highest 30 teams were classified as high-belonging teams (M = 5.00; SD = 0.38).",

These items were selected from Aritz and Walker (2014) to measure inclusion. Moreover, student perception of co-presence was measured following their experience of technology-mediated connection using Slack, a platform that provides communication and collaboration options for teams (see, eg, Azarova et al., 2020) . Finally, the items from the attitude toward using technology subscale of the UTAUT-2 instrument (Venkatesh et al., 2012) were utilized as a measure of technology acceptance: Slack made the project more interesting; Working with Slack was fun; I liked working with Slack (\u03b1 = 0.95).

The online design of the project empowered all participants to do that in their own way. Professors kept the regularity of meeting in a physical classroom by meeting with students online through weekly WebEx or Zoom sessions. To simulate the classroom environment, one faculty member opened their digital Zoom classroom 10 minutes before the class hour for students to \"hang out\" with classmates like they used to do on campus. WhatsApp class groups created by one instructor became invaluable to overcome technology challenges with mobile messaging platform application and to reinforce a sense of collective belonging. Additionally, students used the platform for seeking help, obtaining missing information, or just for checking in with others-many students posted a simple but compassion-filled question not only to fellow students but also to the professor: \"How are you professor?\" (F10).

The results in this study illustrate how technology-enabled social presence was used to build much needed emotional and personal connection by faculty and students during the social distancing. Hafermalz and Riemer (2020) suggest that interpersonal connectivity is achievable through skillful work with technology, even with low social and technical connectivity, as was the case during the transition from campuses to homes in the Project X. Many faculty members responded by using alternative technologies-Zoom, Skype, Slack, WhatsApp-to maintain class connectivity and foster belonging. Professors adopted new practices such as personalizing communication via Zoom and WhatsApp, adding empathy and behavioral engagement into these interactions, thus intensifying efforts to build social presence in the virtual classroom (Biocca et al., 2003) . Multiple ways of being together online represented deliberate attempts to develop online inclusion and co-presence with selected technologies to overcome low social and technical connectivity as organization scholars suggest (Gibson, 2020; Hafermalz & Riemer, 2020; Kolb et al., 2020) . Therefore, this study also extends the research on teaching practices fostering a sense of belonging (Kirby & Thomas, 2021) . Ultimately, the results suggest that the transition to an exclusively digital environment changed the role of an information-transfer and instruction-based instructor to a coach and mentor, creating a greater sense of inclusion in student-faculty interactions.",

While post-secondary education has advanced slowly in recent decades, the year 2020 marks a watershed moment (Trombly, 2020) . Many institutions may continue to provide more online learning opportunities given the comfort and convenience of collaboration tools. At the same time, students at record rates continue to report depression, anxiety, and loneliness, in large part due to physical isolation. Further research is needed about the shifting roles of instructors in this environment. Do online instructors need to adopt more of a coaching and mentoring mentality? Does fostering carein-connecting become an overriding concern in all online instruction? What activities and technologies can instructors use to fulfill these roles more effectively?",

It exemplifies how the project participants used a variety of technologies and adaptive learning and teaching strategies to combat the social and technology disruptions. In the post-pandemic world, remote work will be even more ubiquitous than before, and the lessons from the pandemic world will gain relevance in the emerging hybrid workplace.
