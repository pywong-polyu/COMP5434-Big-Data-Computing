Aims: To evaluate the clinical performance of AusDiagnostics respiratory multiplex tandem PCR assay including SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We reviewed the results following implementation of AusDiagnostics respiratory multiplex tandem PCR assay including SARS-CoV-2, and compared with an in-house RT-PCR assay at our State Reference Laboratory. Results: Initial validation using AusDiagnostics coronavirus multiplex tandem PCR assay including SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated good concordance with the State Reference Laboratory. After implementing the AusDiagnostics respiratory multiplex tandem PCR assay including SARS-CoV-2, we tested 7,839 samples. 127 samples in which SARS-CoV-2 was detected using the AusDiagnostics assay were referred for testing at the State Reference Laboratory, with concordant results in 118/127 (92.9%) of samples. After resolution of discrepancies, 125/127 (98.4%) of AusDiagnostics results were determined to be true positive results. Out of 7,839 samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 during this period, only 2 tests (0.02%) were indeterminate results. Conclusion: The AusDiagnostics respiratory MT-PCR assay is a reliable assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2.",

The Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory provided a proficiency-testing panel that represented a titration series of gamma-irradiated virus isolate diluted 1/1,000 to 1/256,000. Subsequent testing (20 March -17 April 2020) utilised the AusDiagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 12-well assay (catalogue number 80618) with targets for Bordetella pertussis. The AusDiagnostics platform uses SYBR Green detection and reports a semi-quantitative result using 1+, 2+ detection up to the maximum of 5+ rather than a cycle threshold (Ct) value. Molecular target concentrations, expressed as arbitrary units, are calculated relative to the internal control SPIKE, which amplifies a known amount of target molecules. The AusDiagnostics assay was compared to SARS-CoV-2 in-house real-time TaqMan PCR performed at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (18). RNA extraction was performed at the reference laboratory using the QIAamp 96 Virus QIAcube HT Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the genetic target of was the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene. Further testing of discordant samples was undertaken using assays targeting the envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes.",

Performance of the AusDiagnostics assay on the proficiency panel serial dilutions indicated high analytic sensitivity. Furthermore, any person with ongoing symptoms during this study period who fulfilled testing criteria was encouraged to have a repeat test as per national guidelines (19) in order to minimise the risk of false negative results and no further positive patients were identified. After resolution of discrepancies by pyrosequencing or incorporation of other results from the patients, only two of 7,839 (0.02%) samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 were indeterminate results, as there was insufficient amplicon for pyrosequencing and no further positive samples.
