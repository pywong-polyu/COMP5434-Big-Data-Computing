Central to this approach is overcoming barriers to research involvement and interdisciplinary collaboration. Identifying barriers has been the subject of several studies focused on communities with large academic hospitals. The Windsor-Essex region is currently built around community hospitals which have less of an emphasis on research, employ fewer physicians holding academic appointments and generally do not provide incentivised time for research and training. In this study, we surveyed clinicians and researchers working in Windsor-Essex to gain insight into barriers to translational research important to those working in smaller sized, community-based research networks.",

Schedule incompatibility, funding issues and identifying interested collaborators with overlapping interests were identified as barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration by 80% of participants.

Unlike academic centres, community centres like WRH have less research funding, employ many physicians that lack academic appointments and do not generally provide incentivised protected time for research or training; though a precise definition is lacking [11] . While most clinical and translational research conducted in Canada takes place in these large academic centres, the benefits of conducting research in community hospitals like WRH is substantial for both researchers and patients [11] . Given the limitations of previous work, we set out to examine which TR barriers are important to a smaller research community and community-based hospitals. We surveyed clinicians and health researchers from Windsor-Essex and specifically examined participants' confidence in research tasks, opinions on TR, barriers to health research participation and interdisciplinary collaboration. We identified several major barriers to research and collaboration in our community and found that those struggling with their research involvement perceived barriers differently. Our findings will inform decision-making in the Windsor-Essex research community and contribute to the understanding of TR barriers in smaller centres.",

We also asked participants about their satisfaction with research involvement, faculty appointments, time spent on research and research area. We then divided participants into the following groups: clinical care provider vs non-clinicians, and happy vs unhappy with current research involvement. Much of the questionnaire was adapted from previous studies that explored these barriers in other locations [7] [8] [9] 12] . Others were designed by the research team based upon their experiences working in Windsor-Essex. We choose not to collect certain demographics, such as age, gender, and specific research area, as these are beyond the scope of the study and could potentially allow for individual participants to be discerned in our relatively small research community.",

Amongst faculty members from the targeted faculties at the UoW, we received 40 responses from an estimated 447 members [Response Rate (RR) = 9%]. 24 physicians from WRH responded out of an estimated 485 physicians (RR = 5%). 14 allied health professionals also contributed, but we are unable to estimate a total number of these professionals that were recruited. A total RR is likely higher than each individual RR combined due to physicians that are also UoW faculty.",

The largest differences were in publishing results, applying for research funding, and writing research protocols (Fig. 1B) .

We also sorted our findings into 3 of the 5 thematic barriers identified in the narrative synthesis by Fudge et al.

We included participants with various research interests from clinical and non-clinical backgrounds across a range of disciplines; reflecting the growing group of professionals that contribute to health research [4] (Additional file 1: Figure S1 , Table 1 ). 46% of study participants felt unhappy with their current research involvement and 83% of these individuals felt that research was important for their career progression (Additional file 1: Figure S2) (Table 1 ). This suggests that there is a group of This group felt that lack of mentorship and institutional support were significantly more impactful than those that were happy with their current research involvement (Fig. 1A) . The data agrees with a survey of Canadian respiratory workers, which suggested that lack of mentorship was a more important barrier for those not involved in research when compared to those actively engaged in research [12] . Clinicians and non-clinicians ranked barriers to research participation relatively equally (Fig. 1A) , with more than 85% of participants selecting managing competing activities, lack of time, funding, and infrastructure as a barrier.

Previous studies have also suggested that this lack of confidence could be a barrier to participating in interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly with colleagues who are more research focussed [9, 12] . Clinicians and non-clinicians generally agreed on the benefits and barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration ( Fig. 2A) ; with 80% identifying schedule incompatibility, lack of funding, identifying interested collaborators and lack of shared infrastructure as a moderate or major barrier. Both groups also tended to find traditional research metrics, such as publications, presentations, and citations, as the [3] ; including \"Research Process\", \"Interdisciplinary Collaboration\" and \"Concepts of Translational Research. \" most significant metric of research productivity (Fig. 3) . This is in contrast to previous work which suggested that clinical researchers found incorporation into clinical guidelines as more important than publications [14] . Furthermore, non-clinicians were more confident in their understanding of TR and largely felt that they had the necessary training to contribute to TR. Non-clinicians also felt that their research was either already translational or requires translation (Fig. 4) .",
