The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the occupational stressors experienced by restaurant and food service workers during the COVID-19 pandemic through a detailed assessment of their lived experiences. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns within data from sixteen semi-structured interviews with people employed or recently employed in the restaurant industry during July of 2020. Five themes were highlighted including fear of being exposed to the COVID-19 virus while working under inadequate safety policies, job insecurity, inconsistent pay and hours and a lack of health benefits and paid time off, all of which increased occupational stress and led to uncertainty if respondents would return to the restaurant industry. Hardships associated with the pandemic were mitigated by the support and connections fostered by the communities built within the restaurants. Results led to several recommendations to address the social and economic contributors to occupational stress at the structural and population levels which can be used in the current and post-pandemic workplace.",

Theoretical models of workplace stressors, although varied, attribute elevated stress to an imbalance between inputs (demands, costs, efforts) and outputs (gains, control, rewards) [26, 27] . Recent studies of the restaurant and hospital sectors have shown that organizational practices such as increasing workloads without increased compensation and lack of transparency in revised operating procedures during the pandemic had led to more job insecurity, lowered job satisfaction, occupational stress, emotional exhaustion, and less organizational commitment [28, 29] . Similarly, our participants reported decreases in job control with the continued shutdowns and lack of clarity in health and safety protections, decreases in rewards with less and variable pay and hours while at the same time experiencing increased work demands due to understaffing, increased duties, and efforts expended towards controlling customer behavior. Increasing social support has been shown to mitigate the effects of these imbalances which was also seen in our findings as the community aspects of restaurant work alleviated stress for many of our participants [30] . Finally, our findings were consistent with the understanding that role conflict and role ambiguity leads to higher levels of stress [31, 32] . Our findings showed a disconnect between the expectations of the work prior to and during the pandemic and little if any effort to clearly define the new operating procedures and the responsibilities of enforcement.",
