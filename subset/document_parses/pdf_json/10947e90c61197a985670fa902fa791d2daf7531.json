Today we know that clinically relevant depression and anxiety are more common in people with MS than in the general population, which significantly reduces their quality of life [1, 2] . A systematic review [3] states the lifetime prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms in people with MS to be approximately 35%, others estimate it being even as high as 50% [4] . Somewhat lower are the prevalence values for anxiety disorders in MS patients, which vary from 22-36% [3, 5] .",

Though there are differences in intensity and manifestation, the universality of concern for death is widely recognized and is an essential object of human thinking. While MS is a treatable condition today [7] , the multitude of physical and psychological impairments that can arise throughout the course of the disease [3] may intensify awareness of and anxiety about death. Hence, it seems plausible that people who are confronted with a chronic disease that can severely restrict their lives are more likely to be engaged in thoughts and worries about death than healthy people [8] . Patients with MS have an average reduced life expectancy of 7-14 years, with range depending on the individual study [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, as the cause of death in MS patients in over two thirds is due to direct or indirect consequences of their disease [12] , thoughts on existential questions may be more salient as well.",

The scale is based on Templer's death anxiety scale [15] , Lester's death anxiety scale and the question inventory for multi-dimensional evaluation of experience of dying and death (FIMEST). In the BOFRETTA scale, which is semi-quantitative, participants indicate their accordance with its statements by choosing between \"does not apply at all\" (1 point), \"applies slightly\" (2 points), \"applies predominantly\" (3 points) or \"applies mostly\" (4 points). As its qualitative component, participants may express personal thoughts or concerns towards death in three free-text columns. An example of this qualitative data concerning death anxiety: \"Die Gewissheit, dass mein Leben auf der Erde begrenzt ist, macht mir Angst,\" [The certainty that my life on earth is limited, scares me]; and an example concerning attitude: \"Ich habe eine negative Einstellung zum Tod als das absolute Ende meines Lebens,\" [I have a negative attitude to death as the absolute end of my life]. As further qualitative analysis, participants could express personal thoughts or concerns about death in three open questions. This questionnaire was sent to patients by mail after their individual sessions with an accompanying letter explaining the use of this questionnaire. The participants then returned the questionnaire with an enclosed reply envelope.",

The tests and questionnaires used in the sessions covered cognition and fatigue, using the multiple sclerosis inventory of cognition (MUSIC), as well as depression and anxiety, using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS [17] . MUSIC consists of five short subtests: a two-trial word-list-learning-paradigm (A1 and A2) and an additional one-trial distractor list (list B), a time-limited verbal fluency task with alternating categories (vegetables vs. clothes), a Stroop-like interference-test and, finally, a delayed recall measure. MUSIC raw-scores are weighted following discriminant analysis and transformed on the basis of mean and standard deviations. Age and education effects are considered by differential scoring (20-30 pts: normal range; 16-19 pts: mild cognitive dysfunction; 11-15 pts: moderate cognitive dysfunction; <10 pts: severe cognitive dysfunction).",

In other words, anxiety was not significantly associated with age, CI or disability in MS patients. However, there were significant group differences between anxious and non-anxious patients. Patients with anxiety symptoms had clinically relevant fatigue symptoms more often than those without.

Contrary to HADS-A, HADS-D showed significant correlations with MUSIC, fatigue scores or EDSS, meaning that depressive symptoms are more likely to be associated with fatigue symptoms, disability, and CI. As symptoms of fatigue often overlap with symptoms of depression (e.g., exhaustion, tiredness, etc.), the strong relationship between depression and fatigue makes sense. In fact, some studies have found that there is a correlation between fatigue and depression [21, 22] . Furthermore, the connection between depression and disability (EDSS) is also comprehensible, as both can be traced back to structural changes in the central nervous system [23] . Depression could therefore be partly explained by disability and fatigue. The same applies, partially, to CI. Numerous studies have shown that CI has a negative impact on other parts of life, such as social and working life, which can lead to unemployment and low quality of life [24, 25] . Factors such as unemployment and quality of life are, in turn, also associated with depression [26] .",

However, both group differences, between anxious and non-anxious as well as depressive and non-depressive patients, remained significant. Additionally, all effect sizes, except for attitude towards death and anxious/non-anxious patients, showed a moderate effect. This could be seen as the patients converting their death anxiety into \"situational anxiety\", which is seen as a coping strategy, since it limits the perception of one's own finitude [27] . In comparing these findings to the general impairment of MS patients no correlations were found. Neither fatigue nor cognitive impairment showed significant correlations with BOFRETTA 2.0. Only EDSS score correlated significantly with either death anxiety or sum score after controlling for covariables. This can be interpreted as different measures for impairment being overlapping constructs. Since EDSS score considers cognitive domains as well as physical limitations it is a good measure for obtaining a general impression of a patient's impairment.",

            "text": "Examining the results, it is apparent that the sample, in general, had low scores in all three subscales of the BOFRETTA 2.0. The mean score in the death anxiety subscale (M = 13.93) was not even half the maximum possible score. Attitude towards death scored just a bit higher, on average (M = 19.38), as it did for sum scores (M = 33.3) of BOFRETTA 2.0. Most strikingly, 98.2% of the participants had a score of 47 or lower. As rates of death anxiety are not high in MS patients in general, according to our findings, one might ascribe this to the fact that views about death are very individual. The fact that one has health issues or a diagnosis like MS does not necessarily result death anxiety, as the individual might have a positive attitude towards it. Taking the findings of Juckel and Mavrogiorgou [14] and Chmielewski et al. [19] into account, personality traits could explain some of the results. In all previous BOFRETTA studies a positive relationship between neuroticism and death anxiety was found. This means that the low scores in death anxiety, in this sample, could be discussed as a manifestation of a personality dimension. It is possible that this sample was low on neuroticism or had an above-average increased openness, both of which, in turn, may be preventive against anxiety. Another reason for this low score may be the relatively long disease duration of each patient. Since MS is a life-long disorder and the average disease duration in this sample was 15 years, it could be argued that early or enduring confrontation with a disabling disease has led to a more mature attitude towards human finitude.",

            "text": "The challenge in research on death anxiety is definition. First, from within the different types of established death anxiety, our focus was on the personal prospects of death and dying; that is, existential death anxiety, which stems simply from the knowledge that human life is finite. Secondly, the capability for realizing this finitude is bound to different conditions, such as awareness of the distinction between self and other, fullness of sense of personal identity, and ability to anticipate the future [28] . Hence, we take death anxiety as the \"possibility of a mental occupation with dying and death\", \"which is associated with anxiety, tension, dysphoric excitement and the like\" and assume it to reflect knowledge of one's own and others' mortality [29] . This awareness can lead to fearing the inevitable, i.e., death anxiety. There are many definitions and theories around death anxiety, some of them distinguish between fear \"of a thing\" and fear of \"something that is nothing\" and some others describe death anxiety as \"a negative emotional reaction provoked by the anticipation of a state in which the self does not exist\" [30] . Hoffmann [31] differentiates between reactive and existential fears of death. Reactive fear implies a specific stressful situation, which subsides again after the duration of the acute stress phase or else is localized externally, thus giving the individual the opportunity to adapt to the fear. In this context, fear of death can be interpreted as a state of fear \"that accompanies a subjectively experienced threat to one's own life\" and as such, is a natural reaction to acute danger to life. An existential fear, on the other hand, is more prolonged and hence corresponds more to a \"basic emotional state\". In this case, the fear is located within the person and cannot be confronted, thus is not opposable. It seems apparent that in order to reduce existential fear, many people will subconsciously transform it into situational fear. This conversion of death anxiety into situational anxiety limits the perception of one's own finitude and has therefore been regarded as a coping strategy [27] . Failure of such coping strategies may serve as a catalyst for the establishment of mental disorders like depression, as the pathologic dimensions of death anxiety have been considered to relate to other mental disorders, e.g., anxiety disorders [32] . Interestingly, although evidence indicates that death anxiety is expected to be the most powerful unconscious psychodynamic dynamism in today's emotional life [33] , it remains a taboo topic that lacks substantial data.",

This might be due to the fact that MS is a treatable disease, today, and participants were not in a constant state of concern for their death since their disease's chronicity might induce adaptation with time. Interestingly, and somewhat contrary to our assumptions, chronic disease itself was not responsible for increased levels of death anxiety. It is more likely that personal dispositions, comorbidities and affective disorders, rather than physical impairment, play a role here. Essentially, this is also what was shown in the results: the actual psychopathological status (representing an anxiety-depressive mood) has a much greater impact on the subject of death than the limitations caused by the neurological disorder itself. This is similar to the results obtained from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, who showed relatively low levels of death anxiety despite being even more impaired than MS patients [34] . Nevertheless, the psychopathology must be seen in the context of the physical illness since the physical impairments correlate relatively highly with depression and anxiety. Finally, however, it can be concluded that attention should be paid to an anxiety comorbidity in MS patients in order to treat this appropriately with psychiatric-psychotherapeutic treatment.",

Finally, (3) the study sought to draw from the qualitative data of the BOFRETTA 2.0 when discussing quantitative results. A significant correlation between anxiety and depression was found, as well as significant correlations between anxiety and fatigue, depression and fatigue, CI and EDSS score. These findings were consistent with other studies. However, this study revealed a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety than previous studies. Nevertheless, the most important results of this study refer to the newly developed BOFRETTA 2.0 questionnaire. It is the first time this questionnaire has been used on an MS cohort and the first time the issue of fear of death has been addressed in this way. Contrary to expectations, fear of death and the attitude towards it was low in this MS cohort. It was found that current psychopathology has a much stronger impact on the subject of death than the limitations caused by their neurological disease. Except with EDSS score, there were no significant correlations of impairment with BOFRETTA 2.0. Finally, even a burdensome diagnosis like MS does not necessarily lead to fear of death or depression and can be seen by many patients as an opportunity to make the best of it. Future research should certainly take a closer look at the subject of death because, especially in open questioning, many interesting aspects came to light that could not be dealt with here. Furthermore, it would be of great interest to study the issue of death attitudes as extensively as possible in different neurodegenerative cohorts, since little or no research has been done on the subject in the literature to date. There is a lot of potential in this topic, which will not only benefit those directly affected but also humanity in general, since it is innately bound to that which affects us all equally: the realities of sickness and of health.",

On the one hand, significant correlations between the BOFRETTA 2.0 and the HADS-D disappeared when controlling for anxiety. With HADS-A, on the other hand, there were no significant correlations with attitude towards death (rs(56) = 0.06, p = 0.687), death anxiety (rs (56) = 0.21, p = 0.125) and sum score (rs(56) = 0.15, p = 0.278), even after controlling for depression. Looking into the group differences between anxious and non-anxious people (HADS-A scores \u2265 8), significant group differences could be found in death anxiety (z = \u22123.24, p = 0.001, |d| = 0.43), attitude towards death (z = \u22120.04, p = 0.041, |d| = 0.27) and sum score (z = \u22122.93, p = 0.003, |d| = 0.39). The same applied to depressive and non-depressive people (HADS-D scores \u2265 8) regarding death anxiety (z = \u22123.01, p = 0.003, |d| = 0.4), attitude towards death (z = \u22122.51, p = 0.012, |d| = 0.33) and sum score (z = \u22122.29, p = 0.004, |d| = 0.38). All effects except for one were moderate with respect to size (Cohen, 1992). No significant correlation could be identified with death anxiety, fatigue (rs (56) = 0.114, p = 0.403) and CI (rs(56) = 0.04, p = 0.754). Only EDSS score showed significant correlation with death anxiety (rs(56) = \u22120.29, p = 0.05) Attitude towards death did not correlate significantly with fatigue (rs(56) = \u22120.09, p = 0.495), CI (rs(56) = \u22120.10, p = 0.469) and EDSS scores (rs(56) = \u22120.172, p = 0.204). Sum score showed no significant correlation with fatigue (rs(56) = \u22120.003, p = 0.983) or CI (rs(56) = \u22120.005, p = 0.970). As with death anxiety, sum scores only correlated significantly with EDSS score (rs(56) = \u22120.26, p < 0.05). When controlling for CI and fatigue, the relationships between death anxiety and EDSS score (rs(56) = \u22120.27, p = 0.043) and sum score (rs(56) = \u22120.27, p = 0.043) remained significant.",
