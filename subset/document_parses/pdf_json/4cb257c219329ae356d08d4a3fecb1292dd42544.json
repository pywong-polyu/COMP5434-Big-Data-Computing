Since 1992 an expert panel from the American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine produced a consensus statement on definition of sepsis and the stages (see table 8 ) . A systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was defined as a systemic inflammatory reaction, regardless of their etiology (infectious or noninfectious). Sepsis was, therefore, defined as SIRS resulting from a documented infection; severe sepsis as sepsis with organ dysfunction or hypoperfusion; and septic shock as presence of sepsis with refractory hypotension. The above criteria have recently been updated, dismissing the SIRS criteria and proposing prediction/ insult/response/organ dysfunction (PIRO) criteria. 9 The application of the definitions for epidemiological and clinical reporting can be problematic but does provide a framework for classification of patients.

Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant causes of sepsis in the 1960s up until the 1980s but gram-positive bacterial infections have now accounted for more than half the cases in the past 2 decades. Fungal infections such as systemic candidiasis are an increasing cause of sepsis in the ICU and immunosuppressed patients. Among the organisms causing sepsis in 2000 in the United States, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 52.1% of cases, gram-negative bacteria for 37.6%, polymicrobial infections for 4.7%, anaerobes for 1%, and fungi 4.6%. 6 The first line of defense against invading microorganisms is the innate immune system, which then triggers the adaptive component organized around specialized cells, T-cells and B-cells. There are a limited number of receptors involved in innate immune recognition (in the hundreds) which would not be able to recognize every possible foreign antigen. Thus, the innate immune system by evolution has adapted to focus on highly conserved structures present in large groups of microorganisms. 10 These structures are named pathogens-associated molecular patterns: i.e., bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptoglycan, lipoteichoic acid (plasma membrane of gram-positive bacteria), mannan (cell wall of fungi), bacterial DNA, double-stranded RNA (viral), and glucans. The pathogens-associated molecular patterns are produced only by the microorganisms and not by the hosts, and are invariant structures shared by the entire classes of pathogens. The innate immune system evolve to recognize them by pattern-recognition receptors, which are expressed on many effector cells, such as the macrophages, dendritic cells, and B-cells professional antigen-presenting cells. For example, the LPS present on all gram-negative bacteria can be detected by the pattern-recognition receptor of the host to virtually any gram-negative bacterial infections. 10 Once the pathogenrecognition receptor binds to the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, it activates the effecter cells immediately without delaying after proliferation, thus initiating a rapid host defense.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 734, "end": 735, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1229, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2077, "end": 2079, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immune Response"}, {"text": "The pattern recognition receptors can be divided into three classes: secreted, endocytic, and signalling. 10 The secreted pattern-recognition molecules (e.g., mannose-binding lectin) functions as opsonins by binding to microbial cell wall and triggers the complement system and phagocytosis.

Pathogen-derived peptides are present and form a complex with the major histocompatibility -complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of macrophages. The macrophage mannose receptor, (member of the mannose-lectin family) is an endocytic pattern-recognition receptor that recognizes carbohydrates in a large number of microorganisms and mediates their phagocytosis by macrophages. 12 The macrophage scavenger receptor is another endocytic pattern-recognition receptor that binds to bacterial cell wall and enhances phagocytosis and clearance from the circulation. 13 Other recently identified pattern-recognition receptors with relevance to innate immunity include nucleotide-binding and oligomerization-domain proteins, and caspase-recruitment domain helicase. 14 Signaling receptors include the family of toll receptors that have a major role in the induction of immune and inflammatory responses by mediating the intracellular signaling of microbial products. These toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecule patterns and activate signal-transduction pathways that induce inflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules, essential to the adaptive immune response. 10 TLR4 and TLR2 function as receptors of the innate immune system and activate the transcription nuclear factor (NF-K B) signaling pathway. TLR4 is essential for the recognition of LPS and interacts with LPSbinding protein and another protein, MD-2, to interact with CD14, a receptor on 6 .3 Immune Response macrophages and B-cells to form a complex. Thus, for any one microbe, there are a variety of molecules that can activate many different pattern-recognition receptors. The binding of pathogen-associated molecules with pattern-recognition receptor activate several signaling intracellular pathways, resulting in activation of transcription factors (NF-kB, AP-1, FOS, JUN) that control immune response genes (including interferon regulatory factor families) for the release of numerous effector molecules and proinflammatory cytokines. Cytokines are essential for orchestrating the innate and adaptive immune defenses to invading pathogens. The adaptive immune system responds to a pathogen only after recognition by the innate immune system. T-cells antigen receptors recognize ligand (peptide) bound to MHC class II molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. T-cells require signals from the peptide-MHC molecule complex plus a costimulatory signal (CD80 and CD86 molecules) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells to be activated.

Whereas gram-negative bacteria initiate the sepsis syndrome mainly by LPS interacting with LPS-binding protein and CD14 via TLR4 (coreceptor for LPS), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococci and Streptococci) can initiate the mechanism of SIRS by the components of their cell wall (peptoglycin, lipoprotein, lipoteichoic acid, and phenol soluble modulin) by binding to TLR2. 15 There is also recent evidence that although pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid induces profound inflammatory response and activation of the coagulation pathway through TLR2-dependent route, it is likely amplified by endogenous TLR4 ligands. 16 Grampositive bacteria can also cause severe sepsis or septic shock by producing exotoxins that act as superantigens, as in staphylococcal or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis. Superantigens are not processed for clonotypic presentation by antigen presenting cells. Superantigens are a group of powerful antigens that bind directly to MHC class II molecules of antigenpresenting cells and to Vb chain of T-cell receptors, outside of the normal T-cell receptor site, and are able to react with multiple T-cell receptor molecules. 15 Thus, activating a large number of T-cells nonspecifically (>fivefold than conventional antigens) to produce massive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 727, "end": 729, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 967, "end": 969, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1541, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogenesis"}, {"text": "Macrophages and neutrophils contain the inflammasome, a complex of proteins involved in the innate defense mechanism. 17 At least two types of inflammasome exist, composed mainly of the ''NALP'' family of proteins, NALP1 inflammasome and NALP3 (the central component of the cryopyrin inflammasome). Stimulation of the cryoprin inflammasome by pathogenic bacteria results in activation of caspase I, which in turn activates interleukin-1b (1L-1b) through cleavage of pro-1L-1b. This proinflammatory cytokine (secreted by macrophages) triggers another cascade of molecular events (including -TNFa) that result in inflammation. 17 Cryopyrin-deficient macrophages do not respond efficiently to gram-positive bacteria (i.e., S. aureus or Listeria monocytogenes) but can recognize gram-negative bacteria (which require other inflammasome components). 18 Nuclear factor (NF)-kB is involved in regulating the transcription of many of the immunomodulatory mediators involved in sepsis and associated organs dysfunction or failure. Signaling pathways stimulated by bacterial products (LPS, lipoteichoic acid, etc.) or cytokine receptors, including those for TNF-a, 1L-1 via TLRs, enhance nuclear activation of NF-kB and transcription of genes encoding expression of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, apoptotic factors, and other mediators of inflammation and coagulation (Table 6 .2). 19 Since NF-kB plays a central role in sepsis modulation of this factor may have therapeutic implications, and suppression in animal models of sepsis decrease acute inflammation and organ dysfunction. 20 Activation of caspase-8 (a cysteine protease required for monocyte differentiation into macrophages) may have therapeutic implications, as it prevents sustained NF-kB activation by down-regulation through cleavage of a kinase receptor-interacting protein1 (RIP1). 21 Interferon -g (IFN-g) plays a major role in immune-modulation after immune stimulation of T-lymphocytes by infectious agents. IFN-g is essential for killing intracellular organisms by enhancing the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide (NO). However, the role of IFN-g in immune defense against gram-negative bacterial infection is inconsistent. Interleukin -18 (IL-18), an IFN-g inducing factor, essential for IFN-g production appears to play an important role in sepsis. 22 In mice neutralization of IL-18 protects against endotoxin and ischemia-induced liver damage. Thus, IL-18 blockade may be a therapeutic target to neutralize the pathologic consequences of sepsis via IFN-g mechanisms. 22 Monocytes and macrophages are effector cells of the innate immunity which are central in the recognition and elimination of invading pathogens. Molecules and cytokines secreted by macrophages orchestrate the innate and adaptive host immune response. An important cytokine released in large amounts by monocytes and macrophages on exposure to bacterial products is macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF acts by regulating the expression of TLR4-LPS complex, which are important in the innate immune responses to endotoxin and gram-negative bacterial sepsis. 23 Immunoneutralization of MIF protects mice against lethal endotoxemia, gram-positive toxic syndrome and experimental bacterial peritonitis. 15 High blood levels of MIF in children and adults with gram-negative sepsis is associated with parameters of disease severity (shock, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy [DIC], lactic acidosis, etc.), dysregulated pituitary-adrenal function, and early mortality. 24 Excessive production of this potent proinflammatory cytokine appears to play an important role on the sepsis syndrome and associated mortality, and inhibitory agents may help to treat severe sepsis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 120, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 625, "end": 627, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 845, "end": 847, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1386, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1587, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1854, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2326, "end": 2328, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2546, "end": 2548, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3108, "end": 3110, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3250, "end": 3252, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3518, "end": 3520, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1370, "end": 1378, "text": "(Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Pathogenesis"}, {"text": "High mobility group proteins superfamily, particularly high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a DNA-binding protein regulating gene transcription and stabilizing nucleosome formation has been shown to be a late mediator of inflammation and sepsis, 25 HMGB1 is released by activated macrophages, induces the delayed release  of other proinflammatory mediators (TNF-a, IL-1a, 1L-1b, IL-1 receptor agonist,  1L-6, 1L-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP] ), and thus mediates lethality when overexpressed.

In animal models of acute sepsis blockade of TREM-1 signaling with TREM-1-IgG fusion protein reduces hyperinflammatory responses and death. 29 Neutrophils play a pivotal role in the defense against bacterial and some fungal infections (i.e., invasive candidiasis). However, overwhelming activation of neutrophils can result in tissue damage. Elimination or neutralization of pathogenic bacteria by neutrophils is accomplished by their large stockpile of proteolytic enzymes and rapid production of reactive oxygen radicals to degrade internalized invaders. 30 Local accumulation of neutrophils in the microvasculature, and release of lytic factors and proinflammatory cytokines extracellularly from tissue-infiltrating neutrophils can result in local damage. During sepsis the homeostatic environment in the microculation is compromised partly by formation of leukocytic aggregates, endothelial hyperactivity, fibrin deposition, and tissue exudates that predispose to microvascular occlusion and impairment of tissue oxygenation. 31 Large numbers of neutrophils accumulate in organs developing failure in sepsis, and widespread recruitment and sequestration probably contribute to subsequent organ dysfunction. 30 Experimental interventions that deplete or antagonize the activity of neutrophils ameliorate organ dysfunction. 32 The fact that neutrophil-mediated lung injury (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) occurs in patients with neutropenia, indicate that organ dysfunction can be initiated by a few neutrophils sequestered in the microvasculature. A distinct subpopulation of neutrophils with characteristic secretary profiles may account for the organ dysfunction.

The basic mechanism responsible for vasodilatory shock is failure of the vascular smooth muscle to contract.

Moreover, nitric oxide, atrial natriuretic peptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and adenosine (all greatly increased in septic shock) activate the K ATP channels, allowing efflux of potassium and thus hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and preventing entry of calcium into the cells, thus, inhibiting catecholamine or angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction.

Apoptotic cells increase anergy or anti-inflammatory cytokines that impair the response to pathogens, whereas necrotic cells cause immune stimulation and enhance antimicrobial defence. 46, 47 The mechanism of lymphocyte apoptosis in sepsis is not completely understood but may be related to stressinduced endogenous release of glucocortecoids 48 and bacteria have evolved molecules that deregulate caspases to induce apoptosis. 46 Neutrophils play a major role in the host's response to invading pathogens and are essential for their eradication. However, neutrophils through release of oxidants and proteases are believed to be responsible for injury to organs with inflammatory conditions, including sepsis. Excessive neutrophil activation and sequestration in the lungs may play a role in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), commonly present with severe sepsis. Neutrophils are recruited to the site of infections and normally die within 6-8 h after their release into the circulation. Inflammation is terminated and controlled in part, by the apoptosis of neutrophils. There is recent evidence that apoptosis is delayed in neutrophils from patients with sepsis. 49 This may result in failure to down-regulate proinflammatory cells, leading to prolongation of inflammation. 50 Failure of the regulatory pathway of apoptosis can prolong survival of neutrophils, resulting in death by necrosis with up-regulation of inflammation. The mechanism of delayed apoptosis involves activation of NF-kB, via caspase-1 and generation of 1L-1. 51 Pre-B cells colony enhancing factor (PBEF) a growth factor for B cells (produced by activated lymphocytes), and up-regulated by LPS stimulation, appears to inhibit apoptosis of neutrophils. 52 Thus it is clear that there is deregulation of apoptosis in sepsis which appears to play a role in the pathogenesis.

In an animal model of sepsis depression of splenocyte immune responses was mediated by 1L-6 and TGFb 56 and plasma from septic patients greatly depress normal monocyte secretion of TNF-g through functional deactivation by 1L-10. 57 Since immunoparalysis could contribute to the late mortality of the septic syndrome, strategies to restore immune function in septic patients are being investigated. Biologics that may reverse monocyte deactivation in vitro and animals, thus of potential therapeutic benefit in sepsis, include interferon-g (INF-g) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). 55 In a small pilot study of nine patients with sepsis and immunoparalysis (defined as <30% HLA-DR-positive monocytes), daily subcutaneous injection of INF-g for 3 days restored TNF-production capacity of monocytes and eight patients survived. 58 Thus, further clinical trials with IFN-g in late sepsis is warranted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 485, "end": 487, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 893, "end": 895, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1301, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1682, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1924, "end": 1926, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunoparalysis"}, {"text": "The type of cell death also determines the immunologic function of surviving immune cells. 40 Apoptotic cells induce anergy or anti-inflammatory cytokines that impair host response to pathogens, and necrotic cells cause immune stimulation and increase host immune defence. 59 Thus, in late sepsis immunodepression is a result of quantitative depletion of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes, as well as functional impairment of the remaining mononuclear cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 93, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 273, "end": 275, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunoparalysis"}, {"text": "Although clinical and animal experiments support the concept of early deaths in sepsis being related to hyper-inflammation and late mortality being associated with excessive anti-inflammatory cytokines, this is likely an oversimplification of a complex process.

However, septic shock is nearly always associated with some degree of DIC, with microvascular thrombosis, consumption of platelets and coagulation of proteins, and stimulation of the fibrinolytic system, with increased risk of hemorrhage. 66 Hemostatic abnormalities and endothelial changes are some of the earliest manifestations of a wide spectrum of infections. Changes in the fibrinolytic system are seen soon after a single infusion of endotoxin with many of the abnormalities seen in early clinical sepsis. 67 Rapid release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was followed by an early increase in plasminogen activation, reaching a maximum by 2-3 h and decreased by 3-5 h. The decrease in fibrinolytic activity was due partly to appearance of plasminogenactivator inhibitor (PAI)-1 activity at 3-5 h. Sepsis can activate the coagulation pathway at multiple sites, via activation of chemical mediators on the endothelium and monocytes, and through activation of the proinflammatory cascade. Endotoxin and other toxins can directly activate the extrinsic pathway by up-regulation of tissue factor (TF) and factor VII leading to thrombin and clot formation. TF activation is considered the primary initiator of coagulation in sepsis. 68 In addition, sepsis activates the contact system (intrinsic pathway) through induction of TNF-a and interleukins via activation of Hageman factor (XII), to factor XIa, which acts as trigger of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Activated factor XII (a) also hydrolyses pre-kallikrein to the proteolytic kallikrein which cleaves kininogen to release bradykinin (a potent vasodepressor), which is thought to contribute to hypotension in early sepsis. 69 General activation of the coagulation depletes the natural antithrombotic factors, protein C, antithrombin, and TF pathway inhibitor. Protein C is converted to activated protein C (APC) by thrombin binding to thrombomodulin on endothelium surface, and counter prothrombotic state, and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties by decreasing proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil rolling on endothelium. Protein C and protein S inhibit endotoxin-induced production of TNF, 1L-1b, and 1L-6 by monocytes in vitro and in vivo, activated protein C reduce TNF secretion in endotoxemic rats. 55 Activated protein C controls coagulation by proteolytically inactivating factors Va and VIIa. In sepsis conversion of protein C to the activated form is impaired by increased consumption of its cofactor protein S. Several processes during sepsis and inflammation have been associated with the reductions in endothelial-cell thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor. These include down-regulation of transcription genes encoding these factors in response to cytokines and sepsis, 70 and enzymatic cleavage of protein C activation complex. 71 Thus, disruption of the activated protein C complex in sepsis is an early event that leads to widespread thrombosis and DIC, and may play a role in perpetuation of an uncontrolled inflammatory response.

The lectin pathway involves interaction of MBL and mannose residue on bacterial surfaces, resulting in activations of MBL-associated serine protease complex. Both the classical and lectin pathways converge resulting in cleavage of C4 and C2, and generation of C3 convertase (C4b-C2a). 75 The alternative pathway is stimulated by bacterial LPS, interacting with C3b, factors B and D to subsequently generate C3 convertise. At this stage the three main pathways converge, resulting in generation of C3a fragment which is an anaphylatoxin that causes vasodilation and increased vascular permability. 75 The C3b fragment is an opsonic factor which combines with C3 convertase to form C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C5a is also an anaphylotoxin, whereas C5b interacts with C6, C7, C8, and C9 to form the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9). Another associated pathway involves cleavage of C5 by proteases from neutrophils and macrophages to generate C5a and other fragments. 75 C5a enhances the innate immune response by interacting with a receptor (C5aR) on neutrophils, macrophages, and endothelial cells that leads to induction of localized, contained inflammation. Phagocytic cells (neutrophils and macrophages) ability to engulf and kill bacteria by release of granule enzyme and generation of superoxide anion is enhanced by contact with C5a. 76, 77 C5a also induces chemotactic response of neutrophils and confer resistance to apoptosis. 78 Although low and locally regulated concentrations of C5a have positive priming effects on neutrophils and macrophages, excessive generation of C5a, as occurs during sepsis, can have deleterious systemic effects. 75 Generation of large amounts of C3a and C5a in animals can cause circulatory failure, hypotension, and diffuse capillary leakage. 79 Relatively high levels (10-100 nM) of C5a in plasma can impair neutrophil function, stimulate macrophages and endothelial cells to produce excessive amounts of proinflammatory mediators, and generate prothrombotic activity that can lead to D1C. 75 Furthermore, increased levels of C5a can also induce activation of caspase 3 leading to apoptosis of thymocytes and probably lymphocytes. 80 In experimental animal models of sepsis blockade of C5a or C5aR (by specific antibody against C5a or C5aR antagonist) greatly improve survival in rodents from 20% to 70%. 81 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 286, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 739, "end": 741, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1053, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1442, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1817, "text": "76,", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1820, "text": "77", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1910, "end": 1912, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2127, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2259, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2507, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2646, "end": 2648, "text": "80", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 2820, "end": 2822, "text": "81", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Complement System"}, {"text": "Pulmonary dysfunction is very common in severe sepsis and almost 85% of these patients will require ventilatory support, typically for 7-14 days.

This illness has an early acute phase in all patients with ARDS, and a smaller variable fraction have a late (chronic) phase secondary to pulmonary fibrosis (rare in sepsis-induced ARDS). The acute early phase is characterized by the influx of protein-rich edema fluid into the airspace, due to increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier. 82 Although histologic studies and animal models implicate the sequestration and activation of neutrophils (releasing protease and oxygen radicals) as the main pathogenic mechanism in the acute lung injury, there is still some controversy. Patients with profound neutropenia and sepsis can also develop ARDS and some animal models of ARDS are neutrophils independent. 82 Furthermore, in clinical trials of severe infection patients receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) did not have increased risk of ARDS, despite very high peripheral circulating neutrophils (40,000-70,000/mm 3 ). 83, 84 ARDS is an inflammatory disease with endothelial and epithelial injury, loss of epithelial integrity, increases alveolar-capillary permeability and development of hyaline membranes. It is very likely that there are multiple factors and pathways involved in the pathogenesis. Undoubtedly local and systemic hyperproduction of proinflammatory cytokines (or the imbalance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and disturbances of coagulation are important, leading to platelet-fibrin thrombi in small pulmonary vessels. Other factors that may contribute to ARDS include overdistension of alveoli from mechanical ventilation and disturbance in the production and function of surfactant. 82 Despite the undisputed role of inflammation in the development of ARDS, anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids have not been beneficial in the early acute or later stage of the disease. 85, 86 The three main pathogenic processes of ARDS: unchecked inflammation, interstitial/alveolar protein accumulation, and destruction of pulmonary epithelial cells can be controlled by the up-regulation of the host's heat shock protein (HSP)-70. 86 Thus, the consequences of ARDS from severe sepsis may be due to a dysregulation or impaired expression in lungs of HSP-70. Administration of adenovirus vector containing HSP-70 cDNA driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in septic rats reduced pathological changes of ARDS and improved outcome by 50%. 87 The surprising aspect of this study is the improvement in mortality from amelioration of the ARDS, as patients with sepsis rarely die from ARDS but succumb to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, 88 or recurrent sepsis.

These three prospective studies indicate that rapid institution of appropriate antibiotics results in improved outcome (38-41% improvement), but delaying appropriate therapy for 2-3 days (pending culture and susceptibility) still result in a 60-80% survival in patients with sepsis. Recent reports, however suggests that, outcome with delayed appropriate antibiotic treatment for bacteremias may be organism dependent. In a cohort of 215 patients with S. aureus bacteremia from Taiwan (30 with community-acquired MRSA) there was no significant difference in 30-day mortality between methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or MRSA infection, even though most patients (83%) with MRSA bacteremia did not receive initial appropriate therapy within the first 48 h. 104 On the other extreme, outcomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia with relatively reduced susceptibility to piperacillin-tazbactam is markedly reduced compared to those infected with highly susceptible strains treated with the same agent. 105 In this retrospective cohort the 30-day mortality rate was 85.7% (6/7) in patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam with MIC 32-64 mg/l (considered susceptible by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, 64 mg/l), but only 30% in those whose organisms were more susceptible ( 16 mg/l) treated with the same antibiotic (N = 10). 104 This small study suggest that the resistance breakpoint for piperacillintazobactam should be reduced to >16 mg/l, more in line with the British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy guidelines. 105 Perhaps the most convincing data on relationship between delay in the initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy and mortality was recently reported from a large retrospective cohort of septic chock in adults. 106 In a multicenter study 2,731 patients with septic shock were evaluated, 77.9% of whom had documented infection, and the mortality rate of the entire cohort was 56.2% (higher than recent reports).

Furthermore, total serum corticosal does not reflect the unbound free cortisol (the physiologically active form), and critically ill patients with hypoalbuminemia commonly have high free serum cortisol but low total cortisol levels after corticotrophin-stimulation. 117 In a more recent larger multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of 499 patients with septic shock, hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 h for 5 days) did not improve survival or reversal of shock. 118 Of the total cohort 233 (46.7%) did not respond to corticotrophin (125 in the hydrocortisone group and 108 in the placebo group).

Although large welldesigned randomized, blinded trials should be undertaken with statins for sepsis, it would best be tested in critically ill (high risk) patients even before the onset of sepsis (similar to trials of prophylactic heparin).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 490, "end": 493, "text": "150", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Future Directions"}, {"text": "Another group of agents, thiazolidinediones, now in use for diabetes mellitus may also have therapeutic benefit in the septic patients. 151 Peroxisome proliferatoractivator receptor-gamma (PPARg) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and a ligand-activated transcription factor with pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cell proliferation.
