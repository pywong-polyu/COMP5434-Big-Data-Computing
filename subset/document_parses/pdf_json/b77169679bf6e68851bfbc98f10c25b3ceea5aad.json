            "text": "oculation. Finally, in 1979 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the worldwide eradication of smallpox. The first vaccine against typhoid fever was developed in 1886, the first vaccine against cholera in 1896 and the first vaccine against the plague in 1897. The first vaccines against Bordetella pertussis followed in 1926 and the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis in 1927. In the years after 1970 vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type B, anthrax and cholera were developed. A vaccine against borreliosis was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998, but it was withdrawn from the market within less than 2 years due to more than 1000 reports of side effects [3] . The development of new vaccines has the potential to reduce not only infectious disease morbidity and mortality, but also the use of antibiotics and, consequently, the development of antimicrobial resistance. Recently, a recombinant vaccine against two of the most common serotypes K1 and K2 of the hazardous bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae has been successfully utilized to protect mice against fatal infections. Klebsiella are common pathogens of nosocomial urinary and respiratory tract infections, and particularly antibioticresistant types, such as carbapenemase-bearing or extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Klebsiella strains are characterized by complex and sometimes challenging therapeutic approaches [4] . Besides antimicrobial resistance, vaccines also have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in acute global healthcare crises and to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases in our globalized world. This is especially relevant regarding the ongoing pandemic of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus is a singlestranded RNA virus causing life-threatening respiratory illnesses [5] . According to the US Center for Sys-tems Science and Engineering (CSSE) until 12 May 2020 the virus has infected approximately 4.2 million people and caused 286,000 deaths [6] . To end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the world is in urgent need of an effective, safe and durable vaccine. Currently at least 8 candidate vaccines are being tested in clinical trials and 102 candidate vaccines are in preclinical evaluation. Most of the candidate vaccines are mRNA or DNA vaccines, live vaccines, vector virus vaccines, inactivated vaccines or viral protein subunits vaccines. First results from human trials are expected within the next few months [7] . Since SARS-CoV-2 also affects pets and other animals, an animal vaccine is also urgently needed [8] .",

Currently, RTS,S/AS01 is thought to be the most advanced and extensively tested candidate vaccine against P. falciparum. The subunit vaccine induces immune response against the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) [10] . Although it is currently the only vaccine showing reliable efficacy against P. falciparum in a phase III clinical trial, its protective properties are only partial and decline over time [10, 11] . Despite these limitations, it is thought to exhibit public health benefits, especially in children in areas with high transmission and disease activity rates [12] . Unfortunately, funding volume levels for vaccine research and development decreased from US $ 181 million in 2017 to US $ 156 million in 2018, which may have dramatic effects on the development of malaria vaccine research in the future [13] .",

One example is the vaccination against pertussis, which was discovered around 1930. At the time, the inactivated bacteria B. pertussis was administered for vaccination purposes; however, the inactivated whole cell vaccine frequently produced side effects in the form of redness and swelling at the injection site accompanied by fever and agitation. In the 1980s the whole cell vaccine was replaced by the acellular pertussis vaccine, which had fewer side effects. Currently, the inactivated pertussis toxin is used as an antigen in the production of the acellular vaccine, either alone or in combination with other cell components [14] . The central element in the development of highly selective vaccines is the identification of a specific and potent antigen structure that induces a long-lasting immunity preventing infection. By inducing a highly selective immune response, crossreactions and side effects can be reduced. Lipopeptide, lipopolysaccharide and nucleotide-associated adjuvants target toll-like receptors among other receptors, while genetically modified helper cell epitopes support dendritic cells in their recognition of foreign antigens. Simultaneously, immunostimulatory peptides further enhance the immune response [15] .",

One example of a carrier virus is the measles strain Schwarz. The carrier virus itself acts as an adjuvant-like initiator. Consequently, no conventional adjuvant is required. The structural genes introduced multiply with and within the carrier virus in the vaccinated person, thus inducing a neutralizing immune response. Since these gene segments can be specifically selected and inserted, immunogenicity and side effects can be predicted and assessed relatively well [16, 17] ; however, one concern that has been discussed is the possibility of a reduced immune response in subjects with pre-existing immunity due to previous measles vaccinations or measles disease in the past [18] . The fear is that existing and persistent antibody titres against the measles virus could prevent the replication of the carrier virus; however, this only seems to play a minor role in humans since adequate immune responses were detected after vaccination with a measles virus into which a chikungunya antigen had been introduced even in individuals with high pre-existing measles titres [19] . Therefore, viral vectors make the development of various antibacterial vaccines, e.g. against tuberculosis, seem feasible in the future.",

Both von Behring and Ehrlich were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research, von Behring in 1901 for his work on serum therapy and Ehrlich in 1908 for his work on immunity (Table 1) . During the same period other approaches to the prophylaxis and treatment of infectious diseases were also explored. Later, in the 1970s hyperimmune sera largely came to be replaced by monoclonal antibodies (mAb). From the 1980s onwards, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic prompted the search for immune modulators that may influence and modulate specific immune functions, the aim being, of course, to bring about an improvement in immune functionality [21] . Since then, numerous new modulators, antibiotics, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines have been developed for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious diseases.",

Monoclonal antibodies against bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus anthracis, Clostridioides difficile and Escherichia coli are currently being explored. These antibodies are usually human antibody type IgG, whereby the respective complementarity determining regions (CDR) determine to which pathogenic bacterial antigens or strains the antibody binds [22] ; however, this requires the identification of a reliable antigen structure in the pathogenic microorganism. Monoclonal antibodies can be produced from phage banks, B cell cultures, B cells immortalized by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or by cloning single antigen-specific B cells [23] . Binding capacity and opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) are indicators of functional capacity and as such must be tested using a range of different test systems. If the putative antibodies show sufficient OPK, they can be tested in preclinical and clinical studies in animal models or humans to further evaluate their therapeutic potential.",

Food-associated infections with E. coli serotype O157:H7 are characterized by shigatoxininduced hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which in turn is characterized by the triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure, accompanied by bloody diarrhea and neurological failures.

This overreaction is down-regulated by eculizumab, which binds factor C5 and can thus reduce cerebral damage in HUS [33] .

Another early antibiotic, developed by Gerhard Domagk in 1932, was sulfamidochrysoidin (Prontosil \u00ae ), the first drug from the sulfonamide group [36] . At present, research into new antibiotics appears to be more important than ever, but also more difficult than ever since the challenge of antimicrobial resistance is expected to increase even further in the future. Normally, clinically valuable antibiotics are characterized by a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Recently, with the discovery of ridinilazole, a narrow spectrum antibiotic has been developed that is comparatively specifically directed against C. difficile. The advantage of ridinilazole is that it minimizes the collateral changes to the microbiome that occur during antibiotic therapy with vancomycin or metronidazole, the current antibiotics of choice according to the guidelines. Although the mechanism of action has not yet been fully clarified, there is evidence that ridinilazole not only exerts influence on the bacteria itself in the gut, but also has therapeutic effects on the bacterial toxins A and B and additionally reduces the local inflammatory response [37, 38] . Phase III studies were initiated in 2019 (NCT03595566 and NCT03595553, https://clinicaltrials.gov) to further evaluate ridinilazole's therapeutic value.",

Bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTE) are artificial monoclonal antibodies, which exhibit both a binding site for antigen structures and another for specific surface proteins on T cells. In vitro experiments have already shown that the viral replication of HIV is suppressed by inducing BiTE antibody-mediated redirection of T cells to gp120-expressing cells. It is currently being discussed whether the new generation of antibodies could be used to reach the replicative inactive viral reservoir of HIV-infected patients and thus achieve complete viral eradication. No therapeutic strategy to target the replicative inactive viral reservoir is available to date, although this reservoir is the main cause of viral rebound after the interruption of antiretroviral therapy. The reason for this is that the proviral DNA of HIV is anchored in the nucleus of host cells, meaning that replicative inactive cells are not recognized as infected cells by the host immune system [40] . A highly selective extraction of proviral DNA without damaging the host cell would be desirable. This goal seems to have been made feasible thanks to the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) method [41] , which has recently been used to successfully remove subgenomic HIV-1 DNA fragments from the genome of HIV-infected mice. Up to 5 weeks after therapy, no virus was detectable in 5 of 13 animals, which suggests that the replicative inactive viral reservoir had been reached [42] .",

At the moment it is unclear what further consequences this procedure will have for the babies. Such interventions in the genomes of unborn humans are ethically highly questionable and require a debate on the framework conditions for the use of the new technologies. In the CRISPR method, CRISPR RNA binds specifically to DNA sequences and marks relevant sites in the genome, which then are cut by the CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) nuclease. In this way, gene segments can be specifically cut out or inserted at certain sites. The same gene scissors can also be used to produce bacteriophages which can destroy specific gene segments or plasmids in bacteria and thus inhibit pathogenicity factors or selectively switch off specific resistance mechanisms [44] . Recently, a 15year-old girl suffering from cystic fibrosis was successfully treated for disseminated resistant Mycobacterium abscessus infection after lung transplantation by means of selectively produced bacteriophages [45] .",
