Pranayama is a term that is associated with astanga yoga and deals with formal and traditional practice of control of breath and is intended for regulation of pranathe life-force [2] . Pranayama is controlling the breathing process in a therapeutic way, leading to improvement of the pulmonary reserve function, and efficient neurological control at a basic and obvious level [2] . Anulom vilom pranayama (AVP) is alternate nostril breathing which regulates higher autonomic tone, Kapal bhati pranayama (KBP) is a cerebral detox with bellows of breath in and out with inward contraction of abdominal wall [2] . Breathing exercise as Diaphragmatic breathing exercises (DBE) and Pursed Lip Breathing (PLB) are popular forms [3] that help to improve the process of breathing. During lockdown of COVID-19 online interventions were given to increase breath holding time at lower level of perceived exertion. Anulom Vilom Pranayama (AVP), Kapal Bhati Pranayama (KBP) are investigated in this study along with certain breathing exercises that are also popular like Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercises (DBE) and Pursed Lip Breathing Exercises (PLBE) for supporting the pulmonary volumes and capacities checked using breath holding time (BHT) [4] , and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) [5] , values (see Tables 1-4 Hypotheses. H0-There is no significant relative superiority of various breathing interventions (pranayamas & breathing exercises) over each other for breath holding time (BHT) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE).",

            "text": "It is seen in independent t-test that KBP & PLB did not decrease RPE (Table. 2). DBE and KBP both are working on the respiratory diaphragmatic mechanics which is the main muscle of inspiration, but in DBE the work is on the piston movement of diaphragm, on the lower ribs and abdominal compliance [6] , which is the prime bio-mechanical movement for inspiration. In KBP the abdominals move inward and outward supplementing the diaphragm in a stimulating manner, however it increases ventilator mechanics it does not specifically changes the diaphragmatic excursion. AVP increase the duration of inspiration similar to DBE, which does not happen in KBP and PLB. PLB rather decreases the inspiration time and increases the expiration time, which is useful for clinical populations [7] . All the four interventions were effective in increasing the breath holding time significantly p < 0.000 from pre intervention values as seen in paired t-test analysis as seen in table -3. Only AVP & DBE decreased RPE simultaneously (p < 0.000). Highest t value is seen for BHT of AVP amongst all four groups. Highest t value is seen for RPE of DBE amongst all four groups. AVP works on the autonomic nervous system and is known to be a slow pranayama practice as compared to KBP, AVP has been shown [8] to improve the parasympathetic activity as compared to KBP. However, DBE are also known to be sympatholytic and improve the parasympathetic activity [9] . Therefore, as seen in figure \u2212 2 both AVP & DBE are producing changes in RPE post training. One-way ANOVA among all four interventions could show significant variation for RPE change only (p < 0.05), with maximum reduction by AVP. No difference is seen for any other variable among the four groups. This is suggestive of overall superiority of AVP to decrease the affective aspect of breath holding. The nature of AVP pranayama is of cooling the exaggerated sympathetic response [2, 8] .",

Inhale slowly through right nostril closing the left nostril, exhale fully through the left one closing the other one, repeat this in cyclic manner. The mouth shall remain closed.\" PLB-\"Please sit erect on a chair with feet supported. Relax neck and shoulder. Inhale slowly through nose like you were going to, smell the roses. Purse lips like you were going to, whistle. Exhale slowly through pursed lips like, blowing out a candle. Try to blow out twice as long, as it took to inhale.\" DBE-\"Please sit erect on a chair with feet supported. Relax neck and shoulder. Keep hands on abdomen.
