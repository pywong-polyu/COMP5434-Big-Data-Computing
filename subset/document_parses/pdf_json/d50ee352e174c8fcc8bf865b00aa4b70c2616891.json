The tribological behaviour of the Au/SiO2 coatings with different SiO2 content were investigated under sliding conditions against an alumina counterpart at different loads and sliding velocities. The tribological induced transformation of the coated surfaces were analysed using 3D-profilometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused-ion beam (FIB) cross sectioning and Auger electron epectroscopy (AES). The composite coatings provide higher hardness and ten-fold longer lubricating lifetime compared to the original hard gold coating. Hardness was identified as a key factor reducing the adhesive component of friction and increasing the resistance of gold against smearing. These effects allow to postpone the exposure of the nickel substrate and thus the loss of the self-lubricating character of the coating.",

            "text": "Gender inequality and stereotyping remains a defining societal issue across a wide range of sectors. Reeves (2009) , in reviewing the 2009 Global Report on Human Settlement, as an example, argues that little progress has been made to improve the position of women in planning sustainable cities. Housing is a case in point, with the perception in many societies, including developing and developed countries, that ownership rights rest with the male rather than the female. Rossi and Sierminska (2018) , in a survey of 22 OCED countries, reported that female homeownership remains uncommon. In a seminal paper, Fox O'Mahony (2008) , focusing on the US, argued that women still experience disadvantages in purchasing a house, although this inequality is seen to be more rooted in income, rather than gender, with income rooted in gender too, given the lower rate of pay for women. Deng et al. (2019) observed that women in China are disadvantaged by patrilineal family traditions with males recognised by the community and authorities as the head of household and the owner of family home. Gandelman (2009) found that homeownership rates for women are low in most Latin American countries and, moreover, that female headed households with higher incomes do not necessarily have greater homeownership rates. In Australia, a mortgage company observed that the goal of homeownership for Australian women is an elusive one (Wizard Home Loans, 2009) . Seemingly, despite the evolving status of women in society, homeownership continues to be male dominated.",

Housing is a signifier of social wellbeing: it provides identity, in addition to security and comfort, and it affords access to social networks, employment and services. These aspects, however, are often gendered with the physical components of housing typically held to be a male preserve while the softer elements such as sentiment, comfort and security considered as a female preserve (Fox O'Mahony, 2008) . Housing is also an asset and signifier of wealth: it is a tradable commodity, it is an income-producing good and is viewed by most financial commentators as a positive investment strategy, especially for retirement (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2007; Ong et al., 2013) .

The analysis sought to focus on research questions relating to the significance of household structure, housing quality, and characteristics of women in Australia and how these factors affect the financial strain of households. The study also examines an additional factor known to impact the housing experience of Australian women, namely, age. Older Australian women are more likely to live in substandard housing and be more vulnerable to homelessness (Darab & Hartman, 2013; Thredgold et al., 2019) . Indeed, the Australian Human Rights Commission (2019) argues that the financial situation of older women, their housing preferences, and their individual circumstances should be considered together, to improve their financial and housing security later in life. Thus, a further dimension of this paper is to examine whether women aged 65 years and above, i.e. those typically representing households in retirement, differ to those still of active working age, i.e. women below the age of 65.",

Given this context, a particularly interesting paper is the longitudinal investigation by Wells and Harris (2007) from the US which examined the relation between housing quality and psychological distress among low-income women relocating from inadequate dwellings to newly constructed homes. Set against the background of the greater likelihood of women in the US (14.1%) living in poverty than men (11.1%), the paper raised questions relating to housing and mental health amongst low-income women. The study showed significant improvements amongst women, comparing pre-move to post-move, across variables measuring housing quality, psychological distress, and social withdrawal. Social withdrawal was found to mediate the relation between housing quality and mental health and improvement in psychological distress. The authors noted a statistically significant difference in housing quality and reduced psychological distress, and that aspects of housing quality, such as crowding, play a potent role in mental health.",

Their research was based on young children and their mothers living in high rise buildings that presented situations of restricted play and social isolation. Two samples, one of women living in poor-quality housing and the second sample of women in high-quality housing, were analysed in relation to six subscales of housing quality namely cleanliness/clutter, indoor climate conditions, privacy, hazards, structural quality, child resources, and a separate subscale for neighborhood quality. Using factor analysis, each of the subscales, except for indoor climate conditions, significantly differentiated between poor and quality housing, and controlling for income difference between the two samples it was found that high quality housing leads to lower levels of psychological distress and vice versa, leading Evans et al. (2000) to conclude that improved housing quality can lead to improved mental health.",

Based on longitudinal data over a six-year period on low income families in three US cities, a bioecological perspective was used to explore associations between housing contexts and children's development. The child's biological mother (90%) or primary female caregiver (10%, all referred to as mothers) was the primary respondent in each family. The study shows that poor quality housing was consistently and strongly predictive of children's wellbeing and that those children who resided in lower quality housing showed greater emotional and behavioural problems than their peers. Coley & Leventhal (2012) surmised that low-quality housing may induce stress in mothers and female caregivers, increase mental health problems, and limit the ability to regulate family activities, in turn affecting children's socioemotional functioning. Snyder et al. (2006) examined race and residential variation in female-headed households with children in the US, with the aim of understanding the pattern of economic resources available to children in different types of female-headed households and the degree to which poverty is reduced by household type. This paper focused more on household type rather than on housing conditions and showed that poverty was highest among single female-headed households with children in non-metro areas. Grandmother headed households with children were shown to have the highest odds of poverty, significantly higher than those headed by a single mother. Furthermore, the earnings of a male partner are especially important for non-metro female-headed cohabiting households with children-this income source cuts poverty in half.",

The findings indicate that most individuals start in rental housing and subsequently make the transition to homeownership. People with a middle or high level of education were shown to have a higher propensity to live in high quality housing than those with low levels of education and with increasing age the probability of living in high quality housing increased for the highly educated compared with middle and low levels of education. Unemployment amongst males was considered to have a long-term impact on housing quality though, and significant for this paper, female unemployment of those in a partnership is less decisive in terms of housing quality. Coleman et al. (2016) further explored the issue of age, in particular the experience of older adults ageing in-place and the burden that home maintenance places on this age cohort in a study of retirees in New Zealand. Specifically, with regards to women, the authors observed that when financially constrained, female recipients reported that the cost of maintenance, knowing what to do, and securing reliable help were all sources of stress and worry. Furthermore, female recipients reported that isolation (and abandonment) from family was an issue especially where help with maintenance was needed. Asking for assistance with maintenance, might negatively reflect on their competency and therefore capacity to remain in-place which resulted in reduced help seeking behaviour despite apparent need.",

Baker and Tually (2008) observed that women in general, 1 The authors are mindful that there are different definitions of 'housing quality' and 'housing conditions' in the literature. However, in the context of this study 'housing conditions' refers to the physical attributes and condition of the house (such as necessity of repairs, etc.). 'Housing quality' refers to a mental and personal perception and feeling of the house (such as impact on mental health and wellbeing). and female headed households in particular, are over-represented in terms of being economically and socially disadvantaged. Women more often than men are the head of single parent households, with 82% of single parent families being headed by a female (ABS, 2013) . Inequalities in salaries (Cassells et al., 2017) , greater reliance by women on part-time work and less skilled employment (Jefferson & Preston, 2005; Warren, 2006) and the reduced ability to accrue superannuation funds over their working lives (Australian Human Rights Commission, 2019; Thredgold et al., 2019) have, according to Everingham et al. (2007) meant that single women often cannot afford to retire, and the financial assistance provided by government is insufficient to make retirement an option for these women. Furthermore, those older single women who have not accumulated enough wealth in the form of housing to provide financial security later in life have to rely on the rental sector (Darab & Hartman, 2013) .",

Thus, rental affordability is a concern for older people, especially older women (Australian Human Rights Commission, 2019) with Baker and Tually (2008) and Olsberg and Winters (2005) showing that women in private rentals are financially more vulnerable, and the uncertainty associated with rent increases their overall levels of economic disadvantage. Thus, most renters in the social rental market are women (62%), and single households comprise the largest proportion of social renters (55%). Those who live in public rental accommodation often experience financial challenges and again older single women are most at risk (Gong et al., 2014) .",

The significance of Kupke et al. (2014) lies in the implication that, if given the same opportunities, homeownership is as important, or perhaps even more important to women, compared to men. Indeed, for some single older women in Australia, the family home represents a larger portion of wealth when compared to other cohorts (Jefferson & Ong, 2010; Ong et al., 2013) . However, Ong et al. (2019) observed that, for older adults who still have a mortgage, many find it more difficult to pay expenses on time with an increased tendency to make use of superannuation lump-sums to pay off their mortgages. In the long run, this has the effect to reduce monthly income streams and can increase financial strain notably for older women, who have lower levels of superannuation savings. Indeed, the analysis by Ong et al. (2013) shows that the percentage of older single women with mortgages is higher compared to couples or single men.",

Second, those variables shown to be significant are then considered as candidate independent variables in the modelling of the financial strain of households using a binomial logistic regression.

Only 3% (n = 76) suggested that repairs were essential of which 66% (n = 50) were in the below 65 group and 1% (n = 42) described repairs as essential and urgent of which 74% (n = 31) were in the younger age group (with chi-square = 69.71, significant at 0.001 level).

Strong associations (phi coefficient and Cramer's V) for categorical variables exist where the value of the coefficients is in excess of 0.31. Using this criterion, both tenure and dwelling type had high coefficients with several variables: for example, tenure and age of respondent phi = 0.431, tenure and family structure phi = 0.449; dwelling type and number of bedrooms phi = 0.597. Likewise, strong associations were apparent amongst certain physical building characteristics and between assessed health variables. Hence the number of variables entered in the regression model was reduced. Furthermore, recoding of some variables mainly due to potential violations occurring from small numbers in categorical variables and also to allow for non-responses reduced the useable sample size to 2502 observations.

Likewise, general physical health has a significant impact with respondents who considered their health was fair/poor adding to the financial strain by a factor of 1.794 relative to those having good to excellent health. However, hypertension was not significant. Being a single/lone parent household increases financial strain by a factor of 1.854 and as discussed, inferential tests suggested that financial strain, where apparent, was more prevalent in households for which the respondent was under 65. There is evidence that thermal comfort (\u03b2 = 1.721) has an impact on financial strain through the added costs of energy. Major building problems/defects are not significant at the 0.05 level.

Housing and household surveys typically assume the respondent is male. This is despite the widespread understanding that women, compared to men, will have different expectations, both from a financial and personal point of view when it comes to housing. Women are often financially more vulnerable due to gender pay gaps and lower levels of superannuation contributions and savings. These factors impact on their ability to secure homeownership and to pay housing related expenditure. A lack of financial wellbeing may have detrimental financial implications, such as having to move into private, or public rental accommodation. It could also have negative personal and emotional consequences and may impact on mental health. For single parent households these financial concerns may have a more significant impact. Older single women of future generations, who may have no option but to be lifelong renters due to the inability to become a homeowner, may also have financial concerns. The greater longevity and consequently the need for increased formal care extending into later old age of women further underlies the critical role that housing can play in both the economic and health of women.",

This was especially evident in women 65 and above. Regardless of age, most women liked where they lived and had not moved location in the past five years. They also expressed a high level of satisfaction with the physical quality of their dwellings. Only a small minority of women and predominantly those under 65 reported energy poverty or the ability to keep warm in winter and cool in summer. House mortgages were more likely where the respondent was under 65, also this group spent more on house repairs. One-third of households were female headed (lone person + one parent family) with only a small percentage living in rental accommodation and although the likelihood of renting was not age-related, women over 65 were more likely to be renting properties from public authorities rather than private entities. Only a small percentage reported poor physical health with long-term health problems more prevalent in those 65 or over and especially poor mobility and cardiovascular disease. In contrast, mental health and mainly anxiety and depression which tended to be more prevalent in women under 65. A significant minority of women reported financial strain, especially women under 65. Logistic regression analysis shows a higher tendency towards financial strain in women under 65, those with either poor physical or mental health, and those who were single or lone parents. The relationship between financial strain and health is not surprising. Healthcare costs in Australia between 2006/07 and 2016/17 have increased by 81% (AIHW, 2018). For older people, health care cost comprises a larger part of personal budgets due to a deterioration in health and increase in disability with age (McConnell, 2013) . This is especially the case for older women with 66% (compared to 50% of men) above 65 projected to require some form of formal care during their lifetime (AIST, 2016). To a lesser degree, financial strain was greater in women who reported poor thermal comfort and had difficulty meeting the cost of house repairs and maintenance.",

            "text": "In 1994, Australia reformed the pension-eligibility age for women from 60 to 65 and in 2014 initiated a progressive increase in the pensioneligibility age of six months every two years, to 67 by July 1, 2023 (Klapdor, 2014) . This reform is reported to disproportionately affect poorer households, especially single women and renters (Morris, 2016) . Partly consistent with the latter findings we found that financial strain was higher in women who were single or lone parents and that financial strain was higher in women who were under rather than over 65. As these women age, if their circumstances do not improve, their financial concerns will increase, rather than improve in the long run. Women under 65 also reported poorer mental health which was strongly associated with financial strain. Indeed, middle-aged Australian women who do not own their own homes are vulnerable to greater financial strain in older age (Darab et al., 2018) , are more likely to experience household financial stress and psychological distress due factors such as divorce (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2019; McCarthy & Simpson, 1991) , unemployment (Taylor et al., 2017) and poor health (Gibson et al., 2011) . The women under 65 are also likely to have been exposed to the debt funded crises of the recent decade leaving them more vulnerable than their older peers (Wood et al., 2017) . In the US, women have been impacted more severely by the current COVID-19 pandemic, with more women having lost their jobs than men (Schmidt, 2020) . Furthermore, research in China shows that women reported significantly higher post traumatic stress symptoms ('PTSS') than men during the pandemic (Liu et al., 2020) . The association between financial stress and both physical health and mental health is well described (Asebedo & Wilmarth, 2017; Choi, 2009; Frankham et al., 2020; Sturgeon et al., 2016) . Although the relationship is bidirectional, strategies which reduce financial stress are reported to result in physical and mental health gains. For example, according to White et al. (2018) financial education programs in twenty single low income African American women improved their wellbeing and health. Collins & O'Rouke (2011) , in a review of US homeownership education and counselling programs reported that they are effective at improving timely payments and thereby housing security. As yet, the effectiveness of increasing financial capability on the homeownership and physical/mental health of vulnerable Australians has not been documented but it is likely to have positive effects.",

            "text": "The findings in this paper suggest that women under 65 are at greater risk of financial strain and poorer housing security. This has consequences for policy such as increasing the availability of affordable housing. The provision of affordable housing would not only alleviate financial strain but also likely to benefit mental health (Rowley et al., 2016; Baker et al., 2020) . Indeed, Darab et al. (2018) , Devlin et al. (2015) and Varley (1993) propose that flexible housing arrangements may provide additional housing solutions such as co-housing and co-ownership schemes between governments or community housing providers and low-income earners. In this respect we are confident that the research presented in this paper contributes to the evidence base for advancing such proposals. ",
