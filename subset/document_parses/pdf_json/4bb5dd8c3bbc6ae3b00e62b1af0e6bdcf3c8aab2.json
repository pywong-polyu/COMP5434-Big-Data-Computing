Sixty-four patients (67.4% of those scheduled for surgery) had a COVID-19-related modification in their surgical plan, 45 (21.5% of those scheduled for systemic treatment) a modification in systemic treatment and 12 (18.8% of those scheduled for radiation) a modification in radiation. Nineteen patients (6.3%) had positive COVID-19 testing. On univariate analysis, hospital location in Queens or Brooklyn, age \u226465 years, treatment for a new cancer diagnosis versus recurrence and COVID-19 positivity were associated with treatment modifications. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, hospital location in Queens and COVID-19 positive testing were independently associated with treatment modifications.",

The American Cancer Society estimates that nearly 5000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed per day in the Gynecologic Oncology xxx (xxxx) xxx United States, however, the preferred approach to cancer care during the pandemic remains uncertain [1] . Early reports suggest that patients with cancer may be at increased risk for COVID-19 infection and may have more severe COVID-19 clinical events including admission to intensive care units, requirement for invasive ventilation and death [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . A recent study at a New York City Hospital found a case fatality rate of 25% for patients with COVID-19 and solid tumors [5] . However, such studies are limited by small sample size, heterogeneous cancer types and several possible confounding variables [7] . Oncology providers face difficult decisions, 1) balancing plausible risks of COVID-19 infection for cancer patients with the recognized consequences of not treating cancer in an effective or timely manner, 2) mitigating the risks for significant care disruptions associated with social distancing behaviors, and 3) managing appropriate allocation of limited health care resources for both COVID-19 and cancer patients [5] .",

However, patients with active cancer requiring cancer-directed treatment require in-person physician evaluations and treatment [8] . Established frameworks to inform decisions about how to adapt cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic based on patient and cancer-specific factors do not yet exist and providers are relying on evolving medical society guidelines [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . For patients with active cancer, the physician and patient together must balance a delay in cancer treatment against the risk of potential COVID-19 exposure, keeping in mind the capacity of the local health care system to meet existing and projected needs [8] . This is especially challenging for gynecologic cancers because, although gynecologic oncologists have expertise in multi-modality cancer management, published literature regarding outcomes associated with surgical delays and extended neoadjuvant chemotherapy are retrospective, underpowered or single institution analyses with inconsistent results [14] [15] [16] . As New York City was among the early epicenters during the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to investigate practice patterns in gynecologic cancer care during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic at affiliated New York City hospitals in three boroughs.",

Patients were included if they were followed by the gynecologic oncology team (inpatient and/or outpatient) and had a diagnosis of an active cancer or presumed gynecologic cancer based on a suspicious clinical evaluation. Patients in remission were not included. Data for registry patients were manually abstracted from electronic health records with the use of a quality-controlled protocol and structured abstraction. De-identified data were maintained in a secure web platform supported by the participating institutions. Abstractors were clinicians and medical students trained to abstract standard data elements into a secure institutional data repository. Training was performed in several sessions, led by a single investigator (MF). Calibration was reinforced through daily meetings and ongoing collaboration through a remote shared communication platform. Abstracted data included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbid conditions, COVID-19 symptoms and testing, oncologic history, planned oncology treatments and completed oncology treatments.",

Data on COVID-19 testing was abstracted from the patients' electronic health records and cross-referenced with the institution's COVID-19 research data repository, which maintains all electronic COVID-19-related patient data. COVID-19 testing strategies were standardized across three hospitals, however, changes occurred over the course of data collection. In early March, COVID-19 testing was limited and only performed for symptomatic patients in the hospital at the discretion of emergency department and hospital physicians. As testing became more available, COVID-19 testing was offered at outpatient clinics for symptomatic patients and for all patients undergoing surgical procedures. The method of COVID-19 testing was standardized across the three hospitals with nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab testing.",

Associations between categorical variables were evaluated using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate for category size. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was explored to evaluate the independent effect of hospital location, race, age, medical comorbidities, cancer status (new diagnosis vs. recurrence), and COVID-19 status, on treatment modifications (i.e., binary outcome variable) during the study period. Ethnicity was not included in the multivariable model as it was collinear with race. Statistical significance was evaluated at the 0.05 alpha level, and two-sided 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the precision of all obtained estimates.

National guidelines have recommended postponing surgeries and considering postponing or cancelling nonsurgical cancer treatments based on shared-decision making with a review of the risk to benefit ratio [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 17] . New York City had the first case of confirmed COVID-19 on March 1, 2020. On March 7th the governor of New York declared a state of emergency and on March 22 cancelled all non-critical elective surgeries. Not surprisingly, many women with gynecologic cancers throughout the country are experiencing significant delays in their cancer care [18] . In our study of hospitals in three New York City boroughs, 39% of patients experienced either a delay, cancellation or change in their planned cancer management due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior studies demonstrate health inequities across the five boroughs of New York City and suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected many minority and marginalized populations. [19] [20] [21] Early studies of COVID-19 demonstrate higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in the boroughs with greater representation of racial/ethnic minorities. The boroughs, in order of decreasing COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, were the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Manhattan [22, 23] . We found significantly increased rates of oncologic care modifications among women treated at the location in Queens followed by Brooklyn compared to Manhattan. This finding is important given that these three hospitals are affiliated academic centers with shared standardized and evidence-based treatment algorithms for management of gynecologic cancers. The patient populations between hospital locations were also different, Brooklyn having the highest percentage of Black/African American patients, Manhattan the highest percentage of White/Caucasian patients, Queens the highest percentage of Asian/Asian American patients and Hispanic/Latino patients. Of note, we did not identify differences in treatment modifications by race or ethnicity. We did find that younger patients and patients with a new cancer diagnosis versus a recurrence were more likely to experience treatment modifications, however both patient characteristics were more common among the population treated at Queens and the differences disappeared when adjusting for hospital location.",

This number likely represents an underestimate of the true COVID-19 prevalence as only 19% of patients underwent COVID-19 testing during the study period. All but one of the patients with COVID-19 had at least one medical comorbidity in addition to cancer. This is not surprising as a high burden of severe disease and death from COVID-19 has been consistently observed in patients with pre-existing medical comorbidities [24] . Two of the 19 patients (10.5%) died due to complications of COVID-19 infection and one patient living in a nursing home died with presumed COVID-19 prior to testing.",

Additionally, despite locations in three separate New York City boroughs, the hospitals have a close affiliation with standardization in evidence-based care. As a result, differences between hospitals are unlikely due to varying clinical approaches to disease management. Our study was unable to capture whether treatment delays resulted from hospital policies versus patient decision-making. Future studies are needed to better capture patient concerns and resulting treatment delays during the pandemic. While our study raises important questions about the risks of treating cancer during the pandemic and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and a cancer diagnosis, similar to other early studies of COVID-19 and cancer, it is limited by small numbers of patients and potentially significant bias [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Finally, our study did not capture long-term effects of treatment modifications on cancer recurrence and overall survival. Large scale studies with long-term follow-up and high level, critically reviewed data are needed in order to prevent unduly influencing oncology practices and clinical guidelines during this crisis [7] .",

Patients treated at hospitals in New York City boroughs with greater reported COVID-19 burden experienced significantly more delays.
