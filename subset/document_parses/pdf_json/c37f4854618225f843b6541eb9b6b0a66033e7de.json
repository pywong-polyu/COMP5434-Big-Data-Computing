People with TB described feeling discriminated against, mistreated, isolated, or hated. They reported perceptions or instances of people talking behind their back or remaining physically distanced. Participants of the FGD with community stakeholders shared that sometimes people with TB experienced extreme negative behavior such as physical or psychological mistreatment from their own family members. The situation was discussed as being even more pronounced for young married females because of a lack of personal agency within their husband's family. While this stigmatizing behaviour towards people with TB was reported to occur across socioeconomic groups, participants described that a 'blame and shame culture' was prevalent among family members belonging to groups perceived as \"higher\" in the caste-related, social hierarchy. In alignment with this assertion, community mobilisers mentioned that lack of social and family support can cause people to conceal their TB status and not adhere to or complete TB treatment.",

[6, [8] [9] [10] The Nepal National TB Program (NTP) provides 3,000 Nepalese Rupees (~27 USD) in cash incentives monthly for transportation and nutritional support to people with multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) [11] who are enrolled in government treatment centers and receiving ambulatory care. There is currently no cash incentive scheme for people with drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB) in Nepal. [12] In other settings, socioeconomic support for TB-affected households, including mutual support groups and cash transfers, has been shown to help overcome barriers to accessing TB services, defraying catastrophic costs, and improving treatment success rates. [3, [13] [14] [15] [16] However, there is limited context-specific understanding of the barriers and facilitators to TB diagnosis and care in LMICs with which to inform the development of tailored socioeconomic support interventions for people with TB and their households.

Using telephone, email, or inperson meetings, we invited 55 individuals to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were being 18 years of age or older and being able to give informed consent. Seven participants were invited to each of the seven FGDs. Prior to conducting FGDs, participants were provided with a 'Participant Information Sheet' that explained the purpose of the study, benefit and harm, and confidentiality.

The topic guide was piloted with a group of seven female and male participants with TB resulting in minor refinements to the FGD structure and delivery techniques. TW moderated the FGD with TB healthcare professional and KD and BR moderated the other six FGDs. Apart from these researchers, district field staff who supported patients attended the discussions and facilitated any dialectic interpretation or contextual explanations related to access to and engagement with TB services.",

While important, themes identified that mapped to category IV of the Framework, such as governmental policy, political commitment, public-private mix, and healthcare Across all the FGDs, participants described the need to raise community awareness on risk factors for TB, mode of TB transmission, and TB signs and symptoms. Community stakeholders particularly felt that future awareness-raising programs would benefit by informing communities about available free TB diagnostic and treatment services in their local area and adding a component to reduce TB-related stigma. Further, NTP stakeholders stressed the importance of not only providing education but also, in the face of competing health beliefs, influencing attitudes, and promoting behaviour change.",

In particular, community leaders and people with DR-TB raised concerns that the current monthly governmental nutrition allowance was insufficient to obtain nutritional food, such as meat and fruits, which is often recommended by healthcare providers.

[40] It was notable that people with MDR-TB reported severe negative psychosocial impacts of their illness. These included profound feelings of anxiety, isolation related not only to their diagnosis but also to physical distance from their families, and recognized side effects of certain MDR-TB medications (e.g. Cycloserine) such as depression and despair. [41] [42] [43] Participants perceived an association between the psychosocial impact of MDR-TB and the potential for non-adherence to long, arduous treatment regimens including injectable agents.

These findings are in line with the rapidly growing global body of evidence relating to the economic burden of TB. Such findings suggest that coping strategies remain common and only limited progress has been made towards the WHO target of \"zero TB-affected families face catastrophic costs by 2020\". [1, 44] TB Patient Costs Surveys conducted in various LMICs have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of TB-affected households incur catastrophic costs, which can push them into further impoverishment and contribute to adverse TB treatment outcomes. [6, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Studies in Nepal demonstrated that more than 60% of TB-affected households in Nepal incurred catastrophic costs [6, 7] and stark economic impact. [27, [51] [52] [53] Although this study focused on barriers amenable to interventions at the household level rather than health system level, our findings showed that when TB diagnosis and care were sought from both the public and private sector, patient pathways to TB diagnosis and care were protracted and their costs, especially out-of-pocket costs, escalated (described in detail in Supplementary File II). This finding is consistent with the findings of systematic reviews from Nepal, India and Uganda, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] which also highlighted that interventions to strengthen public-private partnerships can streamline diagnostic and referral pathways and potentially increase TB notifications to the NTP.",

This is supported by the results of studies in Nepal and other LMICs, which showed that providing both counseling and economic assistance to people with MDR-TB improved cure rates.[61-64] However, it must be noted that a significant proportion of people with DS-TB in Nepal experience enduring psychological, social and economic impacts of TB but receive no additional support. [6, 7, 12] In line with a study from Ethiopia, [65] our findings also suggest that the timing of provision of financial support is important. Participants advocated for early cash support delivery in the initiation phase of treatment when they perceived it to be needed most. Involvement of family members and peers in such interventions was also noted by participants as a vital aspect of support to complete TB treatment. This has also been reported in a systematic review of factors affecting medication adherence in LMICs.",

While important and informative, the research team felt that such themes could not practically be addressed by -and hence would not directly inform the design of -a discrete socioeconomic support package for TB-affected households for future trial evaluation. Here, the perceived higher level barriers and facilitators are mapped to Category IV \"Healthcare system, TB diagnosis and care delivery\" of the adapted WHO treatment adherence framework. 1 These barriers and facilitators are summarized in Figure 2 of the main article and expanded on in more detail below.",

Participants mentioned that the incorrect diagnosis of TB caused long and convoluted journey during the diagnosis and treatment, including a public-private (PPM) mix of hospitals and clinics and pharmacies before reaching NTP diagnostic and treatment services: The NTP stakeholders mentioned that the pharmacy services were perceived to be compromised because of the practice of prescribing antibiotics without suitable clinical or microbiological confirmation of infection. Moreover, the practice of changing to new and more expensive antibiotics was noted if the disease wasn't cured. However, such services were noted to be thriving and supported a culture of, as one NTP stakeholder noted, \"medicine dependence in South Asia\". Geographical barriers such as long distances to reach health facilities, weather conditions such as rain, natural disasters (landslides and flooding), difficult roads and limited transportation options were discussed in depth across FGDs. These barriers were perceived as hampering access to TB diagnosis, impeding engagement with TB treatment and DOTS, and had a knockon impact on access to broader health services.",

Community stakeholders reported that this was especially important for labourers given the competing demands to earn money during peak labour hours or seek healthcare during clinic opening hours. These barriers were compounded by issues relating to staff lateness and staff shortages or absence at healthcare centers that provided TB services: Moreover, participants perceived that there was negative behaviour of healthcare workers towards people seeking TB diagnosis or who were taking TB treatment as a notable barrier and disincentive to attend. There was a perception that some NTP staff at health centers took little interest in people with TB. A participant with TB disease mentioned that the healthcare workers at the DOTS center only provide medicines and put a tick mark in the treatment card or sometimes even proper recording is missed in the card. Another participant with TB also shared his experience during his treatment where he was often told to take medicines from the shelf at the DOTS center.

Although people with MDR-TB reported supportive care and staff at the DR-TB hostels in which some were managed during their treatment, others reported that the facilities were not as expected. One participant describing their room to have been \"colder than snow\" and another shared that the substandard conditions of the hostel rooms made him feel even worse and so he did not remain there.

There is currently limited evidence concerning the potential acceptability, impact, or costeffectiveness of such a package, with which to inform and guide this policy decision. A cohort study has suggested that, during their illness, TB patients in Nepal experience decreased income and the total costs of accessing free TB treatment equate to nearly one quarter of annual household income 17 . Further studies in Nepal have shown that clinic fees make up the largest proportion of direct costs and that TB patients who are poorer, are migrants, or are from rural areas, experience a disproportionate burden of total costs [18] [19] [20] . It is vital that vulnerable TB patient households most at risk of incurring TB-related costs are identified in order to prevent and cure TB and mitigate further impoverishment and its consequences.",

Due to constraints in study budget, duration, and field logistics, it will not be possible to age and sex match cases and controls nor to randomly select controls using geospatial or other household randomisation techniques. Therefore, a convenience sampling strategy was used. In order to be as widely representative of and generalisable to the background population as possible, following project team and community mobiliser discussions in the study sites, we opted to recruit control participants from diverse locations within the districts, which were attended by a broad demographic cross-section of the local population in terms of age, gender, and socioeconomic position. These diverse study site locations include: tea houses, primary healthcare centres, antenatal and immunization clinics, door-to-door visits following sputum camps (e.g. people who tested negative for TB), and public gathering places. Interviewers will visit the control recruitment locations at similar times of the morning and aim to consecutively recruit all individuals in attendance at that location. Similar numbers of participants from each recruitment location will be recruited until the sample size of 100 people without TB is reached. We acknowledge that convenience sampling may be associated with a higher likelihood of a non-generalisable control cohort than other techniques. To try to address this, the survey used to collect data from the controls has incorporated multiple questions concerning sociodemographic variables, including education level, occupation, amenities, and assets, from the most recent version of the Nepal Household Survey, which is publicly available. Descriptive analysis will evaluate whether the controls recruited are representative of the wider population in those districts through comparison of their sociodemographic data with respondents to the national survey in the same districts. Any differences between the control population and background population will then be highlighted transparently in corresponding research outputs and publications.",

Rather, the potential interventions selected are intended to consist of what stakeholders perceive to be key elements or ingredients of psychosocial and economic support for TB-affected households, which are feasible and locally-appropriate to the Nepalese context. The interventions will be presented to the group including strengths, weaknesses, and potential sources of funding for implementation. This Wellcome research will aim to achieve the short-term outcomes described in the logic model.

We did not conduct any follow-up discussions with participants but some of the participants attended a workshop to discuss the FGD findings, the outputs of which are published elsewhere. 12 We performed real-time member checking in each FGD by noting key points of the discussion, summarizing them on a wall chart, and clarifying their accuracy with the group.

They also recommended broadcasting educational campaigns on television adapted from similar campaigns in the field of HIV (HIV ka sawal) and maternal care (Aama ko Maya) in Nepal. However, there was concern that information transmitted through media could bypass vulnerable, poor, and marginalized populations. To overcome this, the group suggested innovative and interactive community-based approaches such as coordination with local women's group-initiated self-help enterprises, street plays, and engaging TB survivors as peer champions and educators to improve TB education. The involvement and ownership of TB education programs by community leaders, including volunteers, teachers, and community mobilizers, was also deemed important to achieve effective, decentralized delivery. Furthermore, the stakeholders acknowledged the essential role of healthcare provider-led education as part of a client-provider contract because people with TB need -and will follow -advice from healthcare providers only when that advice is relayed sensitively and understood thoroughly. Nevertheless, people with TB indicated that both sensitization and education from a trusted source were key to deliver education successfully and to enable and empower communities.",

This is supported by the results of studies in Nepal and other LMICs, which showed that providing both counseling and economic assistance to people with MDR-TB improved cure rates. 9,58-60 However, it must be noted that a significant proportion of people with DS-TB in Nepal experience enduring psychological, social and economic impacts of TB but receive no additional support. 6, 7, 12 In line with a study from Ethiopia, 61 our findings also suggest that the timing of provision of financial support is important. Participants advocated for early cash support delivery in the initiation phase of treatment when they perceived it to be needed most. Involvement of family members and peers in such interventions was also noted by participants as a vital aspect of support to complete TB treatment. This has also been reported in a systematic review of factors affecting medication adherence in LMICs. 62",

Moreover, the practice of changing to new and more expensive antibiotics was noted if the disease wasn't cured. However, such services were noted to be thriving and supported a culture of, as one NTP stakeholder noted, \"medicine dependence in South Asia\". Geographical barriers such as long distances to reach health facilities, weather conditions such as rain, natural disasters (landslides and flooding), difficult roads and limited transportation options were discussed in depth across FGDs. These barriers were perceived as hampering access to TB diagnosis, impeding engagement with TB treatment and DOTS, and had a knockon impact on access to broader health services.",

Community stakeholders reported that this was especially important for labourers given the competing demands to earn money during peak labour hours or seek healthcare during clinic opening hours. These barriers were compounded by issues relating to staff lateness and staff shortages or absence at healthcare centers that provided TB services: Moreover, participants perceived that there was negative behaviour of healthcare workers towards people seeking TB diagnosis or who were taking TB treatment as a notable barrier and disincentive to attend. There was a perception that some NTP staff at health centers took little interest in people with TB. A participant with TB disease mentioned that the healthcare workers at the DOTS center only provide medicines and put a tick mark in the treatment card or sometimes even proper recording is missed in the card. Another participant with TB also shared his experience during his treatment where he was often told to take medicines from the shelf at the DOTS center. There were also reports of discourteous consultations",

There is currently limited evidence concerning the potential acceptability, impact, or costeffectiveness of such a package, with which to inform and guide this policy decision. A cohort study has suggested that, during their illness, TB patients in Nepal experience decreased income and the total costs of accessing free TB treatment equate to nearly one quarter of annual household income 17 . Further studies in Nepal have shown that clinic fees make up the largest proportion of direct costs and that TB patients who are poorer, are migrants, or are from rural areas, experience a disproportionate burden of total costs [18] [19] [20] .

Due to constraints in study budget, duration, and field logistics, it will not be possible to age and sex match cases and controls nor to randomly select controls using geospatial or other household randomisation techniques. Therefore, a convenience sampling strategy was used. In order to be as widely representative of and generalisable to the background population as possible, following project team and community mobiliser discussions in the study sites, we opted to recruit control participants from diverse locations within the districts, which were attended by a broad demographic cross-section of the local population in terms of age, gender, and socioeconomic position. These diverse study site locations include: tea houses, primary healthcare centres, antenatal and immunization clinics, door-to-door visits following sputum camps (e.g. people who tested negative for TB), and public gathering places. Interviewers will visit the control recruitment locations at similar times of the morning and aim to consecutively recruit all individuals in attendance at that location. Similar numbers of participants from each recruitment location will be recruited until the sample size of 100 people without TB is reached. We acknowledge that convenience sampling may be associated with a higher likelihood of a non-generalisable control cohort than other techniques. To try to address this, the survey used to collect data from the controls has incorporated multiple questions concerning sociodemographic variables, including education level, occupation, amenities, and assets, from the most recent version of the Nepal Household Survey, which is publicly available.

To generate the population for Project 2, a literature review and desk-based scoping review will identify a list of key in-country stakeholders from Nepal from diverse groups including: civil-society representatives; community leaders; and TB healthcare professionals including NTP managers and multi-disciplinary staff. Approximately 50 stakeholders will be selected through purposive sampling and invited to participate in: a pre-FGD survey, FGD, and a one-day workshop.

The FGDs will be conducted with separate groups of approximately eight key stakeholders. Stakeholders will be invited to participate according to their background (e.g. people with TB will be asked to participate in one FGD, and TB healthcare professionals will be asked to participate in another separate FGD). Towards the end of each FGD, participants will be asked to privately rank the top three most important barriers or facilitators to accessing TB diagnosis and care identified by the group during the FGD, and these responses will be collated for each FGD and across FGDs. The FGDs will be moderated by members of the project team trained in qualitative methods including conducting FGDs. The discussions will be audio recorded in Nepali language, translated into English, and back-translated by a translator who is not part of the project team.

The morning section of the workshop will consist of interactive presentations from the project team and stakeholder group representatives (including leaders of national social protection schemes in Nepal), and discussions exploring and validating the barriers and opportunities identified during the pre-FGD survey and interviews during FGDs. The afternoon section of the workshop will consist of multi-sectoral working groups (\u226410 diverse stakeholders) developing a shortlist of potential socioeconomic interventions for TB-affected households in Nepal. The shortlist is not intended to consist of defined, unalterable packages, which are immediately ready for trial implementation. Rather, the potential interventions selected are intended to consist of what stakeholders perceive to be key elements or ingredients of psychosocial and economic support for TB-affected households, which are feasible and locally-appropriate to the Nepalese context. The interventions will be presented to the group including strengths, weaknesses, and potential sources of funding for implementation.",

Specifically, two researchers (KD and TW) will familiarize themselves with the data through successive reading of transcripts; use both open and closed first order data coding to label data within NVivo; group codes together into a second order codebook of themes and subthemes. Themes and subthemes will then be further stratified by third order coding to the level at which they predominantly occurred (e.g. individual or household level, health systems level, community level, or governmental level). The primary approach to codes, themes, and sub-themes will be deductive (top down), being informed by our conceptual framework and preliminary analysis of data from Project 1 relating to the social determinants and consequences identified. As coding continues, a secondary approach will integrate inductive (bottom up) coding in order to be iterative, responsive, and flexible as further data becomes available and is collated following each successive FGD.\""

This included visiting, spending time with, and showing affection towards people with TB to demonstrate solidarity and reduce feelings of isolation. People with TB also shared the importance of mutual support beyond family and friends, including the wider community, leaders, elders, and other important local figures. The participants believed that this kind of support would help people with TB to cope and reflected the close communities and rich socio-cultural values inherent to Nepalese culture. FGD with people diagnosed with MDR-TB, 44-year-old, male: \"My friends and the people in my village told me 'TB is a normal disease and encouraged me that, if I took my medicine, I'd be alright.\"Interactions and consultations with healthcare providers were also seen as opportune occasions to provide education and counseling to address the psychological impact of TB. FGD with community stakeholders raised the perceived importance of healthcare providers simply recognizing, acknowledging, and being understanding of patients' fears, concerns, and expectations. While healthcare provider-led counselling on medication adherence was noted to be commonplace at treatment initiation, counselling TB patients about TB-related fear, stigma, and anxiety was broadly overlooked. It was noted that integration of medication and psychological counselling by healthcare providers could be a suitable method to deliver clear and open information about stigma and discrimination, which could improve TB treatment adherence and completion rates and potentially support mental wellness and empowerment.",

Community stakeholders were community leaders or those working in civil society and were selected based on their in-depth knowledge on the locak context and experiences of working with the communities, preferable in health progams. TB healthcare professionals, such as those working with the NTP or TB-focused NGOs, have several years' experience in planning, designing, and implementing NTP activities. Community volunteers or mobilizers were people working with the IMPACT-TB project, who have first-hand experiences in screening symptoms of TB and supporting people with TB to adhere to and complete their treatment. These participants were selected based on the expertise in delivering community programs and to bring diverse perception of the stakeholders into the study. Using telephone, email, or in-person meetings, we invited 55 individuals to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were being 18 years of age or older and being able to give informed consent. Seven participants were invited to each of the seven FGDs with the exception of the TB healthcare professional FGD, which consisted of 12 participants. This related to the logistical challenges of organizing more than one FGD with this group due to their working hours and time constraints coupled with the aim of representation from the public, private, and NGO sectors of TB healthcare. collection: The study team consisted of diverse members from multiple sectors including a physician, senior TB researchers, social scientists, public health professionals, and project managers.

The interview guide consisted of open-ended questions to explore the perceptions of participants concerning protective factors and risk factors for exposure to TB and development of TB disease; barriers and facilitators to accessing and engaging with TB diagnosis and care, including the recommendations for better access and engagement with TB diagnosis and care; and the socio-economic impact on people with TB of being ill with the disease.",

This was noted to potentially increase the likelihood of a delayed diagnosis, more advanced disease at presentation, and acquisition of DR-TB during treatment. The perceived lack of knowledge was predominantly felt to relate to suboptimal TB education, advocacy, and political commitment from health system and governmental leaders. Participants also reported that the current health education programs are Across all the FGDs, participants described the need to raise community awareness on risk factors for TB, mode of TB transmission, and TB signs and symptoms. Community stakeholders particularly felt that future awareness-raising programs would benefit by informing communities about available free TB diagnostic and treatment services in their local area and adding a component to reduce TB-related stigma.

Previously, similar campaigns focused on TB awareness through door-to-door visits, health promotion at health facilities, or educational outreach into communities. Such campaigns were perceived to increase knowledge on TB, advocate for free TB services, and empower communities to make informed choices. As highlighted by participants, in addition to commonly used platforms such as leaflets, radio, and television, future educational campaigns in Nepal would benefit from using technology such as mobile phones -which are used by over 90% households in both urban and rural areas 32 -or, where appropriate, social media.Of the perceived psychosocial barriers to accessing TB diagnosis and care in Nepal, stigma predominated. Participants mentioned feelings of guilt among people with TB, fear of disclosure, and experience of discrimination. This mirrors findings from diverse settings, which show that experiences of stigma are highly prevalent among people with TB and can impede access to TB services.33 For example, in Zambia, a cohort study showed that anticipated and enacted stigma of people with TB resulted in delayed diagnosis, poor treatment adherence, reduced quality of life, and represented a distinct challenge to successful screening of their household contacts.34 It was notable that people with MDR-TB reported severe negative psychosocial impacts of their illness.
