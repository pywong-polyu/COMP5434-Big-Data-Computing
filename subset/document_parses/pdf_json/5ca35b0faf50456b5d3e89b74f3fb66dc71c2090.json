However, evidence directly testing the link between infectious diseases and political ideology and partisanship is lacking. Across four studies, including a large sample representative of the U.S. population (N > 12,000), we demonstrate that higher environmental levels of human transmissible diseases and avoidance of germs from human carriers predict conservative ideological and partisan preferences. During the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 848), we replicated this germ aversion finding and determined that these conservative preferences were primarily driven by avoidance of germs from outgroups (foreigners) rather than ingroups (locals). Moreover, socially conservative individuals expressed lower concerns of being susceptible to contracting infectious diseases during the pandemic and worried less about COVID-19. These effects were robust to individual-level and state-level controls. We discuss these findings in light of theory on parasite stress and the behavioral immune system and with regard to the political implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In contrast to other threats to human welfare (e.g., intergroup violence), disease-causing parasites are largely imperceptible, and the origin and means of transmission were largely unknown prior to relatively recent scientific advancements (Murray & Schaller, 2016) . Consequently, traits, behaviors, cultural practices, and belief systems that facilitate the detection and avoidance of infectious diseases would have had evolutionary benefits for humans living in ancestral environments, leading to their retention through natural selection (Murray & Schaller, 2016; Schaller, Park, & Faulkner, 2003; Thornhill & Fincher, 2014) .",

            "text": "Parasite stress theory (PST) posits that objective regional differences in levels of infectious disease can predict cross-cultural variation in a range of traits, values, and beliefs (Thornhill & Fincher, 2014) . For example, environmental infectious disease prevalence is associated with preferences for ingroup members and avoidance or exclusionary attitudes towards outgroups (Brown, Fincher, & Walasek, 2016; O'Shea, Watson, Brown, & Fincher, 2020) , collectivistic (vs. individualistic) social structures (Fincher, Thornhill, Murray, & Schaller, 2008; Morand & Walther, 2018; Murray, Trudeau, & Schaller, 2011) , conventional social norms (van Leeuwen, Park, Koenig, & Graham, 2012) , and stronger adherence to traditionalism or authoritarianism (Thornhill, Fincher, & Aran, 2009; Tybur et al., 2016; Zmigrod, Ebert, G\u00f6tz, & Rentfrow, 2020) . Importantly, past research has relied on the right-wing authoritarianism scale (Tybur et al., 2016) or authoritarian child-rearing values and U.S. state laws (Zmigrod et al., 2020) to estimate regional-level conservatism. Here we substantially enhance the specificity of the relationship between infectious diseases and political conservatism by measuring participants' political leanings (i.e., Conservative vs. Liberal) and partisan preferences (i.e., Republican vs. Democrat) in the U.S. context. Moreover, the effect of parasite stress on social attitudes and behavior should be constrained to human transmittable (nonzoonotic) pathogens. In contrast, zoonotic disease variants can only transfer from nonhuman animals to humans and, therefore, have minimal impact on human behavior (Thornhill, Fincher, Murray, & Schaller, 2010) . Yet this distinction between zoonotic and nonzoonotic parasites is rarely examined in the literature (Thornhill et al., 2010;  for recent exceptions, see Mullett, Brown, Fincher, Kosinski, & Stillwell, 2020; Zmigrod et al., 2020) and, to our knowledge, has not been investigated in relation to political ideology or partisanship in the United States.",

For example, people negatively evaluate and avoid individuals with physical characteristics indicating illness or who are associated with disease (Kurzban & Leary, 2001) and view with more suspicion members of unfamiliar outgroups who may be more likely to carry pathogens for which one lacks immunity (Faulkner, Schaller, Park, & Duncan, 2004; Navarrete & Fessler, 2006; Petersen, 2017) . Importantly, hypervigilance towards potential human carriers of infectious disease has been observed in relation to both situational cues of infectious diseases (Murray & Schaller, 2016; O'Shea et al., 2020) and individual differences in perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD; Aar\u00f8e, Petersen, & Arceneaux, 2017; Duncan, Schaller, & Park, 2009; Murray & Schaller, 2016) .",

            "text": "Individual differences in the perception of disease threats have also been implicated in a broad range of norms and practices that help protect the ingroup and defend the cultural status quo. For example, social conformity increases when disease threat is made salient (Mortensen, Becker, Ackerman, Neuberg, & Kenrick, 2010; Wu & Chang, 2012) , especially among individuals chronically high in PVD (Murray & Schaller, 2012; Terrizzi Jr., Shook, & McDaniel, 2013) . However, in our view, these tendencies are more likely to relate to germ aversion rather than infectability concerns. To clarify, germ aversion is empirically associated with beliefs in a dangerous world, a need for order, and a desire to dominate outgroups, whereas infectability concerns are not (Duncan et al., 2009; O'Shea et al., 2020) . Infectability concerns involve perceptions of one's immunological functioning and general susceptibility to infectious diseases, but it is not oriented towards mitigating pathogen transmission. In contrast, germ aversion measures avoidant behaviors towards potential carriers of disease, towards which strong motivational control processes can be exerted. Importantly, no research has directly examined whether the two PVD dimensions (i.e., infectability concerns and germ aversion) are differentially associated with political ideology and partisanship, despite its relevance to many of these aforementioned outcomes. Here, we predict that germ aversion will be more strongly implicated in the behavioral immune system than infectability concerns and will, therefore, more strongly relate to conservative political ideology and partisanship.",

For example, the group centrism elicited by the behavioral immune system shares a natural resonance with the emphasis on ingroup loyalty associated with conservatism (Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2009; Jost et al., 2009; van Leeuwen et al., 2012) . Moreover, the emphasis on conformity and adherence to established norms produced by the behavioral immune system mirrors the premium conservatism places on social cohesion and the preservation of traditional lifeways and structures (Federico, Fisher, & Deason, 2011; Tybur et al., 2016) . We refer to these constructs as prepolitical because while they may reflect beliefs about desirable patterns of social relations and have implications for civic life, they nonetheless lack direct linkages to beliefs about government, elected officials, public affairs, or policy prescriptions (Feldman, 1988) . In the same way that political psychologists recognize that personality traits are distinct from political preferences even though it can shape political ideology (Vitriol, Larsen, & Ludeke, 2019) , we too view the implications of disease threat for psychological motivations, orientations, and values to be distinct from its implications for partisanship and ideology.",

But none of these perspectives has directly linked the behavioral immune system to ideology or partisanship (for a recent exception, see Aar\u00f8e, Petersen, & Arceneaux, 2020 , who used a measure of germ aversion to predict political preferences but did not compare it to infectability concerns). More importantly, while these prepolitical orientations and goals can lead to more conservative political preferences, these are nonetheless independent constructs from ideology and partisanship (Goren, Motta, & Smith, 2020) that can have distinct impact on political judgment and behavior (Feldman, 2003; Goren, 2005) . In general, underlying prepolitical orientations do not always map directly onto political constructs, like ideology and partisanship, for all members of the general public (e.g., Federico et al., 2011; Federico & Malka, 2018) , and so the need to understand if or how disease threat directly shape political ideology and partisanship is pressing.",

For example, disgust can be elicited in response to moral and sexual cues but does not covary with environmental levels of parasite stress (Tybur et al., 2016; Tybur, Lieberman, & Griskevicius, 2009 ). In our view, disgust is an inadequate proxy for PVD in that it fails to directly tap feelings of subjective infectability concerns or behavioral motivations to avoid germs from human carriers of disease (Duncan et al., 2009) . Disgust sensitivity measures also focus on susceptibility to disgust as a general affective response, whereas PVD is conceptualized more specifically as a constellation of personal beliefs about infectability and the avoidance behaviors elicited when exposure to germs is heightened.

In Studies 1 and 2, we test our PST hypothesis by examining the relationship between various individual-level political ideology and partisanship variables and environmental levels of both nonzoonotic and zoonotic disease rates across states within the United States. In Study 3, we test our behavioral immune system hypothesis, by examining political ideology and partisanship in relation to PVD. Study 4 conceptually replicates Study 3 using data gathered during the first peak phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States (April 2020). Empirical evidence consistent with our two hypotheses would provide strong support for the unique role of infectious disease and germ aversion in predicting political ideology and partisanship. In all studies, we expect our predicted effects to survive the inclusion of various controls that covary with political ideology and partisanship.

These eight nonzoonotic diseases accounted for over 90% of all the infectious diseases reported by the CDC in the years analyzed. The second metric used estimates from Mullett et al. (2020) which uses the CDC's state-wise median infectious mortality rates for the years 1979-98. The third metric was the same as the second, except it did not include rates of sexually transmitted disease. This modification to the index eliminates a potential confound with sexual life-history strategy, which has also been theorized to relate to political preferences (Figueredo et al., 2006; Weeden & Kurzban, 2014) .",

Participants volunteered for the study in exchange for extra credit in one or more of their psychology courses. Upon registration, all participants were emailed a link to an online survey for the first wave of the study (Time 1; T1) and instructed to complete it immediately after checking a box to indicate informed consent. Two days after completing the T1 survey, participants were recontacted via an email prompt with a link to a second online survey (T2). All participants completed both surveys between October 10 and November 5, 2012. Approximately two months later (T3), participants were recontacted a third time to complete a survey that measured their voting behavior in the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election. Table S9 in the online supporting information reports the demographic characteristics of participants in Study 3.",

Second, the United States had passed the predicted peak (April 14-15, 2020) of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Third, it is important to test whether our hypothesized results for germ aversion and infectability hold up amid (1) objective pandemic conditions and (2) related political messaging that might conceivably reduce PVD specifically among conservatives (Motta, Stecula, & Farhart, 2020) .

            "text": "Across four studies, we substantially extend prior work on PST and the behavioral immune system by examining the relationship between political partisanship and ideology and environmental levels of nonzoonotic diseases and avoidance of germs from human carriers. Study 1 found that individual-level ideological self-placement and affective preference for the Republican (vs. Democratic) Party were related to higher environmental levels of nonzoonotic (but not zoonotic) parasite stress in a large convenience sample, a set of findings we replicate in Study 2 using a sample representative of the American population. Extending these regional-level findings to the individual level, Study 3 found that germ aversion (but not general concerns about infectability) was associated with more conservative identifications and preferences. Study 4 also provided a conceptual replication amid the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak and extended the findings to conservative economic preferences. Moreover, individuals in Study 4 with socially conservative issue preferences also showed weaker infectability concerns. Perhaps this outcome was impacted by cues from conservative media downplaying the seriousness of the pandemic , which might lead some to overestimate their immune system functioning or underestimate the health risks posed by COVID-19. Importantly, in all cases, our results were robust to controls for relevant demographics, competing psychological determinants of political preferences, and (in Study 1 and 2) a wide range of state-level controls.",

Our findings also address a major gap in our understanding of the political implications of the behavioral immune system. Although PVD has been shown to predict conformity (Murray & Schaller, 2012; Wu & Chang, 2012) , ingroup preference (Fincher & Thornhill, 2012) , and exclusionary attitudes toward outgroups (O'Shea et al., 2020) , the current studies uncover how germ aversion and infectability are distinctly related to conservative ideological and partisan preferences among U.S. participants. Moreover, we suspect that past researchers might have overlooked the importance of specifically the germ-aversion dimension because the infectability-concern dimension is unrelated (Study 3) or negatively related (Study 4) to conservative political preferences. To clarify, when both the germ-aversion and the infectability-concern dimensions of the PVD scale are combined to create a total PVD score, which is a more common approach (see Terrizzi Jr. et al., 2013) , this total score was inconsistently related (Study 3; see Tables S12 and S13 in the online supporting information) or unrelated (Study 4; see Table S17 ) to conservative political preferences.",

Since conservatives show a stronger preference for interaction with ingroups (Graham et al., 2009) , it is possible that they may be motivated to downplay the threat of the virus (i.e., lower fear of COVID-19) if it primarily comes (imperceptibly) from interaction with valued ingroup members. However, if a threat is primarily confined (perceptibly) to outgroups, especially foreigners, perhaps conservatives will instead exaggerate the threat (cf. Crawford, 2017) .

Methodologically, our results provide a more precise look at the relationship between political preferences and the behavioral immune system than studies that rely solely on disgust sensitivity as an indicator of pathogen-avoidance motives, which have yielded weak (Aar\u00f8e et al., 2020) or inconsistent findings (Tybur et al., 2016) . By relying on more direct indicators of (1) objective environmental exposure to parasites transmittable by human carriers (i.e., nonzoonotic pathogens) and (2) pathogen avoidance that accounts for both subjective perceptions of susceptibility to infection and germ avoidance motivations, our results explicate the connection between political preferences, parasite stress, and the behavioral immune system. We would expect similar finding to those reported above within other nations, as well as across nations; however, further research in this regard is needed.",

Like other threat variables (e.g., Federico & Malka, 2018; Johnston et al., 2017; Jost et al., 2017, p. 20) , increased attention to public health concerns associated with infectious disease-both in communications from political elites and in media coverage of ongoing events-have the potential to produce a conservative shift in public opinion and ideological and partisan sympathies (e.g., Schaller, Hofer, & Beall, 2017) .
