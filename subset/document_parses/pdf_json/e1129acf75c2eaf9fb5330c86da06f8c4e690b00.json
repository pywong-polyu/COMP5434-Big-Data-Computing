Information on basic demographic data, stress prevalence, and attitude towards the stressful event was collected using a Google form circulated through social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and email. When participants agreed and submitted their response, self-consent was acknowledged. The criteria for participation in the survey were that participants had to be aged at least 15 years and understand English well. Students who did not meet these criteria were excluded. We randomly selected five local colleges in the capital of Delhi and surroundings and included students from different provinces. Participants were asked to name their provinces to identify the geographical area in which they were residing when the survey was conducted.

Regarding reliability, Cronbach's alpha was higher than 0.7 after deleting a factor that decreased the impact of the inter-item relationship. The Relative Importance Index (RII) was employed for the response variables to rank stressrelated items in the self-reported questionnaire on attitude towards COVID-19 and academic setbacks due to the pandemic. In addition, a correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between students' problems and the reasons underlying their perceived stress. Along with a logistic regression, a one-way ANOVA was performed to check the variance of socio-demographic details, which was compared with its statistical significance. In total, 99% of the students agreed to follow the health guidelines issued by the government, and 98.7% were confined at home. The most participants responded from Sikkim (42%), followed by Delhi (29%), Haryana (12%), and from other states (17%). Furthermore, 358 (87%) reported being interested in attending online academic activities and 372 (90%) refrained from the consumption of licit or illicit drugs during the pandemic. A ManneWhitney U-test was performed to analyse students' psychological concerns during lockdown. An independent hypothesis on equal probabilities of all items in the PSS and other parameters were excluded by the ChieSquare test, the results of which were highly significant. A null hypothesis was accepted with no difference regarding fear of COVID-19, and a non-significant difference (p > 0.001) was found for gender. Of the sample, females experienced more stress (2.36 AE 1.31) than males (2.32 AE 2.01). In addition, female students are more worried (mean \u00bc 3.03; p < 0.001) about their studies than male students (mean \u00bc 2.61; p < 0.001).",

This suggests a change in the existing curriculum to ensure an appropriate fit with the online mode of teaching as well as the provision of enhanced counselling and guidance regarding the current situation. However, consuming alcohol and violation of policies are negatively correlated. With limited resources available concerning the impact on students' life because of COVID-19, the present study also found the prevalence of stress due to the pandemic. The one-way ANOVA and multiple logistic regression confirmed the association of the PSS with routine academic studies and confinement due to COVID-19. Previous studies reported that mental and psychological episodes such as stress and fear affect the efficacy of life. 12, 18 Aligned with the hypothesis of this study, selfmanagement problems, ongoing academic activities, and the non-opening of educational institutions were all related to stress. Similar studies by 7, 19 on Chinese students also reported a psychological imbalance among university students due to the COVID-19 outbreak. An Italian study 20 sought to understand how students are coping with the situation. In some situations, parents are also stressed by the payment of tuition fees after losing their jobs, which exacerbates students' stress. 12 Social support during this health emergency is thus crucial. 21, 22 In this study, students reported their interest in engaging with social activities that would help them overcome their fear and anxiety.",
