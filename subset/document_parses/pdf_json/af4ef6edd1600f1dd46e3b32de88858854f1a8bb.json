We contrast treatment of fictitious Black and White job applicants in the labor market for service-related job openings, specifically applicants with prior experience as a police officer, firefighter, or code enforcement officer. Results reveal that the White advantage in employer call-backs and requests for an interview receded during the protests and unrest following the killing of George Floyd, even to the point of producing a Black advantage.",

Audit studies are a type of field experiment used to test for discriminatory behavior, typically in studies of employment or housing discrimination [7] . Whereas an expansive empirical literature has developed over the past two decades using audit and related correspondence experiments to examine employment discrimination [8] [9] [10] small number of studies similar to ours leveraged a natural experiment with an audit experiment to examine how rates of employment discrimination may change in response to policy or exogenous shocks [11] [12] [13] . However, none of these studies of employment discrimination have examined the context of an exogenous shock associated with police violence and resulting social protests against racial injustice. We implemented our audit experiment in two waves, before and then during the heightened unrest associated with the murder of George Floyd. For our experiment, we submitted fictitious r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to real service-related job openings posted on Indeed.com and Craigslist, using racially distinctive names to signal race, and then recorded whether a given job applicant received an affirmative response from the employer to interview for the position or to discuss the job (via a voicemail, text, or email). Analyses to follow focus on whether the gap in response rates between Black and White individuals varied significantly from the period prior to Mr. Floyd's murder to the period immediately following his murder.",

First, our study is informed and motivated by work on the role of the police as an instrument of oppression against ethnic communities [14, 15] . As social scientists have importantly ascertained, in many marginalized communities, the police are the face of the government, and interactions with the police represent the primary way residents interact with the state. The protests in the wake of George Floyd's murder were a response not merely to the murder, but to the continued marginalization and subjugation of Black communities by state actors, particularly the police [15] . Our contribution to this literature is to examine whether the occurrence of George Floyd's murder, and the mobilization against state oppression and racial injustice that followed, yielded gains for marginalized communities, in this case in the realm of employment.",

These feelings can help us disentangle whether to expect progress on race relations following large-scale social protests, or perhaps a backlash, as has been a common narrative about the fallout from the civil rights protests of the 1960s [5, 18, 19] .",

            "text": "To Blumer, prejudice is relational, and derives from a perceived challenge to group position. Importantly, but perhaps obviously, perceived group position is not static. Because group position and race relations are dynamic, Blumer theorized a process of \"collective definition\" to understand the ways in which groups form views about relative group positions of dominant and subordinate groups [16, 17] . Quillian and Midtb\u00f8en characterize Blumer's theory as a situational theory of discrimination, and suggest that the extent of discrimination against an outgroup depends on contemporary social forces [7] . Pertinent to the current study, Blumer and Duster (p.131) argue that this process of assessment and reassessment of race relations is \"profoundly influenced by highly-dramatic events,\" such as \"well-publicized brutal police action against members of a racial group\" [17] . Prompted by police violence and a rising consciousness of stark racial inequalities in society, superordinate groups may be confronted by an antagonistic pair of forces, one involving action to maintain social advantages through exclusion practices and the other a \"gate-opening orientation\" in which the barriers to an equal and equitable society are lowered, even if temporarily [17] . For instance, increasing awareness of racial injustices may lead superordinate groups to reconsider its \"feeling of proprietary claim to certain areas of privilege and advantage\" (p.4), thereby opening up access to subordinate groups to some of the advantages of their position [16] . Indeed, one reason we draw upon group threat theory to situate our study over other explanations for employment discrimination (e.g., racial prejudice, implicit bias, organizational and institutional theories) is that group threat may be able to explain relatively abrupt shifts in discriminatory practices whereas other perspectives may predict slower change.",

In their study of the anti-Muslim terrorist attacks by Anders Breivik in Norway in 2011, Birkelund and colleagues use two waves of an audit experiment to determine if employment discrimination against individuals of Pakistani descent declined as solidarity with Muslims purportedly grew following the attacks [12] . However, they do not find evidence that employment discrimination against Pakistanis changed from before to three to five months after the attack. The authors acknowledge, however, that they were unable to examine labor market practices immediately after the terrorist attack (i.e., less than three months), so it possible that there may have been a very short-term reduction in employment discrimination against Pakistani job applicants, which had reverted to pre-existing levels within three months.",

For instance, some employers may view experience as a police officer as a signal that the individual holds prejudicial views or may be overly aggressive and controlling.

Using data from the Fatal Encounters repository on police killings (http://www.fatalencounters.org/), we categorized primary cities in each of the metro areas in the Northeast with more than one million population as either having low or high rates of police violence. We did so by ranking the cities based on the rate of deaths by the police from 2013 to 2017 and splitting the list at the median. We then randomly selected one metro area to sample from the bottom half (Boston) and one from the top half (Philadelphia) of the distribution in terms of rates of police violence. We only sampled large metro areas in order to ensure a sufficiently large number of potential jobs for which to apply, and to avoid diluting the job market with fictitious applications.",

For instance, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average unemployment rate in Boston was 2.65% in the first time period of our study (May 2019 to March 2020), and 5.85% in Philadelphia. In the second time period, June and July 2020, the average unemployment rate was 12.1% in Boston and 18.95% in Philadelphia. Hence, we suggest that comparisons related to the level of employment across time periods be interpreted cautiously.",

Research suggests that the costs to employers for discriminating will be higher in a tight labor market with few suitable job applicants [30, 31] . Conversely, there may be less cost to discriminating employers in a slack labor market. Hence, we might expect that during the early stages of the pandemic, employers would have been more likely to discriminate against Black applicants given slack in the market. Should we find that the White-Black gap in employer call-backs narrowed following the protests from Mr. Floyd's murder, the reduction may be less than in might have been in a \"normal\" labor market not characterized by pandemic-induced slack.",

We sampled recently posted jobs on Indeed.com and Craigslist by convenience rather than conducting a random sample of all recently posted job openings. Moreover, our design focuses on entry-level service-related jobs, particularly those with a routine demand for new employees [32]. These jobs represent just a fraction of the labor market, and the nature of recruitment for these jobs may result in typically lower levels of discrimination than in other sectors. For instance, per our discussion above about slack vs. tight labor markets, given the frequent demand for qualified workers in the skilled trades, delivery and transportation, sales, and office and customer support, discrimination rates may be lower than with other jobs because there is often a shortage of workers. The implication is that in various ways, our results may not fully generalize to the population of jobs in a labor market. Of course, this limitation is true across all audit studies of labor market discrimination.",

On the other hand, we are unable to determine if the findings of our study generalize beyond the narrow professional background characteristics we include in the study. We acknowledge the trade-off and potential limitation of this design choice. By design, correspondence studies of discrimination involve deception, given that participants, employers in our case, are not made aware that they are participating in an experiment. Therefore, we did not obtain informed consent from the employers who participated in the study. There are trade-offs between the costs and benefits of audit and correspondence designs, but the use of deceptive study designs may be acceptable under the following conditions: a) other research designs (i.e., that do not use deception) cannot similarly overcome the methodological obstacles to measuring discrimination; b) the topic has social relevance; and c) there is minimal harm to participants and minimal negative externalities [34] [35] [36] . We suggest that our study meets these conditions, and in our S1 File we provide a detailed justification for our use of deception.",

The White-to-Black ratio in terms of the call-back rate is 1.37 (24.5 / 17.9), which is almost exactly equivalent to the disparity reported in a recent meta-analysis of audit studies by Quillian and colleagues [8] . In that study, the authors find no change in the levels of employment discrimination against Black applicants in the US between 1989 and 2015, and that White applicants received, on average, 36% more callbacks from prospective employers than otherwise similarly qualified Black applicants. Hence, whereas our focus is specifically on entry-level job applicants with a prior background in policing, firefighting, or code enforcement, we observe a pattern of employment discrimination similar to other audit studies of employment discrimination in the United States.",

This observed shift in racially disparate hiring practices after a highly-dramatic event is consistent with Blumer and Duster's theorizing about group threat [17] . The death of Mr. Floyd and the protests that immediately ensued may have raised consciousness about racial inequalities among employers, leading some to reduce exclusionary practices against Black job applicants. For how long employment practices remain more equitable as societal attention to racial injustice wanes is a critical question, although not one we are able to answer in the present study. Social psychological research on interventions to alter implicit racial biases suggests that while preferences for some racial groups may be malleable in the very short term, biases tend to be quite stable in the long-run [37, 38] . Consistent with these studies, Birkelund et al. did not find evidence of a sustained change in ethnic discrimination against Pakistani job applicants after an anti-Muslim terrorist attack in Norway [12] . Moreover, recent meta-analyses of audit experiments, in both the United States and Britain, reveal that levels of hiring discrimination against ethnic minorities tend to remain stubbornly persistent over many decades [8, 9] .",
