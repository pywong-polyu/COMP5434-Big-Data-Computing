            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is the most deadly outbreak worldwide since the Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918, and its burden has been particularly heavy in the older population. Nearly one third of older patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia died in hospital (1) (2) (3) . Most deaths are the result of respiratory failure linked to viral pneumonia, for which therapeutic management is still a matter of debate. However, the distinction between bacterial and viral pneumonia remains particularly difficult in practice, and influenza experience has shown that coinfections are not rare in viral pneumonia, especially in older individuals (4) . Despite recent advances in this field (5) , there is currently no distinctive tool to conclusively distinguish SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia. Because delayed antibiotic treatment has been associated with worse outcomes in bacterial pneumonia (6) , empirical antibiotic treatment was initially recommended for COVID -19 pneumonia in many guidelines (7) . Since then, increasing data have highlighted a very low frequency of documented bacterial co-or superinfection in COVID-19 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Moreover, the widespread use of empirical antibiotics during the current pandemic appears to have contributed to the development of multidrug-resistant microorganisms (15) (16) (17) . Thus, the most recent guidelines consensually suggest a restrictive use of antibacterial drugs in patients with COVID-19 (10, (18) (19) (20) . However, the level of evidence for such recommendations remains very low and reposes on small-scale observational data (3, (21) (22) (23) . Interventional studies only focused on azithromycin and failed to demonstrate any benefit compared with usual care (24) (25) (26) . Antibiotics remain still widely prescribed in practice (8, 9, 15) , especially in frail older individuals (3, 27) .",

There has been considerable concern about the widespread use of antibiotics since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many authors have detected an increase in highly resistant pathogens and plead for raised antimicrobial stewardship efforts (14) (15) (16) (17) . However, the clinical presentation of severe COVID-19 is frequently indistinguishable from bacterial or fungal sepsis. Given the paucity of active therapeutics, physicians are often tempted to prescribe antibiotics in frail older patients with a severe presentation. Thus, there is a need for a higher level of evidence to support recent guidelines (10, (18) (19) (20) against systematic antibiotic treatment in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, especially in the geriatric setting.",

However, antibiotic use varies considerably from one center to another (8, 9, 40) , as highlighted in our study (from 11.2% to 74.9% of patients), stressing the need for stronger evidence on this issue. Broad-spectrum therapies, mainly beta-lactams, were frequently prescribed, as recommended in recent guidelines for bacterial pneumonia (34,39). Contrary to other reports (9,11), macrolides were a minority of antibiotic prescriptions. As in other reports, we found that the likelihood of early antibiotic prescription was correlated with the initial severity of pneumonia, rather than with comorbidities (21) .

            "text": "Here, one interesting result is the relatively high frequency of bloodstream infections compared with previous reports in younger patients (12, 41) , although they may have been slightly overestimated by blood culture contaminations (DNAse negative staphylococci) (41). Our study population was expected to be at higher risk for severe superinfections for several reasons. First, older patients have already shown to be more prompt to develop superinfections during COVID-19 (42) . Second, COVID-19 could particularly predispose to bacterial infection since bacteremia was found to be more frequent in COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 critically ill patients (43) . This risk may be higher than in other infections: patients with COVID-19 were 2.5 times more likely to develop bacteremia than patients with influenza (44) . The reasons for such a high frequency are not elucidated. However, the high frequency of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococci and Candida, already documented by others in COVID-19 (9, 11, 14, 45, 46) , suggest a potential digestive translocation (47), as already described at the acute phase of bacterial pneumonia (48) . Digestive involvement is frequent in COVID-19 patients, especially in the older population (49) , and could be due to ischemic damage in the gastrointestinal tract rather than direct viral damage (47) . Interestingly, C. difficile colitis was rare, as also already reported by others. Even if antibiotic treatment remains a major risk factor for C. difficile infection in A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t COVID-19 inpatients (50), this low rate could be due to COVID-19-linked reinforced cleaning procedures and reduced patient mobility (51) .",

            "text": "Whether systematic early antibiotic treatment should be introduced in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 pneumonia remains a current issue. In a recent single-center study, authors showed that early administered antibiotics did not impact mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (22), confirming similar results in non-critically ill units (3, 21) . However these previous results did not have sufficient power to adequately assess this question. We believe that our large multicenter data further reinforce previous findings and strongly discourage systematic antibiotic treatment. Further research is needed to define the patients for whom antibiotics should be indicated and in which settings. Our results also show that documented bacterial superinfections often develop a week or more after COVID-19 diagnosis (median of 8 days) in patients without early antibiotic treatment, further mitigating the benefit of a systematic strategy. Some authors suggest that antibiotic therapy should be reserved for the patients with the most severe presentations (10, 52) , but no data to date support this position. Biomarkers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin) may play a role in deciding when antibiotics can be withheld (5, 46) . Also, the ability of thoracic computed tomography to distinguish alveolar infiltrates associated with bacterial pneumonia as opposed to the typical glass ground opacities seen in COVID-19 remains to be evaluated (10) . This study has some limitations. First, only patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a medical ward were included, and those initially hospitalized in the ICU were not considered. These results cannot be extrapolated to more severe patients, especially those under mechanical ventilation. Second, because no systematic sampling procedure was performed in these wards (screening was based on clinical judgment), microbiological documentation was often missing in this retrospective study. Thus, we probably underestimated bacterial infection occurrence. However, we believe that this study represents the real-world situation in most hospitals. Third, most of patients in the group without early antibiotic treatment during the first 48 hours did receive antibiotics later during their hospital stay.",
