In this study, we analyzed RNA-seq transcriptome data from Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to five other viruses namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-MERS), influenzavirus A (FLUA), influenzavirus B (FLUB), and rhinovirus (RHINO) compared to mock-infected cells and characterized their coding and noncoding RNA transcriptional portraits. The induction of interferon, inflammatory, and immune response was a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comprehensive bioinformatics revealed the activation of immune response and defense response to the virus as a common feature of viral infection. Interestingly however, the degree of functional categories and signaling pathways activation varied among different viruses. Ingenuity pathways analysis highlighted altered conical and casual pathways related to TNF, IL1A, and TLR7, which are seen more predominantly during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, the activation of chemotaxis and lipid synthesis was prominent in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Despite the commonality among all viruses, our data revealed the hyperactivation of chemotaxis and immune cell trafficking as well as the enhanced fatty acid synthesis as plausible mechanisms that could explain the inflammatory cytokine storms associated with severe cases of COVID-19 and the rapid spread of the virus, respectively.",

Among the most common are the coronaviruses, including severe changes in host cells were unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not addressed thus far. In the current study, we compared six datasets of Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells infected with different viruses: SARS-CoV-2 [25] , SARS-CoV, SARS-MERS [26] , FLUA, FLUB, and RHINO [27] . Previous studies showed the suitability of the Calu-3 cell model due to its susceptibility to infection by respiratory viruses, including influenza virus A, rhinovirus, and SARS-CoV. Calu-3 polarize into stable cultures more rapidly than NHBE cells, which can differentiate into multiple cell types and layers, while Calu-3 cells culture in monolayers more efficiently. When subjected to infection, the Calu-3 cell model did not appear to alter tight junction formation, even though infection was found to be persistent for at least 6 weeks, providing a more stable and malleable model for studying viral infection, such as SARS-Cov-2 [28] . Our computation analysis provides a side-by-side comparison of molecular changes in host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 and the aforementioned respiratory viruses. While Calu-3 cells exhibited common altered functional categories and signaling pathways in response to various viruses, there were remarkable differences in the magnitude of the response. Our study provides insight into the pathogenesis and host response to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) compared to other common viruses, and it highlights chemotaxis and lipid synthesis as the main affected functional categories.",

Differentially expressed genes from each study (log2 FC) were subsequently subjected to IPA analysis. Differentially expressed genes were imported into the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems; www.ingenuity.com) and were subjected to functional annotations and regulatory network analysis using upstream regulator analysis (URA) to analyze upstream molecules, which are connected to genes in the dataset via a set of either direct or indirect relationships based on changes in expression. Mechanistic networks (MN) analysis was employed by IPA to generate signaling cascades that connect upstream regulators to help visualize how they connect to explain the observed changes in gene expression. Downstream effector analysis (DEA) identifies the biological processes (disease) and functions, which are casually affected by the deregulation of genes in datasets and predicts their activation state (Z score). IPA uses precise algorithms to predict functional regulatory networks from gene expression data and provides a significance score for each network according to the fit of the network to the set of focus genes in the database. The p-value is the negative log of P, and it represents the possibility that focus genes in the network are found together by chance [30] . The comparison analysis feature in IPA was employed to enable the visualization of differentially affected cellular processed and pathways in Calu-3 cells following infection with the aforementioned viruses. Affected functional categories and pathways exhibiting \u2265 2.0 Z score (absolute) and p < 0.05 in at least one of the conditions were considered significant and were retained.",

Overall, we observed a larger number of genes to be upregulated (1426 upregulated versus 225 downregulated; Supplementary Table S2) Table S4 ). Hierarchical clustering and GO analysis showed the activation of cellular processes related to immune response and defense response to virus, as well as the suppression of microtubule and cell division processes ( Figure 2c ). Calu-3 cells infected with FLUB exhibited 1308 upregulated and 4435 downregulated genes (Supplementary Table S5 ), hence exhibiting the most alteration in gene expression in Calu-3 cells. Most of the activated cellular processes were those involved in the immune system process, in response to cytokine stimulus and inflammatory response, while most of the suppressed cellular processes were those involved in cell cycle regulation ( Figure 2d ). Lastly, characterizing the transcriptional landscape of RHINO-infected Calu-3 cells identified 382 upregulated genes versus 154 that were downregulated (Supplementary Table S6 ). Among the upregulated processes, defense response to virus and immune response were heightened, as well as multiple processes found in common with other viruses such as inflammatory response, cytokine activity, and general immune response. Figure 2e also highlights some of the suppressed processes in RHINO-infected cells, including GTPase activity, tubulin binding, and response to hypoxia. Taken together, our data revealed a considerable overlap in affected cellular processes upon infection with various viruses, mostly processes related to immune responses and cytokine activity, inclusive of interferons, and responsive to external stimuli.",

Evidently, some pathways are predicted to be activated by some viruses and not others; for example, viruses of the coronavirus family exhibited unity in some predicted pathway functions. All three coronaviruses exhibited enrichment in most canonical pathways, but they were uniform in pathways that were suppressed such as Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) signaling, which was significantly activated in FLUB infection. Interestingly, however, a higher degree of enrichment was observed in SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells in dendritic cell maturation, TREM1 signaling, High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) signaling, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells, the role of pattern recognition receptors in the recognition of bacteria and viruses, IL-8 signaling, and several others ( Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S7 ).

Overall, the majority of functional categories were similarly affected by the six types of viruses. However, our data identified several functional categories that were differentially affected by individual viruses. For instance, several functional categories were severely suppressed by the FLUB virus, which were otherwise activated by the other five viruses (i.e., cell viability, survival, movement, and transactivation of RNA; Figure 6 ). Functional categories that are universally upregulated in response to all six viral infections include antiviral response, cellular homeostasis, and the migration of phagocytes. Those functions are suppressed by all six viral infections, with variable degrees, and include replication of the RNA virus. A remarkable observation from the disease and function analysis highlighted the significant activation of several disease and function categories in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells compared to all other virus-infected Calu-3 cells. Precisely, a higher activation Z score was observed for cell movement, migration of cells, chemotaxis, cell movement of myeloid cells, leukocyte migration, cell movement of granulocytes, cell movement of phagocytes, as we all as many other categories, all implying a robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2.

Previous work by Yeung et al., reported renal infection and an induction of apoptosis in MERS-CoV-infected renal cells, which would be concordant with our findings from the current analysis of Calu-3 cells [26] . Canonical pathway analyses in the IPA of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells highlight a higher degree of enrichment in pathways related to dendritic cell (DC) maturation. DCs are important antigen-presenting cells in the initiation of an immune response, enabling the priming and activation of T cells to fight foreign infection [34] . A successful virus is likely to take steps in preserving their host and maintaining their replication reservoir; thus, most viruses will allow for a host immune response after the release of new virions into the host microenvironment [35] . A particularly strong host immune response through the enriched maturation of DCs can also lead to autoimmune complications such as those seen in COVID-19. Among the top upregulated genes in the dendritic cells category in SARS- CoV-2 Calu-3 cells from the current study were IFNB1, CSF2, TNF, IL-6, IL1A,  IL1B, NFKBIA, ICAM1, LTB, IL12A, STAT1, CREB5, STAT2, and TNFRSF11B . Therefore, and while those genes are known to be involved in the maturation and function of dendritic cells, apparently, those genes could also be expressed by epithelial cells in response to viral infection. It is possible that the secretion of several of those chemokines (i.e., TNF, IL-6, IL1A, IL1B, and IL12A) by virally infected cells can orchestrate dendritic cell recruitment and function. For instance, Chomarat and colleagues reported that IL-6 can divert the differentiation of monocytes from dendritic cells to macrophages [36] . Interestingly, single-cell analysis of bronchial lavage from COVID-19 patients revealed the presence of monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages in severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting a possible role of IL-6 secreted by SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells in promoting FCN1+ macrophages differentiation from monocytes [37] . In another study, TNF-\u03b1 was shown to play a crucial role in the maturation of DC after adenovirus challenge and the activation of adaptive immunity in response to viral infection [38] . Therefore, it is plausible that cytokine secretion by SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells can shape the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses, in part through the activation of macrophages and DCs. Aside from the DCs category, IL-8 signaling was also activated. Among its many functions, IL-8 plays a role in the recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and na\u00efve T cells to the sites of infection, acting as a chemoattractant [39] . The resulting elevated levels of cytokines have shown adverse effects in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cytokine storm syndrome occurs when large numbers of cytokine-releasing cells are recruited, eliciting a systemic inflammatory response that when dysregulated, can cause hypotensive shock and multi-organ failure [40] . Increasing evidence has shown that cytokine storms may be fueling some COVID-19 deaths. In April 2020, the Pediatric Intensive Care Society in the United Kingdom observed children presenting multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care. Another report describes cases in the US, where patients with post-infectious cytokine release syndrome had significantly longer bouts of fever [41] .",

Several of the identified genes in the current study has also been validated by other groups. A study by Lau et al. on cell lysates of Calu-3 cells infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV showed significantly upregulated levels of IL-6 in MERS-CoV compared to SARS-CoV, while TNF, IFNB, and CXCL10 were greatly induced upon SARS-CoV infection compared to MERS-CoV, which would be concordant with data presented in the current study [42] . The expression of several cytokines identified in the current study (i.e., IL1B, IL-6, TNF, CCL2, CXCL9, and CXCL10) were also seen in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from COVID-19 patients, providing further support to our observation [37] .

Heightened chemotaxis functionality is particularly important to highlight, as this confirms the likelihood of macrophages and granulocytes recruitment to sites of infection, leading to the activated interferon response eluded to by the conical and casual pathway analysis in the current study. In line with our findings, recent single-cell analysis has highlighted the presence of neutrophils and macrophages in BAL as the hallmark associated with severe COVID-19 cases [37] . A study by Rzepka et al. looked at the immune response to Rat coronavirus (RCoV) viral infection through the response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in type I-like alveolar epithelial (AT1) cells. Interestingly, several CXC chemokines were found to be required for the chemotaxis of PMNs toward RCoV-AT1 but not mock-AT1 [46] , in concordance to our data, which identified several CXC chemokines to be associated with chemotaxis related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in the extracellular space of Calu-3-infected cells (Figure 6a) . Furthermore, the neutralization of both CXCL1 and CXCL3 in the RCoV study showed a reduction in PMN chemotaxis, but not in the complete blockage [46] , indicating a possible redundancy in some chemokines. Other potential chemotaxis-promoting factors also need to be explored in order to understand the exact mechanisms of chemotaxis and how they contribute to processes affecting the progression of viral infection. Alveolar macrophages secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines signals for the further chemotactic recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils, resulting in dysregulated inflammation. This lack of control prompts further macrophage infiltration, which could develop into lung injury through host organ attack and viral sepsis, creating even more complications for the patient infected [47] . Bouhaddou et al. provided a global phosphorylation overview and reported the production of a diverse number of cytokines as well as p38 MAPK and CK2 activation upon SARS-Cov-2 infection of vero E6 cells and reported morphological changes in SARS-Cov-2-infected cells-more specifically, actin-rich filopodial protrusions that were significantly longer and branched compared to normal cells, which also possessed budding viral particles [48] . Concordantly, in the current study, we observed a strong activation of the P38/MAPK pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells (activation Z score = 5.8, p = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u221227 ) as well as the activation of CK2 (CSNK2A1; activation Z score = 3.6, p = 6.9 \u00d7 10 \u221236 ) employing transcriptome and computational analyses.",

Lipids make up the main components of membranes and energy storage vesicles in eukaryotes, making them the first line of defense when encountering a pathogen [49, 50] . Targeting lipid signaling allows viruses to remodel host cells, making them the most optimal for their own benefit [51] . The surge in lipid biosynthesis also serves to provide membranes for 'safe' viral replication and assembly and subsequent exit through budding, enhancing viral spreading, as seen particularly in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection [52] . In addition to this, some viruses can encase themselves in lipid structures to avoid the recognition of their viral proteins, evading immune system recognition and prolonging its survival [51] . In fact, Dengue virus (DENV) has been proven to even hijack the host fatty acid synthase to sites of its own viral replication to further synthesize fatty acids [53] . Further research into the nature of virus-host lipid interactions can provide us with important targets, whereby anti-viral therapeutics targeting lipid metabolism can be potentially utilized for the control of viral infectious disease.",

In one study, 20 patients received 44 \u00b5g of IFN-\u03b2-1a subcutaneously every other day up to 10 days, along with conventional therapy (Clinical trial registration number: IRCT20151227025726N12). Within this time, virology clearance had decreased in time and there has been significant recovery in all patients within 14 days, supporting the use of IFN-\u03b2-1a in combination with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in the management of COVID-19 [54] . An early administration of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 infections has been proposed in the reduction of the viral burden, reducing the need for advanced cardiorespiratory support and preventing early mortality. Infliximab and Infliximab-abda to be used in this study are TNF\u03b1 inhibitors currently FDA-approved for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, including Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04425538).",

Our data can provide further insight for the development of additional therapies targeting the use of interferons and blockers of inflammatory mediators in the treatment of COVID-19. Altered conical and casual pathways related to TNF, IL1A, and TLR7, seen more predominantly during SARS-CoV-2 infection in our study, are just some potential targets for further investigations to assess their potential utilization in future clinical trials. Although findings from the current study remains to be validated experimentally, our findings serve as the basis for future work in the understanding of host response to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.",

Although we observed a large degree of overlap between affected genes ontologies and functional categories, SARS-CoV-2 in particular exhibited an enhanced activation of chemotaxis and lipid synthesis functional categories. These functions have been previously implicated in the progression of viral infection, namely via the recruitment of cytokine secreting cells leading to inflammation-induced complications such as tissue injury. The viral manipulation of lipid synthesis pathways have also been implicated in the masking of viral proteins, facilitating optimal conditions for viral replication and secretion through budding. Our findings from the current study provides novel insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection for better management of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic interventions.",

Sequencing libraries were prepared using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Influenza A and B, and the rhinovirus preparation methodologies are described in detail in Dissanayake et al., 2020 [27]. Viruses were isolated from patients in Hong Kong with Influenza A (H1N1) virus A/HK/415742/2009 and influenza B virus B/HK/411989/2011, and a patient with pneumonia from which rhinovirus species A type 1A was isolated. Both influenzas were propagated in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at 37 \u2022 C, while rhinovirus was propagated in rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells at 33 \u2022 C. Viruses were resuspended in 1 mL of minimum essential medium (MEM) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for influenza virus and Rhinovirus, respectively. Calu-3 cells were infected with FLUA, FLUB, and rhinovirus in DMEM-F12 medium. RNA isolation was performed using a QIAamp R Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).",
