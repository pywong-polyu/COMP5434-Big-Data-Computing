There has been no validation study of the ACE-III in patients with suspected dementia in a Taiwanese population, where the language is traditional Chinese. We aimed to culturally adapt and validate the ACE-III as a cognitive assessment tool for differentiating between people with and without dementia presenting to healthcare professionals in Taiwan with possible dementia. Methods: We culturally adapted the ACE-III for Taiwan (T-ACE-III) and tested it with consenting patients with suspected dementia in northern Taiwan who had been through the diagnostic process. We calculated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to test the ability of the T-ACE-III to differentiate between dementia and non-dementia cases using clinician diagnosis as the gold standard. We generated the Youden Index to determine the best cut-off score. Results: We recruited 90 Taiwanese individuals aged 49-93 years: 24 males and 33 females had dementia and 12 males and 21 females did not. The area under the ROC curve was 0.99 for distinguishing dementia from non-dementia. The T-ACE-III had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 78.8% when the cut-off score was 86/87. With a cut-off value of 73/74, the specificity was 100.0%, and sensitivity 89.5%. The highest Youden Index was 0.895, indicating the best overall cut-off point to be 73/74.",

Studies mostly conducted around two decades ago found that the prevalence of dementia in Taiwan was 3.4% in the age-range of 65-69 years, increasing to 36.9% for the over 90s age range (Sun et al., 2014) . A more recent Taiwanese national study between 2011 and 2013, found the data of very mild dementia was less reported and addressed in some early studies (Lin et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998a; Liu et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1995; Liu et al., 1998b; Liu et al., 1997) , indicating possible challenges in diagnosing very mild dementia (Chen, Wang, Ma, & Yang, 2014) . There is a pressing need for validating rapid and accurate tests for timely detection of possible dementia among Taiwanese populations.",

But data collected between 1992 and 2016, found internationally only approximately half of individuals who met dementia diagnostic criteria were formally diagnosed (Amjad, Roth, Samus, Yasar, & Wolff, 2016; Connolly, Gaehl, Martin, Morris, & Purandare, 2011; Lang et al., 2017; Savva & Arthur, 2015) . The project of the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan aimed to increase the diagnosis rate of dementia from 30% to 50% by 2020 and to 70% by 2025 (Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan, 2020) . Clinical assessments to precisely identify those individuals can be time-consuming but if only brief cognitive assessments are used, suspected dementia is often misclassified, because scores differ across factors such as age, education, and ethnicity (Ranson et al., 2019) . And, screeners often do no adjust for these demographic factors. Therefore, it is important to select an appropriate brief assessment in order to achieve accurate timely detection of dementia.",

The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) (Lin et al., 2002) , which takes around 15-20 minutes, but up to 30 minutes in patients with dementia (Teng et al., 1994) , gives particularly low scores in those who can only speak Taiwanese, after accounting for age and education (Chen, 1996) . So far, there has been no validated short (around 20 min or less) assessment that covers a wide range of cognitive domains to detect dementia in the Taiwanese population.",

The most significant difference between the two written forms of Chinese is the form of the individual characters. Simplified Chinese was implemented by the Chinese government between 1956 and 1964 in order to improve literacy but is often not understood in Taiwan especially by older people. We used the Cross-Cultural Adaptation Process (Beaton, Bombardier, Guillemin, & Ferraz, 2000) to guide the appropriate procedures for cultural adaptation of psychometric tests for the Taiwan population. This is used when assessments in one language are used in other populations with the same language, but differing cultures or language characters. So, for example, the terms used for the leaders of state differ (chairman in China and president in Taiwan). The form of characters (simplified Chinese in China, traditional Chinese in Taiwan) and the culture and history between two populations also differ. In particular, the influence of different Chinese dialects is relevant when culturally adapting neuropsychological assessments (Chen, 1996) . Further details are outlined below.",

C-CY who is a clinical neuropsychologist and linguistics expert is also a bilingual researcher, read the draft adapted version and discussed the changes with R-CY. It was adapted for Taiwanese culture after a series of discussions with two neurologists specializing in dementia, C-JH and C-TH, resulting in a consensus. Lastly, after pretesting in a small sample of Taiwanese colleagues and adapting it in line with their feedback, we generated the final version of the Taiwanese ACE-III (T-ACE-III). The main changes include replacing phonemic fluency with semantic fluency (from generating Chinese words starting with the word \"car\" to \"naming vegetables and fruits\"), using local Taiwanese name and addresses for memory, using pictures frequently seen in daily life in Taiwan (from pencil, panda, harp, barrel to spoon, kangaroo, drum, bulb) instead of in China for language and understanding, using traditional Chinese words for reading in language, and replacing English letters with numbers for visuospatial abilities. More importantly, alterations were made to language subtest items (asking them to repeat the phrases or proverbs) for Taiwanese language users and Taiwanese language was used throughout the assessments. The validated T-ACE-III is now available online (The University of Sydney, 2021).",

We found that language spoken (Taiwanese only compared to those who spoke both Mandarin and Taiwanese) was a significant predictor of ACE scores and this may be because those who only spoke Taiwanese had less education, echoing previous research that indicated education levels are negatively correlated with the choice of Taiwanese language (Tsao & Lu, 1999) . People who spoke only Taiwanese had less education and this was possibly a risk factor for dementia and may have led to lower scores on the T-ACE-III. However, the clinical diagnosis was made independently of T-ACE-III scores. In terms of the potential predictors on the diagnosis of dementia, logistic regression analysis found that demographic factors had no influence over and above T-ACE-III. In summary, in the cultural context of Taiwan, although demographic factors of language and education years have some influence on the T-ACE-III scores, it is still a powerful diagnostic tool in detecting patients with dementia, with T-ACE-III scores contributing more to diagnostic classification than other factors.",

Firstly, we recruited a consecutive sample of people to reduce selection bias and found that Taiwanese language users in the current study were all in the dementia group. Future research can further confirm the influence of language used on the T-ACE-III performance if necessary, enriching the sample and recruiting Taiwanese users in each group. Also, there were six participants in the dementia and one in the non-dementia groups who were illiterate. They may have led to problems in tasks with reading and writing elements which were not due to dementia, the cut-off values after adjusting the T-ACE-III scores is shown in appendix. We recommend that future research uses a larger sample size to explore different cut-off values of the T-ACE-III for participants with different educational levels and levels of literacy, so as to provide more tailored cut-off scores relating to educational and literacy needs, and thus increase the diagnostic accuracy. Secondly, we calculated internal consistency but no other forms of reliability in the analysis, such as test-retest reliability. Similarly, we did not examine discriminant validity. Thirdly, one question in the attention domain (orientation) has been replaced with the MMSE item due to the instruction of the simplified Chinese version not being clearly translated and tending to misguide the examiners during the assessing procedure. Fourth, the study could not be double-blind as the patients had been given a diagnosis as part of the routine clinical work-up. Both the patient and the researcher were aware of the diagnosis when administering psychometric tests but at that time the cutpoint for the T-ACE-III was not known. Lastly, under the threat of COVID-19, Taiwanese residents were required to wear a mask in all indoor spaces, such as hospitals and public transport. During the assessment procedures, both participants and examiners were wearing a mask, which may potentially have affected the understanding of instructions or conversations, especially for specific items, such as language tasks (asking participants to repeat a sentence, asking them to complete three actions) and attention tasks (asking participants to repeat three words). As a result, this may have contributed to a degree of variability in the T-ACE-III test performance, as well as the average time taken by individual participant to complete the T-ACE-III, which was slightly longer than 20 min in the dementia group. Apart from that, personal and environmental factors during the assessment session may also have contributed to variability in time taken to complete the T-ACE-III. However, since the T-ACE-III showed a high level of diagnostic accuracy for dementia, which was superior to those of MMSE and CASI and took shorter time to administer than CASI, the T-ACE-III would appear to be a promising screening tool for detecting dementia in a Taiwan population.",
