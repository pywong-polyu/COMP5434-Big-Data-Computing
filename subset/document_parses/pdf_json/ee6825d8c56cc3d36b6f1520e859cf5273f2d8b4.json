Annually, motor vehicle crashes lead to approximately 1.3 million fatalities and an additional 20-50 million injuries worldwide. Ninety percent of road traffic deaths occur in developing countries, although they hold only 54% of the world's registered vehicles [2, 3] . During 2013-2016, the rates of road traffic death were highest in Africa (26.6/100,000 population) and Southeast Asia (20.7/100,000). Thailand ranks among the countries with the highest rate of traffic deaths in the region and globally: 32.7/100,000 population [1] . RTIs are not only problematic for local populations; this was the leading cause of death among international travelers in developing countries [4, 5] . In high-risk settings, the proportion of traffic injury is more notable in travelers compared with the local population [6] . In Jeju Island, Korea, transportation-related injuries often occur among travelers more than local residents [7] . According to data from the Thai Road Safety Collaboration (TRSC), during 2019-2021, there were at least 12,754 RTIs and 907 deaths among international travelers in Thailand (fatality rate 907/12,745 = 7.1%). The fatality rate was much higher than among resident Thais who had RTIs during the same period (39,794/2,423,544 = 1.6%) [8] .",

Male drivers, alcohol/drug use, exceeding the speed limit, under-maintained vehicles, night-time driving, and poor road and traffic management are factors increasing the severity of an event. Using personal restraints (seatbelt/helmet), safer vehicles and improved road hazard treatment are preventive measures during the event; first aid, rescuer skills, and accessibility of rescue teams are preventive measures post-event [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . While factors influencing the severity outcome were well-established in previous research, most of the literature only focused on local road users. The epidemiological pattern of RTIs and the associated consequences can be varied among different world regions [17] . Travelers from different countries may be less familiar with road safety practices and emergency medical response systems at the destination, especially in a highrisk setting, like Thailand [6] . TRSC data from 2016-2020 showed that more than half of the deceased travelers following RTIs were Asian (67%) followed by European (13%) and African (10%). The top three countries of origin were Myanmar, China, and Laos [8] .",

A survey of travel medicine clinics worldwide reported that 70% discuss personal safety during pre-travel consultations, while almost all emphasize infection prevention [20, 21] . Although medical certificate is required for the driver license application in Thailand, discussion on RTIs' prevention is not a mandatory and mostly missed during a medical visit. Road safety campaigns targeting international travelers have also been insufficient; not only is there a language barrier [22] , but there are also cultural differences, particularly handedness of road traffic between countries [23] . Although international travelers have been affected greatly by RTIs in Thailand, studies on road traffic accidents among this group are limited [24] [25] [26] . In shortness of research data and attention, it is important to characterize the travelers and the risk factors associated with severe health outcome following RTIs. A better understanding of the risk factors associated with severe health outcomes following RTIs among international travelers will highlight and support policy-makers to consider additional preventive measures. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to identify the associated factors that increase the severity of health outcome among international travelers with RTIs in Thailand.",

More than half of the injured cases were male or were aged less than 35 years, at 68.9% and 78.5%, respectively. Five hundred and ninety-four (82.5%) of the injury cases came from Southeast Asia, followed by Europe (7%). The road user types among cases were most commonly drivers of motorized 2-3 wheelers (79.2%), followed by pedestrians (6.1%), cyclists (5.6%), and car occupants (4.3%). The possible risk factors among injured cases were reported as follows: 13.2% drank alcohol, 27.9% did not use a seatbelt/helmet, and 58.6% were driving at night. Only one-fifth had a history of tetanus vaccination. Of the 720 injured travelers, 144 (20%) had severe health outcomes (9% died and 11% were hospitalized). Table 1 displays statistically significant differences by Pearson's chi-square and ANOVA tests in the level of severity following RTIs by demographic characteristics, potential risk factors, and potential preventive factors. The majority of severe outcomes occurred among motorcycle riders (68.8% of fatal cases, 83.8% of hospitalized cases) and night-time drivers (65.6% of fatal cases, 77.5% of hospitalized cases). However, travelers' demographics and different handedness of road traffic between their home country and Thailand were not associated with outcome severity. Among potential risk factors, motorized 2-3 wheelers, alcohol/drug use, and night-time driving were each significantly associated with outcome severity (p-values of 0.034, <0.01, and <0.01, respectively).

Our study found lower fatalities among travelers who had a tetanus vaccination; history of a tetanus vaccination may represent preparedness and receiving care either from a previous injury or pre-travel preparation [42] . Although there was no repeated traffic injury among our subjects during the study period, travelers may have previously encountered a traffic accident or had other pervious injuries, and may have thus received an education on injury prevention along with the tetanus vaccination.

Therefore, the possibility of illicit drug use was not included in the regression analysis. In addition, we could not retrospectively collect some potentially related factors such as road and vehicle conditions, pre-travel preparation, duration of stay in Thailand, and the reason for tetanus vaccination. Travelers who died at the scene were also missed. Second, the collected data from this single center were strongly weighted toward travelers from Southeast Asia. The results, hence, may not be generalizable to every population of travelers, although travelers' demographics from our data were in general accordance with the national data, reflecting the current situation across Thailand. Third, the fatality rate may have been overestimated because our study retrieved the data from the hospital emergency center; some travelers with slight injuries may not have visited a hospital.

            "text": "Among the hospital database of 720 international travelers with RTIs, we report that one-fifth of traffic injuries resulted in severe health outcomes (including a 9% fatality rate). The level of outcome severity was associated with conventional risk factors, including alcohol drinking and night-time driving. Outcome severity did not significantly vary by travelers' demographics, although we suspect that accessibility to post-crash care may be a potential factor influencing the high fatality rate. Travelers' preparations and experiences, represented by tetanus vaccination history, may protect travelers from more severe health outcomes. Traffic injury is a universal problem, but the rate of RTI fatalities among travelers in Thailand is significantly higher than the rate in travelers' home countries and the rate among Thai people. As international travelers are essential for economic growth in Thailand, stakeholders should increase efforts and campaigns to promote road safety and improve post-crash care, focusing on this population with a high fatality rate. Further research agendas should prospectively compare the factors influencing severity of injuries both crash and post-crash. The comparison with local residents at the same geodemographic should be made. The interventional study on individual travelers and public health measures can further support policy maker to curb the incidence and severity of RTIs among international travelers in Thailand. ",
