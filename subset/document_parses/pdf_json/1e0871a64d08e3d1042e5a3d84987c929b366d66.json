Starting on April 24th, 2020, all employees at work (n = 15,300) at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden were invited and 92% consented to participate in a SARS-CoV-2 cohort study. Complete SARS-CoV-2 serology was available for n = 12,928 employees and seroprevalences were analyzed by age, sex, profession, patient contact, and hospital department. Relative risks were estimated to examine the association between type of hospital department as a proxy for different working environment exposure and risk for seropositivity, adjusting for age, sex, sampling week, and profession. Wards that were primarily responsible for COVID-19 patients were at increased risk (adjusted OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.65-2.32) with the notable exception of the infectious diseases and intensive care units (adjusted OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.66-1.13)), that were not at increased risk despite being highly exposed. Several units with similar types of work varied greatly in seroprevalences. Among the professions examined, nurse assistants had the highest risk (adjusted OR 1.62 (95% CI 1.38-1.90)). Although healthcare workers, in particular nurse assistants, who attend to COVID-19 patients are a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection, several units caring for COVID-19 patients had no excess risk. Large variations in seroprevalences among similar units suggest that healthcare work-related risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be preventable.",

The study was performed very early in the first wave of the epidemic when routine testing was not available outside of the study.

KUH has about 15,300 employees in a variety of professions (physicians, nurses, nurse assistants, laboratory and administrative personnel as well as a variety of allied health professions) and is comprehensive in the types of health care provided. Healthy (i.e. asymptomatic) HCWs were recruited between April 23rd and June 24th, 2020. At that time, SARS-CoV-2 testing was not routinely available outside of the study (neither by serology nor PCR). All visits to the hospital by non-patients have been banned since March 13th, 2020. In Sweden, there was no policy mandating face masks or other PPE in health care settings. Public messaging stated that spread from asymptomatic subjects was very limited and that face masks did not largely prevent further spread of COVID-19. Citizens with symptoms that might be COVID-related were advised to stay at home. Although national guidelines were lax, many health care units may have taken individual management decisions on the use of PPE. During April 2020 there was risk for a general shortage of PPE and usage was likely somewhat affected by this. Participants signed a written informed consent that included permission to link to the hospital administrative databases for information on professional role (physician, nurse/midwife, nurse assistant, or other), sick leave records and hospital unit assignment (s).",

Hospital units were then categorized as intensive care units (ICU), COVID wards (meaning non-ICU units that cared for COVID-19 patients at some point during the study period) and \"other\" (including research, administrative and management units, that did not have routine contact with COVID-19 patients). Baseline data showing the distribution of HCW roles and places of employment within the hospital were estimated overall and by seroprevalence. Chi square tests and Cochran Armitage tests of trend were used to examine the association between covariates and seroprevalence. A multivariate logistic regression was run examining the association between type of hospital ward and serology positivity, adjusting for age, sex, sampling week, and professional role. Patient contact was not included in the model since it was strongly associated with the professional role of the HCWs. For the analysis of risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with each hospital unit, HCWs with two or more affiliations listed were assigned to a ward-type using the following logic: HCWs were assumed to have contributed to COVID care, and then ICU or \"other\" units in that order given the need for additional support in the COVID wards. Hospital units with <50 participating HCWs were excluded from the unit-specific analysis, resulting in the removal of 44 units. The hospital units that cared for COVID-19 patients were noted and then serology positivity was reported as a prevalence with 95% confidence intervals. Using a case-cohort design, odds ratios were calculated comparing the odds of serology positivity in the unit to the odds of serology positivity in a reference group consisting of all 3671 employees registered as not having any patient contact in their work tasks.",

Significant differences in Covid-19 seropositivity were observed by age, sampling (calendar) week, professional role of HCWs, and type of hospital unit (Table 1) . A trend of decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection with age from 16.4% (95% CI 14.6-18.3) among HCWs under the age of 30 to 8.6% (95% CI 7.4-9.9) among HCWs over the age of 60 was found (p-value for trend, <0.0001) (Table 1) . Moreover, in the multivariate logistic regression model, a significant almost two-fold increased risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure was found for HCWs in hospital units caring for COVID-19 patients (adjusted OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.65-2.32)) as compared to units not caring for COVID-19 patients. Notably, ICU wards were not at an increased risk as compared to other wards despite intensive work with COVID patients (adjusted OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.66-1.13)). Differences in risk for seropositivity were also seen by profession and sampling week. Nurse assistants had the highest risk for seropositivity (adjusted OR 1.62 (95% CI 1.38-1.90)), followed by nurses and midwives (adjusted OR 1.28 (95% CI 1.11-1.49)) as compared to a reference group of other healthcare personnel.

HCWs in six out of ten COVID wards had more than two-fold increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure compared to HCWs without patient contact. The highest, almost three-fold increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure was observed for HCWs in units that had been repurposed to nurse COVID-19 patients but that would typically care for patients with non-infectious diseases (e.g. neurology, geriatrics, and cardiology).

The study exploited the fact that the linkable hospital administrative systems contained pre-collected and exact information on e.g. patient contact, place of work, profession, and the repurposing of hospital units for COVID-19 care. HCWs can, of course, be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 outside the hospital (community transmission). However, the fact that seropositivities clustered in wards re-purposed for COVID-19 care implies that transmission from patients to HCWs must have occurred at least once in such wards. Once introduced, it is of course possible that the HCWs working in the same unit can transmit infections to each other. The fact that some non-COVID-19 wards also had high seroprevalences could be compatible with outbreaks that had been introduced to the units by community transmission to a member of staff, with subsequent spread among the staff in the unit.",

At KUH, the intensive care and infectious disease units had, in general, a high degree of vigilance and used masks as well as long aprons in contact with patients as well as masks in staff meetings.

Importantly, however, we also show that examples that HCWs in hospital wards prepared for infectious diseases control and caring for high amount of COVID patients did not have increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The large variability among units also suggests that with appropriate preventative measures healthcare work-related risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly reduced. In severe outbreak situations, HCWs are likely to be more exposed. As the seroprevalences among HCWs in different units varied widely, it is possible that stringent workplace preventive measures may reduce this risk. ",
