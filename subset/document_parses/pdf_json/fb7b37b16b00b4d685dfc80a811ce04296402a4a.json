This report describes efforts made by one union local to protect workers, including negotiated paid sick leave and specific safety practices. Union representatives from 319 stores completed 1612 in-store surveys to assess compliance between 23 April 2020 and 31 August 2020. Employers provided the union with lists of workers confirmed to have COVID-19 infection through 31 December 2020. Worker infection rates were calculated using store employees represented by the union as the denominator and compared to cumulative county infection rates; outcome was dichotomized as rates higher or lower than background rates. Restrictions on reusable bags and management enforcement of customer mask usage were most strongly associated with COVID-19 rates lower than rates in the surrounding county. Stores that responded positively to worker complaints also had better outcomes. The union is currently engaging to promote improved ventilation and vaccination uptake.",

            "text": "Grocery and supermarket workers are indispensable for community survival. Their jobs require physical exertion and customer contact. They experience higher rates of nonfatal injuries compared to the U.S. average 1 and, as public-facing workers, have had increased or borderline increased rates of acute respiratory illness or influenzalike illnesses (ILI) documented in the past. 2 They are considered essential workers whose jobs place them at risk for exposure, yet they are low-wage workers who often lack the safety measures required to prevent the occupational transmission of SARS CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Early in the current pandemic, an investigation of COVID-19 rates in a Massachusetts grocery store found that of the 104 workers screened by PCR testing, 20 percent had positive viral assays; fewer than half of the infected workers were symptomatic. 3 Testing occurred in May, prior to a state-wide mask mandate (personal communication). A previous study conducted during the H1N1 pandemic surveyed a nationally representative sample of 2079 American adults and found increased levels of ILI among those who had no paid sick leave or who would be unable to afford to stay home for seven to ten days. 4 Although mask usage is not considered a form of respiratory protection, there has been growing evidence that it is useful both as a form of source control and to provide some level of personal protection. Twenty-four Kansas counties that opted into a mask mandate as of 3 July 2020 were compared to eighty-one counties that opted out; pre-mandate COVID-19 incidence rates were increasing at a similar rate across all counties. Postmandate seven-day rolling average rates decreased 6 percent in counties with mask ordinances (mean decrease \u00bc 0.08 cases per 100,000 per day; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] \u00bc -0.14 to -0.03), but rose by 100 percent in counties that did not enact any mask requirements (mean increase \u00bc 0.11 cases per 100,000 per day; 95 percent CI \u00bc 0.01-0.21). 5 This report was developed in response to a request from the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union, Local 400, to review store safety surveys collected by union representatives, and to evaluate COVID-19 illness information among workers represented by the union as reported by stores under contract.",

Early in the pandemic, the union developed a series of safety measures that were negotiated with store chain management, and further negotiated fourteen days of paid leave for workers with known or suspected COVID-19 exposure or infection. The union worked with shop stewards and employees serving on store-level safety and health committees to conduct store surveys and checklists to determine store compliance with negotiated safety measures and, beginning on 23 April 2020, the local union contacted representatives or other members to collect survey results. A union contract affords employees the opportunity to raise concerns with management without fear of retaliation. The safety survey asked if employees had raised safety concerns with management and, if so, how management addressed them. Union leadership compiled the information into an Excel spreadsheet reporting store identification and zip code.",

The size of the difference is better described by an effect size, such as Cohen's d, which is the amount of standard deviation difference in the means. The ASA also recommends providing a measure of the probability that the results were due to chance. One such measure is the false positive risk (FPR) 7,8 that is reported as well. A combination of a relatively small p value, relatively large effect size, and relatively small FPR, suggests the items that best differentiated stores that were above county COVID-19 rates from other stores.",

Rather than comparing worker infection rates from stores in different counties, the comparison of in-store worker infection rates to county rates served as a measure of the county's background contribution to the store's infection rate. To examine whether safety practices reported by stores in the safety surveys affected COVID-19 rates, we compared the percentage of time that stores engaged in each safety practice between stores in which worker infection rates exceeded the background county rate and those in which the worker infection rate fell below the county rate. Between April and August 30, 2020, stores submitted surveys periodically. For each store, answers for all surveys submitted were averaged to produce an overall proportion of the time each safety practice was reported. Because of the variability in store survey completion, we used the dichotomous outcome of infection rates above or not above county background rates as the marker for negative or positive outcomes rather than store safety scores.

Workers who reported safety concerns to management were somewhat more likely to be from stores with COVID-19 rates above the background county rate than workers in stores in which no reports were made. The effect size was very small, however, (d between \u00c0.08 and \u00c0.04) and FPR high (between 62% and 65%). Stores in which worker concerns were met with positive responses from management were more likely to have worker COVID-19 infection rates below county rates compared to those stores in which management response was negative. Workers reporting concerns in stores with higher than background COVID-19 rates were more likely to get negative responses from management. The effect size for negative responses in September and October were .25 and .34, respectively, meaningful effects for social interventions (although statistically considered small). FPR in September was 46 percent and in October 27 percent. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between cumulative rates of COVID-19 infections among grocery workers and the background county rates in the largest city in the region and some of its surrounding counties, including three jurisdictions (the District of Columbia and parts of Maryland and Virginia). Local and state mask mandates are noted in each. This region experienced the earliest rise in COVID-19 cases among areas covered in this study, had the largest populations, and included the most stores and multiple store chains. Although the relationship to background county rates varied, in most instances the initial worker rates are higher, and precede the rise in background county rates. Local mask mandates appear to reduce the rate of increase of both worker and background rates in a number of instances. ",

First, it negotiated paid sick leave that provided workers with the ability to stay home following infection or close exposure without facing lost wages, encouraging symptom reporting and testing. Although some safety measures were universally applied and therefore difficult to assess for relative effectiveness, the safety surveys documented a wide range of compliance with some practices, among them management enforcement of customer mask usage. Our findings of improved outcomes among workers in stores in which customer mask use was enforced by management as well as the appearance of changes in the rate of both store and county rates following early mask mandates support previous findings. 5 Restrictions on use of reusable bags were consistently associated with better outcomes. It is unclear whether restricting reusable bags is a marker for other behaviors, such as limiting social contact, or useful in itself. Social distancing and regular cleaning appeared to be useful as well, although the effect of management-required mask usage by customers was most strongly associated with better outcomes. On the other hand, our findings suggest that one-way aisles may not be helpful. Stores in which workers raised complaints performed well when management was perceived to have responded to those complaints. Note that none of the work sites in our report participated in comprehensive screening. Workers obtained testing for the same reasons those in the general population did, making it unlikely that testing bias accounted for the differences with the background county rates.",

It is possible that the impact of management's response to raised safety concerns is also reflected in the safety scores. Enforcing the customer mask mandate and banning the use of reusable bags require the active intervention of management, either by directly engaging with customers or by directing store security to do so. We believe programs training front-line managers to exert safety leadership, such as the Foundations for Safety Leadership developed for the construction industry (CPWR), 10 should be explored for use in grocery and other industries.",

Concerns about vaccine hesitancy and disparate rates of vaccine administration among racial and ethnic minorities have been widely discussed. By engaging in-store workers as leaders and providing consistent, supportive information about the importance and safety of vaccines, the union has prepared its members for participation, although scarcity of vaccine supply has limited the outcome measure to anecdotal instances of high vaccine uptake in several stores.",
