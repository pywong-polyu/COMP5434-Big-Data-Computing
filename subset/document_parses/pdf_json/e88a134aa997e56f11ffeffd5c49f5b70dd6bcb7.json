CA 125 is a useful biomarker to detect treatment response and recurrence of ovarian malignancy (Montagnana et al., 2017) , however, its use as a diagnostic marker is precluded by its limited specificity. CA 125 can be elevated in several non-ovarian malignancies including cervical, lung, and colorectal cancers (Johnson et al., 2008) , and have also been found to be elevated in benign diseases involving coelomic epithelium, such as endometriosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts, and pelvic inflammatory disease (Sevinc et al., 2007) .",

She was deemed unresectable and completed four cycles of neoadjuvant taxol and carboplatin chemotherapy prior to an interval debulking surgery in November 2017 and completed chemotherapy in February 2018. She was enrolled in a maintenance Niraparib vs placebo clinical trial (S16-00663) but was taken off the trial after she was found to have progression of disease.

This report of a women with advanced ovarian cancer and COVID-19 infection with a transient rise and fall of CA 125 biomarkers without radiographic evidence of disease progression demonstrates the importance of considering COVID-19 infection as an etiology after ruling the patient out for active or progression of cancer. Although the patient was not known to have COVID-19 infection at the time of CA 125 increase, the marked fatigue and weakness reported by the patient at this time coupled with the subsequent positive COVID-19 antibody test and resolution of CA 125 spike without change in treatment plan make COVID-19 infection the most likely cause of the increase in CA 125.",

(2020) , who demonstrated significantly higher CA 125 levels in hospitalized nononcology patients with severe COVID-19 infection compared to those with non-severe infection, and suggests that this pattern may be true in cancer patients as well. Moreover, the increase of COVID-19 reported by Wei et al. seen in severe COVID-19 infections compared to non-severe infections was modest (5.4 \u00b1 4.1 vs 3.2 \u00b1 1.4 U/mL respectively; p < .001), while our patient had a peak CA 125 of 4499 U/mL, an increase of 2617 U/mL from the presumed pre-COVID-19 level and only had mild infection not requiring hospitalization. This case illustrates that in the presence of underlying malignancy and elevated CA 125, COVID-19 infection may produce a dramatic increase in CA 125 that resembles cancer progression.",

            "text": "CA 125 is a large mucinous glycoprotein expressed on apical surfaces of tissue derived from coelomic epithelium including the female reproductive tract, respiratory tract, and ocular surfaces (Bischof, 1993) . The mechanism by which CA 125 is increased in inflammatory states is not well described, but secretion of CA 125 has been shown to increase in response to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and lipopolysaccharide (Zeillemaker et al., 1994) . Elevated CA 125 has been documented in infections including pulmonary tuberculosis (Sahin and Serum, 2012) and pelvic inflammatory disease (Moley et al., 1996) , and in addition to certain malignancies can be elevated in non-infectious states such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, and fibroids (Sevinc et al., 2007; Barouchos et al., 2015) . Increased CA 125 seen in COVID-19 infection may be secondary to inflammatory damage to lungs as increased CA 125 has also been documented in other pulmonary processes, however interestingly our patient reported no pulmonary symptoms. While COVID-19 has been primarily thought of as a pulmonary disease, there has been increasing evidence that it can also infect other tissues throughout the body. Literature suggests that the SARS-Cov2 receptor ACE2 is expressed in ovaries of reproductive age and postmenopausal women as well as other gynecologic tissue, raising the possibility that COVID-19 can infect these organs as well (Jing et al., 2020) . Given the elevation of CA 125 in other infectious etiologies, future studies would be informative to evaluate the role of CA 125 in COVID-19 infection, particularly among patients with a history of gynecologic cancer. Our case underscores the importance of ruling out COVID-19 infection in patients with increase in CA 125 from their baseline as well as consulting imaging modalities for evidence of disease progression. Further investigation into the effects of COVID-19 infection on CA 125 levels in patients with ovarian malignancy and other gynecologic cancers is warranted.",
