            "text": "Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the major pathogenic fungal species, causing life-threatening infections. Due to a limited spectrum of available antifungals, exploration of new drug targets as well as potential antifungal molecules has become pertinent. Rodlet layer plays an important role in adherence of fungal conidia to hydrophobic cell surfaces in host, which also leads to A. fumigatus biofilm formation, contributing factor to fungal pathogenicity. From decades, natural sources have been known for the development of new active molecules. The present study investigates effect of isoeugenol on genes responsible for hydrophobins (RodA), adhesion as well as biofilm formation (MedA and SomA) of A. fumigatus. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC and IC 50 ) of isoeugenol against A. fumigatus were determined using broth microdilution assay. The IC 50 results showed reduced hydrophobicity and biofilm formation as well as eradication after treatment with the compound and electron micrograph data corroborated these findings. The qRT-PCR showed a significant downregulation of genes RodA, MedA, SomA and pksP involved in hydrophobicity and biofilm formation. SwissADME studies potentiated drug-like propensity for isoeugenol which formed four hydrogen bonds with low binding energy (\u2212 4.54 kcal/mol) at the catalytic site of RodA protein studied via AutoDock4. Hence, the findings conclude that isoeugenol inhibits conidial hydrophobicity and biofilm formation of A. fumigatus and further investigations are warranted in this direction.",

Recently, COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis was reported as a lethal complication affecting critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Borman et al. 2020) . This life-threatening fungal disease is caused by ubiquitous filamentous mold, Aspergillus fumigatus that produces large number of small size airborne spores capable of surviving under harsh biotic as well as abiotic stress conditions (Kasprzyk 2008) . The mainstay antifungal drugs against A. fumigatus infections mainly target fungal cell membrane components and enzymes involved in its biosynthesis. Despite availability of the antifungal drugs, there are many limitations, including poor oral bioavailability, narrow therapeutic indices and emerging drug resistance resulting from their excessive use (Hagiwara et al. 2016; Mota Fernandes et al. 2021) . Thus, the discovery of a novel antifungal with broad-spectrum activity, low toxicity, minimal side effects and enhanced bioavailability is highly warranted (Brauer et al. 2019) .",

DHN-melanin, pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)], secondary metabolite gliotoxin, thermotolerance, biofilm formation, oxidative stress components (Abad et al. 2010; Croft et al. 2016; Voltersen et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2021 ). Adherence to a host cell represents the most crucial step of fungal pathogenesis (Lin et al. 2015) . A. fumigatus spores adhere to the lung epithelial cells of the host upon direct inhalation, with subsequent germination and hyphal outgrowth representing the first stage of infection (Escobar et al. 2016) . Its conidia possess a surface protein coat known as rodlet layer, which masks their recognition by the host immune response (Aimanianda et al. 2009 ). The rodlet layer is a thin coating of regularly arranged hydrophobin proteins covalently bound to conidial cell wall through glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-remnants. The rodlet layer is composed of multiple hydrophobin (rod) proteins encoded by their respective genes (RodA-G) (Cerqueira et al. 2014 ). Among all the Rod proteins, RodA is the only essential hydrophobin responsible for outer layer permeability, stability, hydrophobicity and immune inertia of the conidial cell wall surface (Valsecchi et al. 2019) . Deletion of RodA gene modifies the properties of the conidial cell wall surface (Valsecchi et al. 2017) . The decrease in surface RodA rodlets results in increased phagocytosis of A. fumigatus spores (Dagenais et al. 2010 ). It has been reported that adherence of conidia to the host epithelial lining is reduced due to loss of conidial hydrophobin RodA (Croft et al. 2016) . RodB was also found to be present in conidia but disruption of rodB gene did not affect the rodlet formation (Paris et al. 2003) . The significance of other hydrophobins (RodC-G) in A. fumigatus is still unknown (Valsecchi et al. 2017 ). According to Gravelat et al (2010) , the preliminary expression analysis of putative A. fumigatus adhesins also indicated down-regulation of the expression of a GPI-anchored protein Afu3g00880.",

            "text": "Regulatory proteins governing conidiation, adherence, cell wall homeostasis and biofilm formation in A. fumigatus includes Medusa (MedA) and transcription factor SomA. MedA has been reported to control conidiation and biofilm formation along with expression of downstream adhesin genes in A. fumigatus (Abdallah et al. 2012) . It is required for adhesion to several host surfaces like pulmonary epithelial cell, endothelial cells and fibronectin. The \u0394MedA mutant studies in Galleria mellonella as well as mammalian models revealed that the mutants were pigment less with reduced virulence (Gravelat et al. 2010) . Also, conidiation was reported to be affected in MedA deletion strain of A. fumigatus. According to Gravelat et al (2010) , in \u0394MedA strain delayed conidial pigmentation was observed along with reduced gene expression of six gene cluster involved in dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin biosynthesis as compared to wild-type. In DHN-melanin biosynthesis, pksP gene deletion leads to loss of melanin which results in modification in the A. fumigatus cell wall (Bayry et al. 2014) . The pksP mutant produces hydrophilic conidia due to deposition of glycoproteins on their conidial cell wall. Under normal conditions, transcriptional regulator SomA functions along with its co-regulator PtaB, and plays a critical role in conidial adhesion and biofilm formation. The galactosaminogalactan (GAG) is an important component of fungal cell wall that are important in fungal adhesion and also one of the components in extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. It has been reported that the galactose and galactosamine levels reduce in \u0394SomA mutants (Lin et al. 2015) . SomA binds to the promoter site of GAG biosynthetic genes adg3 and ega3 (Chen et al. 2020 ) and affects its downstream gene expression. It also regulates the expression of genes MedA, StuA, uge3 of A. fumigatus conidiation and adhesion. According to Lin et al (2015) , SomA also affects the expression of RodA. The cell wall homeostasis in A. fumigatus is somewhat interlinked with the hydrophobins (RodA), and adhesion gene regulators (MedA and SomA).",

The surface of A. fumigatus conidia is masked by a layer of hydrophobin proteins (Linder et al. 2005; Aimanianda et al. 2009 ) which forms rodlets on the surface of A. fumigatus conidia (Paris et al. 2003; Valsecchi et al. 2019) . The rodlet layer is amphipathic and it renders the conidial surface resistant to wettability as well as facilitates easy spore dispersion. It consists of rodlet proteins RodA and RodB wherein only RodA contributes majorly towards conidial hydrophobicity, immune inertness against macrophages (Paris et al. 2003) and also restricts the entry of hydrophilic molecules like oxidant components of phagocytes (Rementeria et al. 2005) . Along with hydrophobins, fungal adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces signifies initial stage towards establishment of fungal biofilms (Oshiro et al. 2019 ). According to the literature, biofilm is an important structure for fungal virulence and provide protection from host response as well as antifungal drugs. Hydrophobins do not play any significant role in biofilm formation and its adherence (Valsecchi et al. 2017 ). There are reported regulatory genes underlying biofilm formation that are SomA and MedA in A. fumigatus-mediated invasive diseases that has now been studied in detail (Gravelat et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2020) .",

The presence of free hydroxyl (-OH) from the aromatic chain of isoeugenol is one of the structural parameters involved in the antimicrobial activity of this phytoconstituent, however, molecular properties such as hydrophobicity, refractivity and molecular geometry also seem to be related to the inhibitory capacity of isoeugenol on Candida spp. (Dambolena et al. 2012; Siddiqui et al. 2013 ). It has been reported that it is an effective molecule in controlling the establishment and progression of candidiasis by inhibiting the formation of virulence structures (chlamydoconidia, blastoconidia and pseudo-hyphae) in Candida albicans (Mayer et al. 2013; Medeiros et al. 2020) . Thus, the present study explored the effects of phenolic compound isoeugenol on conidial hydrophobicity and biofilm formation of A. fumigatus.",

            "text": "In presence of isoeugenol, conidial cell surface hydrophobicity of A. fumigatus was analysed which showed a significant decrease with increased wettability of the conidia. Similar results on hydrophobicity have also been reported in A fumigatus mutant by Pihet et al (2009) and Girardin et al (1999) . Isoeugenol treated A. fumigatus produced pigment-less conidia whereas wild-type control was of greyish green colour. In addition, the UV-Vis spectrum showed that the DHN-melanin was reduced in treated conidia due to its inability to produce conidial pigment. Various other studies have also suggested that the absence of rodlet layer and melanin pigment corresponds to altered hydrophobicity of the A. fumigatus conidia (Aimanianda et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2011; Hoda et al. 2020) . The white pigment-less, smooth walled conidia of A. fumigatus have been reported in \u0394pksP (DHN-melanin biosynthesis pathway mutant) (Bernard and Latg\u00e9 2001) as well as rodlet mutant (Paris et al. 2003 ). Subsequently, scanning electron micrographs suggested an alteration in the spore cell wall with loss of protrusion in isoeugenol treated conidia whereas wild type conidia showed a distinct ornamentation on their surface. At low magnification, closely packed conidia as seen in control (untreated) sample, were not observed in isoeugenol treated A. fumigatus. The conidial samples were later subjected to TEM observations where treated conidia revealed marked modifications in the outer membrane with loss of protrusions and lack of melanin content in comparison to wild type control. On other hand Fig. 4 depicted that presence of isoeugenol inhibited the ECM formation, which in turn decreases the compact hyphal structure of A. fumigatus biofilm. For biofilm formation, ECM is an important characteristic which consists of galactomannans, galactosaminogalactan, glucans, proteins etc. (Rajendran et al. 2013) . Herein, chemical composition of A. fumigatus was observed by the co-localisation of fluorochrome attached to chitin and glucans under CLSM using calcofluor white dye. These micrographs suggested that isoeugenol plays a major role in inhibition of outer cell wall components via interfering their biosynthesis and its The oral bioavailability radar of isoeugenol using SwissADME predictor. The six physiochemical properties taken into account to consider a molecule as drug-like are FLEX, LIPO, INSATU, SIZE, POLAR and INSOLU. The pink area of radar plot showed that compound satisfies all the above-mentioned properties except saturation biofilm formation. In addition, the altered conidial surface could enhance drug sensitivity of A. fumigatus. Aimanianda et al (2009) reported that altered conidial surface also induces inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen intermediates to activate host immune response.",

Compared to wild type, the expression levels of studied genes (RodA, MedA SomA and pksP) were significantly downregulated at IC 50 treated A. fumigatus (Fig. 6) . The gene expression of RodA gene responsible for rodlet formation and transcriptional regulator MedA and SomA governs adherence, conidiation, host interaction and biofilm formation in A. fumigatus (Gravelat et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2015; Valsecchi et al. 2019) . Moreover, in mutant \u0394RodA conidia, underneath layer gets exposed which is composed of glycoproteins, chitin and \u03b2-(1,3)-glucan (Valsecchi et al. 2020 ). These components are pathogen associated molecule patterns and their exposure on the conidial surface actively induces the host immune response. Deletion of rodA gene impacts drug sensitivity of the fungi (Valsecchi et al. 2019) . Another study on \u0394MedA mutant which analysed the role of gene MedA in the adherence of A. fumigatus to epithelial cells A549 as well as in biofilm formation (Gravelat et al. 2010) reported that \u0394MedA mutant strain was unable to induce any epithelial cell damage with decreased adherence, and stimulation of cytokine production in comparison to the wild type. It is still unclear whether MedA directly interacts with substrates to mediate adherence or not. Probably, MedA serves as a regulatory protein controlling the expression of downstream adhesion genes (Gravelat et al. 2010) . The \u0394MedA and \u0394pksP mutant conidia are also reported to undergo de-pigmented morphology and has been linked to A. fumigatus virulence (Gravelat et al. 2010; Hoda et al. 2020) . SomA gene expression was highly downregulated in our study, these results corroborated by scanning electron micrographs depicted loss of ECM and biofilm formation in presence of isoeugenol. There are certain strong evidence suggesting downregulation of SomA gene and its effects on A. fumigatus biofilm formation and enhances sensitivity to cell wall stressors (Lin et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2020 ). SomA governs GAG biosynthetic genes as well as cell wall related genes under normal and cell wall stress conditions.",

SwissADME web tool was used to predict the physiochemical properties and drug likeness of molecule to further analyse the molecule on other parameters. It takes into account six important physicochemical properties including flexibility, lipophilicity, saturation, size, polarity and solubility (Pires et al. 2015) . In the present study, drug likeness properties of isoeugenol were in favour as it follows Lipinski's, Veber, Egan rule. The pink area of radar plot showed that isoeugenol satisfies all the mentioned properties except saturation which should be less than 0.25 (http:// www. swiss adme. ch/ index. php). Lipinski's rule of five states molecular weight less than 500, hydrogen bond acceptor less than 10, hydrogen bond donor less than 5 and logP value should be less than 5. On other hand, Veber rule states rotatable bonds should be less than 10 and polar surface area should not be more than 140 \u00c5 are orally active (Cheng et al. 2012 ). Isoeugenol's computational ADME studies suggested that it can be considered as a drug-like molecule and similar results were reported by Ferreira et al (2018) .",

            "text": "In present study, molecular docking was conducted at A. fumigatus RodA protein catalytic site that consists of Cys 64 as one of the amino acids. The docking score obtained between ligand isoeugenol and cysteine residue active site of RodA protein was \u2212 4.54 kcal/mol with four hydrogen bonds formation. The secondary structure of RodA protein consists of a central \u03b2-barrel composed of two curved antiparallel \u03b2-sheets, two relatively long \u03b1-helices and two short 3 10 helices (Valsecchi et al. 2019) . The structure of RodA protein comprises four-disulfide bridges formed between eight cysteine residues and two amyloidogenic regions. According to Valsecchi et al. (2020) , any point mutations on this conserved region may lead to alteration in the cell wall organisation rendering conidial surface hydrophilic. And, out of eight cysteine residues isoeugenol interacted with four cysteine residues: two formed hydrogen bonds and two formed Van der Waals interaction. The counting of these intermolecular interactions formed between receptor and ligand is calculated in terms of scoring function (Oda et al. 2006) . Consequently, it is very important to understand molecular mechanisms that are involved in reduction of conidial hydrophobicity, biofilm formation in presence of isoeugenol as this work will provide new approaches to combat the infection caused by A. fumigatus.",

It downregulated the expression of RodA gene responsible for rodlet formation and transcriptional regulators MedA and SomA that regulates downstream genes responsible for adherence, virulence and biofilm formation in A. fumigatus. The compound also inhibited pksp gene expression which is first gene responsible for DHN-melanin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus.",

Similar results were observed under CLSM, where the ECM components were analysed by co-localisation of the fluorochrome calcofluor white dye. In isoeugenol treated A. fumigatus biofilm, disintegrated hyphae without ECM component were visualised when stained with calcofluor white(Fig. 5). The treated and control (untreated) biofilm were illustrated inFig. 5, with (a) calcofluor white dye (excitation: 405 nm and emission: 420-470 nm); (b) a bright field (without fluorochrome); and (c) overlapping image.",
