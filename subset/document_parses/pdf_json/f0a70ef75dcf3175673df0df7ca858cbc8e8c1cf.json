This study was undertaken to assess the transference of newly gained knowledge and skills to other laboratory staff, and to identify enabling and obstructive factors to their implementation.",

Diagnostics courses included Viral Load, and systems strengthening included strategic planning and Biosafety and Biosecurity. SAS v9.44 and Excel were used to analyze retrospective de-identified data collected at six months pre and post-training.",

The consequences of these are extended turnaround times, laboratory testing errors, lack of support for functional continual quality improvement (CQI) and accreditation efforts [6, 7] .

The participants were expected to integrate, and transfer knowledge gained to their home laboratory and administrative staffs and to collaborate with their Ministry of Health (MoH) to build country ownership.",

To assess the effectiveness of the training courses, we designed and implemented a set of structured questionnaires to answer the question: \"Are PEPFAR and other partners' investments in ACILT having a positive impact in building country ownership to provide quality and timely laboratory services to patients in countries with high burdens of infectious disease?\"",

Importantly, the trainings reached far more individuals than those attending the courses. Unprecedented progress was made in strengthening national laboratory systems through planning and enhanced organizational efforts. It is only in recent years that laboratories in resourcelimited settings have received significant support in training and instrumentation to offer these tests to their populations suffering from HIV/AIDS. Thus, providing the training to in-country laboratory staff was, and continues to be, essential to ensure the accuracy of these tests for appropriate patient care. Although organizations invest billions of dollars in training every year, yet many competencies reportedly fail to transfer to the workplace [23] .

The high attendance of this course suggests that knowledge in this area was limited. Several international partners including World Health Organization have identified gaps in Biosafety and Biosecurity programs in sSA, indicating the need for a safe work environment for patients and laboratory staff [34, 35] . These partner efforts were not captured in this evaluation. However their shared responsibility led to concurrent additional support, direct funding, expertise, and training towards these efforts [36] . The course improved participants' knowledge and awareness in safety programs and facilitated a mitigation movement by leadership of a number of common safety concerns in laboratory and healthcare facilities across sSA. Our results indicate that programs to assess use of PPE, large safety equipment e.g., Biological Safety Cabinets, Autoclaves, Centrifuges for calibration and maintenance were ranked among the areas of least improvement. Participants reported that this area had a comparatively better performance indicators prior to ACILT's training, hence it recorded a low improvement (Fig. 4a) . Our results also indicate challenges in the areas of building and facility safety and transport of infectious substance. A growing concern that is receiving more global attention recently is the need for safe disposal of waste generated from VL/EID tests. With growing number of tests globally for COVID-19, there will also be need for trained personnel to dispose waste from COVID-19 testing responsibly. Leveraging existing human and financial resources in bio-risk management can potentially overcome some of these challenges [36] . In the most affected areas for COVID-19 access to PPE for health care workers was a pressing concern. Some medical staff were waiting for equipment while already seeing patients who may be infected or are supplied with equipment that might not meet requirements (33) .",

The low numbers of COVID-19 cases in Africa are a testimony to the robust laboratory capacity that ACILT built with stronger quality management systems for infectious disease diagnosis, equipment management systems, supply chain management systems, Biosafety and Biosecurity programs, accreditation readiness, improving turn-around time, laboratory strategic planning -all contributing factors to it's preparedness and transferable capacity to upscale COVID-19 diagnosis and testing. ACILT enhanced capacities in sSA to strengthen national laboratory systems and networks, boosted competency of workforce to perform complex Molecular Diagnostic (Roche and other equipment) and serological assays that have gained emergency use approval to diagnose COVID-19 [41] . Specifically, among the strategies to upscale COVID-19 testing in African countries, a key strategy for PEPFAR and CDC Africa is to ensure leveraging existing platforms that have been the backbone for large-scale testing for HIV and tuberculosis [42, 43] . The availability of high-throughput machines, technical resources, infrastructure and the near point-of-care platforms provided through the GeneXpert machines -all capacities developed by the national HIV/ AIDS and TB control programs with the support of their major partners -The United States Government and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has been recognized as a critical resource which can be leveraged to support the COVID-19 response [42, 43] .",

In light of these studies the response rate in this study is modest. Second, the data were retrospectively collected and self-reported, which could be subject to social desirability, personal and recall biases. Third, this is a cross-sectional impact evaluation study, which limits our capabilities to analyze the long-term outcomes of the training courses on public health system improvement and patient care service enhancements. The SLMTA training outcome and impact analysis offered at ACILT did report the longlasting laboratory program improvements after the training [18] . Even with a modest response rate it is evident that participants were able to transfer knowledge and skills to significant number of other experts. In addition, we would like to acknowledge the contributions of other national and international organizations who are working towards the same goal.",
