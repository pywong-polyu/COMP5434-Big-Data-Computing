            "text": "Viruses can hijack autophagosomes as the nonlytic release vehicles in cultured host cells. However, how autophagosome-mediated viral spread occurs in infected host tissues or organs in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we report that an important rice reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) hijacks autophagosomes to traverse multiple insect membrane barriers in the midgut and salivary gland of leafhopper vector to enhance viral spread. Such virus-containing double-membraned autophagosomes are prevented from degradation, resulting in increased viral propagation. Mechanistically, viral nonstructural protein Pns11 induces autophagy and embeds itself in the autophagosome membranes. The autophagyrelated protein 5 (ATG5)-ATG12 conjugation is essential for initial autophagosome membrane biogenesis. RGDV Pns11 specifically interacts with ATG5, both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of ATG5 or Pns11 expression suppresses ATG8 lipidation, autophagosome formation, and efficient viral propagation. Thus, Pns11 could directly recruit ATG5-ATG12 conjugation to induce the formation of autophagosomes, facilitating viral spread within the insect bodies. Furthermore, Pns11 potentially blocks autophagosome degradation by directly targeting and mediating the reduced expression of N-glycosylated Lamp1 on lysosomal membranes. Taken together, these results highlight how RGDV remodels autophagosomes to benefit viral propagation in its insect vector.",

            "text": "Autophagy is a multistep, conserved process by which cytoplasmic components, such as damaged organelles and foreign pathogens, become enveloped into double-membraned autophagosomes and are shuttled to lysosomes for degradation in eukaryotic cells [1] . This process begins with the formation of membrane crescents, called phagophores, which then extend to form enclosed double-membraned autophagosomes [1] . Autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) and two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems mediate phagophore elongation and the subsequent generation of double-membraned autophagosomes. The first conjugation system entails ATG8-I, which is constitutively processed by ATG4 to expose conserved glycine residues to produce the phospholipid ATG8-II, and is conjugated to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at the autophagosome membranes [2, 3] . ATG8-PE is involved in the elongation and closure of the autophagosome membranes [1] . The second conjugation system contributes to the coupling of ATG12 with ATG5 for forming a covalently linked heterodimer on the phagophore membranes [3, 4] . This conjugate is mobilized to the phagophore to produce E3-like activity toward the ATG8-PE complex [1] . Finally, the autophagosomes are fused with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where the cytoplasmic materials or invading pathogens are degraded [1] . Lysosome-associated membrane protein (Lamp) consists of a polypeptide core of~40 kDa and is decorated by a significant number (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) of N-glycans [5] . Lamp protects lysosomal membranes from lysosomal hydrolases that normally digest membrane components [6] . It is generally believed that host cells use the autophagy as a defense against invading viruses [7, 8] . For example, autophagy has been proved to play a direct antiviral role against the arbovirus vesicular stomatitis virus in the model organism Drosophila [9] .",

Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) \u03b3b protein subverts autophagy to promote viral infection by disrupting the interaction of ATG7 with ATG8 [12] .

            "text": "Many viral pathogens of significant consequences to global health or agricultural problems are transmitted by insect vectors. Several arthropod-borne plant viruses are highly evolved and adapted for persistent infection and maintenance in their insect vectors. Such viruses circulate throughout the insect bodies and induce a variety of cellular responses such as autophagy or apoptosis that modulate the efficiency of viral transmission [15] . To date, only three reports on autophagy in plant viruses-infected insect cells have been published. In 2016, Wang et al. reported that the begomovirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) could activate autophagy in whitefly vectors to resist excessive viral replication [16] . Similarly, a recently published study demonstrated that the fijivirus rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) infection could activate autophagy in planthopper vector, leading to inhibition of viral transmission [17] . In 2017, we reported that the phytoreovirus rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) induced the formation of autophagosomes for carrying RGDV virions to facilitate viral infection in insect vector cells [18] . Thus, RGDV has evolved elaborate mechanisms to evade antiviral autophagy, or even to activate certain forms of selective autophagy for successful infection and replication within its insect vector.",

            "text": "RGDV, an important rice reovirus, causes epidemic outbreaks and extensive rice yield losses in Asian rice-growing countries, and is mainly transmitted by green rice leafhopper, Recilia dorsalis, in a persistent-propagative manner [19, 20] . The 12 segments of RGDV genome encode 6 structural proteins (P1, P2, P3, P5, P6 and P8) and 6 nonstructural proteins (Pns4, Pns7, Pns9, Pns10, Pns11 and Pns12). Among these proteins, P8 is the major outer capsid protein, Pns7, Pns9 and Pns12 are the components of the viroplasm, Pns11 is a viral RNAsilencing suppressor, and the functions of Pns4 and Pns10 are unknown [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Once ingested by insect vector, RGDV establishes primary infection in the intestinal epithelial cells [27] . However, even in a single initially infected epithelial cell, the invading viruses initiate the formation of nascent viroplasms, which serve as the sites for viral multiplication to assemble progeny virions [27] . The progeny virions then pass directly through the basal lamina of the intestinal epithelium toward the visceral muscles, or cross the intercellular junctional complexes for cell-to-cell spread [27] . Viruses then disseminate from the visceral muscles into the hemolymphs and eventually into the salivary glands to be horizontally transmitted to healthy plants [27] . More importantly, RGDV can hitchhike with insect sperm for paternal transmission [20] . It was previously reported that the persistent replication of RGDV in cultured R. dorsalis cells can trigger the autophagy process, as demonstrated by the appearance of obvious virus-containing double-membraned autophagosomes and the conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II [18] . Applying the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing the expression of ATG5 significantly decreases viral infection, whereas applying the autophagy inducer rapamycin facilitates viral infection [18] . Such autophagosomes are able to mediate a nonlytic viral release from insect cells [18] . Here, we further demonstrate that RGDV could effectively hijack autophagosomes to overcome the membrane barriers in vector midgut or salivary gland. Furthermore, the nonstructural protein Pns11 of RGDV could directly recruit ATG5-ATG12 conjugation to induce the formation of autophagosomes for the transport of viral particles. These findings highlight how RGDV can block autophagosome degradation to benefit viral propagation in its insect vector.",

The intestines were immunostained with P8-FITC (green) and ATG8-rhodamine (red). Panel M was an enlargement of the boxed area in panel L to show the colocalization of P8 and ATG8 (arrows). (N) The average number of ATG8-puncta per cell in stable in viruliferous insects (Figs 1E-1I, and S2). Western blot assay showed that the intensity level of ATG8-II was increased in viruliferous insects relative to nonviruliferous controls (Figs 1J and S3A), suggesting that RGDV infection facilitates the conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II. Furthermore, the accumulation level of ATG5 was significantly increased, p62 remained stable, while N-glycosylated Lamp1 was significantly decreased in viruliferous insects ( Fig 1J) . Thus, the autophagosome-related p62 and ATG5 were not degraded after viral infection in R. dorsalis. Another hallmark of autophagy is the redistribution of ATG8 from a diffuse localization to a characteristic punctate pattern, reflecting the recruitment of ATG8 to autophagic vesicles [4] . Indeed, in virus-infected midgut epithelial cells, ATG8 redistributed into discrete puncta, which were co-localized with viral antigens (Fig 1K-1M ). There was a significant increase (P< 0.01) in the average number of ATG8 puncta per cell in virus-infected midgut epithelial cells compared to uninfected cells ( Fig 1N) . Taken together, our results demonstrated that RGDV infection induced the incomplete autophagy within insect vectors.",

We then used electron microscopy to investigate how virus-induced autophagosomes overcome insect transmission barriers. We observed that virus-containing autophagosomes could attach directly to the serosal side of the midgut epithelium barrier, and then release into the hemocoel (Fig 2C) . Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that the Pns11 antibody specifically labeled these autophagosomes ( Fig 2C) . We also observed that virus-containing autophagosomes could target and cross the intercellular junctional complexes between the adjacent midgut epithelial cells ( Fig 2D) . Furthermore, such autophagosomes also could target and traverse the apical plasmalemma into saliva-stored cavities in the salivary gland (Figs 2E and S1C). Taken together, RGDV can exploit autophagosomes as the vehicles to overcome the multiple membrane barriers, finally facilitating viral transmission by R. dorsalis (Fig 2F and 2G ).",

There was a significant decrease (P< 0.01) in the average number of lysosomes per cell in virus-infected midgut epithelial cells compared to uninfected cells ( Fig 6E) .

Two plant viruses, TYLCV and RBSDV, activate autophagy as an antiviral mechanism in the insect vectors; however, the virions were not directly enclosed within the autophagosomes [16, 17] . RGDV virions are directly enclosed within virus-induced autophagosomes, and thus these autophagosomes can fuse with the plasma membranes for a nonlytic viral release from insect vector cells [18] . Here, we further demonstrate that RGDV hijacks such double-membraned autophagosomes to traverse the apical plasmalemma into saliva-stored salivary cavities, pass through the tight intercellular junctions into adjacent midgut epithelial cells, or release from the serosal barrier of midgut epithelium into the hemocoel. We thus determine that viruses can hijack autophagic release pathway to overcome the membrane barriers of insect organs. Viral nonstructural protein Pns11 could physically distribute on the membranes of virus-induced autophagosomes. RGDV Pns11 specifically interacts with cytoplasmic actin and actin-binding proteins such as myosin and gelsolin, which are the main components of insect membrane barriers [32, 40] . Previously, we have shown that the actin filaments can provide sufficient power to propel the tubular or fibrillar structures constructed by RGDV Pns11 to spread from infected cultured leafhopper cells into adjacent cells [15, 29] . Thus, we deduce that the attachment of Pns11 with cytoplasmic actin would also propel Pns11-associated double-membraned autophagic vesicles to pass through the tightly regulated membrane barriers of leafhopper vectors. Similarly, we have observed that viral particles of rice dwarf virus (RDV), also a phytoreovirus, were sequestered in the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in the salivary glands of insect vectors [41] . Thus, RDV can hijack small vesicles, referred to as exosomes, to traverse the apical plasmalemma into saliva-stored cavities after fusing MVBs with apical plasmalemma [41] . In particular, exosome-or autophagosome-mediated viral spread through the membrane barriers does not cause substantial damage to insect tissues or organs, conferring an evolved advantage for viruses to be persistently transmitted by insect vectors. Furthermore, autophagic or exosomal vesicles potentially operate as an immune evasion strategy within insect bodies.",

The ATG5-ATG12 conjugation is essential for the proper curvature and elongation of the phagophore membranes [3] . Thus, it can be reasonably deduced that the binding of fibrillar Pns11 structures to the conjugated ATG5-ATG12 on the phagophore membranes may further remodel the double-membraned autophagosome to serve as a structural platform for viral accumulation and further nonlytic egress. A key event in the biogenesis of autophagosomes is the recruitment of ATG5-ATG12 conjugation to facilitate the covalent attachment of ATG8 to PE lipids on the nascent phagophore membranes [31] . It was further determined here that the ATG5-ATG12 conjugation is required for RGDV-induced ATG8 lipidation, the subsequent autophagosome formation and, ultimately, efficient viral dissemination throughout the insect vectors. ATG8 is present on both inner and outer membranes of the autophagosomes, and also serves as an adaptor for selective substrates such as p62 [42] . In general, the autophagosome-related ATG8 and p62 are efficiently degraded after the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes [43] . However, we observe here that such autophagic flux is inhibited during viral infection, potentially via blocking the fusion of virus-containing autophagosomes with lysosomes. The reduced expression of N-glycosylated Lamp1 in viruliferous R. dorsalis further supports the mechanism of action in this process. Others have reported that viral infection effectively disrupted the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes by interfering with the function of the regulators of autophagic flux [36, 44] . For example, the NSP4 protein of rotavirus binds to autophagosomes and inhibits their fusion with lysosomes to enhance viral RNA replication [44] . Similarly, the phosphoprotein of HPIV3 disrupts the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to promote extracellular viral production [36] . We further determine that Pns11 of RGDV could effectively mediate the reduced expression of N-glycosylated Lamp1 on lysosomal membranes by directly targeting Lamp1, finally decreasing the fusion ability of virus-containing autophagosomes with lysosomes by an unknown mechanism. Thus, RGDV Pns11 is involved in preventing the degradation of virus-induced autophagosomes. Taken together, we show that RGDV Pns11 induces a non-canonical autophagy process to benefit viral spread in the insect vectors.",

After virions enter the midgut epithelium of R. dorsalis and initiate multiplication process for the assembly of progeny virions, viral nonstructural protein Pns11 is initially synthesized and recruited by ATG5-ATG12 conjugation on the phagophore membranes. This process then induces the formation of doublemembraned autophagosomes for packaging of virions. Meanwhile, RGDV Pns11 directly interacts with and mediates the reduced expression of N-glycosylated Lamp1 on the lysosomal membranes, which potentially preventing the fusion of Pns11-associated autophagosomes with lysosomes.
