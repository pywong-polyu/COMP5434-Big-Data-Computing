The D614G mutation in the spike protein was present in 99.3% of the isolates. The calculated viral mutational rate of 22.2 substitutions/year contrasts the 13.5 substitutions/year observed in California isolates without the D614G mutation. Phylogenetic clade 20C was associated with severe cases of COVID-19 (p=0.0467, OR=6.95).

The growing significance of COVID-19 in the pediatric population has become more evident in recent months, as cases have grown from a reported 1.7% in April to 7.7% of total reported U.S. cases in August, 2020 [3] . Between July-August 2020 alone, 179,990 new cases were reported in children, a 90% increase [4] . While COVID-19 in children is often reported to be much less severe, analysis of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization data from 14 states in the US found that 1 in 3 hospitalized children were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) [5] . Awareness of the risk of serious long-term sequelae of COVID-19 in children such as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has increased [6, 7] . Hence, even amongst children with asymptomatic or mild disease manifestations, diagnosis and monitoring of disease course has become a key public health imperative as we seek to safely re-open schools and restart other public activities.",

Viral load (copies/mL) were calculated based on a standard curve generated by testing samples with known viral copy numbers. Briefly, viral samples consisting of a gradient of known viral copy numbers (2.0 x 10 7 copies/mL to 2 x 10 3 copies/mL) were processed followed by RT-PCR in triplicates. A standard curve was generated by plotting a linear line in a graph with Ct values plotted on the y-axis and viral load in log (copies/mL) on the x-axis.",

All patients <5 years old were symptomatic and had higher viral loads (2.3x10 8 vs 1.9 x10 6 copies/mL, p=0.0004) ( Figure 2C) . No difference in viral load was observed in association with chronic underlying conditions, gender, or disease severity. Table 3 ). SNVs were located mostly in ORFs, with highest numbers in ORF1ab (n=231) and S (n=42) (Figure 3a, supplementary Table 3 ). The majority (10/15) of the insertion/deletions caused a frame-shift mutation in ORF1ab. Notably, the recently described D614G mutation in the spike protein [10, 22] , caused by nucleotide G-to-A substitution at position 23,403 in the Wuhan reference strain NC_045512.2 (Figure 3b, supplementary Table 3 ), was present in all but one of our isolates (140/141, 99.3%). There were two other mutations that co-exist with the D614G mutation in all isolates located in ORF1ab: F924F (c.2772C>T) is a synonymous mutation while P4715L (c.14144C>T) is a non-synonymous mutation (Figure 3b ). Using CHLA CARD [16] to assess the incidence of these variations globally, we compared our isolates to a global database of 77,966 SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide and found 41 variations unique to the isolates present in our cohort, while the remaining 329 variations were present in at least one other global isolate (supplementary Table 3 ). These 41 variants unique to our cohort include 18 missense, 10 synonymous, 10 frameshift, 1 inframe, 1 stop loss and 1 start loss. Interestingly, each of the 10 frameshift mutations was M a n u s c r i p t 7 detected in one isolate. The only other frameshift mutation found in the cohort is the c.361delA mutation in ORF8 that was also found in only one isolate in our cohort but reported 25 times previously according to CHLA CARD. While the clinical significance of these variations remains unclear, they point towards genetic heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in Southern California.",

The D614G mutation is shown to have been rapidly fixed in isolates from Europe and North America and has been associated with lower Ct values in vitro and in vivo, but not with disease severity nor case fatality rates [10, 31] . The role of the D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity continues to be a focus of active investigation. While some studies suggest this mutation may increase transmissibility, a clear consensus awaits further investigation [32] [33] [34] . In this pediatric cohort the mutation does not appear to be a primary driver of disease severity as it was present in all spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic to severe infection. We also identified the two common mutations (F924F and P4715L) alongside the D614G mutation in our isolates [35] . ORF1ab P4715L is located in Nsp12 which is important for viral replication. A comprehensive analysis of over 12,300 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences across 28 countries reported that mutation at P4715L and D614G may correlate with higher fatality rates [36] . Nevertheless the functional significance of these mutations still needs to be fully investigated. Confirmation of these observed mutations and better understanding of its potential significance will require sequencing and correlatives studies of larger numbers of pediatric COVID-19 cases.",

However, the effect of this higher than expected rate of mutation is readily apparent in the unexpected diversity of variation across the viral genome as illustrated in Fig. 2B .

This is consistent with previously described patterns of multiple introduction and community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in California [37, 38] . Analysis of the genome sequences from the 22 pediatric patients in California not in this study that are currently available for evaluation confirmed the same 3 phylogenetic clades, but with a difference in clade distribution. In these cases phylogenetic clade 20A was most prominent (data not shown). The genetic diversity among the isolates points to multiple potential introductions of the virus in Southern California from across the US and the world. An unexpected finding in our cohort was an apparent association between disease severity and clade 20C. Recognizing the limitations of small case numbers, it is notable that all severe cases and all but one moderately severe case fell into the phylogenetic clade 20C. Two additional mutations (C1059T and G25563T) differentiate phylogenetic clade 20C from 20A and 20B and at least one of these may potentially be associated with increased disease severity [39] . G25563T leads to the Q57H missense mutation ORF3a that is associated with host cell apoptosis and contribute to increased infectivity and virulence [40, 41] . Confirmation of the effect of these mutations, as well as well as further exploration of the genotype-phenotype correlation of phylogenetic clade 20C, warrant further examination in larger scale pediatric populations.",

First, this is a single-center study on 141 pediatric patients in Southern California with clinical characteristics available on 88 patients. Although we observed interesting associations between viral genotypes and disease severity, this study was not sufficiently powered to establish a statistically significant correlation between individual viral genetic variations and disease severity. Finally, due to the over-representation of Hispanic population (67.3%) in our pediatric cohort, the clinical and genomic findings from this study may not reflect all ethnic groups. Notwithstanding the predominant Hispanic population in this cohort, 6 of the10 moderate or severe cases occurred in non-Hispanic patients. Data from a larger and geographically diverse pediatric population will be required to better characterize these potential associations between disease severity and viral genetic variations.",

While we observed limited shared variations between the isolates, our findings demonstrate unique variation in each isolate at the cohort or population level including observation of moderate and severe COVID-19 cases corresponding almost exclusively to phylogenetic clade 20C. Furthermore, the majority of these variants led to amino-acid changes in the viral proteins, possibly indicating an ongoing adaptation of the virus in human population. This genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 at the population level has not been well appreciated in previous description of SAR-CoV-2 in children and suggests that substantial collaborative efforts will be required across multiple institutions to confidently establish an association between genetic variations and any specific disease manifestation in pediatric COVID-19 patients.
