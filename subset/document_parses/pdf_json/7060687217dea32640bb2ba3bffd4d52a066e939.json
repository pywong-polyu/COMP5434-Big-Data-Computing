Symptom frequencies are used in applications including triage recommendation [1] and COVID-19 diagnostic [2] [3] . However, the reported symptom frequencies vary considerably across studies [1] . An example is \"fever\" for which symptom frequencies were reported between 7% and 91% [1] . Causes for these discrepancies include the over-representation of patients in hospital settings [2] and the lack of clarity on how symptoms were collected [1] .",

Also, the dyspnea frequency and difference reported here might be due to a sample bias as (a) dyspnea is often a late symptom of an infection while chat-bot users might rather be at an earlier stage of an infection and (b) dyspnea can be a distressing symptom and affected individuals might rather call an emergency hotline instead of using a chatbot [12] .",

Our results showed a cough frequency of 58% which falls within the previously reported symptom frequency range of the literature [6] (range [43%-71%]). Similar agreements were found for sore throat (41% vs [5%-71%]), fever (51% vs [7%-91%]), malaise (81% vs [19%-86%]) and headache (64% vs [3%-71%]). The upper limit of the reported literature ranges might represent hospitalized patients. Only the frequency of fatigue (73%) does not fall within the range of [6] (10%-57%). This discrepancy might be explained by the non-specific nature of fatigue.",
