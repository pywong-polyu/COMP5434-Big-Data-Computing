            "text": "Purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench) is a popular native North American herbal plant. Its major bioactive compound, chicoric acid, is reported to have various potential physiological functions, but little is known about its biosynthesis. Here, taking an activityguided approach, we identify two cytosolic BAHD acyltransferases that form two intermediates, caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid. Surprisingly, a unique serine carboxypeptidaselike acyltransferase uses chlorogenic acid as its acyl donor and caftaric acid as its acyl acceptor to produce chicoric acid in vacuoles, which has evolved its acyl donor specificity from the better-known 1-O-\u03b2-D-glucose esters typical for this specific type of acyltransferase to chlorogenic acid. This unusual pathway seems unique to Echinacea species suggesting convergent evolution of chicoric acid biosynthesis. Using these identified acyltransferases, we have reconstituted chicoric acid biosynthesis in tobacco. Our results emphasize the flexibility of acyltransferases and their roles in the evolution of specialized metabolism in plants.",

One example was the introduction of Echinacea, a genus of herbs native to North America, and used by Native Americans as traditional medicines to treat common colds and infections 1 . Since the 1880s, Echinacea extracts have become some of the most popular commercial herbal preparations, and today over 1000 products containing extracts of Echinacea are listed in the Dietary Supplement Label Database (https://dsld.od.nih.gov). The total sales of products from E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida, reached US$ 120.2 million on the US market alone in 2019 and grew by 90.9% in the first half of 2020, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2 . The main bioactives in Echinacea are caffeic acid derivatives (CADs) 3 . Chicoric acid is the principal CAD and provides an index for the quality of raw material and commercial preparations of Echinacea 4 . Although there isn't sufficient evidence to conclusively establish its functions, chicoric acid has been reported as an potential HIV-1 integrase inhibitor 5 along with other bioactivities including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, glucose and lipid homeostatic, neuroprotective, anti-atherosclerosis, and anti-aging activities 6 . Despite the large number of studies in the potential health benefits of chicoric acid, its biosynthetic pathway remains unclear.",

In Echinacea, caftaric acid and chicoric acid are L-isomers, which differ from those in Equisetum arvense suggesting a distinct biosynthetic pathway 8 . A hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: tartaric acid hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HTT) activity synthesizing L-caftaric acid has been reported in Arachis glabrata, but without gene information 9 . However, no enzyme activity has yet been described for L-chicoric acid biosynthesis. One of the best-studied CADs is chlorogenic acid. Hydroxycinnamoyl-Coenzyme A: quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT), a BAHD acyltransferase family member, is involved in the biosynthesis of chlorogenic acid in different plant species [10] [11] [12] . Another important acyltransferase group is the serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) family. The major differences between these two families are the acyl donor source and cellular compartment: BAHDs use acyl-CoA thioesters as acyl donors in the cytosol, whereas SCPLs use 1-O-\u03b2-glucose esters as their acyl donors in the vacuole 13 .",

Two BAHD enzymes, EpHTT and EpHQT are responsible for the biosynthesis of caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid in the cytosol, respectively. These two CADs serve as substrates for the generation of chicoric acid in the vacuole by a unique SCPL enzyme. Unlike other SCPLs, this SCPL prefers chlorogenic acid to 1-O-caffeoyl \u03b2-D-glucose as its acyl donor. Among the species we checked, this chicoric acid biosynthetic route is unique to Echinacea spp. and it is likely that chicoric acid biosynthesis in other species evolved by convergent catalytic mechanisms. Our results expand the understanding of acyltransferases and highlight the rapid evolution possible with these types of enzymes.",

Previous studies indicated that purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) contains much higher levels of chicoric acid than other Echinacea species 14 . Metabolic profiling of purple coneflower seedlings revealed the presence of chicoric acid throughout the plant, making it difficult to conduct tissue-specific coexpression analysis to identify biosynthetic genes ( Fig. 1) 15-17 . We generated hairy root cultures of purple coneflower and confirmed the presence of chicoric acid (Fig. 1) . RNA-seq of hairy roots treated with methyl jasmonate to induce chicoric acid accumulation failed to provide good candidate genes due to the large number of differently expressed genes. As an alternative, we took a traditional biochemical approach and searched for caftaric acid synthase activity as caftaric acid is a likely intermediate (Fig. 1d) 12, 18 . Based on the structural similarity of caftaric acid to chlorogenic acid, we investigated whether hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: tartaric acid hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HTT) could use caffeoyl CoA as an acyl donor to produce caftaric acid as reported 9 . When tartaric acid and caffeoyl CoA were incubated with a crude protein extract from hairy roots of purple coneflower, we detected the production of caftaric acid, indicating the presence of HTT activity. In addition, the crude protein extract also catalyzed the generation of chlorogenic acid using quinic acid and caffeoyl CoA as substrates, confirming the activity of hydroxycinnamoyl-Coenzyme A: quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT).",

This HQT-like protein was closely related to the HCT (Hydroxycinnamoyl-Coenzyme A: quinate/shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase) clade, with HHLVD and DFGWG motifs ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). In vitro enzyme assays using recombinant protein from E. coli confirmed that this enzyme can catalyze the biosynthesis of caftaric acid ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3a and 4a-c), and we named it EpHTT. Similarly, in fractions with high HQT activity, we identified another BAHD acyltransferase with classic HTLSD and DFGWG motifs belonging to the HQT clade of BAHD acyltransferases (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1a -b and 2), which could catalyze the formation of chlorogenic acid in vitro, and which we named EpHQT ( Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3b and 4d-f). No putative signal peptides were found in the EpHTT or EpHQT sequences. Both EpHTT and EpHQT GFP-tagged proteins were cytosolically localized as reported for other HQTs 19, 20 and showed highest activities at pH 7 ( Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 5a-b) . Although both enzymes showed promiscuity in their acyl donors, caffeoyl CoA was preferred by both (Supplementary Table 1 -2). EpHTT differs from HTT activity from perennial peanut which prefers p-coumaroyl CoA as its acyl donor 9 . We verified the function of EpHTT and EpHQT in vivo using both overexpression and gene silencing in hairy roots. When the EpHTT gene was overexpressed or silenced, the caftaric acid levels in transgenic hairy roots increased or decreased correspondingly (Fig. 2d, e) . Similar results were seen for the EpHQT gene, where the contents of chlorogenic acid in the transgenic hairy roots were correlated positively in the different lines to the expression levels of EpHQT (Fig. 2f, g) . Our in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that EpHTT and EpHQT are responsible for caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid biosynthesis, respectively in purple coneflower.",

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that EpHTT might have evolved from the hydroxycinnamoylcoenzyme A: shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) clade of BAHD acyltransferases (Fig. 2a) . Using AtHCT (AED95744.1) and NtHCT (CAE46932.1) to screen RNA-seq data, we also identified a candidate transcript encoding EpHCT. EpHCT belongs to the HCT clade with conserved HHAAD and DFGWG motifs ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2) 21 . We confirmed EpHCT function by in vitro enzyme assays which could catalyze the production of p-coumaroyl shikimic acid using p-coumaroyl CoA and shikimic acid as substrates, and the generation of 5-O-caffeoyl shikimic acid using caffeoyl CoA and shikimic acid as substrates ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). All three BAHD enzymes, EpHTT, EpHQT and EpHCT, showed preferences amongst their potential acyl acceptors (Table 1) . EpHTT could use only tartaric acid but not quinic acid nor shikimic acid, EpHQT and EpHCT could use both quinic acid and shikimic acid as acyl acceptors but with significant preferences by EpHQT for quinic acid and by EpHCT for shikimic acid as previously reported ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ) 12, 21, 22 . Molecular docking was undertaken based on the structural model for p-coumaroyl shikimic acid bound AtHCT (PDB: 5KJU) 23 . All three EpBAHDs have similar scaffolds. Compared with EpHQT and EpHCT, EpHTT formed a smaller pocket, that could accommodate only tartaric acid, and not quinic acid and shikimic acid (Supplementary Fig. 8a) . Differences between the active pockets of EpHQT and EpHCT appeared critical in determining their acyl acceptor preferences ( Supplementary Fig. 8b ). In summary, EpHTT has likely evolved from the HCT clade of enzymes, principally through specialization of its acyl acceptor recognition.",

As suggested by the formation of di-caffeoyl quinic acid in tomato and di-O-caffeoyl-meso-tartrate in Equisetum arvense 7,24 , we tried to establish a similar in vitro chicoric acid biosynthesis assay. However, neither EpHTT nor crude protein extract could convert caftaric acid or caftaric acid with caffeoyl CoA to chicoric acid ( Supplementary Fig. 9a, b) . We noticed that decreases in EpHQT expression also led to the decline of chicoric acid content in transgenic hairy roots ( Supplementary Fig. 9c ). Chlorogenic acid has been reported as an acyl donor for the biosynthesis of dicaffeoyl quinic acid by SlHQT, as well as caffeoylglucarate by a GDSL lipase-like acyltransferase in tomato 24, 25 . This suggested that chlorogenic acid might be used as acyl donor in chicoric acid biosynthesis. Consequently, we incubated caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid with a crude protein extract from purple coneflower and detected the formation of chicoric acid. We optimized this assay using acidic and low salt conditions (PBS pH 4.0 without NaCl or KCl) ( Supplementary Fig. 9b ). Together, these data suggested that chicoric acid can be synthesized from caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid by a chicoric acid synthase in purple coneflower.",

The activity of chicoric acid synthase was measured and fractions with the highest activities were used for peptide mass fingering (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d) . However, peptides of neither BAHDs nor GDSL lipase-like proteins were detected. Instead, we noticed peptides of a Serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) protein were enriched in the fractions ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ). This protein belongs to the SCPL clade IA which has been reported to have acyltransferase activity (Fig. 3a) 26 . In vitro assays indicated that this protein, when expressed and purified from yeast, could catalyze the trans-acylation of caftaric acid by chlorogenic acid to form chicoric acid and quinic acid ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary  Fig. 10 ). Therefore, we named this SCPL protein, chicoric acid synthase (EpCAS). Compared to BAHD acyltransferases, EpCAS required longer incubation times for accumulation of its chicoric acid product to become apparent, which is typical of other SCPLs 27,28 . We determined the kinetic parameters of EpCAS using in vitro enzyme assays and found that EpCAS showed quite low Kcat values for its caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid substrates (Supplementary Table 3 ). Similar to other SCPLs 29,30 , EpCAS has a conserved vacuolar targeting peptide at its Nterminus (Met1-His24) ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). We confirmed that an EpCAS GFP-fusion protein was located in vacuoles, and the enzyme shows highest activity at pH 4 consistent with its vacuolar location ( Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 5c ). We verified the role of EpCAS in chicoric acid biosynthesis in vivo using hairy roots. When EpCAS was overexpressed or silenced, the chicoric acid content was increased or decreased respectively, consistent with EpCAS expression levels which were accordingly upregulated or downregulated (Fig. 3c, d) . These results showed that EpCAS catalyzes the synthesis of chicoric acid in purple coneflower.",

            "text": "When the EpCAS was aligned with other functionally characterized SCPL acyltransferases, we found it had the conserved Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ), which is necessary for hydrolysis of peptide bonds by serine proteinase and can be inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) 31, 32 . Indeed, the in vitro activity of EpCAS was inhibited by PMSF in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a) . The significance of the conserved Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad of EpCAS was also confirmed using site-directed mutagenesis. When the Ser180 was replaced by Ala, EpCAS lost acyltransferase activity completely. Mutations converting His430 and Asp374 to alanine also showed significantly lower activities (Fig. 4b) . These results demonstrated that the catalytic triad is crucial for the acyl transfer activity 33 (Fig. 4c) . Surprisingly, we also detected caffeic acid as a byproduct in the EpCAS reaction ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary  Fig. 10f-g ). An SCPL (1-O-sinapoyl-\u03b2-D-glucose: L-malate sinapoyl transferase) from Arabidopsis has also been reported to have a minor hydrolytic activity producing sinapic acid from 1-Osinapoyl-\u03b2-D-glucose (pH 6.0) 35 . When EpCAS was mixed with caftaric acid or chlorogenic acid alone (pH 4.0), it cleaved caffeic acid from both these substrates ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Another SCPL from Zea mays, 1-O-(indole-3-acetyl)-\u03b2-D-glucose: myoinositol indoleacetyl transferase has also been reported to have hydrolytic activity towards its product 36 . EpCAS could also hydrolyze chicoric acid to release caftaric acid and caffeic acid, but this reaction was irreversible ( Supplementary Fig. 13c -d). It seems that the Ser180 of the catalytic triad can attack the ester bond of these caffeic acid esters directly and release minor amounts of caffeic acid. Table 3 ). Docking results showed that the glucose group of 1-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucose would sink into the inner pocket and hinder the entry of caftaric acid. Although quinic acid and glucose have similar structures, the extra carboxyl group of quinic acid would hinder the entrance of chlorogenic acid to the inner pocket of EpCAS. This difference suggested that quinic acid would be liberated more easily from chlorogenic acid than glucose from 1-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucose, explaining the preference of EpCAS for chlorogenic acid as its acyl donor (Supplementary Fig. 15c ). Interestingly, we found that compounds with structures similar to chlorogenic acid (neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid and 5-O-caffeoyl shikimic acid) could also be used by EpCAS but with much lower relative activities (<1%) than with chlorogenic acid under identical conditions (Supplementary Fig. 16 ). These results demonstrated that EpCAS has evolved unique specificity for its acyl donor, distinct from that of other characterized SCPL enzymes in plants 33, 38 . Interestingly, although we could detect very low activity of purified EpCAS enzyme when using 1-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucose as an acyl donor in vitro, crude protein extracts of purple coneflower could not use 1-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucose as an acyl donor to synthesize caftaric acid, chlorogenic acid or chicoric acid ( Supplementary Fig. 17 ). In addition, we failed to detect any 1-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucose in extracts of purple coneflower ( Supplementary Fig. 18 ). All these results demonstrated that in purple coneflower, EpCAS has evolved specificity for its acyl donor.",

To investigate the conservation of EpCAS's unique acyltransferase activity in other chicoric acid producing species, we selected several representative species including: another two Echinacea species (Echinacea pallida and Echinacea angustifolia) and two distantly related species (Cichorium endivia and Lactuca sativa) known to produce caftaric acid, chlorogenic acid and chicoric acid; as well as Helianthus annuus and Chysanthemum coronarium, from two different intervening plant lineages which accumulate only chlorogenic acid ( Fig. 5a-b and Supplementary Fig. 19 ). When we incubated crude protein extracts from the other chicoric acid-producing species with caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid, E. pallida and E. angustifolia crude protein extracts showed CAS activities. However, Cichorium endivia and Lactuca sativa failed to produce chicoric acid (Fig. 5c ). Crude protein extracts from all samples exhibited HQT activities, but Cichorium endivia and Lactuca sativa crude protein extracts did not show HTT activities agreeing with their lack of CAS activity ( Supplementary Fig. 20 ). In addition, we were unable to find any sequences encoding highly homologous proteins to EpHTT and EpCAS from the Lactuca sativa genome or any other public available databases by BLAST, while the BAHD proteins with the HTLSD motif (conserved in HQT-likes proteins) were found. It seems likely that the pathway for chicoric acid biosynthesis catalyzed by HTT and CAS in Echinacea species is unique. In other chicoric acid containing species, we conclude that chicoric acid is likely synthesized using different substrates and enzyme activities. Our results support the idea that chicoric acid biosynthesis is polyphyletic and has evolved in different plant lineages by convergence 40 .",

Chicoric acid is also present in intercellular spaces and cell walls which may be due to release following cell damage. Like other identified SCPLs 13, 35, 44 , EpCAS prefers acidic conditions and exhibits highest in vitro enzyme activity at pH 4, like SlHQT chlorogenate-chlorogenate transferase activity in vacuoles 24 . EpCAS activity was relatively high (>80% of the maximum) over the pH range of 3.6 to 4.9, which should ensure the production of chicoric acid under vacuolar pH conditions. Based on our results, the biosynthesis of chicoric acid is likely to depend on transport of caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid into the vacuoles, although, to date, no transporters for hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives have been reported. Chlorogenic acid has been reported to be transported into vacuoles by vesicles in Lonicera japonica flowers 45 .",

Unlike other SCPLs, in purple coneflower, EpCAS utilizes chlorogenic acid rather than 1-O-caffeoyl \u03b2-glucose as its acyl donor 13, 37 . Among the species we tested, this pathway is unique, existing only Echinacea species and it is likely that chicoric acid biosynthesis is polyphyletic and has evolved by convergent mechanisms in other plant lineages. Chicoric acid is also vacuole-localized in Cichorium endivia 48 where it may be synthesized using caffeoyl CoA as an acyl donor as suggested for Equisetum arvense 7 , or produced by modification of other intermediates, such as p-coumaroylcaffeoyl tartaric acid. Further research is needed to clarify its biosynthesis in other species. Additionally, it will be interesting to identify the biological functions (if any) of chicoric acid in Echinacea and other species. This could help us better understand its evolution and regulation. In summary, our results expand our understanding of acyltransferases in specialized metabolism and highlight the rapid evolution possible with these types of enzymes. Extraction of caffeic acid derivatives. Plant materials were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately and stored at -80\u00b0C. On the day of extraction, samples were lyophilized and ground into powder.

Schematic representation of the proposed chicoric acid biosynthetic pathway in purple coneflower. Two types of acyltransferases distributed in distinct subcellular compartments are involved in the biosynthesis of chicoric acid. In the cytosol, the BAHDs including EpHTT and EpHQT use caffeoyl CoA from phenylpropanoid metabolism as an acyl donor to synthesize caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid, respectively. Both products are then transported into the vacuole. EpCAS, a specialized SCPL acyltransferase, uses chlorogenic acid as its acyl donor instead of 1-Ocaffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucose and transfers the caffeoyl group to caftaric acid to generate chicoric acid.
