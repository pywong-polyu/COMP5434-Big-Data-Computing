This disease affects the entire population, with the oldest and those with comorbidities being the most affected. During these first 7 months with COVID-19, findings have been reported in thousands of pregnant women, which has allowed us to understand and know findings generated by SARS-CoV-2 1,2 . We have learned that the possibility of maternal complication, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit and ventilation is greater in pregnant women with COVID-19. Increased frequencies of cesarean section, premature birth, premature rupture of membranes and other obstetric complications have been associated with COVID-19 1,2 . However we do not know the maternal and perinatal results of pregnant women recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection continuing the pregnancy.",
