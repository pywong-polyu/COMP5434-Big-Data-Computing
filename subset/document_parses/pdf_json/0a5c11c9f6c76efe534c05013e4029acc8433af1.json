Recent SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility studies in cats show that the virus can replicate in these companion animals and transmit to other cats. Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease and transmission in domestic cats. Cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel cats were introduced. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats. Serology showed that both, principals and sentinels, developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels. The results of this study are critical for understanding the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in a naturally susceptible host species, and for risk assessment.",

Alpha-and betacoronaviruses infect mammals and cause important respiratory, enteric, and systemic infectious diseases of humans, cattle, pigs, cats, dogs, horses, and camels [1, 4, 5] . Importantly, coronaviruses can occasionally cross the species barriers [6, 7] .",

In a recent animal susceptibility study, dogs, cats, ferrets, pigs, chickens and ducks were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 [20] . The results from that study show that both cats and ferrets were efficiently infected and could transmit the virus, dogs showed low susceptibility, while pigs and avian species were non permissive hosts. In addition, nonhuman primates (NHPs), hamsters and hACE2 transgenic or adenovirus transduced mice have also been evaluated as potential animal models for SARS-CoV-2 and seem to be highly susceptible showing mild to severe clinical signs [15, 21] .",

Therefore, further research of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various animal species is needed in order to identify susceptible hosts and to better understand the infection, disease, clinical course and transmission capabilities of susceptible animal species.

Histologically, the pathological changes were limited to the upper and lower airways (larynx, trachea, and main, lobar and segmental bronchi of the lungs) of SARS-CoV-2 principal infected cats. Pathological findings are characterized by multifocal lymphocytic and neutrophilic tracheobronchoadenitis of seromucous glands of the lamina propria and submucosa of the trachea and bronchi. Changes range from minimal to mild at 4 DPC and progress to mild to moderate by 7 DPC (Figure 3 , Figure S3 ). Affected submucosal glands and associated ducts were variably distended, lined by attenuated epithelium, and contain necrotic cell debris. More severely affected glands are poorly delineated, and disrupted by mild to moderate numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells, and few neutrophils (Figure 3 , Figure  S3 ). No significant pathology was identified elsewhere in the pulmonary parenchyma of SARS-CoV-2infected cats on 4 and 7 DPC. No significant histologic changes were noted in the respiratory tract at 21 DPC, with the submucosal architecture of the trachea and bronchi being unremarkable and within normal limits (Figure 3 , Figure S3 ).",

While the minimum infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 for humans, cats or other susceptible animals is not currently known, in our study we administered a relatively high infectious dose via multiple natural infection routes, to achieve sufficient virus exposure for primary infection. Compared to the SARS-CoV-2 study in cats by Shi and colleagues (2020), we used a 1 log higher infectious dose administered orally and intranasally simultaneously. The detection of high levels of viral RNA from swab samples and in various organs and tissues, along with mild to moderate histologic changes in trachea and bronchi associated with viral RNA and antigen, and the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies demonstrates that cats were productively infected, without developing any obvious clinical signs. Furthermore, the principal infected cats were able to transmit the virus to sentinel animals within 2 days of contact housing similar to previous reports [20, 25] . Shedding of virus through the respiratory and GI tract are most likely responsible for the transmission to the sentinel animals. Shi and coworkers (2020) determined that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among cats is possible but not highly effective.",

Consistent with our results, previous studies [20, 25] also reported no obvious clinical signs in SARS-CoV-2 infected cats which were older than 4 months. We detected high viral RNA levels in many tissues tested at 4 and 7 DPC, with reduced levels (upper respiratory tract, lymphoid tissues, CNS) or clearing by 21 DPC. Since no virus was detected in blood, it remains to be studied how the virus reaches and infects non-respiratory tissues including the CNS. Shi and colleagues [20] detected viral RNA and infectious virus throughout upper and lower respiratory tracts in juvenile (70-100 days old) and subadult cats (6-9 months old) at 3 DPC, but it was cleared from most lung tissues of subadult cats by 6 DPC. However, in juvenile cats, virus was still present at 6 DPC in the lower respiratory tract [20] . In contrast, no virus was detected in other organs of any of these cats which included brain, heart, submaxillary lymph nodes, kidney, spleen, liver, and pancreas at 3 or 6 DPC [20] . Similar to Shi and colleagues (2020) who detected virus in the small intestine of most of the animals, we found shedding of viral RNA in rectal swabs up to 14 DPC and in pooled GI tract tissues on 4 and 7 DPC. In contrast, Halfmann and coworkers (2020) found all rectal swabs from 4-5 month old animals to be virus negative. These differences may be explained by the age of the cats and and/or different virus strains used. SARS-CoV-2 associated pathological changes in juvenile and subadult infected cats were reported, but more severe pathology was found in the juvenile cats [20] . Similarly, our results show that subadult cats had mild to moderate histologic alterations identified as tracheobronchoadenitis within the airways. The macroscopic lung lesions observed were most likely due to the euthanasia with barbiturates. Importantly, all SARS-CoV-2 infected cats (principals and sentinels) in our study mounted an antiviral and neutralizing antibody response during the 21-day observation period. The development of an early serological response starting at 5-7 DPC in some of the principal infected cats could be indicative of the high infectious dose, compared to sentinels which developed antibodies around 10-14 DPC. Other studies reported detection of virus-specific and/or neutralizing antibodies also in all infected animals [20, 25] . None of these studies detected virus or viral RNA in the blood.",

Similarly, our SARS-CoV-2 infection of subadult cats demonstrated mild to moderate neutrophilic and lymphocytic tracheobronchoadenitis with associated intralesional detection of viral RNA and viral antigen. While SARS-CoV antigen was identified in cat tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells [9, 10] , we found that the epithelial cells of trachea and bronchi seem non-permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication in subadult cats as demonstrated by the lack of viral RNA and antigen; this correlated with the absence of histologic alterations on the surface epithelium. These findings are in partial disagreement to those of another recent cat study [20] , where mild histologic alterations in the tracheal lumen and epithelium were reported in the absence of detectable viral antigen. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infected subadult cats did not present histological changes within the small airways or the pulmonary parenchyma consistent with interstitial pneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage, such as inflammatory infiltrates within alveoli, intra-alveolar fibrin or hyaline membranes, or pneumocyte type II hyperplasia. Additionally, there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within pneumocytes or alveolar macrophages as demonstrated by the absence of viral RNA and antigen. These findings correlate with the absence of clinically evident respiratory disease following experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection. While a recent study evaluating the susceptibility of juvenile cats to SARS-CoV-2 [20] suggested the occurrence of histologic alterations in the pulmonary vasculature and alveolar spaces, none of these changes were noted in our study. Additional investigations are needed to determine whether these differences are due to the breed and age of the cats, the virus isolate used or other factors.",

This information will be important for providing appropriate veterinary care for infected cats and cats in their surroundings, for protection of veterinary personnel, animal caretakers and pet owners, and for applying quarantine measures to prevent transmission between felines, people and potentially other susceptible animals. The ease of transmission between domestic cats indicates a significant public health necessity to investigate a potential human-cat-human transmission chain. It is also critical that pet owners are educated on the risks and preventative measures in order to calm fears and discourage animal abandonment.",

However, a preclinical animal model that mimics the clinical symptoms and disease observed in severe COVID-19 patients is still needed to improve the evaluation of vaccines, antiviral drugs and other therapies.",

Only cats less than 1-year-old were evaluated in this and previous studies [20, 25] ; however, SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult and old cats, and questions regarding re-infection of cats were not explored in these studies. Recent non peer-reviewed work by Bosco-Lauth and colleagues (2020) investigated experimental SARS-CoV-2 challenge and transmission in adult cats 5-8 years old, and re-infection after 28 DPC [26] . That study demonstrated that adult cats become infected without clinical signs and with pathology limited to respiratory airways, can readily transmit the virus to na\u00efve cats, and appear to be protected from reinfection [26] . Studies to better understand the mechanisms of infection and the range of symptoms and pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 in various preclinical models of COVID-19 are critical for the development of vaccines and treatments for this disease.",
