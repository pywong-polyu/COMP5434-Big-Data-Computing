While millions of people fought with the disease, economies, societies and institutions faced side-effects of government measures resisting the spread of the virus. This article describes the effects of the pandemic on the legislative behaviour of MPs in one of the worst-hit countries in the world, the Czech Republic. The results show that the number of bill proposals and roll calls substantially increased during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic times. Since the start of the outbreak, a third of roll calls and a half of bill proposals concerned the pandemic. Nonetheless, the outbreak did not substantially affect the voting unity of parliamentary party groups nor the opposition became more supportive of the cabinet. Still, while the liberal Pirates became more cooperative during the pandemic than the pre-pandemic period, the rightist antisystem party Freedom and Direct Democracy receded from the rest of the parties on the pandemic issues.",

First, how did the work of parliamentarians changed formally, and what were the consequences of such changes? Almost all parliaments needed to adjust modes of gathering, deliberation or voting, and it is undoubtedly vital to scrutinise the differences between the adjustments. Thanks to early research, we already know the adopted measures from a comparative perspective (Syllov\u00e1, 2020; Poguntke et al., 2021) . Furthermore, scholars already started to scrutinise how the formal changes influenced legislatures' role in politics in Australia (Mills, 2020) , Canada (Malloy, 2020) , the Czech Republic (Petrov, 2020) , Finland (Neuvonen, 2020) , Israel (Bar-Siman-Tov, 2020) or Sweden (Jonason and Larue, 2020) .",

Unfortunately, the knowledge on this issue is much more limited (e.g. Merkley et al., 2020; Louwerse et al., 2021) . Therefore, this article contributes to this research since it answers how the legislative behaviour of MPs in the Czech Republic changed during the COVID-19 outbreak? The selection of the research case is based not only on the fact that the Czech Republic is a parliamentary regime with a central role of its bicameral parliament. More importantly, the country was one of the worst-hit states by the pandemic in the world. To be more specific, as of 19 June 2021, there were 156,130 confirmed cases and 2,840 deaths per million inhabitants, which ranked the country the fourth (after Andorra, Montenegro and Bahrain) in the number of cases and the fourth (after Peru, Hungary, and Bosnia and Herzegovina) in the number of deaths in the world (The New York Times, 2021). Thus, there is a justifiable expectation that the pandemic affected the legislators' behaviour in the Czech Republic substantially.",

Firstly, the coronavirus, especially the measures adopted to contain its spread, made it difficult for parliaments to operate. Secondly, legislators found themselves at a higher health risk than the rest of the population since politicians are predominantly older males and meet many people. 1 Thirdly, parliamentarians tended to either underestimate or overestimate the risk of the pandemic as there was, for instance, more extensive media attention to infected politicians (see Waismel-Manor et al., 2020) . Fourthly, since governments often treated the situation as a national emergency, parliaments faced a threat of a concentration of executive power.",

            "text": "So far, scholars have focused primarily on the first challenge for the operation of legislative assemblies. Generally, parliaments were choosing among three strategies to deal with the restrictions (Poguntke et al., 2021) . First, some parliaments reduced the number of physically present participants. This was the case of the Czech deputies and senators who decided to assemble in half the number at the time of the most severe spreading of the virus (Parliament of the Czech Republic, 2021). Second, many parliaments employed a strategy of a physical distance (online procedures of deliberation and decision-making). For instance, even the British House of Commons, probably the most traditional legislature in the world, utilised a combination of physical and virtual attendance (Bar-Siman-Tov, 2020). Third, the easiest way of facing the coronavirus was a cancellation strategy. For example, in Australia, the House of Representatives and Senate had initially decided to adjourn sittings for 20 weeks since March 2020 despite the protests of opposition parties, but the decision was changed later (Mills, 2020) .",

            "text": "Many parliaments changed their rules of procedure, especially as they adopted online forms of attendance and voting during plenary sessions and committee and commission meetings (Syllov\u00e1, 2020; Inter-Parliamentary Union, 2021; Pech\u00e1 cek et al., 2021; Poguntke et al., 2021) . Still, there were significant differences among the states. While the most progressive countries (e.g. Estonia, Poland or Romania) adopted the changes relatively quickly or on a large scale, other countries still do not allow the distant attendance at all (e.g. Austria, Denmark, France, Italy or the Netherlands). 1 Male, aged over 65 years might face a greater risk of developing into the critical or mortal condition when infected by COVID-19 (Zheng et al., 2020) . Soon, experts started to discuss how these changes of operation influenced parliaments' role in polities. For example, Malloy (2020) pointed out that the Canadian opposition focused mainly on scrutiny of government actions in the pandemic, while the government mainly concentrated on law-making (see Morden, 2020) . As a result, these two functions were emphasised over others (such as transparency or representation), which was intensified by virtual meetings. In Australia, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated both the capacity and willingness of the executive to govern without the parliament (Mills, 2020) . Moreover, the parliament proved to be unable to define a more assertive role for itself. As a result, 'the emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic either eliminated or by substantially compromised Parliament's capacity to perform each' principal function of the parliament (Mills, 2020, p. 18) . In Sweden, changes were adopted under no specific framework for civil crises, and they led to a shorter law-making process, although not a single step in the process was skipped (Jonason and Larue, 2020) . In Finland, the availability of information turned out to be the central issue when the legislature controlled the government during the pandemic (Neuvonen, 2020) .",

According to the author, parliaments faced a significant trade-off in the pandemic between controlling the executive and supporting its capacity to fight the coronavirus efficiently. Petrov argues that parliaments should show some deference to the executive but should not clear the field for governments completely. To explain this, deliberative and scrutiny functions are essential not only for preventing the abuse of power but also for increasing the effectiveness and legitimacy of emergency measures.",

Importantly, the early positive sentiment applied especially to large opposition parties with considerable prior government experience. Similarly, the evidence from social media, internet search trends and public opinion surveys in Canada shows that political elites and the public were in a unique period of cross-partisan consensus on essential questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as seriousness or necessity of some basic measures (Merkley et al., 2020) .

In the light of approaching regional and Senate elections at the beginning of October, the cabinet hesitated to readopt strict measures. For instance, in August, the Minister of Health, Adam Vojt ech (Action of Dissatisfied Citizens -ANO), recalled his initial instruction on wearing masks at schools, shops or restaurants after Prime Minister Andrej Babi s (ANO) had intervened in the debate ( CT24, 2021). Nonetheless, the daily number of newly confirmed cases exceeded the Spring record even before the end of August and continued to rise in September and October. On 5 October, the government reinstated a nationwide state of emergency. Still, on 7 November, the cumulative number of deaths per million people in the Czech Republic surpassed the level in the European Union (Ritchie et al., 2020) . The country successively faced the second, third and fourth waves of the outbreak. During the time, the Czech Republic mostly followed less strict measures than the neighbour states (Hale et al., 2021) . Between September 2020 and May 2021, the Minister of Health was replaced four times due to political turmoil and affairs, impeding management consistency (including Adam Vojt ech, who was appointed in May 2021 for the second time). The state of emergency lasted until 11 April 2021, when the measures started to follow from a newly adopted anti-pandemic law. At that point, there were 147,557 cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases and 2,597 deaths per million inhabitants in the Czech Republic compared with 63,840 and 1,447, respectively, in the European Union (Ritchie et al., 2020) . As a result, the Czech Republic became one of the worst-hit countries globally (The New York Times, 2021). Furthermore, the country quickly confronted other challenges similar to other states. To be more specific, due to the government measures against the spread of the coronavirus, the economy suffered, and the country's GDP declined by 5.6% in 2020. Thus, the government employed many financial programmes to support the economy (Government of the Czech Republic, 2021). As a result, the 2020 state budget resulted in the largest shortfall in history. Nonetheless, the Supreme Audit Office (2021b) alerts that more than half of the increased budget expenditures were caused by social or operating expenses instead of remedies for government measures. Moreover, the office criticises the management of purchases of personal protective equipment (Supreme Audit Office, 2021a).",

While the number of roll calls had fluctuated noticeably before the pandemic, it remained relatively stable during the pandemic. The main exception was a traditional summer recess that took place also in August 2020, as the outbreak seemed to be under control. Figure 2b confirms that the voting on the COVID-19 bills was a strong reason for the increase in the total number of roll calls. To be more specific, COVID-19 roll calls accounted for 36.8% of all the pandemic roll calls. Interestingly, the number of roll calls on COVID-19 bills fluctuated substantially in both absolute and relative terms. For example, from the start of the pandemic in March until May 2020, the MPs voted on more COVID-19 bills than all the other issues combined (including, for instance, procedural votes). Contrary to this, in September 2020, only 5.1% (15 out of 296) roll calls related to the COVID-19 bills.",

Secondly, the relative as well as absolute amount of the COVID-19 roll calls substantially increased between October and December 2020 when the second wave of the pandemic hit the country with full strength.

Interestingly, while the share of the COVID-19 bills was rising gradually during the pandemic, the roll calls on such bills were the most frequent during the first and second waves of the pandemic. To conclude, while the first and second waves of the pandemic translated into the frequent roll calls on a relatively low share of the COVID-19 bills, the later phases of the pandemic led to rather uncomplicated confirmation of the COVID-19 bills despite their growing share. Thus, on the one hand, especially the first and second waves of the outbreak were the opportunity for a rigorous debate on the COVID-19 bills and the pandemic as such. On the other hand, the discussions and roll calls on the pandemic bills have become less frequent during the time, which was most likely caused by the decreasing salience of the issue.",

After the 2017 legislative election, the first single-party minority cabinet of Andrej Babi s (ANO) took office on 13 December 2017. Since the cabinet did not receive the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies, the second minority cabinet of Andrej Babi s (ANO) was named on 27 June 2018, and it remained in the office for the rest of the term. The cabinet was composed of ANO and the Social Democrats ( CSSD), while the Communists (KS CM) tolerated the cabinet based on a formal agreement. Thus, I treat ANO, CSSD, and KS CM as the coalition parties. Considering the opposition, I differentiate between all opposition parties and the prosystem opposition parties, excluding Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD), the antisystem anti-immigration party.

To be more specific, SPD became the only PPG that explicitly and sometimes even radically opposed the mainstream approach to the disease. For instance, the party members repeatedly questioned the number of COVID-19 deaths, and they rejected most of the governments' antipandemic measures. As a result, SPD substantially deviated from the rest of the parliamentary spectrum. Importantly, the division applied not only to the roll calls on the COVID-19 bills (see Figure 5c ) but to the whole pandemic period (see Figure 5b) .",

Roll calls on the COVID-19 bills refer directly to the outbreak. Source: Author based on Parliament of the Czech Republic (2021). Figure 5f ). In other words, the positions of ODS, TOP 09, KDU-CSL and STAN became almost identical. To summarise, the roll call analysis shows that the pandemic not only changed mutual positions of some parties but it also replaced one of the ideological dimensions. On the one hand, the pandemic affected the coalition parties only slightly. On the other hand, the pandemic opened a crucial space for the opposition parties to redefine their position towards the cabinet and the political spectrum. As a result, while the prosystem opposition parties brought their positions closer together during the pandemic, SPD decided to occupy a unique and previously unknown position outside the mainstream.",

On the one hand, the legislators in the Czech Republic have not confirmed the expectation that politicians primarily cooperate across the parties in the early phase of a crisis. The voting unity of all MPs remained the same after the start of the outbreak. Thus, although the opposition was obliging to cooperate with the cabinet on some significant issues, the general trends of broad cross-party cooperation did not change. On the other hand, the pandemic created an opportunity for parties to unify internally and change their mutual relationships. As a result, antisystem party SPD opened a new dimension of parliamentary politics on the attitude towards government measures against the pandemic. Although it is not justifiable to expect that the dimension will not be only temporary, its creation shows the strength of the pandemic and a potential impact on parliamentary politics.",
