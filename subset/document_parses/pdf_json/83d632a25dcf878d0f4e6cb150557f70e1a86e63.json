There was a predominance of individuals who had a higher level of education (p<0.001), low dependence level on the Fagerstr\u00f6m scale (p<0.001), and conventional cigarette smoking (p<0.001). Table 1 presents the levels of prior knowledge about the elevated risks smokers have for severe COVID-19 complications. In all questions, the majority of participants reportedly knew about the elevated risks and agreed that the risks were true (p<0.001). We also noted that the daily consumption of cigarettes between January (questioned retrospectively in the first evaluation) and March did not change significantly (p=0.723). Table 2 presents the categorical analyses of consumption, motivation to quit, and craving. The majority of smokers reported that, during the pandemic, they increased their consumption by between 1 and 10 cigarettes a day (37.7%) and maintained the same motivation (59.8%) and desire to smoke (53.2%). We observed significantly positive correlations between years of smoking and both motivation for smoking cessation (r=0.32; p<0.003) and nicotine dependence level (r=0.44; p<0.001). We also identified a significantly positive correlation between cigarette consumption (cigarettes/day) and both motivation for smoking cessation (r=0.19; p=0.030) and nicotine dependence level (r=0.61; p<0.001). These results show that individuals who smoked more were more motivated to quit and more dependent on nicotine. No significant correlations were observed between consumption and motivation to quit (r=0.13; p=0.129). However, a significant correlation was observed between load consumption and nicotine dependence level (r=0.69; p<0.001).",

We also identified that. Increasing tobacco consumption during a pandemic may be a remedy for boredom in lockdown periods or a response to stress from the possibility of job loss, financial difficulties, insecurities, and fear of contracting a potentially fatal disease 17 . Stress and anxiety have been shown to augment tobacco use 18 . Pandemicrelated social isolation, concerns, and uncertainties may thus explain our findings that the early stages of the pandemic led to increased levels of tobacco consumption and did not motivate smokers to quit.",
