However, recent administrative changes have hollowed out their flexibility to serve communities. We use administrative data on past budgetary allocations per capita to public health departments at upper tier local areas (UTLAs) of England to examine whether public health funding levels were correlated with more rapid control of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between March and July of 2020. The dependent variable was the number of days between a UTLA's 10th case of COVID-19 and the day when new cases per 100,000 peaked and began to decline. Our models controlled for regional socio-economic factors. We found no correlation between local public health expenditure and the speed of control of COVID-19. However, overall public expenditure allocated to improve local areas helped reduce time to reach peak. Contrary to expectation, more dense areas such as London experienced shorter duration. Higher income areas had more rapid success in accelerating the time of the first peak in the first wave of their local COVID-19 incidence. We contribute to understanding the impact of how public expenditure and socio-economic factors affect an epidemic.",

The Public Health Acts of 1848 and 1874 conceived local health departments schools of public health where the establishment of a professional public health workforce was widely credited with England's remarkable health revolution (Szreter, 1988) . England's local public services staff built the sewers and passed the local ordinances responsible for better housing, safer food, and ultimately dramatic control of regular cycles of contagious illnesses including cholera, typhoid, tuberculosis, diphtheria, etc. In the contentious debate over attributing causes to improvements in health, Szreter (1988) notes that the classic study by McKeown (McKeown et al., 1975) conservatively attributes to public health measures a mortality reduction of 25%.",

Historically infectious disease outbreaks have been contained when local public health officials recognize cases, modify behaviors of close contacts, and take general measures in behavioral change among citizens and leaders. Therefore, variation in recent funding levels for local health departments may be correlated with the ability of health officials to execute outbreak control measures. If historical expenditures show little connection to the control of COVID, it should lead to renewed consideration of ways to spend funds on local public health operations in a way that makes them more prepared to control infectious outbreaks. We seek to understand local public health preparedness for containing infectious disease outbreaks by determining the extent to which variation in local-level public health expenditure contributed to shortening the number of days to reach the peak infection level during the first wave of the pandemic from March to July of 2020.",

            "text": "The period of 20 March to 31 July is recognized as the initial wave of COVID-19 in England (Marmot et al., 2020) . Restricting our focus to the first wave offers a more appropriate path to answer questions about how well prior investments in public health prepared local areas to control a new outbreak. As the pandemic in England continued, supplemental public health funding was released to local areas in patterns and amounts that have not yet been systematically made public. These funds would have given local areas a chance to upgrade their approach to outbreak control (Iabuci, 2020) . The disbursement of public health funds in late 2020 is likely to have been correlated with both the prior public health investments as well as the early 2020 rates of COVID-19, thereby, making it counterproductive to use outcomes from the latter half of 2020 to examine the impact of pre-COVID era public health spending. 1 Therefore, looking at time to first peak and its relationship to public health spending at a geographic level is indicative of how well public health is (or not) working at the community level and how prepared public health was (or note) at the start of the pandemic. Extending the time horizon fundamentally shifts our focus from public health's ability to respond and react to the outbreaks to learning to do better over time conditional on new resources and experience. We focus on the local areas of England known as upper-tier local authorities (UTLAs). Sub-national levels in the UK exhibited different levels of COVID-19 infection rates (Corona Virus Daily Data, 2020; Landler, 2020 ; The Office of National Statistics, 2020a). For the period where a clear bend in infections had taken place, we observe wide-spread local variations that persists when the data is aggregated to the nine English regions (see Fig. 1a & b) for the first wave (March to July 2020). Local health department functions are relevant to infectious disease control because the process of communicable disease control requires the capacity to collect and process local epidemiological data allied with informative local advocacy. Historically, local health departments played an immense role in data collection and policy formation that led to reforms such as the public financing of a sewer construction, a bully pulpit to promote hand hygiene, or a multi-sectoral consortium to change food production practices (Cutler & Miller, 2005) . Local health departments can often succeed even without a national backing if they are politically astute and equipped with a trusted public health workforce.",

            "text": "In 2012, the UK's Health and Social Care Act (HSCA) moved the responsibility to commission public health services from the National Health Service (NHS) to 'upper tier' ('county council') or 'unitary' ('metropolitan') local authorities. The HSCA gave local authorities a statutory duty to improve their population's health and provided nearly 3 billion pounds in ring-fenced funds to enable them to implement their public health activities (Public Health England, 2015) . These local health authorities received technical support from Public Health England (PHE) through its central office and 9 regional offices. Local authorities were to carry out prescribed and non-prescribed functions and track their own spending. Data suggests local public health expenditure per capita varies widely across UTLAs in England with a coefficient of variation at 36%. Local public health expenditure is separate (ring-fenced) from the NHS budget that pays for healthcare, where NHS spending per capita is relatively equal and delivered according to a standardized formula across the UK. While there are reasons to expect that the geographical variations in local public health spending should be related to the variations in COVID-19 control, in the case of England, there are reasons to doubt the efficacy of the spending. Austerity measures since 2010 have cut local government and social welfare budgets by 40%. Local governments are stressed in addressing social determinants of health with diminished resources. In addition, the prescribed areas of public health spending in the HSCA give local health departments little latitude to spend funds on pandemic preparedness and cross-cutting engagement. As can be seen from the allocations to local public health in Fig. 2 , the largest expenditures are in categorical programs in child health, substance use, and sexual health (Public Health England, 2015) .",

Many of the most successful responses to COVID-19 in East and Southeast Asia were staffed by health departments that had the administrative flexibility to draw public health nurses and sanitarians away from other duties (Tran BX, Hoang MT, Pham HQ, 2020; You, 2020) . The additional capability, reflected in historically higher per capita sending, could and should have enabled a local health department to shift the resources into case detection, tracking, counseling, and communications for behavior change. This would result in a shorter interval between the epidemic's start and its first peak. One may expect that a quicker resolution of the epidemic would translate to a relatively lower peak daily new case per 100,000. Although COVID-19 requires multiple levels of specialized interventions, the existing pre-pandemic public health infrastructure should provide protection against the impact of the pandemic if structured adequately. The duration of time to reach peak incidence is an indicator of a UTLA's ability to respond quickly to control the outbreak of the pandemic. The hypothesis tested in this paper centers on the following precept: local-level public health infrastructure should influence the spread and impact of COVID-19 (Cole & Fielding, 2007; Middleton, 2017) .",

The dependent variable itself is harder to define as the pandemic seemed to have been peaking by end of 2020 after the first wave. We have examined the possible suggestion that consideration of data after July should be a robust test for our results here; we do not find anything that contradict the results of this paper (see Annex V). by shifts in the age composition of cases as well as rapid improvements in the medical management of cases. Thus, the time to bend a mortality curve is less reflective of the local health department's ability to control cases. 2 Further, while deaths and health impacts of COVID-19 infections is related to comorbidity (Sorci et al., 2020) direct linkages between becoming infected due to comorbidity has not been reported and can be ignored. We note that the incidence of deaths fell after the peak infection rate has been reached. For example, London areas reached their peak by late April 2020 and experienced the second lowest death rates after that having had the highest rate before that date. Thus, persistence of infections induced deaths from COVID-19.",

Further, during spring and summer of 2020, England had the longest period of excess mortality of these countries after the onset of COVID-19 (Campbell and Morgan, 2020) . Duration of the epidemic is a likely factor in excess mortality. By 24 April 2020, the COVID-19 death rate per 100,000 was shown to be higher in local areas with larger Black or Asian populations and worse levels of self-reported health in England (S\u00e1, 2020) . In other countries also, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic reflects prevailing socio-economic conditions (Borjas, 2020) . Marmot et al. (2020) examine COVID-19 mortality related to deprivation in areas of England. A focus on England is important due to the high level of excess mortality; and explaining aspects of how the spread of COVID-19 occurred through socio-economic factors is a natural question. Studies have examined the relation between the outbreak and health systems factors using cross-country data. Studies used varied geographical units: Allel et al. (2020) and Khan et al. (2020) use cross-country data from all regions of the world while Blondel, S. and Vranceanu, (2020) and Kapitsinis (2020) use data only from European countries or regions of a few European countries. The dependent variables used are deaths/100,000 (Kapitsinis, 2020) , case fatality rate (Blondel & Vranceanu, 2020; Khan et al., 2020) and infection rate 5, 10, and 15 days after detecting the first case (Allel et al. 2020) . Results show that the COVID-19 situation improved with some features of the health systems and measures taken to tackle the outbreaks across region/countries. Improved situation was not related to health expenditure measures (Blondel & Vranceanu, 2020; Khan et al. 2020) ; additionally, Kapitsinis (2020) concludes that lockdown measures may have been less effective due to deterioration of health systems in Europe over the recent years.",

The period between 1 and 10 cases may be long; however, never reaching 10 cases would make COVID a non-existent problem in the region in the period under consideration. Starting from a lower or higher number of cases does not change the results in the paper. We then used the smoothed time series of cases to compute daily incidence rates per 100,000 people (See Annex I). The peak is defined as the point where slope of the incidence curve is 0 signaling the rising incidence rate is followed by a declining incidence rate. A lower number of days to peak and reaching the peak does not mean that the pandemic is over, rather that it has been controlled. The peak did not remain flat for any of the UTLAs for a sustained period, so we are able to define the time to reach the peak clearly in all ULTAs except Oxfordshire (see Annex I).",

We examined policy impact in cases only when a welfare improving policy would significantly reduce the COVID-19 impact. For example, if analysis suggested improving housing prices increased the number of days to reach peak, then this factor was not adjusted in the simulation exercise. As many of the explanatory covariates may be correlated, we estimated the marginal contribution of each of the five clusters of factors toward the explained variation in the data. We examine the percentage of contribution to the R-square in the OLS model from each of the clusters. We use a Shapley decomposition method where the marginal contribution to the R-Square of each cluster is averaged over every permutated regression estimation using the five clusters (Lipovetsky & Conklin, 2001) .

The slowest group also were less densely populated; and half of the London area UTLAs were among the fastest.

These UTLAs required nearly 40 percent more days to peak in comparison to the average UTLA falling within the lowest quartile level of expenditure (TR 1.38, p < 0.01). The result is unexpected, we expected time to peak to be lower with higher public health expenditure. However, the effects of public health spending on duration to peak become statistically insignificant for all 3 quartiles with the inclusion of measures of SES and other factors (models 2-5). Though insignificant, the direction of the coefficients for Quartiles 3 and 4 of local public health expenditure is in the hypothesized direction. One important policy factor to note is that the log of overall local expenditure per capita is significant; thus, higher overall local-level spending decreases the time to peak by as much as 50% in the full model (TR = 0.472, p < 0.01).",

Additionally, higher population density (TR 0.82, p < 0.001) and a higher proportion of residents over the age of 65 years decreased the time to reach peak incidence for a UTLA, whereas the proportion of residents under age 18 had no significant impact on time to reach peak incidence. We do not observe any impact from health indicators used. The instability of some of the factors indicate correlations among the factors; our intuition of introducing them as clusters seem logical.

We mostly draw attention to the signs and significance of the coefficients in the OLS model. In the full OLS model a departure for the model corresponding to the one in Table 2 is that the public health expenditure contributes to lowering number of days to peak although is still insignificant. The level of overall local expenditure is significant at 0.05 level, consistent with Table 2 . Higher population density lowers days to reach peak contrary to expectation. The indicators for ill health did not affect days to reach peak. 4 The results from Tables 1-3 are consistent. The overall expenditure and the health expenditure variables are correlated at 0.698 level; and used separately (with all non-expenditure variables in place). The effect of the overall expenditure variable is stronger while both are significant (see Annex V). The impact of overall expenditure is twice as large and more strongly statistically significant. The interaction suggests the greater importance of non-health system expenditure while one would have suspected that health system factors would play a stronger role, and perhaps even the only role.",

This result can be questioned on epidemiological grounds because ordinarily population density increases human contact frequency and exacerbates the spread of infectious disease. We explored this as best as we can. Taking the linear model, we see that the coefficients for this variable move away from zero with additional variables contributing marginally toward the R-square value (Table 3 models [3] [4] [5] . This is possible if the age variables (in the tail of the age distribution) and ill health variables in less dense areas contribute to increasing the days to reach peak. However, we should not rule out omitted variable bias and that the density variable over-reports an impact due to its correlation with unobservable factors (Oster, 2019) . The linear models helped us identify how much of the variation has been explained in this simple model; 62.3% of the variation has been explained by Model 3. Use of Shapley decomposition method for R-Square (Lipovetsky & Conklin, 2001 ) reveals marginal contribution of each of the clustered covariates to explaining the variations in days to reach the peak: Expenditure at 19.5%, SES factors at 25%, population density along with London factor at 38%, demographic factors at 13% and health factors at 4.5%.

Regions with low income growth rate also have lower population density and lower housing price (House Pricing-Nat'l Statistics, 2020). The richer London areas managed a fast progression to bending the COVID-19 curve, while many of the regions in the north of England, poorer and less dense, experienced lengthier time to reach the peak. It is possible that public policy may have been more effective in denser areas or the population more effectively social distanced. Density may not always reflect the mass action (S x I) component in the SIR model, because viral exposure depends on behaviors that create proximity of less than 2 m of distance. The correlation between dense areas and income is positive. Congruent with Marmot's hypotheses regarding social determinants we note that the duration for a UTLA to achieve a bend in the infection level of COVID-19 is affected by the availability of non-health factors that enrich lives: public goods and amenities, and higher income. Bending an outbreak curve to supress chains of infection during an infectious outbreak has been a fundamental role of public health departments. While one would expect a correlation between past investments in staff and capability from public health expenditure and quicker control of an outbreak we found that there is no statistically significant evidence that public health expenditure played a role when confounders are considered in our setting. Although public health expenditure is rather low at 63 GBP per 1000 people on average, with a farily high variance its inclusion is highly justified. The failure of local public health expenditure to have a detectable effect may have been due to insufficient power to detect what may have been a small effect. That still begs the question, why would local health department resources, devoted to protecting the population from disease have a small effect? Fig. 2 might offer insight, because it shows that local public health departments' budgetary allocations were not aligned ex ante with tasks related to rapid control of a contagious epidemic. It is common for staff in a public health department to become compartmentalized and super specialized in their various missions of children's health, substance misuse, and sexual health. Fig. 2 shows that only 1% of local public health departments budgets were allocated to the cross-cutting area of health protection. This implies that many local health departments may have no full-time staff person assigned to cross-cutting health protection. Prior investments in community engagement and multi-sectoral coordination with schools, law-enforcement, transport, and commerce may have only occurred in the context of a compartmentalized public health unit assigned to substance use, or children' health, etc. However, being properly prepared for emerging health threats would require local public health departments to have standing relationships that could be leveraged to address a new problem like COVID-19.",

This may swing the pendulum away from compartmentalized programs to address non-communicable disease to compartmentalized programs to address communicable disease and biosecurity.

The low level of expenditure may have reduced the effect size making it too small to detect given the sample of 136 jurisdictions. Second, we may ask whether the multiple specifications of explanatory factors were correct although models had a reasonably high R-square. It is possible that a better variable for ill health prior to the epidemic would have improved the models; we did not find any useful one.

We have not provided causal mechanisms or pathways through which median income, housing or general local public expenditure affected days to reach the peak. Such pathways have been provided as supplemental explanations regarding persistent associations between gradients in health outcomes and those observed for socio-economic conditions (Braveman & Gottlieb, 2014) . It is, of course, a topic for policy debates as to how social policies can effectively contribute to improving population health; in the literature the range of policy factors examined are wide, from ones that are obvious to ones that seem very indirect: improving the health system, environmental conditions, and growth rate of average income to ensuring political freedom (Varbanova & Beutels, 2020) . A modest interpretation of our findings would be that local expenditure can reduce the days to reach the peak incidence of a novel epidemic (Fig. 4) . Perhaps factors associated with higher expenditure, such as being able to work from home, confounded this finding, even though we controlled for the median income of a UTLA. The contribution here should be seen as initial exploration into the association of regional socio-economic factors and the duration to achieving control of an epidemic of COVID-19.",

For example, when 2 of 3 variables are used with K = 3, 6 marginal values are obtained. The marginal contributions add up to the total R-Square. We illustrate with three covariates used in the text: log of per-capita health expenditure (SPENDING), log median income (INCOME) and population density per square mile (DENSITY) which will be used to explain days to reach peak in the local area. There are seven regressions, from which we obtain 7 R-Squares. There is likely to be some multicollinearity, the approach shows a clearer contribution to the explained variations of these two variables.",

Model 2 in Annex 5, Table 1 shows that public health expenditure by itself reduces days to reach peak; however, Model 3 shows that local overall expenditure has a larger impact. Model 3 has an R-Square equaling the Model 1 results below. Comparison of results across Models 1 to 3 shows that public health expenditure contributes little to reduce the days to peak is supported.",

By July as there was a period where incidence rates were low, one could ask how the public sector shaped to reduce the infection rate. As noted in the paper there were changes made to Public Health Expenditure during the first wave. Thus, our main independent variable of interest, local public health expenditure, should not be a factor in determining the local outbreak trajectories after the first wave. Nonetheless, we test to see how the trajectory of the pandemic might have been affected by the factors we had chosen in explaining the days to reach peak during the first wave.",

When incidence for start of the outbreak from 10 cases is considered the average number of days to reach peak for the UTLAs is 322 with coefficient of variation to be a low of 7.8%. Annex V, Table 2 presents the results. The dependent variable is log of days to reach peak from 30 January to March of 2021. We find that local health expenditure does impact days to reach peak at a p-value < 0.10 level.
