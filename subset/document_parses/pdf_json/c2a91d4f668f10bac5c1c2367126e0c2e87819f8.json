A D-dimer concentration of > 0.5 mg/L on admission was significantly associated with 30 day mortality, and a D-dimer concentration of > 5 mg/L was found in a much higher proportion of nonsurvivors than survivors. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scoring systems were dichotomised as < 4 or \u2265 4 and < 5 or \u2265 5, respectively, and the mortality rate was significantly different between the two stratifications in both scoring systems. Enoxaparin was administered to 68 (37.78 %) patients for thromboembolic prophylaxis, and stratification by the D-dimer concentration and DIC score confirmed lower mortality in patients who received enoxaparin when the D-dimer concentration was > 2 than < 2 mg/L or DIC score was \u2265 5 than < 5. A low platelet count and low serum calcium concentration were also related to mortality.",

Critically ill patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) in the intensive care unit (ICU) account for the majority of deaths. Reports from Wuhan, China revealed increased D-dimer concentrations in 26-36 % of patients requiring ICU admission, and 71.4 % of non-survivors developed overt DIC [1] [2] [3] . Reports have suggested that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is higher in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 than in patients in the wards and historically reported incidence rates of VTE in the ICU [4] . Anticoagulant treatment and outcomes are closely related to the SIC score and D-dimer concentration; therefore, the SIC criteria established by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) is often used to guide anticoagulant therapy [5, 6] . In an analysis of patients with severe COVID-19 from Tang, stratification by the SIC score revealed lower mortality in patients treated with prophylactic doses of heparin [2] . Many centres support increased prophylactic doses of anticoagulants for ICU patients because of the increased incidence of thrombotic complications despite the use of systematic thrombosis prophylaxis [7] . Therefore, coagulopathy management including monitoring of coagulation changes, thromboembolic prophylaxis, and anticoagulant treatment is becoming increasingly more important, and coagulopathy guidelines are needed to optimise specific therapy and reduce mortality.",

These coagulation abnormalities were not related to mortality. A decreased platelet count, which is reportedly relatively uncommon at the initial presentation of patients with COVID-19, was associated with non-survival in the present study. Forty-seven (26.11 %) patients with a platelet count of < 150 \u00d7 10 9 /L on admission to the ICU had higher mortality. The D-dimer concentration was higher than that shown in many previous studies [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 11] , and 154 (85.56 %) The D-dimer concentration was stratified into four levels as shown in Table 3 , and a D-dimer concentration of > 0.5 mg/L on admission was significantly associated with 30 day mortality. A D-dimer concentration of > 5 mg/L was found in 62 (34.44 %) patients, and 43 (69.35 %) of them were non-survivors. The concentration of FDP, another hyperfibrinolysis-associated parameter, was elevated in 55 (61.80 %) non-survivors, which was a significantly higher proportion than survivors. To study the association between coagulation disorders and disease development, we compared parameters on the day of ICU admission versus the day of ICU discharge or death. Among 89 non-survivors, the D-dimer concentration was increased and the platelet count and antithrombin concentration were decreased significantly. In contrast, the platelet count had recovered and the fibrinogen concentration was decreased in 91 survivors on the day of ICU discharge or end of data collection compared with the day of ICU admission ( Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "Critical illness is the main contributor to the mortality of COVID-19. This retrospective study focused on patients with severe COVID-19 in the ICU with regard to coagulation abnormalities that may contribute to higher mortality than in ward patients. Unlike severely ill patients with sepsis, patients with COVID-19 rarely present with prolongation of the PT or aPTT, although a slightly prolonged PT has been reported in patients with severe disease [1, 2, 7, 12 ]. An elevated D-dimer concentration is widely accepted as a specific coagulation abnormality in patients with COVID-19. A rising D-dimer concentration suggests a hypercoagulable state and microthrombus formation, and increased rates of VTE have been reported in ICU patients with COVID-19 [11] . However, an elevated D-dimer concentration was not associated with VTE in this study. We hypothesised that a rising D-dimer concentration can result from limited microthrombosis before VTE formation. The lack of VTE screening for all patients might also explain the lack of relevance of the D-dimer concentration in the present study. The D-dimer concentrations in non-survivors continued to increase as the disease developed. A D-dimer concentration of > 0.5 mg/L on admission was significantly associated with mortality, and a higher proportion of non-survivors than survivors had a D-dimer concentration of > 5 mg/L. A dramatically increased D-dimer concentration (> 5 mg/L) may be due to overt DIC, which seems to be less common in patients with severe COVID-19 than in patients with other infections, although the mortality rate reached > 90 %. The concentration of FDP, another parameter associated with hyperfibrinolysis, was also elevated in non-survivors; this is consistent with the increased D-dimer concentration. The roles of the ISTH SIC and CDSS DIC scoring systems in predicting mortality of patients with COVID-19 were evaluated. Mortality increased as the SIC and DIC scores increased, especially when the SIC score reached \u2265 4 and the DIC score The SIC and DIC scores were significantly higher in non-survivors on the day of death than on the day of admission to the intensive care unit (p = 0.000). d The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with an SIC score of \u2265 4 than in those with an SIC score of < 4 (p = 0.002). e The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with a DIC score of \u2265 5 than in those with a DIC score of < 5 (p = 0.000). SIC, sepsis-induced coagulopathy; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation Zheng et al. Exp Hematol Oncol (2021) 10:6 reached \u2265 5. Because both scoring systems were positively correlated with the mortality rate, further studies of larger populations are needed to determine which score can more sensitively predict mortality. The incidence of VTE was high in patients who underwent VTE screening but was low in all 180 patients with severe disease in this study. If VTE screening had been applied, the incidence could have been even higher. VTE management in patients with COVID-19 is important, and whether VTE prophylaxis should be used remains controversial. Reports indicate that VTE prophylaxis should be considered in all patients who require hospital admission, but survival advantages have only been found in patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for SIC. Stratification by the SIC score revealed lower mortality in patients treated with heparin when the SIC score was > 4. However, anticoagulant treatment in patients with a D-dimer concentration of \u2264 1 mg/L has potential risk [5, 6, 13] . In the present study, enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis was given to 68 (37.78 %) patients, and no difference in 30 day mortality was seen between patients with and without enoxaparin treatment. Nevertheless, stratification by the D-dimer concentration and DIC score confirmed lower mortality in patients treated with enoxaparin when the D-dimer concentration was > 2 than < 2 mg/L or when the DIC score was \u2265 5 than < 5. Our results suggested that VTE prophylaxis should be given to selected patients with a D-dimer concentration of > 2 mg/L or DIC score of \u2265 5. These results should be regarded with some degree of caution due to limitations associated with the study including lack of VTE screening for all patients by doppler ultrasound or by further Fig. 3 Thirty-day survival rates and associated risk factors, including increased D-dimer and FDP concentrations, platelet count of \u2264 150 \u00d7 10 9 /L, SIC score of \u2265 4, DIC score of \u2265 5 and overt DIC. The 30 day survival rate was significant after patients with severe coagulopathy were selected as follows: patients with a DIC score of \u2265 5 (p = 0.022), D-dimer concentration of > 2 mg/L (p = 0.045), or confirmed overt DIC (p = 0.043). FDP, fibrin degradation products; PLT, platelet count; SIC, sepsis-induced coagulopathy; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; VTE, venous thromboembolism Page 10 of 11 Zheng et al. Exp Hematol Oncol (2021) 10:6 tests such as von Willebrand Factor (vWF). The incidence of VTE might be higher and the association between VTE and the mortality of severe COVID-19 disease might be positive if VTE screening was performed for all patients in ICU. vWF levels is another parameter to predict VTE and might help making VTE prophylaxis earlier and more precise. COVID-19 may predispose to not only venous but also arterial thromboembolic disease because of the effects of comprehensive factors including excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis [7, 14] . Platelet is the initiating factor in arterial thrombosis; however, thrombocytopenia is reportedly more common in patients with severe COVID-19 [2, 3, 13, 15, 16] . Thrombocytopenia is attributed to abnormal hemostasis and DIC, and is associated with severe disease manifestation and increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 [15] . Thrombocytopenia was also proven to be a predictor of mortality in the present study. No patients in our study died of haemorrhage; instead, most patients who underwent ultrasonography were confirmed to have VTE. Therefore, platelet activation might occur in association with COVID-19.",

Therefore, hypocalcaemia might be a predictor of severe disease. Whether hypocalcaemia impacts the cascade pathways of coagulation requires further study.
