Common adverse events (AEs) from ATRA include headaches, rashes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, transaminitis, and less commonly, pseudotumor cerebri and pancreatitis. Potentially severe but treatable complications include hyperleukocytosis and differentiation syndrome. 1 Common side effects of ATO include nausea, vomiting, and mild diarrhea. More serious ATO toxicities include cardiac AEs, such as QTc prolongation or arrhythmias, neurologic AEs, such as peripheral neuropathy, varicella-zoster reactivation, risk of secondary malignancies, and rarely pancreatitis. 3, 4 While severe diarrhea is a known presenting side effect of acute arsenic poisoning from environmental exposure, 5 to our knowledge, profuse watery diarrhea has not been described in APL patients receiving ATO at treatment doses. Here, we report a patient with low-risk APL treated with standard-dose ATRA and ATO, whose treatment course was complicated by 3-6 liter large-volume diarrhea and pancreatitis. She was found to have a high urine concentration of inorganic arsenic. Symptoms resolved promptly with therapy discontinuation, suggestive of acute ATO toxicity.",

            "text": "Arsenic trioxide is quickly cleared from the plasma and distributed predominately to the liver, kidney, muscle, and skin. 5 Most ingested inorganic arsenic is hepatically metabolized through oxidative methylation, creating monomethylarsinic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), reaching maximum serum levels between 16-24 and 24-48 hours, with a half-life of 32 and 72 hours, respectively. Inorganic arsenic along with MMA and DMA are eliminated in the urine. 3 Since there are other forms of arsenic and several metabolites of varying toxicities, including relatively nontoxic forms from fish and other foods (arsenobetaine, arseno sugars), speciation of urine arsenic samples is recommended where possible rather than measurement of total urine arsenic alone. Variations in susceptibility to ATO toxicity and the rate of ATO metabolism have been observed between populations, which may be due to polymorphisms of multiple methylation genes 7 and differences in gut microbiome. 8 Within the context of APL therapy, underlying comorbidities may also potentially contribute to an increased risk of ATO toxicity. In one retrospective study of low-to-intermediate risk APL patients receiving ATO, obese patients with a BMI >/= 35 kg/m 2 were found to have a higher rate of dose holding or modifications due to AEs compared to patients with BMI <35 kg/m 2 , 9 highlighting the need for additional studies of dosing in this population since ATO is currently dosed based on ABW. In addition, patients with mild to severe acute kidney injury (AKI) have demonstrated decreased urinary excretion of ATO and its metabolites, with 1.4-to eightfold increased exposure after a multidose administration. 10 In the case of our patient, pancreatitis and profuse largevolume diarrhea were two serious complications encountered approximately 4 weeks after the initiation of ATRA and ATO. The patient's urine arsenic levels 2 days after cessation of treatment were much higher than the detectable limit, and in a range reported in individuals with arsenic poisoning. Since monitoring of serum or urine arsenic levels is not currently routinely performed during APL therapy, levels are difficult to interpret given the lack of data on expected levels during therapy. However, our comprehensive workup along with the brisk clinical recovery after stopping ATO suggests that ATO toxicity led to the severe diarrhea. Potential contributing factors may have been underlying obesity and AKI during her induction course ( Figure 1B ). This case highlights the need to be vigilant for acute ATO toxicity in APL patients with potential predisposing comorbidities including obesity and renal impairment. Additional studies evaluating dosing in patients with comorbidities and evaluating the utility of urine arsenic monitoring in patients experiencing toxicities may be helpful to guide potential dose reduction strategies for toxicity mitigation.",
