These studies demonstrated no significant association between tumour growth rate and any change in tumour stage, nor its potential impact on treatment planning and prognosis. However, the majority of studies used barium enemas to assess tumour diameter and volume through measurement of filling defects, and were therefore limited in terms of accurate measurement of volume. Findings were also limited in terms of reproducibility owing to observed inaccuracies in tumour dimension measurements in altered views used during initial and follow-up investigations. These studies did, however, highlight that tumour growth rate may be dependent on primary tumour location and that tumour growth rate appears to be linear 20, 22, 23 . Colorectal cancer cell type heterogeneity, and differences in genetic mutations, epigenetic regulation and the microenvironment in which tumours reside mean that predicting tumour behaviour, independent of sample size, is difficult 38 .

Inferring tumour growth rates from the observation of tumour volumes at two time points has been documented previously, but there is currently no consensus regarding the growth patterns exhibited by solid tumours or how they can be measured. The calculations applied here are based on the assumption that colorectal tumours follow a linear growth pattern, a characteristic that has yet to be established but is in line with current limited evidence (Table S1, supporting information) 47, 48 .",
