This change in fruit marketing has led supply to sharply increase, which is linked not only with the availability of off-season fruits, but also with the possibility of choosing among a wider range of varieties [1] [2] [3] [4] . Moreover, in the last few decades, production systems that respect the environment and health (organic, bio, etc.) have been implemented, and the production method is now another factor that broadens consumer choice options [5, 6] . In light of such an offer, information about the fruit provided to consumers at points of sale has become a key factor for their purchase decisions [7] .",

It is important to clarify that the fact that the participants who declared not receiving specific information does not necessarily imply that it was left as not provided. Perhaps a certain number of responses in this regard came from people who received information, but did not assimilate it. These cases form part of the information gap concept, as it is assumed that the information which consumers stated they are interested in could not be processed and used because it was not properly conveyed. However, to gain a clearer view about this, while this study was underway, we visited 10 supermarkets to detect first-hand the non-mandatory labels that are habitually included on fruit packaging. The obtained results are discussed together with consumer data. As seen in the right column of Table 1 , when the packaged-fruit consumers were asked to indicate all the labels that they would like to be provided with on packaging, fruit origin information (including country of origin and production area labels) and production method were the labels that they found most interesting. This result falls in line with Gao et al., 2014 [6] , who reported that not only physical attributes, but also these two credence attributes (fruit origin and production method), strongly impacted consumer fresh fruit choices, which were closely related to consumer fruit quality perceptions. Moreover, the marked consumer interest in knowing the fruit production area herein detected falls in line with previous research works that have reported production area to be a decisive factor for purchase decision making. A growing popularity of locally produced food has been reported [42] , and several drivers of consumers' local food choices have been identified: Benefits beyond self-interest with advantages for society, environmental and sustainable food policy development [43] ; intrinsic product quality; local support and provenance [44] .",

Therefore, it is likely that consumer choice of loose fruit is related to increasing environmental concerns, as loose fruit offers the advantage of reducing plastic overuse. However, in a recent review, White and Lockyer (2020) [11] highlighted the need to consider the potential increase in food waste that would be associated with a drastic removal of plastic packaging from fruit and vegetables. According to these authors, food waste linked with plastic package removal for fresh fruit and vegetables is likely to have an even stronger environmental impact than producing and disposing of plastic. However, use of packaging is not always justified. For example, packaging is needed to extend the postharvest life of very susceptible fruit to mechanical damage and spoilage, like small berries [52, 53] , but can be avoided with other not so fragile fruit. Oranges, pomegranates, or bananas are good examples of fruit whose packaging step can be eliminated, which would have no marked effect on shelf life.",

Moreover, there are different purchase situations in which previous experience may not exist, when buying fruit for the first time in a new market, and also in a specific market because distributors may change throughout the season depending on the supply/demand.

QR codes allow consumers easy access, by means of smartphones, to information about the item to which it is attached. These optical labels have a greater storage capacity compared to standard barcodes. This means that QR codes are interesting tools to provide consumers with information that is apparently not so relevant for them, while maintaining on packaging those labels that are more decisive for purchase decisions.

Sensory labels are categorized into 'comparative' and 'non comparative' labels [62] . Comparative claims compare similarities and differences between two products or more (different brands or formulations/recipes in the same brand). Non-comparative labels convey something specific about a single product in terms of its characteristics or performance. While objective Foods 2021, 10, 72 9 of 14 attributes like 'very sweet' are relatively easy to substantiate, more subjective characteristics of product or product experience like 'delightful fruit flavor' or 'natural taste' are more difficult to substantiate. This study focused on identifying those objective attributes that are of particular interest for consumer choice decisions among those that confer the sensory profile of different fruit to obtain an appropriate sensory label design. Figure 2 represents, for the main different fruit types, the percentage of consumers who wish to receive information about the different sensory attributes associated with this foodstuff type. The results showed that there were two especially relevant sensory attributes as consumers wished to receive information about them regardless of fruit type. These two attributes were related to flavor, specifically sweetness level and taste intensity, which were chosen in all cases by 50-80% of the participants (Figure 2A-F) . Of these, sweetness seemed the most relevant characteristic for consumers to know because it was chosen by more than 60% of the participants irrespectively of fruit type. As can be observed in Figure 2B ,E, the attributes associated with texture properties were also important for consumers who were especially interested in receiving information about juiciness and firmness of pome and stone fruit. Juiciness was also relevant for citrus fruit, and to a lesser extent for melons/watermelons. Firmness was also pointed out as a main kiwi attribute ( Figure 2C ). Consumer information needs related to texture characteristics are clearly linked with the relevance that these attributes have for the sensory acceptance of such fruit [4, 35, 36, 62, 65, 68] .",

In such studies, consumer preferences and purchase intentions after tasting fruit were related to fruit sensory properties, and in such a way that the attributes which acted as drivers of liking were identified. Thus, sweetness has been reported to be a driver of liking for pome fruit, such as apples and pears [35, 63] , stone fruit like nectarines and peaches [36, 64] , or kiwis [65] , mandarins [4, 66] , bananas [67] , and melons [68] .",

However, it is important to bear in mind that during the shelf-life period and home storage, fruit may undergo metabolic changes that lead to sensory modification in relation to harvest time [72] . Thus, the sensory information customers are provided with should be linked mainly with characteristics intrinsic to variety. In this way, in a pre-purchase situation, consumers would be able to know if a specific variety matches their preferences. Moreover, providing information about sensory attributes linked with fruit maturity may be of special interest for non-climacteric fruit whose maturity barely evolves after harvest [72] . For example, the acidity level of citrus fruit markedly lowers from the beginning to the end of the harvesting season [73] , which is more significant than the slight changes that may occur during shelf life [57] .

'Harvest date', 'production method', 'percentage of the price received by farmers', 'postharvest treatments', 'sensory properties', and 'environmental information' were identified as the major information gaps and, therefore, the industry should make efforts to provide this information or make it clearer than it currently is. For a correct design of sensory labels, they should include information on 'sweetness' and 'flavor intensity' irrespectively of fruit type. 'Sourness' and 'juiciness' levels must be included on citrus fruit labels, while 'sourness' and 'firmness' are relevant for kiwis. Information on texture properties must be provided to help consumers choose pome and stone fruit. Other attributes, such as easiness to peel, are important only for citrus fruit.",
