However, despite existing FL algorithms only allow the supervised training setting, most hospitals in realistic usually cannot afford the intricate data labeling due to absence of budget or expertise. This paper studies a practical yet challenging FL problem, named Federated Semi-supervised Learning (FSSL), which aims to learn a federated model by jointly utilizing the data from both labeled and unlabeled clients (i.e., hospitals). We present a novel approach for this problem, which improves over traditional consistency regularization mechanism with a new inter-client relation matching scheme. The proposed learning scheme explicitly connects the learning across labeled and unlabeled clients by aligning their extracted disease relationships, thereby mitigating the deficiency of task knowledge at unlabeled clients and promoting discriminative information from unlabeled samples. We validate our method on two large-scale medical image classification datasets. The effectiveness of our method has been demonstrated with the clear improvements over state-of-the-arts as well as the thorough ablation analysis on both tasks 4 .",

            "text": "To this end, we study a practical FL problem which involves only several labeled clients while most of the participanting clients are unlabeled, namely federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL). This is also noted by Yang et al. [30] very recently in COVID-19 lesion segmentation, which halts in an extremely simple case containing only one labeled and one unlabeled client. In contrast to their work, we for the first time broaden this problem to a more practical yet complex scenario in which multiple distributed labeled and unlabeled clients are involved. To address this problem, a naive solution is to simply integrate the off-the-rack semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods onto the federated learning paradigm. However, previous SSL methods are typically designed for centralized training setting [2, 10, 17, 29] , which rely heavily on the assumption that the labeled data is accessible to provide necessary assistance for the learning from unlabeled data [1, 4] . In consistency-based methods [5, 31] , for instance, the regularization of perturbation-invariant model predictions needs the synchronous labeled data supervision, in order to obtain the necessary task knowledge to produce reliable model predictions for unlabeled data where the consistency regularization is imposed on. Unfortunately, such close assistance from labeled data is lost in FSSL scenario, where the local dataset could be completely unlabeled. This will make the local model aloof from original task as the consistency-based training goes on, hence fail to fully exploit the knowledge at unlabeled clients.",

In this work, our insight is to communicate their knowledge inherent in disease relationships to achieve this goal. The idea is motivated by an observation that the relationships exist naturally among different categories of disease and reflect the structural task knowledge in the context of medical image classification, as evidenced by disease similarity measure [18, 20] . More importantly, such disease relationships are independent of the observed hospitals, i.e., similar disease at one hospital should also be high-related at others. We may consider extracting such client-invariant disease relation information from labeled clients to supervise the learning at unlabeled clients, thereby mitigating the loss of task knowledge at unlabeled clients and effectively exploiting the unlabeled samples.",

            "text": "We present a new FSSL framework, which to our knowledge is the first method incorporating unlabeled clients to improve FL models for medical image classification. To address the deficiency of consistency regularization in FSSL, our method includes a novel inter-client relation matching scheme to explicitly utilize the knowledge of labeled clients to assist the learning at unlabeled clients. Experiments on two large-scare datasets demonstrate the effectiveness. Our method is extendable to non-IID scenario in FSSL setting, as the employed disease relations are independent of the observed clients and unaffected by image distributions.",
