In this context, we appreciate all efforts to deal with the pandemic and minimise its burden. However, the main goal of systematic reviews cannot be forgotten: to find effect sizes as precisely as possible without bias, accounting for the risk of bias in study design (i.e. excluding studies that may bias the results) and the use of appropriate analytical tools. This paper caught our attention for several reasons.",

This issue has been studied and the current recommendation is to use non-linear imputation of Pa o2 :FiO 2 ratios from SpO 2 :FiO 2 ratios. 2 This very important issue makes study results questionable and probably invalidates their primary outcome assessment.",

For non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI), the Cochrane Handbook recommends extracting adjusted data and subsequently pooling the results. 3 Miguel Hernan furthers this concept stating that, although sample size may not be the most important issue, adequately designed and analysed observational studies (i.e. studies addressing confounding and other methodological issues such as immortal time bias) are quite important for evidence synthesis. 4 For example, our study, 5 which represents one of the highest weights in the meta-analysis of this outcome among the NRSI, presented both unadjusted and adjusted results. Although in the unadjusted analysis the hazard ratio was 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78e1.88), in our adjusted analysis for relevant characteristics the hazard ratio was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.55e1.49), with modifying the direction of the point estimate as a result of confounding by indication accounted for at least partially.",

The estimates will be inherently biased, thus making it questionable to meta-analyse the data of clinical trials along with observational studies. To tackle this issue and as an example, we have reanalysed the secondary outcome of tracheal intubation rate, including only studies that dealt with confounding, at least to some extent. 5e8 We extracted the adjusted hazard ratios with their respective CIs from nonrandomised studies and extracted the same data from the clinical trial. 9 We performed a random effects meta-analysis using the HartungeKnappeSidikeJonkman method to avoid overly optimistic results. Our results are presented in Fig. 1 . The first finding is that all studies had point estimates either favouring awake prone positioning or neutral. The corresponding heterogeneity was much lower (I 2 \u00bc21%) than that presented in Fazzini and colleagues' 1 Figure 3 (I 2 \u00bc75%). This is expected, because the large observed heterogeneity can be explained by the inclusion of unadjusted (i.e. confounded) analyses in the results.",

These results suggest that awake prone positioning, when it comes to the outcome of intubation, should be at least suggested in clinical practice per the GRADE approach. 10 This recommendation cannot be strong (recommend statement) because of some impreciseness and because of indirectness (gathering data from observational studies in the absence of more randomised clinical trials). The exercise we did with intubation hazard can also be done with the metaanalysis presented for mortality (Fig. 4 of Fazzini and colleagues 1 ), in which unadjusted (and therefore biased) analyses were done, coming to biased and potentially wrong conclusions.",

Adequate selection of studies, thorough risk of bias assessment, adequate extraction of data, and finally proper analysis are of utmost importance to draw unbiased inferences as precisely as possible. With proper methodology, our conclusions are different from the authors' conclusion. Pending the publication of further trials (the COVI-PRONE trial), which will increase sample size and therefore provide more precise effect estimates, awake prone positioning could at least be suggested (weak recommendation) as a strategy to avoid tracheal intubation for adult patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure who are not in imminent need of invasive mechanical ventilation.",
