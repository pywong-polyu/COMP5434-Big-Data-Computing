Data for 1990-2012 are reclassified to fit the information sector conceptual framework from prior studies. The analyses examine sector economic value added, share of workers, share of the wage bill, and productivity ratios. These countries' information sectors are compared with those of the United States and South Korea. Novel results include the counterintuitive indication that Denmark's sector differs from Sweden's, with the latter's being closer to South Korea's. The information sector dominates both economies, although Sweden's seems more productive than Denmark's. Saunders, 2010; Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014; Frey and Osborne, 2017) .",

Accordingly, there is a need to understand the composition and dynamics of a country's economy in terms of the size, structure, and dynamics of its information sector so that new knowledge can be advanced and adequate policies may be designed for successful economic governance. The present study is a macroeconomic investigation of the national information sectors in Denmark and Sweden, focusing on the Internet period, from the 1990s to 2012.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, this has yet to be analyzed, as there are no comprehensive studies of these two nations' information sectors, possibly due to the challenges of the required manual data reclassification. Consequently, this study aims to fill this gap in the literature. The two economies are also partially benchmarked to those of the United States and South Korea.",

            "text": "The national information sector is defined here as resources and activities that generate information-content products (Engelbrecht, 1986a) . As such, the information sector distinguishes itself from the material sector, where resources and activities generate material products in the economy (K\u00e4ssi and Lehdonvirta, 2018; Vasilescu et al., 2020) . Existing studies on several developed economies, such as Australia (Engelbrecht, 1985) , the United States Nath, 1999, 2007; Apte et al., 2008 Apte et al., , 2012 OECD, 1981; Porat, 1977) , and Japan (Komatsuzaki and Tanimisu, 1983; OECD, 1981) show that information activities, workers, products, and the corresponding generated value are an increasingly integral part of the economy. At the same time, studies show that information-intensive operations have several distinctive economic characteristics compared to those of material operations. These distinctions include reduced transaction costs (Benslimane et al., 2005) , decreased or eliminated marginal costs, lower entry barriers, activation of strong network externalities (Varian, 2014) , use of alternative pricing and revenue modes, emergence of novel business models (Amit and Zott, 2001) , disintegration of industrial value chains (Macher et al., 2002) , smaller firm sizes, and new industry structures (Brynjolfsson and Saunders, 2010) . Martin (1996: 69) summarizes the impact as follows: \"Overshadowing traditional factors of production such as land, labor and capital, this information factor increasingly holds the key to growth, output and employment.\" These and other findings highlight the challenges of productivity and employment (Appel, 2016; The information sectors of Denmark and Sweden are analyzed here on three data points: economic value added, share of workers, and share of the wage bill. The economic value added, as a share of a nation's gross domestic product (GDP), is first captured in terms of the primary information sector (PRIS) and the secondary information sector (SIS) for the period 1993 to 2012. The product content-form matrix, which distinguishes between information-goods, information-services, material-goods, and material-services (Apte et al., 2012) , is then used to identify the economic value added (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) , share of workers , and share of wages ( -2012 ( for Denmark and 1993 ( -2012 for Sweden) for the information sectors of the two economies. The focus of the analysis is on the period after the Internet became available to the public and commercial enterprises, that is, in the early 1990s (Leiner et al., 1997) . The main reason for this choice of period is that the adoption and use of the Internet facilitated the further development of various information and communication technologies, such as mobile devices, and subsequently, the development of information intensive activities, products, and new business forms, thus affecting the entire economy and its information sector (Castells, 1996) .",

Approximately 60% of their economies' value added comes from their information sectors, and these are slowly growing. While the two neighboring countries may seem superficially similar, the present analysis also uncovers several differences regarding the structure and evolution of their information sectors, particularly in relation to their productivity. In several aspects, the Swedish information sector more closely resembles the information sector of South Korea than that of Denmark, while Denmark's information sector is closer to that of the United States than to that of Sweden or South Korea. Thus, this study adds to the empirical literature that measures the information sectors of developed economies by offering, for the first time, measurements of the information sectors in the Danish and Swedish economies, respectively. The results may also constitute a unique input to governmental policy designs in relation to everything from material and digital infrastructures and R&D to education, the antitrust regulations of technology firms, and the assessment of economic impacts of a pandemic such as COVID-19.",

            "text": "This section reviews the main studies on information economies and articulates the background of the present investigation. Machlup (1962 Machlup ( , 1981 examined the United States and provided the first comprehensive empirical studies of information economies. One of the key contributions was the separation in an economy of the informational component, such as a film production, from the material component, such as the manufacturing of a chair. Machlup's analysis shows that the information economy accounted for 29% of U.S. gross national product (GNP) in 1958 (Machlup, 1962) . Porat (1977) conducted extensive analysis of the U.S. information economy on behalf of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Aligned with Machlup's intention, Porat aimed to understand the structure and dynamics of the U.S. information economy. However, Porat modified Machlup's conceptualization of an information economy to better fit the structure of the official national income accounting framework (Porat, 1977) because Machlup's approach required a new national accounting framework (Rubin et al., 1986) . A central distinction between the two approaches to the measurement of an information economy is that Porat introduced a distinction between the PRIS and the SIS. The former accounted for outputs produced for an organization's external market (e.g., software), while the latter referred to outputs produced for and consumed within organizations (e.g., the software design provided to the software programming unit). A central insight from these empirical studies was that the U.S. economy was undergoing a transformation from material to information production in a similar manner to its previous transformation from agricultural to material production (Porat, 1977) . Rubin et al. (1986) followed Machlup's methodology and found that the information economy as a share of U.S. GNP increased from 29% in 1958 to 34% in 1980. Apte and Nath (2007) and Apte et al. (2008 Apte et al. ( , 2012 provide the most recent and comprehensive measurements of the U.S. information economy. Their key contribution is the application of Porat's approach to the conception and measurement of an information economy, thereby enabling a comparison with previous assessments and providing time series data through 2007 (Apte et al., 2012) . Their studies constitute the most comprehensive analysis of an information economy to date. Another merit of these studies is the additional conceptualization of an information sector in terms of two product dimensions (Apte et al., 2008) . One is the conventional distinction of a product in terms of its form, with the dichotomy between goods and services. The second dimension distinguishes products in terms of content and the dichotomy between informational and material (i.e., noninformational). The combination of these two dimensions produces a two-by-two conception with four product types: material goods, material services, informational goods, and informational services. Using this two-by-two matrix, Apte and Nath (1999) showed that the information services component was the largest segment of the U.S. economy, accounting for approximately 56% of U.S. GNP in 1997 . Wolff (2006 provided another relatively recent attempt to measure the U.S. information workforce based on decennial U.S. census data for . The analysis reports a growth of information workers from 37% of the workforce in 1950 to 59% in 2000. However, Wolff's conceptualization differs from Machlup's and Porat's in that it works with the assumption of four categories of workers: knowledge producers, data processors, service workers, and goods-processors. The aggregation of the first two represents information workers. This different classification introduces ambiguity regarding service workers, which could include both material service workers (e.g., car washers) and information service workers (e.g., translators). Wolff's study is therefore not fully compatible with the studies of Apte et al. (2008 Apte et al. ( , 2012 . Other attempts to quantify the U.S. information economy (e.g., Bergman, 2005; Cisco, 2000) provide questionable results, as they lack both comprehensiveness and conceptual stability (e.g., well-defined constructs) and use different conceptions of the information sector. Overall, this feature makes them difficult to compare with other studies listed here. There are also studies that measure only a specific aspect of the information economy such as the changing occupational structure caused by the emergence of the information sector (e.g., Kuo and Chen, 1987; Kuo and Low, 2001) . For these reasons, our analysis is based on the Apte and Nath (2007) framework. V. PASHKEVICH, et al. Technological Forecasting & Social Change 162 (2021) 120347 ",

In addition to only offering a snapshot of the respective information sectors since no time series data were included, another key limitation of the study was that only five countries were measured in terms of their information sectors' economic value added, and only two had data for both the PRIS and the SIS. Unfortunately, most studies on the information sectors of countries other than the United States have similar limitations.

An example is when a received invoice is compared to an issued order. Information tasks can either constitute a job conducted by a human actor, such as a secretary, or by a machine, such as an enterprise resource planning system. A job's core tasks can process material, information, or both (Zuboff, 1988) . Jobs that process information include teachers, physicians, therapists, priests, singers, engineers, scientists, secretaries, managers, art directors, marketers, and communicators. Jobs that process material include construction workers, car mechanics, hairdressers, and car washers. However, all jobs include coordination activities that process information, which are then needed to manage the core activities of a job. Accordingly, a car washer processes information when receiving an assignment and when coordinating car washing activities.",

PASHKEVICH, et al. Technological Forecasting & Social Change 162 (2021 incompatible. Although this is a valid criticism, there are now enough studies based on Porat's conceptualization of an information economy, which is also the basis of the present study's framework. The second is the issue of available data. Because national statistical agencies typically collect and categorize data based on an orthodox industrial economic conception, the available data are not suited to directly populating the categories assumed by an information economy. This may also be why Porat's conception of an information economy dominates that of Machlup: The former has a closer fit with the available data than the latter. This feature also motivates the present study's adoption of Porat's approach. Finally, there is the criticism that information economy studies are atheoretical; that is, they lack a firm foundational theory. This is a serious criticism, but there are at least two sides to this issue. First, as the underlying assumption is that the growth of information societies gained momentum in the second half of the 20th century (e.g., Castells, 1996; Webster, 2014) and few studies address the peculiarities of an information economy, it follows that limited theoretical contributions have been made by studies of information economies. More studies are needed to accumulate empirical findings, identify regularities, and thereby give rise to theoretical concepts. The second reflection is that although information economies have emerged recently compared to the industrial age, no information economy exists in a vacuum, isolated from the remaining parts of the economy. Hence, the empirical characterizations of information economies ought to be related to, and integrated into, existing concepts of economic theory, where the latter may require modifications and thereby further development to account for the actual economic and social realities. An example is the suggestion of linking information economies to transaction cost economics (Engelbrecht, 1997) and thereby responding to the observation that \"fundamental principles of economic analysis are not easily applied\" to the production of information and knowledge (Lamberton, 1988: 327) . As the present study's results show, investigating an information economy may unearth economic structures and dynamics that are important to developing an understanding that could not be otherwise identified.",

The results show that while the U.S. PRIS increased considerably, by 13.9 percentage points between 1967 and 2007, its growth between 1992 and 2007 was 6 percentage points, which is close to the growth in the Swedish PRIS over the same period. On the other hand, the U.S. SIS decreased by 1.7 percentage points between 1992 and 2007, which is similar to the decrease in the Danish SIS, as opposed to the increase in the Swedish SIS. A key conclusion is that the U.S. economy has been dominated by its information sector, as it represented approximately 60% of its GNP in 2007. The 2002 U.S. information sector was larger than the 2012 Danish and Swedish information sectors, respectively. However, in contrast to the Danish and Swedish information sectors, the U.S. information sector started to decrease, shrinking by 1.7 percentage points between 2002 and 2007. However, the U.S. information sector did grow at a faster average annual rate of 0.93 percentage points between 1992 and 2007 than the Danish and the Swedish information sectors.

Second, both the Danish and the Swedish information sectors manifested continued growth, while the U.S. information sector seems to have peaked in 1997 and started to shrink in the following years. Third, the PRIS dominates the information sector in Sweden, the United States, and Korea to a greater extent than in Denmark. Fourth, unlike any of the other three information sectors, the Danish PRIS decreased. Finally, Sweden resembles Korea more than Denmark in terms of the information sector. Table 4 presents the Danish and Swedish value added in percentages for the two-by-two decomposition (services-goods versus material-informational) for 1993, 2001, 2005, 2008, and 2012 . The results show that the information sector dominated the Danish value added in 1993, (2021) 120347 with 56.1% more than the material sector. The information services component accounted for more than half of the total economy (54.1%). Information goods, on the other hand, represented the smallest component of the economy, with only 2.0%. In the following two decades, information services grew on average 0.16 percentage points annually, growing by 3.2 percentage points in total to 57.3% in 2012.

For the studied period, the U.S. information sector peaked at 63% in 1997, followed by a slight decrease to 60.2% in 2007. On the other hand, both the Danish and the Swedish information sectors grew, with minor increases and decreases. It is too early to confirm that the U.S. information sector is witnessing a consistent change in the trend from increasing to decreasing, but these data may be an indication of this change. A consequent question is whether there will soon be similar changes in Denmark and Sweden. Second, the U.S. and Danish information services for 2007 and 2008, respectively, were similar in size (54.9% and 55.0%) but different from the Swedish information services (49.6% in 2008). Third, information goods in 2007 were largest in Sweden at 9.6%, followed by the United States (5.3% in 2008) and Denmark (1.5% in 2007) . Overall, these figures show that the structure of the Swedish information sector resembles that of the United States and differs from that of Denmark. Table B2 (Appendix B) presents the Republic of Korea's value added in percentages for the two-by-two decomposition for 1990, 1995, and 2000 . The results show that the information sector increased from 52.0% in 1990 to 59.0% in 2000. Information goods increased from 11.0% to 12.5%, representing an average annual growth of 0.15 percentage points, and information services increased from 41.0% to 46.5%, representing an annual growth of 0.55 percentage points. The insight here is that the overall economy of Korea was dominated during this time by its information sector, which was in turn dominated by its information services component. Both information goods and services grew, but the annual increase of information services was several times higher than that of information goods.",

The available data on Korea start in 1990, which were compared to the 1992 data for the United States and the 1993 data for Denmark and Sweden In total, all four economies were dominated by their information sectors in the studied period. However, in terms of the distribution between information goods and information services, Korea had the largest relative information goods component and the smallest relative information services component. Sweden also followed this pattern, while the U.S. information sector deviated from this pattern, and Denmark differentiated itself with a very small information goods component. Overall, Sweden's information sector was closest to Korea's over the studied period. Porat (1977) developed a conceptual framework for information worker classification, which is adopted here for comparative reasons. The framework divides occupations into three major classes: (i) markets for information, which includes workers whose output or primary activity is an information product; (ii) information for markets, which includes information gatherers and disseminators; and (iii) information infrastructure, which includes workers whose occupations involve operating information machines and technologies to support the previous two activities.

The data show that the share of the bill for information workers in total peaked around 2005 at 52.4% and then decreased to 50.8% in 2012. There may be several reasons for this change, the dominant thesis being that the automation of work tasks eliminated many jobs (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014) .

The first ratio is the share of economic value added for information products per share of the information workforce. The second is the share of the information workforce per share of the wage bill for the information sectors. The third is the share of value added for information products per share of the wage bill for the information sector. As the data for value added, employment, and wages do not pertain to exactly the same years in the three countries, the following year correspondence is assumed. For value added in Denmark and Sweden, 1993 , and in the United States, 1992 . For employment in Denmark, 1990 , in Sweden: 1990 , and in the United States, 1999 , 2007 . For wages in Denmark, 1999 , in Sweden, 2001 , and in the United States, 1999 , 2007 Table 9 presents the ratio of economic value added for information products per shares of information workers' employment. These ratios show that Swedish information goods workers produced much more value added than Danish workers. On the other hand, Danish information service workers initially produced considerably more economic value than their Swedish peers, but the trend then changed, and Swedish information service workers produced nearly as much value added as their Danish peers. U.S. information goods workers produced considerably more value added than information workers in Sweden. For information services only, workers in the three countries produced nearly the same value added, with Denmark producing the most. For both goods and services, the initial imbalance disappears, and the value added per information worker nearly evens out. This observation is conditioned by the fact that the total information workforce was dominated by information service workers, particularly in Denmark and the United States. Table 10 presents the share of wages required per information worker. These ratios show that U.S. information goods workers required a much higher wage bill than their peers in Sweden, who in turn required much more than their peers in Denmark. However, for information service workers, there was no remarkable difference between the three countries. The most notable difference, however, was the wage level demanded by Danish goods workers, which was nearly three times less than Swedish information good workers and five times less than U.S. workers. Table 11 presents the share of wages required to produce economic value added. The ratios show that, in general, there were no major differences between the three countries in terms of the share of wages required to produce economic value added from information products. This is particularly true for information services, while there were some minor differences for information goods. Interestingly, for the third period, the United States had the lowest share of wages per value added for information services and the highest share of wages per value added for information goods. Similarly, a comparison between Denmark and Sweden shows that Swedish value added required a higher share of wages for information goods, while the Danish value added required a higher share of wages for information services.",

A key insight is that both Denmark and Sweden have information economies, as the information sector in each economy accounts for well over half of the country's economic value added. The size of each information sector is similar to one another and to that of the United States. However, while the value added of the U.S. information sector has started to decrease, the information sectors in Denmark and Sweden are slowly increasing. Contrary to the intuition that the two Nordic countries and their economies are similar, this study uncovers a set of structural differences between the two information sectors and shows that the economic value added of the Swedish information sector more closely resembles that of South Korea than that of Denmark or the United States.",

While a detailed industry-level analysis is needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis, there are some indications that this may be the case. One indication comes from the U.S. economy, where there is an association between overall productivity gains and the decrease in the SIS beginning in 1997 (Apte et al., 2008; Wolff, 2006) . Another more general indication comes from the findings that productivity gains are associated with investments in information and communication technologies (Lee et al., 2005; Jorgenson, 2007; Papaioannou and Dimelis, 2007; Wolff, 2006) . Specifically, Engelbrecht (1986b) discusses SIS productivity increase at length in a study of the Japanese information sector. A key message there is that the size of the SIS is a matter of organizational and job design with regard to the conduct of information production, which must differ from the old principles of organization and job design of material production. Indeed, this argument has been supported and further developed by more recent studies (Brynjolfsson and Saunders, 2010) . However, another answer to the question of the size of the SIS may be the share of outsourcing for internal information services (Wolff, 2006) : Do Swedish organizations outsource more than Danish organizations? Further investigation is required to uncover the underlying drivers of the size and evolution of the SIS.",

Regarding the value added, the production of information goods is noticeably greater in Sweden than in Denmark, while information service production is slightly larger in Denmark. Again, this difference shows that the Swedish information sector more closely resembles that of South Korea than that of Denmark or the United States. Overall, the Danish and Swedish economies are information service dominated as these sectors account for more than half of each country's total value added. Unsurprisingly, the information goods-services asymmetry between Denmark and Sweden is also manifested in terms of the share of information workers, with Sweden having more information goods workers and Denmark more information service workers. However, information service workers dominate the entire workforce in both economies. Again, the information goodsservices asymmetry is also revealed in terms of the wage bill share. Danish information service workers receive a larger share of the total wage bill than Swedish information service workers, with the opposite true for information goods workers. However, for all information workers, the share of wages is similar in the two economies. Again, the Danish information sector more closely resembles the U.S. information sector than the Swedish one. When comparing the three countries' information sectors in terms of the ratio of value added per share of workers, only for information goods (i.e., how much value added is generated by the share of workers for information goods) there are major differences. The U.S. ratio is superior. Hence, the United States is most productive, followed by Sweden's slightly lower ratio, while the Danish ratio is several times lower. While this productivity difference for information goods is not visible at the overall level for all information products, it may still be regarded as support for the abovementioned thesis that the internal productivity of economic organizations in the Danish information sector is lower than that of Swedish organizations.",

            "text": "A recent and somewhat heated debate addresses the empirical phenomenon sometimes labeled the \"great decoupling\" (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014) . It concerns the observation that while the level of economic productivity is increasing in the U.S. economy, the level of new jobs is not increasing as expected. This, together with other empirical observations about the development and adoption of various digital technologies, gives rise to the message of the so-called \"second machine age,\" which includes the postulate that digital technologies are becoming so smart that they will replace and automate numerous tasks and jobs currently conducted by humans (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014; Frey and Osborne, 2017) . On the other hand, some argue that this will not be the case because new tasks and jobs will emerge instead (Autor, 2015; Davenport and Kirby, 2015; Kaine and Josserand, 2019) , similarly to when the first machine age caused mechanization. Whether all tasks and jobs will be replaced by technology and whether new types of tasks and jobs will emerge are important questions that cannot be answered here. However, this study shows that approximately half of the jobs in Denmark and Sweden-and in the United States and South Korea-are information-processing jobs and are therefore potentially subject to replacement by automation-enabled digital technologies. Accordingly, the other half of the jobs are concerned with material processing and are hence potentially subject to mechanization. One conclusion is that, currently, all jobs in Denmark and Sweden cannot be replaced by digital technologies with their ability to mimic human cognition, as half of all jobs are not concerned with information processing. Moreover, the fact that such a large share of the workforce is still occupied with material processing V. PASHKEVICH, et al. Technological Forecasting & Social Change 162 (2021) 120347 tasks shows that while the first machine age did eliminate many jobs, not all jobs were rendered redundant; in fact, it also created new types of jobs (World Economic Forum, 2016) . It is thus reasonable to assume that a similar pattern may emerge for the ongoing second machine age-the digitalization of societies and their economies-meaning that many current jobs will be eliminated by machines, while new job types will be created. Over the studied period, the labor market in Denmark, Sweden, and the United States experienced an intense polarization of employment: from the material to the information sector. The aggregate share of jobs in low-and middle-skill production and in clerical occupations declined from the 1960s onward, while the share of jobs in high-skill professional and managerial occupations, as well as low-skill service occupations, increased. This coincided with a polarization of wages. A key driver of job polarization seems to be the rapid penetration of information and communication technologies that replace routine worktasks and jobs, typically constituting middle-skill occupations. On the other hand, an introduction of advanced technologies requires workers with special skills, who are scarce in the labor market, which generates wage polarization.",

One such area is education and training, which can provide a workforce with the relevant knowledge and skills to succeed in the information age, particularly in the production of information services. Another policy area is taxation, where corporate taxation may be designed to incentivize corporations to invest in the development of human capital, which is the core resource of information production. The reduction of work taxation, in contrast to other assets and resources, may be central to stimulate the information economy, which typically does not depend on resources other than the workforce. Novel forms of employment due to the use of information and communication technologies enable a wide range of self-employment options, where customized taxation may stimulate such self-employment. A related area of policy is the taxation of startups, which, when designed appropriately, can incentivize the creation of and transition into new types of information jobs. Yet another policy area is the regulation of intellectual property, which needs to balance incentives for innovation with public access and benefits. The recent dramatic growth of companies like Amazon and e-Bay shows that ecommerce may require careful regulation so as to protect customer rights, stimulate the growth of international trade, and at the same time protect the main street and local businesses. A final dramatic illustration of the benefit of knowledge of the structure and dynamics of an economy's information sector is its ability to offer crucial guidance for the assessment of economic impacts of major crises, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This in turn may offer guidelines for a policy aimed at handling such a crisis. In the case of COVID-19, a common governmental reaction was to reduce people's mobility, which prevented people from reaching their workplaces and thus hindered their ability to conduct work activities there. While industrial manufacturing, such as car production, had to close its operations, much information producing work could be relocated to employees' homes and could be conducted there. An economy where the share of the information sector is 60% or more will therefore be affected less than an economy with an information sector of 40% only.",

In January 2012, the Swedish government announced a decrease in the domestic value added tax, from 25% to 12%, for restaurant services only, which is a material service according to the classification adopted here. That initiative was justified by the aim to stimulate the growth of service production and consumption and their contribution to Sweden's economic growth (Swedish Government, 2011) . The analysis presented here shows that in 2012, material service production accounted for 34.8% of total employment and produced only 20.6% of value added. On the other hand, information services accounted for 42.4% of total employment and produced 51.4% of total value added. Therefore, in terms of economic growth, information service employment contributed twice as much as material service employment. If the policy actually aimed to \"contribute to economic growth,\" it should have targeted information service jobs (e.g., software programmers) rather than material service jobs.",

Recent research indicates an emerging field, sometimes called the economics of information technologies (Varian et al., 2004) , with an overall message that the use of digital technologies for business conduct modifies, in some respects, the conventional economic wisdom established by the empirical studies of the industrial age.

One such property is that information requires direct experience to know it, and therefore, its value derives from the experience of information content-this is sometimes labeled Arrow's information paradox: the value of the information good to a consumer is known after the consumer has borne the cost of acquiring it (Arrow, 1962) .

            "text": "Moving our focus from information in general to digitalized information, the theory of \"digital objects\" (Kallinikos et al., 2010) articulates several key characteristics that are fundamentally different from the material object, where these distinguishing attributes include the virtually unbounded editability, interactivity, openness, and distributiveness of digital objects (Kallinikos et al., 2010) . On the level of aggregated digital objects, the notion of \"digital platforms\" may be contrasted to conventional physical infrastructures such as roads (Hanseth and Lyytinen, 2010) . Material objects and material platforms are temporally and spatially stable, whereas digital objects and digital platforms are temporally and spatially unbounded, open, and in constant flux, modifying themselves and other digital and physical objects while being subject to modification as well. An overall message is that digitalized information operates so radically differently from their analogs in the material world that a completely new set of theoretical notions is needed to adequately comprehend the digital fabric and thus govern it. V. PASHKEVICH, et al. Technological Forecasting & Social Change 162 (2021) 120347 Moving from the operational realm to the economic one, the digital fabric tends to have, in several respects, different economic characteristics. One is the strong network effect; another is the elimination of marginal cost; yet another is the tendency to assume several complementary, often indirect, revenue sources (Shapiro and Varian, 1999) . Still another insight is that economic value creation and appropriation in the context of digitalized businesses cannot be understood in terms of a single conventional economic theory, which has caused scholars to synthesize several theoretical concepts to account for some of the distinguishing features of digital businesses (e.g., Amit and Zott, 2001) .",

The works of Machlup (1962 Machlup ( , 1981 and Porat (1977) provide the key underlying deviating distinction between the physical and informational content of an output produced by an economic organization, whether for internal or external use. The distinction in the content of the output, together with the conventional distinction of the form of the output-goods versus services-(e.g., Apte et al., 2008 Apte et al., , 2012 , offers a foundation for an alternative conceptualization and therefore the measurement of the economy as a whole. Our results confirm the overall usefulness of this alternative conceptualization as novel and enable the identification of knowledge about the underlying economic structures. This novel knowledge is valuable for both policy design and further knowledge development.",

This limitation demands extra effort for any measurement of the information sector, as available data must be reclassified. However, the challenges associated with such an effort are a key reason for the relative scarcity of published studies on information sectors. A related yet more profound challenge is the lack of measurement for numerous digital services offered freely via the Internet to consumers (e.g., Internet search engines, social media platforms, encyclopedias, and dictionaries). The value of these offered and consumed services is challenging to quantify and measure, yet the scope and volume of such services are rapidly growing (Aeppel, 2016; Benkler, 2006) . More research is therefore needed to develop measurement procedures to account for the digital goods offered to consumers for free.",

The next data points for Korea are for 1995 and 2000, whereas data are available for the United States for 1997, 2002, and 2007 and for Denmark and Sweden for 2001, 2005, 2008, and 2012. To assume a somewhat similar time span to compare the available data, 1995 data on Korea are compared to 1997 data on the United States and 1993 data on Denmark and Sweden. Data on Korea for 2000 are compared to the U.S. figures for 2002 and data on Denmark and Sweden for 2001. Korea's 1995 information goods component (12.9%) was larger than in the three other economies: the United States (6.5%), Sweden (5.5%), and Denmark (2.0%). Korea's 1995 information services component was 43.7%, resembling Sweden's information services in 1993 (42.3%) but far less than the 49.5% component in the United States in 1992, and even further from the 54.1% in Denmark in 1993. Korea's information goods component in the year 2000 was 12.5%, which again resembled Sweden's information goods for 2001 (11.4%) and was twice that of the United States in 2002 (5.9%), again surpassing Denmark's (2.1%). Korea's information services component for the year 2000 was 46.5%, which again resembled Sweden's information services in 2001 of 48.4% and was far behind both 56% for the United States in 2002 and 53.0% for Denmark in 2001.",
