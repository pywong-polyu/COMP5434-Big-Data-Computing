Major concentrations of larvae occurred in the central portion of the lagoon, occasionally along the channels, but never at the inlets. The cycle of larva abundance was correlated with cycles of salinity and temperature. In spite of the greater number of species then, the spring and summer periods had low species diversity and evenness, due to the marked domination by larvae of Anchoa mitchilli. The number of larval fish species and individuals entering the lagoon from the adjacent offshore waters was minimal. The greatest portion of species diversity is generated within the lagoon itself. The community structure identified corresponds to the physically controlled type, as indicated by the poor diversity values obtained.",

            "text": "portant to Mexico, because lagoons occur along one-third of its coast line. According to Yafiez-Arancibia (1978), 80% of the coastal ichthyofauna of Mexico is closely related to lagoons or to the areas that lagoons influence. Our study is part of a series dealing with the composition and fluctuations of ichthyoplankton in several coastal lagoons along the Gulf of Mexico. In this paper, we report the distribution, abundance, structure, and fluctuations of the ichthyoplankton community, and factors affecting these, during an annual cycle in Tamiahua Lagoon. Study Area Tamiahua Lagoon is located in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, between latitudes 91\u00f810 ' and 99\u00f810'N, and at longitude 97\u00f850'W (Fig. 1). It is long and narrow, with an approximate length of 93 km and a maximum width of 21.5 km, and shallow, with an average depth of 3 m in its central part. Its topography includes three major islands: Del Toro at the center, and Juana Ramirez and Del Idolo at opposite ends of the lagoon. The latter two islands have channels going around them that connect the lagoon with the sea. The lagoon has two inlets, Boca de Corazones to the south, of natural origin, and Boca de Tampachichi in the north, which was artificially opened. Along the inner margin of the lagoon, there are several small streams whose discharges vary greatly throughout the year. The most important ones are La Laja, Cucharas, Tanocochin, and Tampache. Methods Twenty-five sampling stations were visited approximately every 3 months during 1980: March 3-5, May 26-28, August 25-27, and November 27-29. The ichthyoplankton samples were collected with a trapeze net having a mesh of 500 \u2022m, a length of 1.5 m and diameters of 0.1 m at the collector and 0.5 m at the mouth. A digital flow meter, previously calibrated, was placed at the net's mouth. Fiveqninute tows were made along circular paths, the net being 0.1 to 0.15 m below the surface. Each sample was fixed with 4% formalin buffered with sodium borate.",

The temperature regime was similar to that of the salinity and showed lower values in winter (15-18.2 C) and fall (16.5-18.5 C), and higher ones in spring (28.5-32.1 C) and summer (29.6-32.2 C).

The larvae of Brevoortia sp., Lagodon rhomboides, Elops saurus, Hyporhamphus unifasciatus, and Oligoplites saurus were scarce. Their occurrences were basically restricted to the inlets.

Perhaps this is because this index gives more weight to presence than to proportion of the species involved. The dominance index (/t) ibllowed the tendency of larva abundance, and was opposite to the trends in H' andJ'. It clearly indicates the extreme abundance of Anchoa mitchilli. This dominance was the major factor of the ichthyoplanktonic community during the fall sampling period, though it was more obvious during spring and stunruer. Summer dominance of this species seems to be quite common in estuaries and coastal areas, as has been shown in Texas (Bechtel andCopeland 1970; Guillen and Lan-4easonal changes in environmental and biolo\u2022cal va\u2022ables, Tamiahua Lagoon, 1980: generalized salini\u2022 and temperature (C); abundance of fish eggs and la\u2022ae (numbers/1 O0 mS); number \u2022 species (S); and indexes of Margal\u2022s species richness ( D), Shannon-Weaver diversi\u2022 (H'), evenness (J'), and Simpson's dominance ( \u2022.

With the higher number of species in spring and summer it seems that the indices of Shan-non-Weaver (H') and evenness (J') would reachhigher values then, but they seem to be inverse to the number of species and abundance of larvae. This may be because H' gives more weight to proportions of the spedes than to their num-",
