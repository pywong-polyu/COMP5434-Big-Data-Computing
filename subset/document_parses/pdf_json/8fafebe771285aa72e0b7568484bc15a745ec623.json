Hence, patients with CLL might be considered more susceptible to severe complications from COVID-19. We undertook this retrospective international multicenter study to characterize the course of COVID-19 in patients with CLL and identify potential predictors of outcome. Of 190 patients with CLL and confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed between 28/03/2020 and 22/05/2020, 151 (79%) presented with severe COVID-19 (need of oxygen and/or intensive care admission).

Only 60 patients (39.7%) with severe COVID-19 were receiving or had recent (\u226412 months) treatment for CLL at the time of COVID-19 versus 30/39 (76.9%) patients with mild disease.

Moreover, in a recent series focused on patients with hematologic neoplasms hospitalized for COVID-19, those without active cancer (watch & wait strategy and remission status) presented a favorable outcome [11] .

This can be further exacerbated by antileukemic treatments that by definition impact on the host immune system, some applied continuously until progression [16] . This could arguably compromise the capacity of patients with CLL to clear the virus, with a possible higher infection risk for this population. Conversely, immunodeficiency might as well be protective against severe COVID-19 and MOF, limiting excessive activation of the immune system. In this context, the role of novel targeted therapies such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, with overall antiinflammatory activity due to effects on both innate immune cells and platelets, has also been proposed as potentially beneficial against severe disease manifestations [17] .

The presence of three or more comorbidities was not significantly different in patients hospitalized with severe versus nonsevere disease; moreover, the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia, a frequent laboratory finding in CLL, did not show a relevant impact on the clinical course of COVID-19 patients, probably underscoring the relevance of the inflammatory reaction rather than the viral replication (and the capacity to clear it by antibody-mediated immune response) in shaping the severity of the disease. The potential impact of CLL-specific treatments on the course of COVID-19 still needs to be fully elucidated, with international guidelines suggesting careful evaluation of pros/cons of treatment interruption, in particular in patients on targeted agents [20] . Taking into consideration the potential long-term effect on the immune system and the risk of infections (up to 12 months) particularly for patients treated with CIT, we grouped together patients who were on ongoing or had received recent (<12 months) therapies vs patients with no treatments in their lifetime or in the past previous year. Relevant to mention in this respect, our cohort of COVID-19 patients is enriched for patients receiving treatment for CLL compared to a standard population (indeed 2679/15,083, 17.8% were on treatment at participating sites, while 65/190, 34.2% COVID-19 cases were treated). Interestingly, patients under ibrutinib less likely needed hospitalization suggesting a diverse effect of the antileukemic treatments, probably due to a different impact on the immune deficiency and/or dysregulation. Along the same direction, we here report that patients on recent or ongoing treatment were more likely to have a milder COVID-19 compared to those with severe disease who in the vast majority were on a watch and wait followup. It is important to note that a relevant proportion of patients included into the study were on BTK inhibitors but, due to limited numbers of patients treated with other therapies, our study does not allow reaching firm conclusions on potential differences between the different types of treatment (BTK inhibitors vs venetoclax-based regimens vs CIT and/or steroids). Altogether, these data seem to further underscore the possible protective role of specific targeted therapies against a dismal evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 infection [17, 21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1088, "end": 1092, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2687, "end": 2691, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2692, "end": 2695, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Considering the median age of 72 years at the time of COVID-19 occurrence and the presence of at least one comorbidity in~75% of our patients (median number of comorbidities 2), the high mortality rate (55/169, 32.5%) among the hospitalized patients reported in this cohort comes as no surprise, though it is apparently higher than expected in the general population (e.g., 13.4% amongst the general population in Italy) (https://www.epicentro.iss.it/ coronavirus/). However, if we consider only patients with CLL \u2265 70 years of age, the percentage (36/105, 34.3%) is not considerably different from that of normal individuals >70 years (25.5%, https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/) [18] . The difference in the overall mortality rate was seen in all age groups, with young patients (<65 years) succumbing to the disease at rates similar to those of the elderly (26.2% and 31.0%, respectively), though the elderly patients were more likely to experience severe COVID-19, as reported above.

To mitigate at least in part these limitations, we restricted our analyses to hospitalized patients that are more objectively recorded in all different national situations. Despite these limitations, our series thoroughly describes COVID-19 outcome in a large cohort of patients with CLL in Europe and suggests that these patients may be at a higher risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and of succumbing to the disease due to the underlying leukemia, while at least some CLL treatments may favorably influence COVID-19 course.
