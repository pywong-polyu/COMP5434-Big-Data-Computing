Study design: A longitudinal sero-epidemiological study was conducted in sample of Italian healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods: HCWs who were administered two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, 21 days apart, between December 2020 and January 2021, were invited to undergo multiple serology tests to identify SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Participants also responded to questions about their smoking status (i.e. current smokers vs non-smokers) in a survey. Results: Sixty days after the completion of the vaccination cycle, serological analyses showed a difference in vaccine-induced IgG titre between current smokers and non-smokers, with median antibody titres of 211.80 AU/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 149.80e465.50) and 487.50 AU/mL (IQR 308.45e791.65) [Pvalue \u00bc 0.002], respectively. This significant difference in vaccine-induced IgG titres between current smokers and non-smokers remained after adjusting for age, sex, and previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: This study observed that vaccine-induced antibody titres decrease faster among current smokers than non-smokers. Further research to investigate the impact of smoking on the immunological response to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 vaccines is required.",

Participant HCWs also responded to questions about their smoking status (i.e. current smokers vs non-smokers). This study focused on the differences in SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG dynamics according to smoking status. Antibody level was assessed using the SnibeeMaglumi\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay, with a reactivity cutoff of 1.0 AU/mL. 1 A ManneWhitney U test was used to assess differences of median IgG levels between current smokers and non-smokers. A multivariate linear regression model was built to investigate the association between IgG level and smoking status, adjusting for possible covariates, namely, age, sex, and previous infection with SARS-CoV-2.",

Emerging evidence has described lower antibody levels in response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in smokers, irrespectively of duration of smoking or number of cigarettes per day. 3 However, the pathophysiological basis for the impact of smoking on the dynamics of vaccine-elicited anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have not yet been suggested. Previous literature observed that smoking may impact the immune response after vaccinations other than anti-COVID-19, such as hepatitis B and influenza vaccines, with a more rapid decrease in postvaccination antibodies in smokers. 4 Exposure to cigarette smoking impairs the immune system and thus the ability to form memory cells that are critical to the maintenance of the protective immune response induced by vaccines. 4, 5 It is important to note that human IgG subclasses and specific antibodies generally have a half-life of approximately 3e4 weeks, depending on IgG isotype and attributes. Cigarette smoking is associated with increased monocyte-macrophage counts, which may influence the clearance of circulating antibodies. 5 The present analysis shows that antibody titres decrease faster among current smokers than non-smokers. The mechanisms by which tobacco smoke decreases the immunological responses to COVID-19 vaccines deserve further research.",
