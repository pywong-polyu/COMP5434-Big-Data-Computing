The path-dependent arrival process model is useful because it has the arrival rate depending on the history of the arrival process, thus capturing a self-reinforcing property that one might expect in some applications. The workload approximation is based on heavy-traffic limits for (i) a sequence of Polya processes, in which the limit is a Gaussian-Markov process, and (ii) a sequence of P/GI/1 queues in which the arrival rate function approaches a constant service rate uniformly over compact intervals.",

The GPP can capture the long-term impact of initial conditions.

That tractability suggests that the GPP can be useful for modelling in practical applications. Our goal in this paper was to see how much of this appealing tractability we could achieve without requiring the stationarity. We succeed in generalizing both the HTLT and a result obtained in Corollary 6 of [9] describing the transient distribution of the queue's limit process. We also show that a general GPP can be approximated arbitrarily well by a piecewise-stationary GPP, and we use that structure to obtain an explicit transient approximation formula particularly convenient for modeling.",

To achieve that, we let the instantaneous traffic intensity approach 1 uniformly over such intervals. But that in turn depends on a definition of the arrival rate. For that, Theorem 1 here determines the arrival rate \u03bb(t) (which is defined like \u03bb * (t|H t ) above, but is not conditioned on the history) and shows that a GPP exists with any integrable rate function. As a consequence, Corollary 2 here shows that the parameter triples (\u03bb(t), \u03b3 , \u03b2) and (\u03ba(t), \u03b3 , \u03b2) are homeomorphic representations of a GPP.

In order to obtain a transient distribution that depends on a finite number of parameters, we apply Theorem 1 in Corollary 3 to characterize a piecewise-stationary GPP, which we refer to as a \u03c8 k \u2212 GPP (when there are k pieces). The rate function for a \u03c8 k \u2212 GPP is constant on each piece, and it follows that a \u03c8 k \u2212 GPP has k + 2 parameters.

With that scaling, we establish a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for the arrival process and the desired HTLT for the workload process in the P/GI/1 queue. However, the limit processes both depend on the limit function \u03b7 in (1.3) . In order to obtain more useful approximations, in Sect. 3.3 we apply the limit theorems to develop an asymptotic approximation that depends instead on the rate function and the other parameters of the original P/GI/1 model. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has never been proposed before. In fact, we think that this approximation approach is new even for an M t arrival process, i.e., for a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). In that regard, we mention that results for the NHPP arrival process are covered as a special case here by just setting \u03b3 = 0 (which requires minor modifications in some definitions to avoid dividing by 0). Since the GPP is an arrival process with a time-varying rate, the limits here are related to previous ones for time-varying single-server queues; see [21] , especially Sect. 7.2 for a review. The papers [15] and [22] are relevant. Particularly relevant are the HTLTs for the M t /M t /1 model in [15] obtained from the strong approximation. The scaling in (1.3) here and the approximation scheme in Sect. 3.3 here are different than used previously. This paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, after reviewing GPPs, we establish Theorem 1, providing the new representation of a GPP in terms of the rate function, and show how to construct piecewise-stationary GPPs. In Sect. 3, we establish limit theorems for the arrival and workload processes and asymptotically correct approximations for those processes. Theorem 2 is the FCLT for the arrival process, while Theorem 3 is the HTLT for the workload process. The new asymptotic approximation is then developed in Sect. 3.3. Finally, Theorem 4 in Sect. 3.4 establishes the approximating transient workload distribution. In Sect. 4, we prove two lemmas used in the proof of Theorem 4. Finally, we provide some concluding discussion in Sect. 5.",

The conclusion in (3.20) is then a consequence of (3.25) and the converse of the convergence together theorem in Theorem 11.4.8 of [20] . For the prelimit sequence satisfying the conditions of Corollary 5, (3.22) implies that X n \u2261 N n \u2212 n\u03bc n e, W n d \u2248 X n \u2261 nZ n \u2212 n\u03bc n e + n 1/2 T ,\u1e82 n (3.26) with error that is o n 1/2 as n\u2192\u221e on bounded intervals, i.e., the error is asymptotically negligible for large n after dividing by n 1/2 . On the right-hand side, n 1/2 T is the zeromean Gaussian process with distribution determined by Cov n 1/2 T (s), n 1/2 T (t) = nbs 1 + c 2 s + \u03b3 t for 0 \u2264 s \u2264 t. By (3.3) , it is therefore the \u03c8 \u2212 GMP with parameter pair (\u03b1 * , \u03b2 * ) = nb 1 + c 2 s , \u2212nb\u03b3 . On the left-hand side, N n is a GPP with parameter triple (\u03bb n (t), \u03b3 n , \u03b2 n ) = (n\u03b6 n (t), \u03b3 , nb). We can therefore eliminate explicit reference to n from (3.26) for any particular n by substituting \u03bb(t) \u2261 n\u03b6 n (t), (t) \u2261 nZ n (t), \u03b2 \u2261 nb, \u03bc \u2261 n\u03bc n , and T (t) \u2261 n 1/2 T (t). With those substitutions, (3.26) becomes (3.27) where N is then the GPP with parameter triple (\u03bb(t), \u03b3 , \u03b2) , T is the \u03c8 \u2212 GMP with parameter pair (\u03b1 * , \u03b2 * ) = \u03b2 + \u03b2c 2 s , \u2212\u03b2\u03b3 , and \u03bc is the service rate. The parameters \u03b2, \u03bc, \u03bb(t) are large when the index n is large before the substitutions.",

The transient distribution of a reflected \u03c8 \u2212 GMP with constant drift was derived in [10] and applied in [9] for \u03c8 \u2212 GPPs. We generalize that result for the case when the drift is time-dependent to describe the transient distribution of the reflection on an interval conditional on history up to the start of the interval. That holds when the drift is any time-dependent function in D prior to the interval but is constant on the interval. The time-dependent drift prior to the interval enters into the transient distribution on the interval because the increments of a \u03c8 \u2212 GMP are dependent.",

The intensity of demand for testing would then depend on prior demand, increases in demand would be self-reinforcing, and the influence of early conditions would persist. The spread of COVID-19 was assumed to have such characteristics in [5] and modeled there as a GPP; see (8) of [5] for the particular GPP intensity function used.

The stationarity of the \u03c8 \u2212GPP on each piece is then preserved by the time transformation, so that a \u03c8 k \u2212 GPP is piecewise stationary. Remark 2 (GPPs with constant or piecewise-constant rates). As a consequence of Corollary 3, a GPP has a piecewise-constant instantaneous mean function \u03bb(t) if and only if it is a \u03c8 k \u2212 GPP.
