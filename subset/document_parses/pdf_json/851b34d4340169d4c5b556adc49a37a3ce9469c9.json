[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Recent studies suggest antibody production is positively correlated with disease severity with more mild or asymptomatic cases producing lower antibody titers. 7, 8 Although older age and multiple comorbidities are associated with worse COVID-19 health outcomes, it is important to consider individual comorbid factors and how they impact immune response. The purpose of this study was to (1) determine the incidence of detectable antibody response in a long-term care facility (LTCF) population and (2) characterize the relationships between immune response, individual characteristics, and disease progression. We examined the IgG antibody response in geriatric residents of an LTCF 4 weeks after initial infection, 3 months postinfection, and 6 months postinfection.",

Patients' symptoms were grouped into asymptomatic, mild to moderate, or severe.
