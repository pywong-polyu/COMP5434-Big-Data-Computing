Network pharmacology research is very suitable for the analysis of multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). According to the relevant theory, we first carefully collected and screened the active ingredients in ZSS and received 11 active ingredients that may work. e targets going along with these active components were also strongly related to insomnia targets, 108 common genes were identified, and drugcompound-gene symbol-disease visualization network and protein-protein interaction network were constructed. Forty-eight core genes were identified by PPI analysis and subjected to GO functional analysis with KEGG pathway analysis. e results of GO analysis pointed that there were 998 gene ontology items for the treatment of insomnia, including terms of 892 biological processes, 47 cellular components, and 59 molecular functions. It mainly shows the coupling effect and transport mode of some proteins in the biological pathways of ZSS in the treatment of insomnia and explains the mechanism of action through the connection between the target and the cell biomembrane. KEGG enrichment analyzed 19 signaling pathways, which were collectively classified into seven categories. We have identified the potential pathways of ZSS against insomnia and obtained the regulatory relationship between core genes and pathways and know that the same target can be regulated by multiple components at the same time. e results of molecular docking also prove this conclusion. We sought to provide a new analytical approach to explore TCM treatments for diseases using network pharmacology analysis tools.",

Sleep deprivation is a potential factor for a variety of risk sicknesses. General medicine-based treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia have limitations, and better alternatives have also been searched for [1] . ere are many links between insomnia and mental health, of which anxiety and depression may have a bidirectional effect with insomnia, and the problem can no longer be ignored by people [2] . Such people are prone to dizziness and brain swelling, generalized weakness, explosive temper, and irritability in the morning, which have been very harmful to the body for a long time in the past. With the fierce development of social competition, people's life rhythm has become faster. e prevalence and recurrence rates of insomnia remain high, and it has become one of the hot issues in the field of public health. e effective drugs commonly used clinically are benzodiazepines, but they also have obvious side effects, even increasing the death rate of the elderly [3, 4] . As an alternative to treating insomnia, Chinese medicine has achieved good therapeutic effects and has gradually attracted the attention of clinicians [5] . Ziziphi Spinosae Semen (ZSS) is the dried mature seed of Rhamnaceae plant Ziziphus jujuba Mill.var spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H. F. Chou; according to TCM theory, ZSS is a gentle temperament drug that can nourish the heart and benefit the liver, tranquilize the mind, converge sweat, and generate fluid [6] . ZSS is a relatively easy-to-obtain natural medicine. It is found in many Chinese medicine prescriptions for calming and tranquilizing the nerves, and it is most commonly used to treat insomnia [7] .",

All ingredients about ZSS were first collected as candidates with the Chinese name \"Suanzaoren\" as the search term. Afterwards, we introduced these limiting parameters of oral bioavailability (OB) and drug-likeness (DL) according to the classical active ingredient screening rules [10] , in which OB refers to the percentage of unmodified drugs that enter the circulatory system after oral administration and can effectively represent the availability of drugs, and OB \u2265 30% of compounds is considered as one of the screening rules for active ingredients [11] . While DL refers to the similarity of compounds to clinically used drugs, the greater DL value represents the possibility of compounds becoming drugs, and molecules with DL \u2265 0.18 are carefully thought about to have better pharmacological effects and are also one of the most commonly used active ingredient screening rules [12] , so we started obeying this rule. In addition, as a drug often used by Chinese clinicians, the active substances of traditional Chinese medicine must meet the relevant provisions of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia when prescribing [13] . We also added the active ingredients specified in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia as active compounds.",

Studies have shown that saponins and flavonoids are the two most important active components in ZSS [23, 24] , the most important of which are jujuboside A and spinosin. Jujuboside A can inhibit cancer cell growth through various mechanisms such as cell cycle arrest, proliferation inhibition, stem cell inhibition, and promotion of aging and can contaminate antitoxins [25, 26] , and our analysis results show that there are many intersections of targets associated with it and insomnia targets. Spinosin exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting oxidative damage and has a significant antidepressant effect, and there is a great association between spinosin and insomnia [27, 28] . Although the kinetic values of these two components are relatively low, they have very excellent biological activity and are closely related to our study.

CC is rich in 47 GO terms and analyzes that these core genes are closely related to those cell biofilms, mainly involving a variety of synaptic membranes, such as integral component of synaptic membrane (GO:0099699), intrinsic component of synaptic membrane (GO:0099240), and integral component of presynaptic membrane (GO:0099056).

Some of these pathways have been shown to be highly connected with insomnia, such as key Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 protein pathways that upregulate neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling that can significantly improve insomnia [35] , and some pharmacological treatments for psychiatric disorders also use selective blockade of presynaptic dopamine receptors in the frontal cortex, enhancing dopaminergic transmission, which is consistent with the results of our analysis of modulation of the dopaminergic synapse signaling pathway [36] .

It linked the positive inhibitor curcumin to the two amino acids, GLY-27 and ARG-83, on IL-2 ( Figure 6 (e)), and upadacitinib forms two hydrogen bonds with the amino acid ILE-136 on TNF ( Figure 6(f ) ). Our analysis shows that ZSS can effectively act on multiple targets such as TNF and IL-2 simultaneously through various components such as swertisin, jujuboside A, and spinosin, which makes the drug molecules affect the protein, and this achieves the effect of treating insomnia.",

            "text": "With the acceleration of people's modern life rhythm, the number of insomnia population showed an increasing trend. Despite developed medical conditions and increasingly diverse means of treating psychiatric disorders, the problem of insomnia still cannot be effectively treated [37, 38] . Monomeric drugs have opened a channel of remission for some patients with neurological diseases, but it is undeniable that the effects of drug resistance and other side effects are not negligible [39, 40] . Most herbs originate from nature with relatively few side effects and adverse effects. ZSS is a pure natural traditional Chinese medicine that has a significant therapeutic effect on insomnia [41, 42] , but its application and development have some limitations because of the complex mechanism of action of multiple components and multiple targets of traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we used network pharmacology theory and related tools to select the active components and related targets of ZSS and linked them with insomnia-related targets to construct a D-C-G-D visual network, which more intuitively showed the specific relationship between drug components and diseases through 108 consensus genes. e results of PPI analysis showed complex interactions between overlapping genes, and 48 core targets were further screened according to the average node degree between them, such as TNF with a Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine high node degree, meaning that one key to ZSS treatment of insomnia may be the inhibition of inflammation in vivo [43] , which also made our subsequent analysis more prominent. GO functional analysis makes a simple annotation of gene products, BP enrichment results in the coupling effect and transport mode of proteins in biological pathways, for example, G protein-coupled receptors can mediate the normal function of the brain, of which H3 and H4 receptors are high-affinity receptors in the brain and immune system, respectively, and H3 receptors can regulate histamine and neurotransmitters, which control sleep quality [44] . e results of CC analysis show that intersection proteins or their products take part in the cellular environment, and active biofilm, such as a variety of protrusion membranes, can be utilized as tools to transmit synaptic currents in hypothalamic neurons, triggering arousal and regulating energy metabolism [45] . By MF analysis, we can determine that some protein receptor activities are regulated by drugs, such as neurotransmitter receptor, which is closely related to sleep, of which c-amino butyric acid receptor plays an important role in controlling different vigilance states in the human body [46] . KEGG pathway analysis effectively helps us to associate genomes with cellular, species, and ecosystem functions. According to the results of our analysis, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cAMP signaling pathway, and one of the key pathways to treat insomnia in ZSS, in the pathway, multiple targets such as ADRA1A, ADRA1B, and ADRA1D can be simultaneously regulated by components such as (S)-cointeraction, sanjoinenine, and zizyphusine, and upregulation of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine has also been an active process for the treatment of insomnia [35] . Besides identifying the specific pathways involved, cluster analysis of these pathways is also unique to our study, such as the cAMP signaling pathway, renin secretion, and dopaminergic synapse; these three pathways function similarly or are more closely linked during ZSS treatment of insomnia. Some protein kinases in the cAMP signaling pathway phosphorylate some specific proteins associated with insomnia, controlling the molecular and intracellular signaling of sleep and wake states [47] . Renin secretion can affect vital active states, and increased activity of the reninangiotensin system in the brain elevates fluid intake, blood pressure, and resting metabolic rate renin secretion [48] . In addition, antipsychotics may improve psychomotor and routine by releasing dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, which may also involve the dopaminergic synapse signaling pathway [36] . Classification analysis of signaling pathways reveals population differences between different signaling pathways when specific drugs are used to treat diseases. Based on the prediction results, we finally performed in silico molecular docking validation. e tight binding of a variety of small molecule compounds and amino acids on proteins preliminarily showed that our analysis was reliable, and it was also to affirm the feasibility of traditional Chinese medicine, an active compound in ZSS, in the treatment of insomnia. Complex diseases often have many symptoms, and sometimes, the use of monomeric components is less effective to treat complex diseases and has significant side effects. TCM has been used to treat diseases for thousands of years, with significant results. Meanwhile, the special philosophical ideas of Chinese medicine and the very complex Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine composition of TCM limit its further development, and the rise of network pharmacology brings another idea for the study of TCM. By constructing a drug-target-disease network, higher levels of information can be obtained by calculating the mechanism of simultaneous action of multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways, and then using the construction of visual network charts can enable researchers to quickly and clearly know the mechanism of complex components in the treatment of diseases, which is a very practical new research tool. All of our work is dedicated to establishing a new analytical method with the help of network pharmacology, and besides exploring ZSS for the treatment of insomnia, we also hope to apply it in more traditional Chinese medicine research.",
