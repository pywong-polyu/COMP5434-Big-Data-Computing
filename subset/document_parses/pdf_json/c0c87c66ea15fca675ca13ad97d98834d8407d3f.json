As both age and the number of chronic diseases increase so often does the list of prescribed medications. International research has validated the phenomenon to be especially troublesome for older adults residing in nursing homes. 1 Strong associations with negative clinical consequences have also been noted for polypharmacy including inappropriate prescribing and medications 1,2 as well as medications that are not clinically indicated or are no longer affective. 3 Although polypharmacy often refers to a quantity, it can also be qualitatively defined as using multiple drugs or more than are medically necessary. 1, 5 Documented range definitions from five 4 to nine or more are common 5\u00c07 Although the definitions may vary the outcomes are similar. In a systematic review of 48 studies, researchers noted that the total number of medications (polypharmacy) was consistently found to be the main driver for the phenomenon of inappropriate prescribing. 2 It is also associated with increased all-cause and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. 8, 9 The challenges of therapeutics in long term care is complicated by polypharmacy and the associated factors of adverse drug interactions, potentially inappropriate medications, and therapeutic duplication. 6 ,10\u00c014, 37 Frailty, physiological changes of aging, and disease burden result in increased vulnerability and jeopardy. 6, 15 Aggressive medical management of co-morbidities and multiple providers add to the complexity of care in this setting. 16 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an adverse drug reaction (ADR) as a response to a medicine which is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in man. 17 The use of 9 or more medications has been positively correlated with ADRs in older adult in nursing homes. 12 Polypharmacy has also been associated with an increased prevalence of drug-drug interactions and a worsening of cognitive function for residents of long term care. 18 The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications has been noted in more than one in five nursing home residents. 19 Nieves-Perez and colleagues 20 found the number of prescribed and potentially inappropriate medications to be directly correlated. Potentially inappropriate prescriptions have also been found to increase the risk of preventable medications associated hospital admissions 21 Polypharmacy affects not only the resident but also the staff processes in long term care facilities. Thomson and colleagues 21 found that time needed for the medication administration process in LTC was significant and increased for nurses unfamiliar with residents. The realities of polypharmacy and staffing challenges may make completing medication passes in the scheduled time periods nearly impossible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 399, "end": 400, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 636, "end": 637, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 787, "end": 789, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 790, "end": 791, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1127, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1221, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1223, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1430, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1441, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1552, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1555, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1676, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1863, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1973, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2140, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2263, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2535, "end": 2537, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The need to decrease the medication burden in long term care is well accepted.
