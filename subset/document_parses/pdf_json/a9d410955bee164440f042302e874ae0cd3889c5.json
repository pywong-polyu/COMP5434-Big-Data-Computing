Owing to the spread of COVID-19, the need for telemedicine is rapidly increasing to prevent infections more effectively. However, in practices such as traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, where color is used as an important examination factor, an accurate diagnosis cannot be made without adequate color reproduction. In telemedicine using a commercially available smartphone, color reproducibility may deteriorate owing to differences in the devices and lighting, which may result in a misdiagnosis. Therefore, we created a color chart that includes the colors of the human skin and tongue as a tool to help doctors identify the color of patients more accurately when conducting a telemedicine examination. Through a subjective evaluation by eight medical doctors, it was unanimously found that the proposed method is practical in terms of a color examination.

The tristimulus values X, Y, Z on the display can be decomposed to R, G, B as shown in the following equation:where, X' i , Y' i , Z' i (i = R, G, B)are tristimulus values for red, green, and blue luminescence, respectively. The tristimulus values corresponding to each luminescence can be calculated from L, x, y when the monitor is measured. The relationship between X -Y and Y -Z of each emission can be expressed through the following linear equation:where a i , b i , c i , and d i (i = R, G, B) are the coefficients.Equation(4)is obtained from Eqs.(2) and(3):", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Automatic color correction result (color figure online)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "L* a* b* color values for the proposed color chartThe L*a*b* color value is calculated using white reference plate under D50 light source", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Error for seven important colors inFig. 1Patch number L*a*b* error (\u0394E)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Table 1.
