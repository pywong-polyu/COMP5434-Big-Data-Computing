Here cells which belong to the flat region of Figure 6 (a) and (b) were considered as the cells in the smaller and the bigger \"arcs\", respectively. The number of these cells is 9780 and 26000, respectively. We computed the corresponding sample variances\u015d 1 and\u015d 2 of the distances for both \"arcs\". We obtained\u015d 1 = 9.81 for the smaller arc and\u015d 2 = 12.91 for the bigger one. Since the length of the active state is 40 time steps in the simulation, this confirms the visual impression that the reaction front consists of arcs. Note that the distance data should not be normally distributed since the outward periphery of the active zone consists of more cells than the inward one. Test case 3. In the framework of the above model, we could reproduce a unique phenomenon which can hardly be simulated using any deterministic approach. In some real experiments, \"target patterns\" can be detected, in more precise terms: the whole active region consists of concentric circles which propagate outward. These are usually considered as degenerated double spirals. Under some circumstances, such a pattern can appear without any externally forced initial excitation in its center [26] . Using a deterministic approach, only one front of active cells appears, followed by the zone of refractory cells (cf. Figure 1 (d) ). Therefore, in the deterministic simulations, usually a permanent artificial excitation is applied to simulate target patterns [40] . In our approach, however, the excitation can arise in a natural way without any external forcing. Due to the probabilistic transition rules, some cells become active with a time delay. If the length of the refractory period is short compared to the active period, then a refractory cell can become resting at the back of the active zone. This resting cell has a neighboring active one which can infect it again. Usually, it occurs as soon as the first generation of the refractory cells becomes resting again such that the same initial cells will be active. One can thus observe a periodically active centrum without any external forcing. Note that using an external forcing may result in a rather complex behavior: presence of twisted spirals and front reversal has been predicted, which can also be controlled [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1490, "end": 1494, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1761, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2576, "end": 2580, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 96, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 296, "end": 304, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 364, "end": 372, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1627, "text": "Figure 1 (d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Simulation results, discussion"}, {"text": "In course of the simulation, we used again p = 0.35 and \u03b1p = 0.06, with the parameters d 1 = 10, d 2 = 3.
