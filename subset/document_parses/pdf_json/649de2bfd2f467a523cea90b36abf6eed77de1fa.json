We assessed the implications of this management on future orthopaedic practice. We also surveyed patient satisfaction of our virtual fracture follow-up clinics. Method We prospectively analysed 154 patients during two weeks of 'lockdown' assessing their management. We surveyed 100 virtual fracture clinic follow-up patients for satisfaction, time off work and travel. Results Forty-nine percent of patients had decisions affected by COVID. Twelve percent of patients were discharged at diagnosis having potentially unstable fractures. These were all upper limb fractures which may go onto mal-union. Twenty-nine percent of patients were discharged who would have normally had clinal or radiological follow-up. No patients had any long-term union follow-up. Virtual telemedicine clinics have been incredibly successful. The average satisfaction was 4.8/5. In only 6% of cases, the clinician felt a further face-to-face evaluation was required. Eighty-nine percent of patients would have chosen virtual followup under normal conditions. Conclusion Lessons for the future include potentially large numbers of upper limb mal-unions which may be symptomatic. The non-union rate is likely to be the same, but these patients are unknown due to lack of late imaging. Telemedicine certainly has a role in future orthopaedic management as it is well tolerated and efficient and provides economic and environmental benefits to both clinicians and patients.",

They can be done remotely from the hospital, do not require any physical infrastructure such as access to clinic rooms and require less staff namely a receptionist or clinic nurse. They generally involve quicker appointments (although if video conferencing is used in addition, this can take some time to set up). All this leads to increased costeffectiveness. Clinics can be easily screened by consultants and effective triaging can take place. Training is also easily adapted into clinics. Clinicians can video call each other, share screens and use a continuous 'chat' system so communication can occur throughout the consultations. In the current situation, they also decrease potential viral transmission. For patients, there is also plethora of advantages. The time to appointment is quicker due to increased capacity in clinic. There is no travel time or inconvenience to the patient, including travel and car parking costs. They are particularly helpful to patients who are working as they do not require any time off work. There is a less waiting and time taken out of the patient's day. There is also a greater degree of flexibility with virtual clinics not being tied to a set rota timetable. If imaging is required, this can be done at the patient's convenience rather than in pre-designated slots. Environmentally, virtual clinics can save a great deal of travel time, road congestion and petrol consumption.",

            "text": "Disadvantages and limitations There are some considerable disadvantages to telemedicine. Telephone communication requires a better understanding of English as a spoken language and in some patient groups this is much more challenging than face-to-face conversations. Patients with hearing impairments or those who use lip reading as an adjunct suffer particular communication difficulties. Video conference requires a certain level of technological ability and equipment which may limit certain population groups, especially the elderly. Non-verbal communication, which is extremely important in communication, is totally removed if just the telephone is used. Clinical examination can be adapted for telemedicine, but there are limitations to it. Lack of palpation is inevitable and can lead to significant impairment in clinical ability. Certain examinations including range of movement can be assessed relatively easily and clinical examinations in the extremities, particularly the upper limb, are considerably easier than other assessments. There are also some potential security risks over the telephone with a lack of the person being identified. Issues such as coercion particularly in child protection issues and vulnerable adults are much harder to identify which is a huge concern. Even in a video call, there is no knowing who is behind the camera. A face-to-face assessment of a patient will always provide a wider picture of the whole situation.",

Patient satisfaction is high among our population group. The economic impact in terms of time off work and the environmental impact of travel is significant. We hope to make virtual follow-up fracture clinics part of standard orthopaedic practice in the future. Reviews following on call admission or assessment (for instance a limping child or cellulitis) work particularly well as a phone call. Follow-up imaging review such as in suspected scaphoid fractures or postmanipulation cases is significantly more efficient. Immediate post-operative checks can be done with a wound review via video and discussion regarding normal recovery. This can also be translated to an elective service; for instance, long-term follow-up after arthroplasty can easily be done with a prearranged X-ray and outcome scores.",
