Emergent surgical repair is required and includes replacement of the dissected aorta. 2 Hypercoagulable states increase the risk for the development of blood clots. Severe coagulation abnormalities are presented in nearly 20% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 3, 4 The coagulation changes suggest the presence of a hypercoagulable state that increases the risk of thromboembolic complications. 3 We present here a rare case that was diagnosed and successfully treated with ascending aorta replacement for type A aorta dissection repair and pulmonary embolectomy, in a patient who tested positive for COVID-19. The patient was discharged from our hospital on the ninth postoperative day with the same anticoagulation therapy and without any complications. The patient was followed-up in our outpatient clinic eight weeks after she was discharged home. In her last follow-up, the patient recovered totally from her hospital course, was classified with NYHA functional Class I and reported that she is in a good mental state. She was free from any symptoms, including angina or dyspnea. Follow-up CTA twelve weeks postoperative demonstrated good result of the aortic repair and PE repair (Figures 3 and 4 ). In epidemiological studies, the incidence of acute aortic dissection is approximately 3.5-6.0 per 100,000 patient-years 6 and the annual incidence rates for PE range from 39 to 115 per 100,000 patients. 7 The combined presentation of these two is very rare.",

            "text": "year-old female, independent and in a good mental state, with a history of venous insufficiency, impaired fasting glucose and hyperlipidemia, was admitted to our Medical Center with central chest pain of two days' duration. The pain was described as sharp, radiating to the left arm and associated with shivering. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a type A aorta dissection that start proximal to the brachiocephalic artery and continue to the aortic arch with an intimal flap in the ascending aorta and aortic arch. The brachiocephalic trunk, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries were spared (Figure 1). Since the patient came from an endemic area she was tested for COVID-19 infection and was found to be positive. Due to the positive result and hemodynamic stability, cardiac surgery was postponed with the patient under intensive monitoring with tight blood pressure control and mobilization's restriction in the COVID-19 designated intensive care unit of our hospital. During her whole preoperative course the patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic. Her pulse was in sinus rhythm around 60 bpm, systolic blood pressure around 100-110 mmHg under intravenous Beta blockers, Labetolol, and with oxygen saturation around 94%-95% on room air without any speech dyspnea. She did not require any respiratory support and did not receive any antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Furthermore she was not treated by any anticoagulation therapy because of the aortic dissection and the possibility of emergent surgery. Yet, she was treated by pneumatic compression device on both her legs to prevent deep vein thrombosis and PE. Two weeks later and after negative tests for COVID-19, the patient underwent an additional CTA a day before her surgery as a routine examination rather than due to any clinic changes in her situation, to see if there is any progression in the aortic dissection, that demonstrated no progression in the aortic dissection, but a new large bilateral pulmonary embolism in the main right and left pulmonary arteries (Figure 2). Sixteen days following the initial diagnosis of aortic dissection, the patient underwent surgery that included bilateral pulmonary embolectomy and aortic dissection repair by replacing the ascending aorta and hemiarch with a Dacron Tube Graft 28 mm during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The cross-clamp time was 78 min and the circulatory arrest time was 29 min. The patient was extubated and transferred to the stepdown ward on the first postoperative day. On the second postoperative day, we started treatment with anticoagulation therapy, by Apixaban in full dose twice a day.",
