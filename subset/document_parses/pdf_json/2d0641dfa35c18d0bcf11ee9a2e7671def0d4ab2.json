Swine serves as an important reservoir and the processed pork products essentially contribute to foodborne transmission. This study comprehensively estimated HEV prevalence in domestic pigs, wild boars, and pork products. At global level, we found nearly 60% domestic pigs and 27% wild boars have ever encountered HEV infection based seroprevalence rate. Nearly 13% domestic and 9.5% wild swine are actively infected based on HEV RNA positivity. Importantly, about 10% of commercial pork products are HEV RNA positive, although available data are limited in this respect. Our results indicate the high prevalence rate of HEV infection in pigs and widespread contamination in pork products, although there are substantial variations at regional and country levels. These findings are important for better understanding the global epidemiology and clinical burden of HEV infection in human population related to zoonotic transmission.",

There are different routes of HEV transmission from pigs to humans, such as direct contact with the animal, indirectly through contaminated environment and the consumption of pork products. However, the contribution of these different transmission routes can vary tremendously among different settings attributing to multi-factors, such as socioeconomic status, farming systems, food chains and life styles. Nevertheless, the widespread consumption of pork products is inevitably posing a major risk of HEV foodborne transmission in public health. Hepatitis E cases linking to consuming undercooked pork or wild boar meat have been widely reported [8, 9] .",

First, we estimated anti-HEV seroprevalence (indication of ever exposure) and HEV RNA positivity (indication of active infection) in domestic pigs. A total of 84 studies were included to estimate the global anti-HEV seroprevalence, resulting in a pooled rate of 59.33% (37 countries, 95% CI 53.64-64.90, I 2 = 99%; sFig. 2). The highest seroprevalence was found in Oceania (75%, 95% CI 64.28-84.40), but this is only based on one study which likely causes bias in estimation. Fig. 1) . Importantly, we have collected genotyping information of swine HEV. GT3 is universally prevalent across the globe, whereas GT4 is mainly present in Western Pacific region. Interestingly, GT3 and GT4 are co-circulating in countries/territories, such as mainland China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan (Table 1, Fig. 1 ). This is consistent with clinical observations that both GT3 and GT4 HEV patients have been reported from these regions [13] [14] [15] [16] . Although Europe is dominated by GT3, GT4 HEV has been identified in some peculiar cases including chronically infected patients [17] . Here, we found that GT3 and GT4 are also co-circulating in domestic pig populations in Belgium (Fig. 1) . Thus, the emergence of GT4, which is thought to be more pathogenic, requires more attention from both public health and patient care perspectives.",

This generated pooled positive rate of 9.5% (95% CI 5.14-14.90, I 2 = 94%), with 13.27% (95% CI 0.99-35.12, I 2 = 98%) in meat, 6.59% (95% CI 1.83-13.49, I 2 = 92%) in liver and 11.70% (95% CI 7.62-16.47, I 2 = 71%) in sausage (sFig. 10). Sausage production represents a very large industry across the globe, particularly in Europe. Sausages are popular in groceries and sold in a variety of species [18] . We thus further compared the HEV positivity between liver sausage and (Fig. 2 , sFigs. [11] [12] . Finally, we performed sensitivity analysis for HEV prevalence in domestic pigs and wild boars. In this meta-analysis, no significant change was observed by arbitrarily excluding any study from these groups. This low sensitivity supports the reliability of our estimation. However, funnel plot and Egger's test indicate the presence of publication bias (p > 0.05) in three analyses, including seroprevalence and HEV RNA prevalence among domestic swine, and RNA prevalence among wild boars, which may potentially compromise the accuracy of prevalence estimation (sFigs. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Another limitation of our study is that we were unable to estimate HEV prevalence in pork products at regional/country levels and clarify the original place of the products, due to limited data available. Because the current food production and supply chains are diverse and complicated; it has become increasingly important to trace the origin of the contaminated products.",

Nearly 13% domestic and 9.5% wild swine are experiencing active infection. The risk of potential foodborne transmission is highlighted by our estimation that around 10% commercial pork products are HEV RNA positive. However, there remains gaps of translating these knowledge for better understanding the global epidemiology and clinical burden of HEV infection in human population related to zoonotic transmission. Because HEV zoonosis also involves many other factors, including socioeconomic status, farming style, food production and supply, as well as life styles. Nevertheless, our findings have set a stage for future research to further study the role of swine related HEV zoonosis and to facilitate the development of intervention and prevention strategies.",
