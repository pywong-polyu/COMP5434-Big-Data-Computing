            "text": "Objective: To investigate whether the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted healthcare consultations (HCC) and hospitalization among people with and without osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Using register data, we included individuals aged !35 years residing in Sk\u00e5ne region, Sweden, during 2009-2019 with (n \u00bc 123,523) and without (n \u00bc 552,412) a diagnosis of OA during as control as well as dividing data to pre-(January-February) and post-pandemic (March-May), we applied event study design to measure the dynamic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCC/hospitalization. We used fixed-effect Poisson regressions for estimation and subgroup analyses by sex, age, and comorbidity were conducted among OA patients. Results: The impact of the pandemic on healthcare use was evident from mid-March 2020 (34-45%/12-25% reductions in in-person HCC/hospitalization) among people with OA relative to 2017-2019. Smaller reductions were seen in those without OA with 25-34%/8-16% reductions in in-person HCC/hospitalization. On contrary, there were increases in remote HCC following the pandemic (5-25% and 11-31% in people with and without OA, respectively). Among persons with OA, there were variations in the pandemic's effects by sex, age and comorbidity. Conclusion: Despite no lockdown in Sweden there were substantial reductions in in-person healthcare use during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic with greater reductions among people with than without OA.",

The pandemic has imposed major changes in delivery of healthcare services and many healthcare providers restricted the provision of elective and non-essential healthcare procedures [2, 3] . These changes have led to substantial drops in in-person healthcare use (HCU) for different types of care in different countries [4] [5] [6] [7] . These delayed/cancelled HCU might have adverse effects on patient's current and future health. These effects can be more pronounced among those with higher need of healthcare including older adults with chronic conditions. One such subgroup comprises patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who generally use more healthcare than individuals without OA [8, 9] . However, little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCU in OA and in comparison to the general population. Using high-quality individual-level longitudinal register data, we investigated the patterns of HCU before and during the pandemic among people with and without OA in Sweden where no formal lockdown was implemented during the first wave of the COVID-19.",

The SHR is a regional legislative administrative healthcare database covering all healthcare consultations (public and private) in the Sk\u00e5ne region from 1998 onwards.

Healthcare consultations were computed as the sum of primary care and secondary outpatient care visits. Counting healthcare consultations was based on the date of visit, healthcare centre, and type of care provider. Hospital admissions expanded over 2 or more periods were counted as one admission only for the period of admission. We only studied inperson mental health consultations due to large fraction of missing diagnoses for remote consultations.",

In doing so, we treated the year 2020 (the pandemic year) as the intervention group and years 2017-2019 as the control group. We selected March 2, 2020 as the date of the pandemic onset because the Swedish Public Health Agency began recommendations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 [2] and first new COVID-19 infections were identified in the Sk\u00e5ne region in early March 2020 [2] . We then divided our data into pre-and post-pandemic for both intervention and control groups. The main idea is that in the absence of COVID-19, the average HCU in 2020 and 2017-2019 would have followed parallel trends over time (parallel trend assumption). We divided our data into 14-day periods and measured HCU for four pre-pandemic (5/6 January to 1 March) and six post-pandemic (2 March to 25 May) periods. We estimated the following regression model:",

Exploring the patterns of HCU (Fig. 1) revealed that while the OA cohort had, on average, higher all healthcare consultations (in-person & remote) and hospital admissions than the reference cohort in all periods, the temporal trends were very similar. In addition, while people with OA had lower in-person mental healthcare contacts than the reference cohort, the temporal trends were comparable. Moreover, interruptions in HCU following the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is evident for almost all types of healthcare in both cohorts.

A recent systematic review [5] reported a median reduction of 42% in healthcare visits and 28% in hospital admissions following the pandemic which are slightly larger than the reductions estimated in our study. Smaller reductions observed in this study might be attributable to a lack of formal lockdown in Sweden. This suggests that while our estimates might not be directly transferable to countries with formal lockdown, these might provide a \"lower bound\" for the impact of COVID-19 on HCU in persons with OA. Moreover, this systematic review reported [5] greater reductions in healthcare consultations than hospital admissions which are in line with our findings.",

Such voluntary actions should inform developing response strategies to mitigate the effects of potential future pandemics especially among those with higher need for healthcare services. In addition, reductions in HCU despite no formal lockdown We observe increases in remote consultations in 2020 compared with previous years which lasts for the whole study period, with greater rises early on following the pandemic. This suggests that reductions in inperson consultations were partially offset by rises in remote consultations. The rise in remote consultations during the early phase of the pandemic followed by a reduction has also been reported in previous studies, even though the magnitude of the rises were smaller in our study [4, 12, 14] . This might partially be due the fact that video, phone visits and visits through mobile apps are not very frequent as compared to in-person visits. Furthermore, differences in study design, data sources and coding procedures might also contribute to these discrepancies. Further analyses are needed to explain smaller rises in remote consultations in this study. Indeed, if reductions in in-person HCU are not substituted by remote consultations, it can have detrimental effects on population health highlighting the need for further investigation.",

Furthermore, we used historical data to capture trends in the years leading up to 2020 which has been suggested to carry the lowest risk of bias for estimating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [5] . Nevertheless, several limitations of the current study should be acknowledged. No data on healthcare provided by the municipalities (e.g., nursing homes) was available in the register. Moreover, we lack data on certain types of remote consultations including video visits and mobile apps by certain private practitioners. We were unable to capture the OA severity. Potential variations in the pandemic's impact on HCU by OA severity (e.g. persons who underwent total joint replacement) and/or OA site should not be overlooked. Using physicians' diagnostic codes to identify patients with OA is susceptible to coding errors and misclassification, even though our data source had a high positive predictive value (88%) for knee OA diagnosis [15] . Given that Sk\u00e5ne was among the regions less impacted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear if our results are generalizable to the whole of Sweden or other locations.",
