This includes modalities that can readily be used by the public to reduce disease spread and severity. Such preventive measures and early-stage treatments may temper the immediacy of demand for advanced anti-COVID measures (drugs, antibodies, vaccines) and help relieve strain also on other health system resources. Design and Participants. We present results of a clinical study with a multi-component OTC \"core formulation\" regimen used in a multiply exposed adult population. Analysis of clinical outcome data from our sample of over 100 subjects \u00c0 comprised of roughly equal sized regimen-compliant (test) and non-compliant (control) groups meeting equivalent inclusion criteria \u00c0 demonstrates a strong statistical significance in favor of use of the core formulations. Results. While both groups were moderate in size, the difference between them in outcomes over the 20-week study period was large and stark: Just under 4% of the compliant test group presented flu-like symptoms, but none of the test group was COVID-positive; whereas 20% of the non-compliant control group presented flu-like symptoms, three-quarters of whom (15% overall of the control group) were COVID-positive. Conclusions. Offering a low cost, readily implemented anti-viral approach, the study regimen may serve, at the least, as a stopgap modality and, perhaps, as a useful tool in combatting the pandemic.",

For example, research on IBD patients relative to SARS-CoV-2 shows possible protective effects of anti-TNFa antibodies in Crohn's patients. 31 Quercetin as zinc ionophore. Quercetin, a bioflavonoid polyphenol, has been shown to act as a zinc ionophore, 32 enhancing entrance of zinc into cells to inhibit viral intracellular replication. It is also believed to block viruses from entering cells in the first place. An Oak Ridge National Labs/University of Tennessee study of many FDA-approved compounds presented supercomputer modeling results for inhibition by them of SARS-CoV-2 viral S-spike binding to cells. The study ranked quercetin as fifth out of 20 top performers. 33 Studies have shown quercetin also exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties, [34] [35] [36] which could help mitigate the inflammatory response of cytokine and/or bradykinin storms provoked by COVID-19. A wide range of anti-viral/immunity benefits of quercetin have been identified, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] as well as other health benefits that may address some comorbidities of COVID-19 [42] [43] [44] and some of its sequelae. 44, 45 Role of vitamin C. Effects of vitamin C on the immune system (e.g., possible enhancement of activity of NK cells and of other effectors of immunity mechanisms) are well documented. Administration of vitamin C before or after the appearance of flu symptoms seems to, respectively, prevent or ameliorate/alleviate flu symptoms in test populations relative to control populations. 46 Metadata analysis of dozens of studies covering thousands of common cold episodes demonstrated regular supplementation with vitamin C correlating with a modest but consistent reduction in duration of cold symptoms. 47 Role of vitamin D3. COVID-19-related recommendations for vitamin D3 supplementation may go beyond compensation for low UVB (approx. 320-280 nm) exposure directed to restore patients' D3 levels reduced by pandemic-mitigating lockdown/shut-in restrictions. Review studies support a protective role of vitamin D3 supplementation in prevention of acute respiratory tract infection. 48 Recent reports suggest that vitamin D3 plays a significant role in immune system function 49 and, in particular, in susceptibility to Role of vitamin E. Vitamin E has been shown to enhance immune system function and reduce risk of infection, particularly in older individuals, via modulation of T cell function by directly impacting T cell membrane integrity, signal transduction and cell division, and by indirectly affecting inflammatory mediators generated by other immune cells. 51 There are additional data suggesting vitamin E's role in modulation of macrophages, NK cells and B cells. 52 Role of L-Lysine. L-lysine has been shown to improve immune system function. 53 The mechanism of immunological enhancement by which l-lysine supplementation reduces infection rates is thought to be via its raising of zinc serum levels, apparently by facilitating zinc absorption from the gut; additionally, CD4 T cell count shows an increase. 54 ",

Despite their repeated exposures to clinically-and/or test-confirmed COVID-19 carriers, this sub-group presented no cases of COVID-19. c. Self-reporting, both of compliance and of off-site exposures, can be suspected of introducing biasing of data (stemming from subjects' desire to please the physician, researcher and/or employer). Here, one should note-perhaps a tribute to our practice's amicable and accepting atmosphere-that subjects had had no difficulty or hesitation declining the study regimen; opting out from groups and sub-groups during the study; and reporting only partial compliance with the core formulations and methods-all of which bolster a strong presumption of truth-telling in the self-reporting. Given the above limitations and as would be appropriate with any single moderately scaled study, we recommend care in interpretation of the study results. However, it is our hope that the study will serve as a basis for future larger-scale studies of enhanced design.",

Thus, a combined likelihood of post-exposure symptom-presentation would range over approximately 4-24%, with the high end reflected, perhaps (assuming only 1 exposure, on average, per subject), in our study control group's experience of 12/60 \u00bc 20% symptom-presentation.",
