The range of symptoms associated with each infection can be wide ranging in both presentation and severity, depending on age of the patient, underlying co-morbidities and other confounding factors. In this chapter we describe the most common respiratory infections ranging from relatively mild infections such as the common cold, through to more serious presentations including pneumonia. Data are presented from a general practitioner morbidity surveillance system based in England and Wales. Each acute respiratory syndrome is described in respect of seasonality, secular trends and microbiological aetiology providing an insight into the complex nature of these acute respiratory episodes. The more serious endpoints of acute respiratory infections are hospitalisation and death. Many acute respiratory infections are mild in nature and generally self-limiting and therefore do not commonly require further medical interventions. However, despite major advances in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections in recent years, hospitalisation and deaths continue to exert pressures on national health resources and provide an economic burden in countries across the world on an annual basis.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections present one of the most common reasons for consulting a general practitioner (GP) in England and Wales [1] . Approximately 30% of the general population consulted at least once because of a respiratory illness during the 1991/92 GP-based National Morbidity Survey: by 2001, the proportion had fallen to 25% and by 2007 to 21% [2] . Eighty five per cent of all episodes of illness classified to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) chapter on respiratory disorders are due to acute respiratory infections. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Weekly Returns Service (WRS), a sentinel GP surveillance network located across England and Wales has monitored the incidence of acute respiratory infections since 1966 [3] . In 1991 approximately 18% of all consultations were attributable to the respiratory chapter of the ICD9; the vast majority of these were acute respiratory infections [4] . In recent years this proportion has decreased due to reducing numbers of respiratory infections diagnosed, and increasing numbers of total consultations [5, 6] . There are large age-related differences in the illness episode and consultation rates with children reporting much higher rates of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and older persons higher rates of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). In pre-school children (aged less than 5 years), the incidence of respiratory infections is higher in males than females; in school children and the elderly there is no gender difference; in most adult years reported incidence is higher in females, partly because of gender bias in consultation but also partly because of a greater potential of spread from children.",

Influenza B and C are found almost exclusively in humans with sporadic isolations in seals and pigs [7, 8] and cause relatively mild seasonal outbreaks of disease [9] . The natural reservoir of influenza A is in aquatic birds [10] . There are further subgroups of influenza A [10, 11] . The ability of influenza A viruses to undergo major genetic reassortments (antigenic shift) makes them ideal candidates for causing major outbreaks of disease on a global scale. Over the last century, three influenza pandemics have led to the introduction of novel variants into the human population: H1N1 (1918/19) ; H2N2 (1957/58); and H3N2 (1968/69) [12] . Currently, two influenza A subtypes H3N2 and H1N1 (reintroduced in 1977/78) circulate in the human population. Despite recent scares involving highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, e.g. H5N1, H7N7 causing severe disease and high mortality rates in humans, efficient human-to-human transmission has yet to be confirmed and therefore these isolated incidents have not developed into potential pandemic strains.",

Influenza viruses are not consistent in their circulation; however, one can generalise their circulation as peaking during winter months, mainly between November and February. It has been noted that the more severe epidemics (for example in 1989/90) have started earlier in the winter, and peaked well before the Christmas/New Year period. Influenza B virus circulation is distinct from influenza A as these viruses commonly circulate later in the winter. Typically, influenza B circulation follows that of influenza A, and viruses can be isolated from cases during February and into March.",

Generally, the term is taken to mean an acute URTI with rhinitis and variable degrees of pharyngitis.

Incidence rate per 100 000 population of acute bronchitis in young children aged 0-4 years compared with laboratory reports for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) over selected winters [42] . children, the fever tends to be less than that associated with influenza. Colds are caused by a range of viruses such as RV, adenovirus and HCoV. Viruses such as influenza and RSV may also cause symptoms that are commonly described as a cold, although we tend to associate these viruses with more severe respiratory symptoms. A plot of the weekly incidence of URTI and LRTI averaged over a 6-year period (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) shows how the two types of illness show the same trend, suggesting a common aetiology (Fig. 3) . The incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) and the common cold in children aged 0-4 years is plotted over 4 selected winters in Figure 4 , again suggesting a common aetiology [43] . The common cold is usually a mild selflimiting acute respiratory illness; however, symptoms may be more severe in younger children. The duration of illness is mostly about 7 days but the acute phase lasts 3-4 days. In addition to AOM, the common cold may trigger exacerbations of asthma and cause sinusitis [27] . The mild self-limiting nature of URTI prompts only limited collection of clinical specimens for virological investigation from routine disease management and thus it is difficult to be specific about aetiology in the majority of cases of common cold and URTI.",

The mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses is continuous with the upper respiratory tract and is subject to the catarrhal oedema and mucosal congestion affecting the entire upper respiratory tract when subject to infection or to pollen sensitisation. The label acute sinusitis describes infection in any of the paranasal sinuses (frontal, ethmoidal, maxillary) but is usually reserved to describe secondary bacterial infection [52] . This arises because sinus drainage becomes blocked and the relevant sinus fills up with pus that does not drain properly. The increased pressure created causes local pain and tenderness, which is usually readily apparent on percussion of the area. It is commonly accompanied by a sensation of blockage and by pus in the nose. The sense of smell is impaired or lost. The diagnosis is prompted by the history and local tenderness but can be confirmed by X-ray. Treatment includes nasal decongestants and antibiotics with surgical drainage in non-responding cases. Some people get particularly frequent episodes and develop nasal polyps. Nasal polypectomy and surgical measures to improve drainage are sometimes needed for these patients.",

However, the magnitude of the difference and the fact that it is not seen in most other respiratory infections suggest that this is not a sufficient explanation for the difference. We speculate that the anatomical architecture in females is more prone to blockage than that in males. It could also be partly explained by the difficulty of distinguishing the head pain from a migraine attack, which is well recognized as commoner in females.

Although this was useful advice and a suitable warning for an anxious parent, it is a limited view of this illness in young children (less than 12 months of age), where the illness is particularly serious because of the small airways. The disease in this age group commonly progresses more rapidly than in older children and adults. Clinically, it is diagnosed on hearing the classical paroxysmal cough which leaves the sufferer gasping for breath and often quite cyanosed.

Management of the acute condition involves the use of cough and spasm suppressants, plus a course of erythromycin, provided it can be started early in the course of the illness (it is of less use if administered later than 2 weeks after onset). Erythromycin should also be considered in infant contacts who have not yet received primary immunisation. Any decrease in the uptake of pertussis vaccination is likely to lead to an increased possibility of transmission from an older sibling to vulnerable young babies sometimes before there has been an opportunity to offer them immunisation. In older children and adults, whooping cough may present as an acute spasmodic cough with increasing intensity over 3 weeks, but these symptoms can be very protracted.",

Occasionally, tonsillitis may progress to cause a peritonsillar abscess which may even require surgical drainage. Although it is no longer fashionable to give penicillin to everyone with a sore or even streptococcal sore throat, patients with any of these complications should be treated with a 10-day course of Penicillin V administered intramuscularly if there is any difficulty with oral administration [64] .",

It differs from tonsillitis with the extensive distribution of lymphadenopathy and the presence of an enlarged or tender spleen. However, in mild cases it is not always easy to distinguish the two conditions. The diagnosis should be established by the Paul-Bunnell blood test or by culture of the Epstein-Barr virus from a throat swab specimen.

During the 1969/70 winter all age rates of ILI reached 1252 per 100 000 in week 1 of 1970. In the following decade, rates of ILI remained relatively high. During subsequent decades the clinical incidence of ILI has gradually fallen, a trend seen with other common respiratory infections [6] . The last major epidemic occurred in 1989/90, when the prevailing influenza A H3 virus infected persons of all ages but particularly children aged 0-4 years in whom the recorded incidence exceeded that seen in the pandemic which hit the UK in the winter of 1969/70 (Fig. 8) . During the Millennium winter (1999/00) the National Health Service in England was severely stretched due to an influenza epidemic and there were dramatic news stories of persons spending several hours on trolleys in corridors while a hospital bed could be found [70] . Although the ILI activity was not particularly great in magnitude, it impacted on the 45-64 and 65+ years age groups (Fig. 8 ): respiratory infections in these age groups are more likely to result in hospital admission, and longer stays in hospital [71] . The hospital admission pressures in the Millennium winter came partly also from persons requiring admission for acute bronchitis, which was likely due to viruses other than influenza, in particular to RSV [70] . During the winter 2003/04 a novel strain of influenza H3N2 spread throughout the UK and other parts of the world [72, 73] . This \"Fujian-like\" strain was particularly virulent in young children as monitored by GP surveillance data; in contrast, in the winters of 1999/00 and 2007/08 it impacted on older age groups (25-44 and 65+ years, respectively) with a relatively low incidence of ILI recorded in young children (Johnson et al., unpublished results) .",

Several factors may have contributed to the reduction. In part it may be due to a reduced likelihood of consultation caused for example by changes in the statutory requirements for sickness certification; however, that has no bearing on the consultation rates in children or the elderly. Changes in consulting behaviour for uncomplicated respiratory tract infections may have been instigated by promotional campaigns discouraging patients from consulting doctors for \"colds and the 'flu\". The introduction of the tele-health service NHS Direct may also have had an effect by, in effect, providing a triage Figure 8 .

Incidence rates are centred around the peak week (week 0) \u00b15 weeks. service, advising uncomplicated and low risk respiratory cases to self-treat at home [74] . Other potential factors reducing the incidence of ILI include: the overall health of the general population has improved in recent decades due to reductions in pollution/smoking, and smaller family sizes, providing less opportunity for virus spread. Viewed over a 40-year period, however, changes in the incidence of respiratory infections are not the same for all conditions, suggesting that the changes are more complex, probably relating to changes in the circulating viruses and in their transmission characteristics [75] . For influenza in particular, the more severe epidemics over the last years have been caused by influenza A H3N2 viruses and have involved numerous mutations [76] : perhaps we are reaching an evolutionary end point.",

The presentation and diagnosis of acute bronchitis is usually associated with cough as the chief symptom sometimes accompanied by wheeze and pain on coughing and by fever. The diagnosis is usually made when the cough is productive and rales are heard on auscultation of the chest. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is often problematic due to the difficulty in differentiating from asthma. This differentiation presents the GP with problems, especially in young children, where there is no satisfactory distinction between asthma and acute bronchitis when it first appears. Mostly, the diagnosis of asthma follows a series of ill-nesses described variously as wheezy or acute bronchitis. For some persons, there is a strong tendency of respiratory infections to prompt attacks of asthma. In Figure 9 a comparison is made between WRS weekly incidence data averaged over 10 years for asthma attacks and for acute bronchitis in children of 5-14 years.

The differences between the two respiratory conditions are indicative of differing aetiologies.

Seasonality Acute bronchitis demonstrates a clear seasonal peak during the last weeks of the year. Interestingly, there are differences in the peak between age groups as previously reported. The incidence of acute bronchitis in young children (0-4 years) peaks during week 48; the peak in the elderly (65+ years) is approximately 2-3 weeks later; this finding is consistent from season to season and probably represents the mode of spread from young children to the elderly during the holiday period at Christmas and New Year (Fig. 11) .

Although often a secondary complication of viral or bacte- rial infections, primary viral pneumonia is associated with clinical features including non-productive cough, and in more severely ill patients, cyanosis and hypoxemia. Viral causes of pneumonia are mainly associated with influenza and RSV infection, although more recent literature suggest that serious LRTI including pneumonia can be caused by a wide range of viral pathogens and the seasonality of pneumonia suggests that even though caused by a bacterial pathogen it is often consequent on a viral infection [30] .",

Therefore, in respect of estimating numbers of deaths resulting from these infections, this work is predominantly concentrated on these two pathogens. It has been estimated that during the 1990s in England and Wales an average of 12 000 deaths (all-cause mortality) were attributable to influenza each winter [84] . However, it is important to remember that these estimates were made using data collected at a time when there were much higher rates of community-based influenza activity than at present: therefore, current estimates would probably be lower. In the USA, Thompson et al. [76] studied age-specific pneumonia and influenza deaths and estimated those attributable to influenza and RSV. Over the winters 1990/91 to 1998/99 there were 8097 and 2707 underlying pneumonia and influenza deaths associated with influenza and RSV, respectively. In the age-specific analysis, 90% of influenza and 78% of RSV-related respiratory and circulatory deaths occurred in the 65+ years age group [76] : a similar study based on mortality data from England provided similar estimates of deaths [85] . These data highlight the severe impact of respiratory infections, in particular influenza and RSV, on the elderly population. We have recently undertaken an analysis of admissions due to ILI and acute bronchitis with respiratory emergency and all deaths against a background of influenza and RSV 'active periods' [80] . Clinical incidence rates of ILI and acute bronchitis both peak during virus active periods; however, it is clear that the greatest impact occurs during periods of RSV activity. In winters where both virus active periods coincide, e.g. 1999/00, this impact is greatest [70] . In the years where there is good separation between periods of virus activity, it is easier to disentangle the associated effects from each virus, and again it is clear that the clinical, admission and death statistics all increase more during periods of RSV activity (Fig. 13) . The active period for RSV, as it affects persons over 65 years, is based on a 3-week lag behind RSV reports in infants, which in turn is taken from the lag in clinical incidence between acute bronchitis as diagnosed in young children and in adults.",
