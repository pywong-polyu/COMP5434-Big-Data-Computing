Despite the life-saving benefits of ICD treatment, the literature suggests that a number of patients experience significant psychological distress following implant [2, 3] . Several challenges may contribute to ICD-related distress, including: the diagnosis and management of a potentially life-threatening cardiac condition; reliance on a device; an altered sense of self; and living with the potential for shock and mortality [4, 5] . A recent review of patient perspectives of living with an ICD highlighted the importance of addressing patients' key concerns [6] . Patient dissatisfaction was associated with a misalignment in priorities, with healthcare professionals over-emphasising clinical aspects rather than their patients' actual concerns, such as quality of life and normal functioning post-implantation. Understanding the aspects of living with an ICD that patients find most challenging and offering targeted support which addresses these issues is therefore imperative to improving patient care.",

            "text": "The first aim of this study was to explore patients' key ICD concerns and perspectives of living with an ICD. The quantitative data indicated variable levels of ICD concerns with a median score on the ICDC-B comparable to that found in previous studies [13, 14] . The qualitative findings from the patient surveys provided further insight into patients' key concerns and perspectives of living with an ICD. As found previously [15] , this study demonstrated that ICDs are well accepted by many patients, with over half of the participants reporting that their ICD had minimal impact on their lives. Furthermore, some patients described improved emotional well-being, due to the reassurance and safety net acquired by having an ICD, or improved functioning, due to a reduction in cardiac symptoms. However, a sizable minority of participants described emotional difficulties, namely increased anxiety, self-identity and role changes, practical adjustments and physical discomfort. These challenges are consistent with difficulties described by patients with ICDs in previous studies [5] , but healthcare providers often do not have the time or resources to address these concerns as they have to prioritise the clinical aspects of patients' care during medical consultations [6] . The provision of specialised support which addresses these broader aspects of living with an ICD is likely to significantly improve patient care. Amongst the patients who described feeling more anxious since having their ICD, fear of shocks was a common concern. Many studies have shown that anxiety about the potential for shocks is highly prevalent amongst ICD patients [16] and that concerns about shock, rather than a shock itself, determine psychological adjustment [10] . Providing psychological support to help patients manage this anticipatory anxiety is likely to be another crucial element of an ICD support group.",

These findings suggest that patients may most need and be most likely to attend a support group if it is offered in the earlier stages after their implant. The most popular topics to be included in a support group were information about heart conditions, the impact of an ICD on daily life, information about ICD devices and coping with fear of shocks. It is vital that patients are provided with an appropriate space to ask questions and develop accurate beliefs about their heart condition and device. A poor understanding of one's device predicts poor psychological adjustment [18] and it is well documented that inaccurate health beliefs are associated with adjustment difficulties [19] . Patients indicating that they would also highly value the opportunity to discuss the broader impact of their ICD on their daily life and how to cope with fear of shocks further indicates that these are pertinent issues that patients with ICDs require further support with.",

It would be valuable for future research to examine whether other previously identified risk factors for ICD-related distress, such as history of ICD shock, ICD knowledge, ICD acceptance, ethnicity, and specific type of ICD device, also relate to patient interest in an ICD support group. Another limitation is that demographic and clinical data were not collated for the eligible patients who declined to participate, which may reduce the generalisability of the findings.
