Assumptions about the presence and relative importance of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission are based on case reports, the failing of quarantine measures aimed at sequestering ill patients, viral dynamic studies suggesting SARS-CoV-2 production peaks before symptoms appear, and modeling evidence that calculates serial interval between successive generations of infection. In aggregate, these data offer compelling evidence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, but individually these studies have notable shortcomings that undermine their conclusions. The purpose of this review is to discuss the literature of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, highlight limitations of recent studies, and propose experiments that, if conducted, would provide a more definitive analysis of the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

On January 14, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that \"there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\" of SARS-CoV-2. [1] Six days later, when WHO announced evidence of human to human transmission, countries were left scrambling to enact policy to identify and isolate the ill. [2] Only after these efforts failed, were the more comprehensive quarantine and isolation policies enacted in cities like Wuhan, China. In the absence of definitive evidence of asymptomatic transmission, these intervention policies were made out of an abundance of caution. Understanding the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility is key to safely and successfully reopening our cities, states, and countries until the development of an effective vaccine. Unfortunately, with nearly 8 million confirmed cases and over 434,000 deaths, there is still confusion and a dearth of adequate research around the dynamics of transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population. [3] On June 8 th , 2020, WHO official Maria Van Kerkhove said that asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus was \"very rare.\" However, she later clarified this statement saying, \"the available evidence from contact tracing reported by Member States [of WHO] suggests that asymptomatically-infected individuals are much less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms.\" [4] Given the absence of definitive information, and because of the importance of this question, there is an urgent need to direct high quality studies towards examining asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

[7] Infectivity in cell culture is the standard for determining whether a patient is infectious. In the absence of viral culture data, viral load or cycle threshold (Ct) values derived from RT-PCR data has been used as a proxy for the likelihood of transmission. The Ct is the number of replication cycles required for a signal of RT-PCR product to cross a determined threshold. This value is inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid or viral load in the sample -in particular, high Ct values indicate low viral load. In a study of 90 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, Bullard and colleagues found that virus was only successfully isolated when Ct value was below 24. [8] Asymptomatic viral dynamic studies -current understanding A small number of studies have attempted to look at viral dynamics in asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. One study, from a skilled nursing facility in Kings County, Washington, found viral growth in a patient sample with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 34, as well as viral growth in asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. [9] However, findings in elder care facility may not reflect the general population. It is difficult to recognize early signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infections in elderly populations due to impaired immune responses associated with aging and the high prevalence of preexisting and underlying conditions, such as chronic cough and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, elderly and infirm patients have blunted physiological responses that may allow them to remain apparently asymptomatic during infection. Influenza, another respiratory virus, often manifests with few or atypical symptoms in this population, resulting in confounding of when symptoms are first reported and undermining efforts to isolate ill patients. [9] A second report, looking at individuals exposed during a flight from China to Frankfurt, identified one case of asymptomatic infection and one case of presymptomatic infection with positive culture infectivity. [10] This study does not provide information about the passengers' health or age, and there is likely to be a bias to downplay mild or moderate symptoms in the context of being detained while traveling. Although these studies have attempted to look at viral dynamics in asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals in specific populations, to date the authors are not aware of any studies that have successfully cultured live virus from asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals in the general population.",

            "text": "Viral illnesses have varying transmission profiles. Seasonal influenza is characterized by having peak viral load one day after symptom onset, and individuals generally have detectable levels of RNA from two days before clinical symptoms appear to eight days afterward. [12] Although asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals may shed influenza virus, studies have not determined if such people effectively transmit influenza. [13] Other viral illnesses like MERS, SARS and Ebola are notable because infectivity appears to increase later in course of illness. MERS-CoV concentrations peaked during the second week of illness. [14] Ebola virus does not appear to have presymptomatic transmission, though individuals can remain infectious for long periods of time after symptoms resolve. [15] Notably, in the case of SARS-CoV, infectiousness peaked 7-10 days after symptom onset. [16] Understanding the viral dynamics and transmission profile of a virus is critically important because it informs the most effective outbreak curtailment strategies. In the case of SARS-CoV and Ebola viruses, efforts aimed at sequestering the ill and contact tracing are highly effective. In the case of influenza virus, contact tracing must extend to the presymptomatic phase, and more aggressive prophylactic containment strategies are necessary. Efforts to curtail SARS-CoV-2 virus will rely on successful contact tracing to halt further transmission. Decisions on how far back to trace contacts and if/when to test asymptomatic contacts will rely on a comprehensive understanding of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission.",

While studying COVID-19 in China, Zhang and colleagues found that an average of 2.5 days elapsed between symptom onset and first healthcare consultation. [56] Although this decreased from 3.0 to 1.6 days as the pandemic progressed. If individuals are only infectious for 8 days, as Bullard and colleagues report, this delay in seeking care greatly confounds our ability to measure comprehensive viral dynamics. [8, 38] Additionally, the studies do not disclose how soon the first swab was taken after symptoms were reported; a margin of error of a day might dramatically change the viral load in patients. While the finding that viral load appears to peak soon after symptoms are detected in patients suggests that presymptomatic transmission is plausible, there is not enough information about the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics in presymptomatic stage to conclude when infectiousness begins.",

Hypothetical distributions of SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Different assumptions about the shape of the distributions will impact when and if presymptomatic transmission will occur. A line indicating the threshold of transmissibility is shown in purple, which is currently believed to be 10 6 copies per mL. The intersection of the purple line with the various curves would show when an individual becomes contagious. In these hypothetical distributions, a normal and Weibull distribution suggest significant presymptomatic transmission, while a gamma and lognormal distribution seem to suggest limited presymptomatic transmission. These conclusions can change with different transmission thresholds and distribution parameters. A vertical dashed line in grey shows when an individual might seek medical consultation, which Zhang and colleagues report as being 2.5 days after symptom onset in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. [53] Although this number decreased from 3.0 to 1.6 days as the pandemic progressed. Assuming patients don't seek medical care for 2.5 days, the light-yellow shaded region refers to the area where data is lacking.

The authors combined RT-PCR measurement with viral culturing and found that the success of virus isolation in culture was a function of viral load: only samples that contained greater than 10 6 copies per mL yielded an isolate (although Ct value was not reported in this study, He et al. reports this corresponds to a Ct value of 24). [42] Interestingly no isolates were obtained after day 8, despite continuing high viral loads. This finding suggests persistent RNA detection represents non-viable virus that is not infectious. This finding demonstrates that while viral load can be predictive of transmissibility, it is not a perfect correlation. The Despite the attempt to comprehensively profile SARS-CoV-2 kinetics, all eight of these studies were limited in their scope because they were not able to swab patients before symptom onset. An additional limitation of these studies is that many failed to specify the exact schedule of when patient swabs were collected. Only one study, To et al. mentioned a precise collection schedule that applied to all patients. It is also worth noting that nasopharyngeal swabs are an imperfect proxy for viral production. Studies on influenza have shown variability in viral load when sampling left and right nostrils and this finding will likely be similar for SARS-CoV-2. [43] Perhaps the most important limitation of these studies is that the studies either did not specify or did not exclude individuals who were undergoing treatment. Undergoing was not disclosed, and therefore the viral load data cannot be ascertained in relation to symptom onset.",

It is difficult to control for quality and bias from these publicly available reports. These datasets are compiled from human-to-human transmission reports from different countries, jurisdictions, and points in time. These factors may impact standards of reporting cases or symptom onset. In addition to bias or error in the publicly sourced data, all of the serial interval studies are confounded by their reliance on self-reported symptom start date. As stated earlier in this paper, what is considered a symptom varies by region, culture, age, and time, and the definition of symptoms has become more expansive as time has progressed. For example, patients who notice loss of smell may have an earlier symptom start date than a patient who only reports fever and dry cough.

            "text": "Many studies of serial interval are biased towards household transmission because it is more straightforward to isolate transmission chains and rule out other sources of infection in a household setting. In household transmission cases, newly infected individuals will likely be exposed to a much higher dose of viral particulates than would occur in a more casual transmission case. Exposure to higher inoculum may result in a decreased incubation period for household transmission. Given that the papers compared serial intervals to estimates of incubation period, the difference in inoculum between household transmission and community transmission may account for the difference between the calculated serial interval and incubation period. The interpretation of this data is further complicated by the fact that estimates of incubation period vary between studies. We preferentially reported the mean serial interval (red circle). If mean was not reported, median was used (red triangle). However, it should be noted that in skewed distributions such as gamma and lognormal, median is often less than mean. In the case of Wu et al. the mean was noted as 6.3, but no error terms were reported, therefore median was used in the figure. Error bars default to show 95% CI on serial interval on statistic, however if 95% CI was not reported, 1 st and 3 rd quartiles were used (denoted by *) or +/-1 standard deviation (denoted by \u2020). Error bars that extended below zero were not shown but are reported in supplemental Mean serial interval was preferentially reported for the studies in this review and is denoted as a red circle on the graph of Figure 3 .

While the study by Ding and colleagues had the purpose of examining the viral kinetics during antiviral treatment, data focusing on viral load after therapeutic interventions cannot provide insight into the viral dynamics of the natural history of infection. Antiviral and interferon treatments should diminish viral replication and artificially cause viral load to peak at the start of treatment, while steroid treatment may dampen the immune response and potentially cause viral replication to increase. If the viral load data is a basis for clinical decision making, this will even further confound results because an increasing viral load would be the basis for more extensive interventions and therapeutic treatment. There is an urgent need to study the viral kinetics in presymptomatic individuals. Kim et al. analyzed the Ct values of three presymptomatic patients and found the highest levels of virus were one to two days before symptom onset. However, this dataset is extremely small (n=3), and one of the patients was on the threshold of detection. It is hard to reliably extract general trends from this limited sample. Zhou et al. studied the viral dynamics of 31 patients who were asymptomatic upon hospital admission for laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Twenty-two of the patients went on to develop symptoms while nine remained asymptomatic by the case definition used in the study. When comparing the viral dynamics of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals, Zhou et al. found asymptomatic individuals had lower Ct values, and had peak viral loads in the second week of hospitalization.

Even if broad community transmission is not observed, it is still extremely difficult to rule out other sources of infection. Future studies should use viral sequence to more precisely determine sources of infection and transmission chains. Additionally, the temporal variation in what is classified as a symptom of COVID-19, combined with bias and reporting errors, make anecdotal reports of symptom start date unreliable. These factors confound the case reports that highlight asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission and make it difficult to draw reliable conclusions.Viral DynamicsThe preliminary SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics studies demonstrate that viral titer peaks at patient presentation. Without more knowledge of the temporal distribution of viral load, presymptomatic transmission cannot be conclusively shown. In interpreting viral dynamic studies, a sharp rise in viral load, as would be observed if viral load followed a lognormal or gamma distribution, may link infectiousness with the start of symptom onset. On the other hand, a normal or Weibull distribution in viral load supports the possibility of presymptomatic transmission. It is important that the viral dynamics data be validated with culture data on infectivity. As Wolfel and colleagues demonstrated, while viral load is a proxy for infectivity and transmissibility, it is not perfectly correlated.Nasopharyngeal swabs are an imperfect proxy for viral production, and any study on viral dynamics must account for high levels of variability in swab samples. Future research efforts should focus on other methods of virus harvesting including throat, blood, fecal, or urine samples, and must prioritize quantifying viral load from individuals in the presymptomatic stage.",

This systematic review attempted to comprehensively document and analyze literature on asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting, especially because of the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is likely a risk of systemic bias in manuscripts published on this topic. Although all efforts were made to include a comprehensive review of the literature, the rapid progression and influx of new publications, as well as prevalence of preprint manuscripts on this topic, mean this literature review was likely affected by incomplete retrieval of identified research.",

For example, it is difficult to recognize early signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infections in elderly populations, due to impaired immune responses associated with aging and the high prevalence of preexisting and underlying conditions, such as chronic cough and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, elderly and infirm patients have blunted physiological responses that may allow them to remain asymptomatic during infection. On the other hand, younger individuals may be more likely to remain asymptomatic. Studies can only represent the demographic they study.Small sample sizes are more subject to bias and skewed results.Many studies of transmission and serial interval recall on patients self-reported symptom onset date. Recall bias and other errors can alter when an individual reports symptom onset date.In case report and serial interval studies it is impossible to rule out other sources of infection. This confounds determining if presymptomatic transmission occurred. Future studies can use viral genome sequence to better determine source of infection.",
