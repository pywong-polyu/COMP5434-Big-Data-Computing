First, patients are asked to email us photos showing their 1 area of concern. Second, in a select group of patients with access to compatible social media 2 services, we have allowed for video calls with providers. Third, we started incorporating secured 3 video conference call services provided by EPIC, which has facilitated live evaluation of 4 patients' concerns. All non-urgent patients are treated conservatively with compression, 5 elevation, and exercise. Since the peak in Minnesota is projected to be in July 2020, our 6 leadership has asked proceduralists to review all rescheduled and pending cases, and provide 7 their insight regarding urgency.

While most venous insufficiency cases are 11 considered elective, delaying care may result in complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 12 or stasis ulcer. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that early endovenous ablation of superficial 13 venous reflux results in faster wound healing 1 . Consequently, it is crucial to weight the risk of 14 delaying these cases in order to reduce viral transmission, with the benefit of reducing venous 15 disease related complications. In accordance with state, federal and medical societies' 16 recommendations, our institution has made drastic practice changes. This involved rescheduling 17 all elective procedures including venous cases and postponing all venous insufficiency 18 ultrasound studies. Patients with suspected venous stasis ulcers or DVT, are allowed to have 19 appropriate testing, and in some instances seen in the clinic. All postponed office visits, vascular 20 laboratory studies and procedures have been recorded in a database in order to be rescheduled 21 once the COVID-19 related restrictions are over.
