            "text": "Aging is a complex and multietiological process that involves gradual and spontaneous biochemical and physiological changes, such as increased susceptibility to diseases, exposure to harmful environmental conditions, and a loss of mobility and agility [1] . The body's major functions, such as the circulatory and digestive systems, the endocrine system, and the immune system, deteriorate over time. Similarly, one of the signs of aging is the deterioration of cognitive and memory functions [2] .As people get older, the quantitative and functional characteristics of various types of immune cells deteriorate, resulting in a proclivity for inflammation, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, a decreased ability to maintain tolerance to self-antigens, and a reduced response to immunisation [3, 4] .Previous research has found a strong link between immune function and age, with older people's PBMC cell proliferation being lower than that of younger people [5] . As a result, when compared to other age groups, older adults are more susceptible to infectious diseases that are more frequent and last longer. As a result, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), older adults in the United States accounted for more than 92.45% of COVID-19 deaths in the country as of December 2020 [4] . Despite the significant progress made with current vaccines, the majority of vaccines still fail to provide long-term immunity in older adults [6] . Natural adjuvants, for example, have been accepted as effective strategies for increasing the immunogenicity of existing vaccines proposed in recent years, and they may provide effective protection for older adults [4] . Plant-derived adjuvants are relatively nontoxic and do not cause significant side effects, which is a major concern with synthetic compounds; second, they have been shown to potentiate the immune response, making their use in the development of vaccines appealing [7] . Natural dietary polyph\u00e9nols, particularly quercetin, have been shown to have profound effects on immunity, according to research literature, and thus could be used as adjuvants [8] . Quercetin, 3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone, is a widely distributed secondary metabolite in plants that is one of the most abundant vegetal flavonoids in the human diet. Apples, onions, berries, leafy green vegetables, hot peppers, red grapes, and black tea are all good sources of antioxidants. Quercetin has antioxidant, free radical-scavenging, and anti-inflammatory properties that could affect immune system competence and pathogen resistance [9] . Existing research shows that quercetin has senescence-delaying activity in primary cells and rejuvenating effects in senescent cells in vitro [10] . Quercetin exhibits adjuvant activity by enhancing Th2 immune response in ovalbumin-immunised mice, according to previous studies demonstrating the results of immunisation with plant phenolics [8] . In the present study, we assessed in vitro quercetin treatment-induced changes on PBMCs cell proliferation, pro-/anti-oxidant state, IL-2, and nitric oxide release from both young and elderly subjects to better understand the possible clinical uses and safety of quercetin as vaccinal adjuvants, particularly for the elderly. Quercetin (Sigma Aldrich, France) was dissolved in DMSO ( <1% in culture medium) to make a stock solution (200 \u03bcg/ml) ; the final concentration of quercetin in the culture medium was 20 \u03bcg/ml . DMSO concentrations less than 1% were previously found to be neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic to mammalian cells.",

It is self-evident that a healthy immune system is required for effective defence against pathogenic organisms. thus, people with weakened immune systems are more likely to become infected and have more serious infections [17] . Unfortunately, as people get older, they develop immunosenescence, which is characterised by a reduced response to antigens and vaccines [6] . The current study backs up our previous findings, which show that when PBMC is stimulated solely by Con a, proliferation is significantly reduced in elderly people compared to young controls. The immunosuppressive mechanisms involve a series of cellular and molecular events involving the alteration of several biochemical pathways and cell populations [3] . Importantly, Con a in combination with quercetin significantly increased PBMC proliferation in both elderly and young cells. In PBMCs, quercetin appears to stimulate cellular proliferation by acting on the oestrogen receptor (ER), and evidence suggests that physiologically relevant quercetin concentrations can exert phytoestrogen-like activity [18] ; it can also activate GC-A or other isoforms of guanylate cyclase. [19] . Several age-related changes in immune functions and impaired cell proliferation may be linked to oxidative stress, according to Harman's free radicals theory of ageing. At the cellular level, excessive amounts of ROS cause damage to cellular components such as carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, DNA, and proteins; thus, excessive amounts of ROS cause damage. [20] . It is well known that the concentration of oxidised biomolecules, such as MDA and PC, rises with age. [21] . When a hydrogen atom is removed from the methyl group of an Increased cellular oxidative stress plays an important role in immunosenescence and cellular aging [23] .Changes in the permeability of the cell membrane may occur when lipid peroxidation is increased.",
