This reason, combined with the increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences available and its crescent polymorphism, led us to design a set of new primers that can address very conserved regions of the virus genomes. Therefore, to aid PCR optimization, the UFRN_primers were designed to present Tm values that were as close as possible. These settings will probably enable the use of at least two systems using the same thermal cycling parameters. In this way, it would be possible to perform the PCR test identifying different viral genome regions simultaneously, according to the protocols already described for the PD_primers. In this context, possibly the systems UFRN_3 and UFRN_4 will have different thermal cycling parameters compared to the other systems since, in this case, the probe Tm is similar to the primers (Table 1) . Probably these systems will depend on more annealing time to ensure that the probe has interacted in the DNA template before the amplification starts.",

UFRN_primers are strong candidates to simplify the procedures and supply chain for detecting SARS-CoV-2, allowing, for example, the mass production of primers and kits that could be applied in different parts of the world with equivalent efficiency. However, the primers presented here still depend on in vitro validation. The availability of these sequences at this time will be crucial so that these new protocols can be validated promptly to assist in the control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Another critical point is that primers presented here were tested against the updated RNA sequences databases from bacteria, fungi, and protozoa and did not generate nonspecific amplicons in any case. Although executed through in silico analyses, this lack of prediction increases the potential for applying these primers to different samples such as blood, feces, or even environmental samples. Currently, the most suitable sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is the human nasal swab; however, there are already studies that have shown digestive symptoms (e.g. diarrhea and vomiting) 10, 11 and other less frequent symptoms (e.g. conjunctivitis) in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 [12] [13] [14] . This diversity of symptoms makes clinical diagnosis difficult, and testing new types of samples may be needed quickly. The application of UFRN_primers to detect SARS-CoV-2 in blood or fecal samples is likely efficient since these primers should not interact non-specifically with RNAs of the main protozoa and bacteria that cause health problems in humans.",
