Traditional methods using microscopy and chemical or immunological stains, test cultures with selective media or target cells, or serological assays have been used effectively to identify infectious agents in biological specimens or environmental samples. However, due to increasing veterinary, medical, and public health concerns, faster and more accurate diagnostic tools have been sought. Multiplex array-based assays allow for a range of biomarkers to be rapidly and simultaneously measured within specimens (Robertson and Nicholson, 2005) . Recently, multiplex bead-based flow cytometric immunoassays have been developed and applied that show great promise for improving the study, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of infectious diseases (Alvarez-Barrientos et al., 2000; Jani et al., 2002) .",

Highly purified recombinant or synthetic molecules have been used as antigens to generate specific antibody preparations and to provide target antigens or calibrated standards for these assays. Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are widely used for specific and sensitive analyte measurements that have diagnostic value (Andreotti et al., 2003) . Although this methodology is well suited for single-analyte analysis in a relatively large sample volume, methods that simultaneously quantitate multiple analytes from a relatively small sample size are needed to improve the speed, utility, and confidence of diagnostic assays. The combination of traditional immunoassay-based technologies with multiparameter flow cytometry has promoted the development of bead-based, high-throughput multiplex immunoassays. In this method, polymer microspheres (beads) that are several micrometers in diameter replace the traditional immunoassay plates and serve as the solid phase for the flow cytometric assay (Horan and Wheeless, 1977) . Many different types of bead-based flow cytometric immunoassays have been described including those that have indirect or sandwich immunoassay formats (McHugh et al., 1994; Vignali, 2000) .",

            "text": "The indirect immunoassay format is especially useful for measuring specific antibody levels in biological fluids (e.g., for determining rising or falling serum antibody titers during the course of an infectious disease). In this format, capture beads are coated or covalently conjugated with target antigen molecules (Fig. 25.1A) . For diagnostic microbiology assays, these may be either crude microbial extracts or highly purified molecular preparations. The beads are mixed with test biological fluids (tissue culture supernatants, serum, wound exudates, bronchial lavage fluids) that may contain specific antibodies. Solutions or samples containing quantified levels of antibodies that are specific for the analyte of interest can serve as the assay's calibration standards. Adding fluorescent anti-immunoglobulin detection antibodies (DAb) develops the assay. These fluorescent DAb may be specific for all immunoglobulin isotypes. In these assays, total antibody levels are measured. Alternatively, the DAb may be specific for immunoglobulin isotypes and thus allow measurement of antibodies with IgM, IgA, IgG, or IgE isotypes. Isotype-specific measurements of antibody levels may be very important for monitoring the course of an infectious disease and for characterizing the nature of immune responses to vaccinations (Wild, 2001) . The levels and isotype profile for antibodies may indicate whether the humoral immune response is weakly or strongly protective or nonprotective for a particular infectious disease.",

            "text": "Bead-based single analyte flow immunoassays were first described for measuring the levels of \u03b1-fetoprotein (Frengen et al., 1993) and beta2-microglobulin (Bishop and Davis, 1997) . Multiplex bead-based flow cytometric immunoassays were made possible by using beads of different sizes. McHugh(1994) and Fulwyler et al. (1988) used beads of different sizes as carriers for target antigens or antibodies. The beads were differentiated by their sizes that were related to their forward light-scattering characteristics determined by flow cytometric analysis. Appropriate electronic gating strategies were used during data acquisition and D. C. The beads emit fluorescent signals that are distinguished in terms of their wavelength (depending on the type of dye) and fluorescence intensity (depending on the incorporated dye level). Panel B: Alternatively, in flow cytometric sandwich immunoassays, the dyed beads are conjugated with a specific capture antibody (CAb). When mixed with specimens or standard solutions, the capture beads specifically bind and localize antigens to their surface. Fluorescent detection antibodies (DAb) are added that bind to another antigen site. Panel C: A large number of different bead positions can be resolved in two-color dot plots, for example, the logarithmically amplified FL3 and FL4 channels of a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer or the NIR and Red channels of a BD FACSArray bioanalyzer (72 different bead sets). Beads with different two-color fluorescent positions can be combined in assays to create a multiplex assay. Incident light causes the fluorescent DAb that is directly conjugated with a fluorochrome such as phycoerythrin (PE) to emit distinct fluorescence signals. These reporter signal intensities are commensurate with the amount of analyte-bound DAb connected with distinct fluorescent capture bead sets. The flow cytometric data can then be reanalyzed to generate standard curves and to quantify the levels of specific analytes in test specimens. Panel D: Standard curves generated from a 15-plex Cytokine CBA Flex Set analysis are shown. reanalysis to determine the mean fluorescent intensities emitted by the fluorescent DAb associated with each distinct capture bead group. Multiplex flow cytometric immunoassays can also be made using beads of the same size with unique fluorescence properties. In these assays, distinct capture bead sets are produced by labeling them with different levels of one type of fluorescent dye. The different capture bead sets can then be distinguished by flow cytometric analysis based on their distinct MFI. Fluorescent DAb provide the second type of fluorescence that constitutes the reporter immunoassay signals (Camilla et al., 1998) . This approach is useful for creating low-complexity bead-sets (Chen et al., 1999) . However, larger distinguishable bead sets can be prepared by labeling them with distinct proportions of two fluorescent dyes (Fulwyler et al., 1988) , for example, red and far-red dyes as detected by a flow cytometer (Fig. 25.1C ). In this case, DAb coupled to a third fluorescent dye [e.g., phycoerythrin (PE)] generate the immunoassay signals. With this approach, it is possible to develop a number of different capture bead/DAb pairs. These pairs are initially developed and tested separately for their sensitivity and range of analyte measurement. As part of the validation process, the pairs are mixed together with other bead pairs and tested for their capacities to specifically measure analytes in mixtures such as serum samples or cocktails of diluted standards. Capture bead/DAb pairs must be capable of specifically measuring the same analyte levels when tested separately or in mixtures. With the selection of good antibody pairs that do not cross-react with other analytes or antibodies in the system, flow cytometric immunoassays can be used to measure the levels of multiple analytes (e.g., biological markers associated with one or more microorganisms).",

Determinations of stable, rising, or dropping antibody titers and the immunoglobulin isotype of the antimicrobial antibodies provide valuable information concerning the nature or status of an infection or the efficacy of an antimicrobial therapy or vaccine. A growing list of publications for this technology is being reported (Jani et al., 2002) . Best and colleagues (1992) successfully developed an indirect bead assay for the serodiagnosis of Helicobacter pylori. For this assay, the investigators coated plastic microspheres with a crude multicomponent antigen mixture prepared from H. pylori to react with antibodies that were present in patient sera. Fluoresceinconjugated anti-human IgG DAb were used to measure the levels of IgG anti-H. pylori antibodies that were present in serum samples from infected (positive by culture or histological examination) or noninfected control patients. Pooled negative sera served to determine the assay's limit of detection and relative serum antibody titers with weakly and strongly positive control sera included in each assay to control for intra-and inter-assay variability. The bead-based assay was 100% sensitive and 89% specific (positive and negative predictive values of 90% and 100%) and gave no equivocal results. Parallel testing with a commercial ELISA was 96% sensitive and 89% specific (positive and negative predictive values of 90% and 96%) and gave five equivocal results. Lal et al. (2004) developed a simple and rapid cytometric bead assay that simultaneously quantitated serum IgG antibodies that were directed against the Neisseria meningitidis serogroups, A, C, Y, or W-135. Different bead sets were conjugated with meningococcal capsular polysaccharides A, C, Y, or W-135. A calibrated anti-meningococcal antiserum served as the reference. The tetraplex assay had good intra-and inter-assay variations and showed a strong correlation with ELISAs specific for the same antigens. The authors suggested that assays of this type would be useful to study the efficacy of multivalent vaccines designed to protect against meningococcal infections. Biagini et al. (2003) similarly reported the development of a multiplex bead-based assay that was capable of measuring the antibody response directed against 23 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides. These pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes were present in the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

These beads were incubated with serum or plasma samples and developed with PE-conjugated anti-human IgG DAb. The assay mixtures were then analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometric analysis.

Different PCR amplification strategies have been used to demonstrate flow methods to measure HIV viral load (Mehrpouyan et al., 1997; Van Cleve et al., 1998) . Defoort (2000) developed a multiplex flow cytometric beadbased hybridization assay for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C (HCV) RNA and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA using specific oligonucleotide probe-coated, green fluorescent microspheres. The assay was devoid of cross-hybridization between oligonucleotide probes and biotinylated PCR products that were generated by multiplex reverse transcription-PCR. Bound PCR products were detected with PE-cyanin 5-conjugated streptavidin. Methods of this type can be extremely useful for the detection and quantitation of several different pathogens or serotypes in each plasma sample. Flow cytometric assays based on nucleic acid technologies are useful for identifying pathogens not amenable to culture or for when an immunodominant microbial antigen that can serve for serological diagnosis of an ongoing infection has not been characterized. Requirements for highly trained technicians, expensive equipment and materials, and concerns that nucleic acid technologies do not discriminate between viable and dead microbes are potential issues that affect the use of this method.",

The antibodies were used to prepare two distinct sets of single-color fluorescent capture beads and PE-conjugated DAb. Purified preparations of SEB and Ricin communis agglutinin II served as calibrators. In this case, the identification of bacteria used the capability of the flow cytometer to detect bacteria directly by light scatter or dye-mediated nucleic acid fluorescence. The specific identification was achieved with fluorochrome-labeled species-specific antibodies. The use of membrane permeable and impermeable nucleic acid dyes allowed for the discrimination of live and dead cells. For the simultaneous analysis of killed Bacillus anthracis and living Bacillus subtilis bacteria, rabbit anti-B. anthracis antibodies were conjugated with PE. For the discrimination of total and dead bacteria, the nucleic acid dyes, Syto 59 and propidium iodide were used, respectively.",

For example, Carson and Vignali (1999) demonstrated a multiplex bead assay for the simultaneous quantitation of 15 cytokines. The multiplex measurement of cytokine profiles by flow cytometric bead arrays panels may be used to monitor the host response to various infectious disease processes. Infection and sepsis are a frequent cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality (Tarnok et al., 2003) . The early diagnosis of these disease processes is difficult because the clinical signs are highly variable, subtle, and similar to other conditions. Advances in diagnostic detection of pediatric infection and sepsis have been slow, but recent advances in multiplex cytometric bead array analysis of multiple cytokines show promise for improved early diagnoses. Elevated levels of serum IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 are among the proposed early indicators of infection and sepsis . Hodge et al. (2005) measured the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines as biomarkers for following the course of pediatric sepsis cases. These investigators used the BD CBA Human Th1/Th2 Cytokine (measures IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and INF-\u03b3 levels) and Human Inflammatory Cytokine (IL-1\u00df, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1) kits for the simultaneous measurement of multiple cytokines in small-volume (0.1 mL) samples. These assays were chosen for their diagnostic potential because of the associated rise in plasma-derived cytokine levels with pediatric sepsis. Cytokines from a group of 18 infected term neonates (culture positive) and a noninfected control group (culture negative) were analyzed. When the cytokine levels of the infected group were compared with the normal ranges of plasma cytokine levels expressed by the control group, all but two patients failed to show significant elevation of the cytokines tested. All other patients showed elevated levels of between one and nine cytokines tested. Although the different cytokine profiles did not correlate with the identity of a specific infectious agent, the authors concluded that these types of assays could be developed to rapidly identify neonates with sepsis.",

In contrast to what one might expect from the immune system when faced with a common microbial invader, it may be that infection and lung injury progresses in SARS patients as a result of uncontrollable innate and adaptive immune responses as reflected by rampant lung inflammation and uncoordinated cytokine production. Because the varying severity of SARS CoV infection appears to be rooted in a patient's own host immune response, SARS represents a unique opportunity to look at pathogenesis of a critical infectious disease and host defense in a new light using multiplexed bead assays, such as BD Biosciences Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) kits.",

This directive, likely to be a common feature of future outbreaks of emergent or unknown infectious diseases, allowed the collection of specimens within 3 days of onset of symptoms from acutely ill SARS patients as well as a longitudinal study of patients delineated by the severity of SARS disease course (i.e., from mild to moderate symptoms to severe forms of the disease requiring intubation and ICU admittance). CBA results from a representative non-ICU patient shown in Fig. 25 .4 shows the high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the plasma of a SARS patient in the early phase (<3 days since onset of symptoms) of disease compared with the convalescent sample and average healthy control levels. As shown, early SARS infection is characterized by increased expression of numerous cytokines and chemokines representing a vigorous acute-phase response (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) as well as strong innate (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1) and IFN-\u03b3-driven adaptive immune responses. Levels of expression of these cytokines and chemokines appeared to peak within the first 2 weeks of SARS disease and had generally resolved to healthy control levels at convalescence, probably assisted by aggressive steroid treatment begun at day 7 in this patient.",

Because IFN-\u03b3 and other interferon-response genes are crucial in starting and directing different classes of innate and adaptive immune responses, this would indicate that they also could determine the overall effectiveness, or conversely overall mismanagement, of immune responses against the SARS CoV. Interestingly, other cytokines involved in adaptive immunity and T cell subset regulation, such as IL-2, IL-5, and IL-10, were not expressed at significant levels, although levels of IL-4 did increase slightly during the second week of illness. In other words, to describe SARS as mediated by a generalized \"cytokine storm\" is probably oversimplified. Instead, the by BD Biosciences CBA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Higher levels of CXCL10 were observed in SARS patients relative to controls (P < 0.0001). CXCL10 was also significantly lower at 12-14 days in mild to moderate SARS patients compared with those in the ICU (P < 0.05).",

In SARS patients with mild to moderate symptoms, CXCL10 levels decrease to near convalescent levels by the mid stage (12-14 days), whereas levels in SARS patients with severe symptoms requiring intubation and admittance to the ICU remain significantly elevated beyond 30 days regardless of aggressive steroid treatment. It is not yet known whether infected tissues are the main source of CXCL10, although the persistence of elevated levels of CXCL10 in patients with severe illness and unresolved SARS CoV infection indicates that this may be the case. Nonetheless, CXCL10 appears to play a unique role in the progress of SARS illness.

By modeling host gene expression in different subsets of patients from the onset of symptoms through convalescence, multiple genetic pathways may be found that show changes in expression patterns and prognostic capabilities over varying courses of a disease.
