Finally, the case study presented at the end of the paper is motivated by a practical problem of SOF control of a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) helicopter with remote sensor and remote actuator. To increase the reliability of the numerical experiment, an additional novelty in relation to previous MJLS control research consists of using the data provided by a wireless network workbench [25] to compute, with good accuracy, a Markovian model for the communication channel used in the case study. Despite the fact that mathematical models for the signal attenuation as a function of time and distance can be found in the WSN literature, another motivation for using experimental information representing the packet loss on WSN is to provide data for control designers without the need for them to be familiar with the communication theory.",

Thus, they become inadequate in certain analyses due to the inherent complexity and diverse nature of WSNs (e.g., node density, node mobility, dynamic topology, wireless media characteristics, time-varying channel conditions, etc.). Oversimplified models may lead to inaccurate results that are not desirable. On the other hand, it may not be feasible or practical to test and evaluate the performance of protocols through their actual implementation because this is a complex, expensive and time-consuming activity. In this scenario, several works in the literature (see [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and references therein) propose analyzing tools for evaluating algorithms and protocols on WSNs at the design, development, and implementation stages, such as simulators, emulators, and testbeds. Each one of those tools has different features, characteristics, models and architectures for performance testing on WSNs. Briefly, such tools can be described as follows: simulators are based on software that models the real environment; emulators differ from simulators because they can run the same code on real platforms; finally, physical testbeds allow more detailed real-world settings and assist in capturing realistic experimental data.",

On the other hand, [28] focuses specifically on testbeds, analyzing sixteen testbeds, some of them also reported in [26] , but extending the analysis to some new ones developed between 2010 and 2016. The authors conclude that testbeds represent WSNs more accurately, support the great diversity components of hardware and software, and allow the deployment of a WSN under the same environmental conditions as a real application. Testbeds can reveal WSN behavior under the effect of failures and malfunctions, a situation that cannot be analyzed in theoretical simulations. A malfunction can occur due to failing hardware, buggy software, power outages in battery-operated systems, and interference with radio communication. In short, testbeds are the ideal environment to find solutions for the occurrences of failures and malfunctions and to assess the interference from the environment. However, [28] states that testbeds are often inadequate for experimentation scenarios that require the repeatability of experiments, since many relevant operational parameters are beyond the user's control, such as local radio interference due to infrastructure and other experiments.",

Table 3 shows that the emulation results obtained by the workbench are very close to the ones provided by the experimental field tests in terms of signal intensity, mean and standard deviation, attesting the quality of the emulation offered by the workbench. To analyze the WSN packet loss behavior as the distance between nodes increases, two additional tests were performed considering a fixed standard deviation in 1.13, but choosing two opposite extremes for the signal attenuation values: 1 dB representing a minimum distance between the nodes and 25 dB representing the two nodes 310 m apart. Table 4 shows the results for these tests. It is possible to notice an increase in the packet loss as the distance between nodes increases, that is, the PER is 11% for the longest distance (310 m), while for the minimum distance it reduces to 1%.",

Since the emulated network is a semi-reliable communication channel, the sink node may indicate some packet loss; that is, each packet sent by the source node can be associated with a successful (\u03b8 k = 1) or failure transmission (\u03b8 k = 2). For instance, consider the case illustrated in Table 5 supposing that only 10 packets (numbered from 1 to 10) are sent by the source node, and the report provided by the workbench indicates that packets 2 and 5 were not received. Note that \u03b8 k represents a random variable at discrete-time instant k that assumes values on a finite set K = {1, 2, . . . , \u03b7} containing all the \u03b7 operation modes of the system or all the \u03b7 states of a Markov chain. In this particular example, one has only two states, that is, K = {1, 2}, where the first one corresponds to success and the second one represents failure in the transmission. Table 5 , four different transition states can be identified: t 11 (two consecutive successful transmissions), t 12 (a successful transmission followed by a failed one), t 21 (a failed transmission followed by a successful one), and t 22 (two consecutive failed transmissions, which do not occur in this particular example). As a consequence, the packet loss on the communication channel can be modeled by the so-called Gilbert-Elliot model [39] [40] [41] , whose transitions among the states are described by the diagram of Assuming a Gilbert-Elliot model, the transition probabilities among states \u03b8 k = 1 (Success) and \u03b8 k = 2 (Failure) are given by 12 , p 12 = Prob(\u03b8 k+1 = 2|\u03b8 k = 1) = t 12 t 11 + t 12 ,",

Since the plant is remotely controlled through a wireless communication channel with a limited transmission rate, the control design is performed in discrete time. For this purpose, the matrices (A c , B c , C c ) from (16) are discretized using the zero order hold ('zoh') method in Matlab employing a fixed sampling period T s = 0.1s, resulting in discrete-time matrices (A,B,C) .

However, this system is controlled through a semi-reliable network with characteristics similar to the one emulated by the workbench described in Section 3. This means that the probability of the helicopter receiving a successful transmission of the control signal or the controller receiving a successful transmission of the sensor measurement can be considered as a time-varying parameter since it depends on the distance between the controller and the VTOL helicopter. When testing different attenuation levels between 1 dB and 25 dB in the wireless network workbench, it was noticed that PER increases monotonically with an increase in attenuation (representing, in this case, the distance between the nodes). This characteristic indicates that, at any distance between 0 m (1 dB: PER = 1%) and 310 m away (25 dB: PER = 11%), following the Gilbert-Elliot model presented in Section 3.1, the Markov chain can be represented by a transition probability matrix that is a convex combination of two vertices: P(\u03b1(k)) = q(\u03b1(k)) (1 \u2212 q(\u03b1(k))) 0.999 0.001 = \u03b1 1 (k) 0.99 0.01 0.999 0.001 + \u03b1 2 (k) 0.89 0.11 0.999 0.001 (18) where 1 \u2212 q(\u03b1(k)) corresponds to the packet error rate (see (5)), which varies from a lower bound (PER = 0.01, when the distance between the controller and the plant can be neglected) to an upper bound (PER = 0.11, when the distance between the controller and the plant matches the maximum range of the radio signal used for communication: 310 m). Note that, since the distance between the nodes does not remain constant, this means that both transition probability matrix P and, consequently, the parameter \u03b1 are time-varying (depend explicitly on k). Additionally, as discussed in Section 3.1, the Markov model considers two operation modes: (i) successful transmission of the control and measured signals, (ii) failure. In this example, the packet loss of the control signal is modeled by the zero-input [47] approach, which is equivalent to clearing the elements of both the control and output matrices in the mode associated with transmission failure (B 2 = 0, C 2 = 0) and maintaining their actual values (B 1 = B and C 1 = C obtained from the discretization of (16)) in the operation mode that represents success. The dynamic matrix maintains its value in both modes A 1 = A 2 = A obtained from the discretization of A c of (16).",

The control design conditions were developed initially to provide theoretical assurances of closed-loop state-feedback stability for non-homogeneous MJLS, where the time-varying parameters affect the probabilities (and consequently, the Markov chain). However, an adaptation of the method to cope with SOF control problem was also presented, which is most widely explored in practical applications, since usually not all states are available for feedback.",

            "text": "The second contribution consisted of obtaining data related to the sequence of packets sent and received in a semi-reliable network by performing experiments on a wireless network workbench (previously developed and validated by the authors in real scenarios). Such data allowed us to find a Gilbert-Elliot model that describes the probability of packet loss in the communication channel. The transition probability associated with the communication channel model was employed in a practical motivated case study. The numerical experiments of the case study show that: (i) traditional control techniques such as PID cannot be applied to problems of networked control by semi-reliable communication channels since they do not guarantee the stability of the system when there is a possibility of packet loss, as shown in Figures 6 and 7 . On the other hand, the proposed technique based on the non-homogeneous Markov chain model is feasible and also ensures the stability of the closed-loop system, as shown in Figure 8 ; (ii) the numerical complexity associated with the implementation of a traditional PID controller (17) is much greater than the computational effort required to implement the static output feedback Markovian controller (19) , requiring more calculations and better actuators, since the dimension and the magnitude of the controller are greater.",

The initial idea is to attach a microcontroller to each one of the network nodes so that the control and system dynamics are calculated online by the microcontrollers and the measurement and actuation signals are transmitted in real time by the emulated network. The third microcontroller that rules the actions of the digital signal attenuator will also be reprogrammed to implement an oscillatory behavior in order to emulate the variation of the distance between nodes. Other future investigation topics include: to consider different types of routing and models for the communication channel, and the study of energy efficiency and life cycle of the nodes considering large-scale WSNs, in which reliability of statistical data and the fluctuation of network factors, as well as the packet error rate (PER), become more critical.",
