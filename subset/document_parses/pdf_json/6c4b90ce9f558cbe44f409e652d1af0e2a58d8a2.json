A recent systematic review found that relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress were reported in the general population and health care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic globally [2, 3] . Asia has a number of middle income countries (MICs) that face tremendous economic challenges and limited medical resources to maintain physical and mental well-being during the pandemic [4] . This extended to North America as well, with the sudden change in economic security during COVID-19 projected to increase suicide rates [5] . During the pandemic, the Asia Pacific Disaster Mental Health Network recommended to establish a mental health agenda for Asia [6] . It is therefore important to conduct research to assess psychiatric status of Asians living in MICs to develop capacity of various health systems to respond to COVID-19. Previous studies mainly focused on mental health of individual Asian countries during the pandemic without cross comparison [7] [8] [9] .",

Any difference larger than the LSD is considered a significant result.

Fig  1 compares More than half of participants stayed in a household with more than 3-5 people across all countries except Pakistan (49%). Majority of respondents from Philippines, Pakistan, Vietnam and Malaysia were employed when the study was conducted. Table 1 shows the association between demographic characteristics of all participants and mental health parameters. Demographic characteristics associated with lower psychological impact were male gender whereas age younger than 30 years and students were associated with higher psychological impact. Participants who have children were associated with lower stress, anxiety and depression whereas participants with higher education, single and separated status were associated with higher stress, anxiety and depression. Staying with 6 or more people and those who were employed were associated with lower anxiety and depression. Table shows the frequency of physical symptoms that resemble COVID-19 infection and there were significant differences among all countries. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the most common physical symptoms reported by general population in the 7 countries were headache (23.13%), cough (21.86%) and sore throat (19.29%). About 8.13% of respondents consulted General Practitioner (GP); 2.69% were hospitalized; 3.89% were tested positive for COVID-19 and 57.1% had a health insurance. Pakistani had the significantly highest proportion of respondents consulted GP (27.5%), hospitalized (16.4%), receiving COVID-19 test (17.2%) and being isolated (17.8%). Table 2 shows the association between physical symptoms and mental health outcomes.

Risk factors associated with adverse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic include age <30 years old, high education background, single and separated status, discrimination by other countries, contact with people with COVID-19 and worries about COVID-19. Protective factors for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic include male gender, staying with children, staying with 6 or more people, employment, confidence in own's doctors diagnosing COVID-19, high perceived likelihood of surviving COVID-19, spending less time on health information, hand hygiene practice and wearing a face mask. Importantly, these findings will be significantly helpful for healthcare administrators in Asia at the national and local community levels [24] when preparing for the next wave of COVID-19 outbreak and future pandemics [25] . Iran had the highest total reported COVID cases (386,658) and number of COVID cases per 1 million people (4,593), as well as the highest number of deaths from COVID (22, 293) and deaths per 1 million people (265) [26] . Pakistan had the second highest number of cases (298,509) and deaths (6,342) [26] . Of the 7 MICs, Vietnam had the lowest total numbers and rates across all seven countries, with 1,049 reported cases, 35 deaths and rates of just 11 cases and 0.4 deaths per 1 million [26] . As a result, Vietnamese respondents reported the lowest IES-R and DASS-21 scores. Vietnam has adopted several strategies to combat COVID-19 including development of the action plan and response strategies to optimize the utilization of human resources and equipment [24] ; address the health information needs based on the diverse socioeconomic, demographic, and ethnic factors [27] ; re-design communication activities for a more effective dissemination of information related to the epidemic [28] ; safeguarding the health of workforce [29] to ensure minimal impact on economy and involvement of the grassroot system and village health collaborators to combat pandemics [30, 31] .",

For 2020, the International Monetary Fund has predicted Thailand's GDP to be reduced by 6.7 percent which is highest among Asian countries [32] . Pakistan ranked second in terms of DASS-21 scores and number of COVID cases and deaths. The congruence between psychological parameters and epidemiology of COVID-19 in Pakistan was due to poor sanitation, lack of basic preventive measures, lack of proper testing and medical facilities. Pakistani health professionals started protesting and threatened to quit work due to lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) [33] . Currently, the vaccination coverage in rural Pakistan remains unsatisfactory amid various barriers including price, hesitancy, and low level of awareness [34] . Eid-ul-Adha is an annual religious festival that could not be cancelled due to religious obligations and led to a sharp spike in COVID-19 cases [35] . The unpreparedness and contradictory policies resulted in an alarming high rate of COVID-19 spread and worsening mental health and discrimination faced by Pakistani people.

During the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic, medical and public health experts from the US and some European countries believed that there was no direct evidence of airborne transmission of COVID-19 [37] . In contrast, respiratory clinicians and public health experts from Asia argued that lack of evidence does not equate to evidence of ineffectiveness of face masks [38] . The use of face masks by Asians have played an important role in controlling the spread of COVID-19 [39] . This study showed the association between the use of face mask and lower DASS-21 anxiety and depression scores. This finding might support the postulation that wearing face mask could offer psychological benefits, such as feeling less vulnerable to infection via perceived control [37] . Staying with children and more than 6 people in the same household were protective factors due to the values of family support among Asians. Compared with western countries, family support has a greater influence on reducing the risk of adverse mental health in Asia [10] . The findings of this first multinational study have several implications for health and government policies. Firstly, the health authorities should offer psychological interventions to the general population who are at higher risk of developing adverse mental health including women, people younger than 30 years and single and separated status. High education background is a risk factor and online psychological interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based therapy could improve mental health for highly educated individual [40] . For countries with high IES-R scores (Thailand, China and Iran), online trauma-focused CBT that promotes trauma narration, problem solving related to problems associated with COVID-19 and home based relaxation could be helpful in reducing psychological impact [9] . Second, as physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (e.g., rhinitis, persistent fever with cough, breathing difficulties) were associated with high IES-R and DASS-21 scores groups. There is an urgent need to develop accurate, rapid diagnostic tests in general practitioners' clinics, community and rural settings [31] . A negative COVID-19 test result may alleviate anxiety, depression, stress and psychological impact. Enhancing the capacity of health system to combat COVID-19 may increase the confidence of public and improve mental health. Third, based on our findings, the WHO, governments and health authorities should provide regular updates on the effectiveness of vaccines and treatment methods. Mis-information related to the cause of COVID-19 [41] , rumours [42] and inconsistent information [43] on COVID-19 symptoms, prevention, treatment and transmission mode were associated with negative psychological impact. Local governments, news agencies, professional and advocacy organisations should all provide health information and advices related to COVID-19 that are consistent with national guidelines and avoid mis-information [44] . It is important to identify group-specific demands would be helpful to provide proper information related to COVID-19 to fulfil the need of different population groups [27] . Various governments should offer relief packages to safeguard employment and economy to protect mental health. Additionally, the level of policy stringency in response to COVID-19 or pandemics, as measured by the Oxford Stringency Index, may influence mental health and should be moderated accordingly by respective governments [45] . This study has several limitations. First, the findings of this study were based on seven MICs in Asia and could not be generated to other countries. The study population had different sociodemographic characteristics as compared to the general population in the world due to sampling bias because only participants with Internet access could participate in this online survey. The respondent sampling method also compromised the representativeness of samples. The study population was female predominant (proportion of female in the study population: 67.76%; world population 49.58%) [46] and a high proportion of the study population possessed a university degree (85.6%). Thus, there is a potential risk of sampling bias because we could not reach out to potential respondents without Internet access. The second limitation was the cross-sectional nature of this study and inability to demonstrate cause and effect relationship. The third limitation was that we did not record demographic data regarding pre-existing mental illness of the study participants. The fourth limitation is that selfreported levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression and stress may not always be aligned with objective assessment by mental health professionals. Nevertheless, psychological impact, anxiety, depression and stress are based on personal feelings, and self-reporting was paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fifth limitation is that we did not study other aspects of the pandemic such as the potential threat of self-medication of hydroxychloroquine and cholorquine [47] and precautionary measures of walkthrough sanitization gates [48] . Lastly, we were unable to calculate the response rate. For potential respondents who were not keen to participate in the online survey, no response was recorded, and we could not collect any information from them.",

The risk factors for adverse mental health include age < 30 years, high education background, single and separated status, discrimination by other countries, contact with people with COVID-19 and worries about COVID-19. The protective factors for mental health include male gender, staying with children, staying with 6 or more people, employment, confidence in own's doctors diagnosing COVID-19, high perceived likelihood of surviving COVID-19, spending less time on health information, hand hygiene practice and wearing a face mask.",
