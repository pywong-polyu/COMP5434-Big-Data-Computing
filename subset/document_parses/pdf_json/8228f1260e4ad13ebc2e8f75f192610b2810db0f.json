A safe and effective vaccine remains urgently needed. Method: We constructed three variants of the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (residues 331-549) in yeast as follows: (1) a \"wild type\" RBD (RBD219-WT), (2) a deglycosylated form (RBD219-N1) by deleting the first N-glycosylation site, and (3) a combined deglycosylated and cysteine-mutagenized form (C538A-mutated variant (RBD219-N1C1)). We compared the expression yields, biophysical characteristics, and functionality of the proteins produced from these constructs. Results and conclusions: These three recombinant RBDs showed similar secondary and tertiary structure thermal stability and had the same affinity to their receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), suggesting that the selected deletion or mutations did not cause any significant structural changes or alteration of function. However, RBD219-N1C1 had a higher fermentation yield, was easier to purify, was not hyperglycosylated, and had a lower tendency to form oligomers, and thus was selected for further vaccine development and evaluation. General significance: By genetic modification, we were able to design a better-controlled and more stable vaccine candidate, which is an essential and important criterion for any process and manufacturing of biologics or drugs for human use.",

In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was responsible for 8098 infections and approximately 800 deaths. Beginning in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV has led to 2519 infections and 866 associated deaths and the virus is still circulating in camels. First reported in China in December 2019, SARS-SARS-CoV-2 after viral challenge [8] , previous preclinical studies in mice indicated that the full-length SARS-CoV S protein could induce eosinophilic immune enhancement [9, 10] and lung immunopathology [11, 12] , possibly due to epitopes outside of the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The SARS-CoV RBD vaccine was shown to induce high levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies, minimized or abrogated eosinophilic immune enhancement in mice compared to the full-length S protein, and can be easily scaled for production [12, 13] ; therefore, some groups consider the RBD an attractive vaccine immunogen alternative to using the full-length S protein [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Beyond our findings with SARS-CoV, additional studies have already shown that mammalian cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2 RBD triggered high specific total IgG as well as neutralizing antibody titers in mice [7] and that the vaccination of insect cellexpressed RBD protected non-human primates (NHPs) from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo with no significant lung histopathological changes, further supporting a rationale for using the RBD as antigen to develop an efficacious vaccine [20] .",

The sequence includes two glycosylation sites at N331 and N343 [24] . However, hyperglycosylation as well as dimer formation were observed during the production of RBD219-WT. The variable lengths of the glycans attached to RBD219-WT posed a challenge to the purification process and no uniform band was observed by SDS-PAGE. In addition, we observed dimerization of the antigen that might further impact the quality of antigen. To resolve these issues, we first removed Asn331 from the sequence, generating RBD219-N1, and then also mutated C538 to alanine (RBD219-N1C1). RBD219-N1C1 constitutes a better-controlled and more stable protein, which is an important and essential criterion for any process and manufacturing of a biologic for human use. The immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates was recently tested, demonstrating that when formulated with Alhy-drogel\u00ae, these yeast-expressed RBDs triggered equivalent high titers of neutralizing antibodies [25] .",

Two of the RBD constructs resulted in high fermentation yields, however, for the RBD219-N1 construct, we only achieved low fermentation yields with likely high host cell protein levels. This impeded us from getting any purified RBD219-N1 protein, hence, a hexahistidine tagged construct (RBD219-N1 + His) was created to obtain purified protein for further characterization. Biophysical characteristics, and in vitro functionality of these three purified recombinant RBD proteins were evaluated. Based on the results, we identified the RBD219-N1C1 construct best suited for advancement. This construct and its initial process for protein production have been transferred to an industrial manufacturer, who has successfully produced and scaled it and has now advanced this vaccine candidate into a Phase I/2 clinical trial [26] .",

However, the fermentation yield of RBD219-N1 was low (50 \u00b1 13 mg/L of FS, Table 1 ), and the level of non-RBD proteins, likely HCP impurities, remained a concern ( Fig. 2A and Supplementary Figs. S1E and S1F). Due to the low yield and high level of non-target-specific proteins, we were unable to purify tag-free RBD219-N1; thus, the hexahistidine tagged construct (RBD219-N1 + His) was used to obtain purified protein for later characterization. We also observed that both RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1 formed dimers during fermentation. This suggested the potential formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between a potential free cysteine found in the molecule, and therefore, a C538A-mutated form of RBD219-N1, RBD219-N1C1, was constructed. The rationale is that there are nine cysteine residues in the RBD, where we assumed that eight residues formed intramolecular bonds, leaving the last cysteine available for undesired intermolecular cross-linking. The new C538A-mutated construct based on the RBD219-N1 backbone was able to express the protein (RBD219-N1C1) with low yeast-derived hyperglycosylation, without the presence of extensive non-RBD specific proteins or HCPs ( Fig. 2A) , and with a fermentation yield of 280 \u00b1 70 mg/L of FS (Table 1) . Even though, when fermentation yields were analyzed using western blot, one could observe a dimer form of RBD219-N1C1 in the fermentation supernatant (Supplementary Figs. S1I and S1K), such dimer was not seen after purification in the final purified protein (Fig. 2B) . After treating the three purified RBDs with PNGase-F to remove N-glycans, RBDs with similar size were observed ( Fig. 2C ; Please note that the band at 37 kDa was PNGase-F enzyme), which confirmed that the size differences were likely due to the yeast-derived glycosylation.",

The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-WT has a slightly larger hydrodynamic radius (2.79 \u00b1 0.01 nm) than RBD219-N1C1 (2.56 \u00b1 0.00 nm), and thus a higher calculated molecular weight (37.5 \u00b1 0.5 kDa) than RBD219-N1C1 (30 \u00b1 0.0 kDa) (Fig. 3A) , presumably due to the additional N-glycans. Interestingly, even though RBD219-N1 + His was less glycosylated due to the removal of the first glycosylation site, its hydrodynamic radius (2.74 \u00b1 0.01 nm, 35.7 \u00b1 0.5 kDa) was similar to RBD219-WT; thus, it was suspected that potential oligomer formation might have occurred. We further determined the diffusion interaction parameter (K D ) of three RBDs (Fig. 3B and Table 2 ) to evaluate the level of protein-protein interaction. The results indicated that all three RBDs in TBS showed negative K D values, implying protein attractions. However, it was noticed that the K D of RBD219-N1C1 (\u2212 16.3 mL/g) was similar to that of RBD219-WT (\u2212 14.9 mL/g), while that of RBD219-N1 + His was almost double (\u2212 29.7 mL/ g), suggesting that RBD219-N1 + His was even more prone to form oligomers. Additionally, when we monitored the changes of the molecular weight for RBDs stored at room temperature, it was observed that both the molecular weight of RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1 + His increased over time while the size of RBD219-N1C1 remained unchanged at ~30 kDa (Fig. 3C ).",

This increased the uniformity of the RBD size by SDS-PAGE ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). However, we discovered that dimer formation via intermolecular disulfide bridging occurred during expression of the RBD219-N1 protein. While Dai et al. have recently shown that an RBD dimer improved immunogenicity of their vaccine candidate [41] , we note that dimer formation is typically considered a challenge while establishing production reproducibility, scalability, stability and quality characteristics in support of regulatory enabling documentation. When investigating the structure of RBD219-N1 using PDB ID 6XEY [42] , we saw nine cysteine residues, eight of which formed disulfide bonds (Supplementary Fig. S2 ) while one, C538, was free to form intermolecular disulfide bonds. In RBD219-N1C1, we therefore mutated the free C538 residue to alanine to avoid this issue. That residue has not been shown to be an epitope involved in triggering neutralizing antibodies.",

By using this immunoblot-based method, we were able to quantify the protein production in the fermentation supernatants without the interference of HCPs. The protein yield quantified using western blot indicated that in the FS, RBD219-N1C1 had the highest yield among the three constructs. Due to the high HCP background found in RBD219-WT FS, QXL was used to first capture most of the HCPs leaving the target protein in the flowthrough, this flow-through was further purified using Butyl HP followed by SEC. As for the RBD219-N1 construct, the target protein was barely visible in the FS when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and thus, we were unable to purify tag-free RBD219-N1 protein; instead, a hexahistidine-tagged protein was expressed and purified by metal affinity column. RBD219- N1C1, however, was the dominant protein found in the FS and could be easily purified by a simple two-step purification scheme similar to the yeast expressed SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 [13] . Therefore, RBD219-N1C1 was selected for further process development and scale-up.",

Mutating the free cysteine residue successfully reduced the propensity of oligomerization during fermentation, as no dimer formation was found in purified RBD219-N1C1. Additionally, as part of the stability evaluation, when monitoring the size using DLS, purified RBD219-N1C1 remained at 30 kDa for approximately 30 days while RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1 + His continued to form oligomers. However, when determining the diffusion interaction parameter (K D ) using DLS and assessing surface hydrophobicity (S 0 ) using extrinsic fluorescence, we observed that RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 shared similar K D and S 0 values while RBD219-N1 + His showed a lower K D and higher S 0 values, implying a higher tendency to form oligomers. The high oligomerization tendency for RBD219-N1 + His is likely due to the additional hexahistidine as we also performed an extrinsic fluorescence study on a hexahistidine-tagged version of RBD219-WT (RBD219-WT + His), and the results indicated a much higher surface hydrophobicity value (12.7 RFU*L/mg; supplementary Fig. S3 ) than RBD219-WT. The pKa of the imidazole ring in histidine is approximately 6.0, suggesting that at pH 7.5, this aromatic ring is likely non-protonated, which makes this additional hexahistidine more hydrophobic.",

Additionally, Li et al. have derived neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, and the most potent neutralizing antibodies that recognized the RBD blocked ACE-2 binding [42] . Thus, confirming the ACE-2 binding is crucial to ensure the epitopes within the ACE-2 binding site are still intact.

Yeast-derived glycans typically contain high levels of mannose [47] , while mammalian cell-derived glycans are more complex. In the case of mammalian-cell culture expressed SARS-CoV-2, the N343 residue is highly fucosylated [48] , and thus, antibodies raised against the yeastderived protein might have a different quality. Notably, yeast-derived mannosylation has been shown to induce mannose receptor-mediated macrophage recruitment that might actually enhance immunogenicity [49, 50] .

Since it is unknown whether the C538A mutation may have a safety effect, it is important this is monitored in the clinical settings. Nevertheless, as C539 is not conformationally close to the RBM (Supplementary Fig. S2 ), and this cysteine was naturally forming a disulfide bridge with C590 (PDB ID: 6XEY) [42] , the area near this residue is less likely to trigger neutralizing antibodies.

Knowing that the RBD is only part of the spike protein, it may be more vulnerable to viral escape mutations, especially when the mutations are observed in the RBM region. Based on the lessons learned from SARS, it was discovered that some of the neutralizing antibodies recognizing the RBD of SARS-CoV strains from the first outbreak (Urbani, Tor2) did not possess potent neutralization ability against strains isolated from the second outbreak (GD03) [52] . The recently emerging SARS-CoV-2 South Africa variant (B.1.351) contains a concerning mutation, E484K, located in the RBM, which reduced the neutralizing ability of monoclonal antibodies and human convalescent sera raised against earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants [53, 54] and also negatively impacted the efficacy of several full-length S-protein vaccines [55] .

            "text": "In this study, we have modified genetically and generated three different SARS-CoV-2 RBD constructs. The RBD219-N1C1 construct provided higher protein yields in the FS (~280 mg RBD219-N1C1/L of FS), and the fermentation process was less impacted based on the detection of fewer impurities. This facilitated the use of a straightforward and relatively efficient initial purification scheme, with an approximate recovery yield of ~189 mg of purified RBD219-N1C1/L of FS. With respect to biophysical characteristics, unlike RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1 proteins, the purified RBD219-N1C1 protein does not appear to form dimers via intermolecular disulfide bridging. Additionally, RBD219-WT, RBD219-N1 + His, and RBD219-N1C1 showed similar thermal stability and the same binding affinity to their receptor, ACE-2, further suggesting that the deletion of the first amino acid and mutation of the free cysteine did not cause any significant structural changes. Based on all the data, we conclude that the RBD219-N1C1 construct is the superior candidate to move forward. For this vaccine candidate to advance to clinical development, we have extensively studied and developed a robust, scalable, and reproducible production process. This construct and its initial process for protein production have been transferred to an industrial manufacturer, who has successfully produced and scaled it and has now advanced this vaccine candidate into a Phase I/2 clinical trial [26] .",
