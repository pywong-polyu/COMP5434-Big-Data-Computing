Animal models are urgently needed to study the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and to 14 screen candidate vaccines and treatments. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are considered the gold standard model 15 for many infectious pathogens as they usually best reflect the human condition. Here, we show that African green 16 monkeys support a high level of SARS-CoV-2 replication and develop pronounced respiratory disease that may 17 be more substantial than reported for other NHP species including cynomolgus and rhesus macaques. In 18 addition, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mucosal samples of all animals including feces of several animals as late 19 as 15 days after virus exposure. Importantly, we show that virus replication and respiratory disease can be 20 produced in African green monkeys using a much lower and more natural dose of SARS-CoV-2 than has been 21 employed in other NHP studies.",

Several animal species 41 including mice, hamsters, ferrets, and NHPs were found to support SARS-CoV-2 replication and displayed 42 varying degrees of non-lethal illness when the virus was delivered into the respiratory tract of these animals [7-43 13]. While each of these models has utility in the study of COVID-19, NHPs have the closest physiological 44 resemblance to humans allowing a better comparison of host responses to infection. This genetic similarity has 45 also contributed to the increased availability of reagents to perform in-depth analyses of the immune response.",

Rhesus macaques developed pneumonia and clinical signs whereas disease in 48 cynomolgus macaques was fairly mild indicating the former appears to better reflect more severe cases of 49 . These results suggest certain NHP species may serve as better models than others for 50 4 coronavirus infections. For SARS, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-1, African green monkeys (AGMs) were 51 found to support the highest level of viral replication, followed by cynomolgus macaques and rhesus macaques 52 when all three species were challenged in parallel [14] . Only AGMs had notable replication in the lower 53 respiratory tract following SARS-CoV-1 inoculation; necropsy of these animals indicated focal interstitial 54 mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and edema in the lung consistent with human SARS. As SARS-CoV-1 and 55 SARS-CoV-2 share the same putative host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [15, 16] , we 56 reasoned that AGMs might serve as a useful model for COVID-19.",
