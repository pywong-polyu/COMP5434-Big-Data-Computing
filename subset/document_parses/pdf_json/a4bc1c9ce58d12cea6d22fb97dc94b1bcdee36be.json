The bacteria colonize blood vessels and rapidly cause vascular damage, despite a neutrophilrich inflammatory infiltrate. Here, we use a humanized mouse model to show that vascular colonization leads to the recruitment of neutrophils, which partially reduce bacterial burden and vascular damage. This partial effect is due to the ability of bacteria to colonize capillaries, venules and arterioles, as observed in human samples. In venules, potent neutrophil recruitment allows efficient bacterial phagocytosis. In contrast, in infected capillaries and arterioles, adhesion molecules such as E-Selectin are not expressed on the endothelium, and intravascular neutrophil recruitment is minimal. Our results indicate that the colonization of capillaries and arterioles by N. meningitidis creates an intravascular niche that precludes the action of neutrophils, resulting in immune escape and progression of the infection.",

Although N. meningitidis is best known for causing cerebrospinal meningitis, the systemic septic form of the infection is responsible for 90% of the mortality attributed to meningococcal infections 1, 2 . In both cases, the infection is characterized by a fulminant evolution and diseases can progress from relatively unspecific flu-like symptoms to a life-threatening condition in less than 24 h 1 . Meningococcal systemic infections are characterized by a typical skin rash, called purpura, indicating a perturbation of the vascular function 3, 4 . Clinical studies have revealed major perturbations in vascular function in infected tissues with congestion, coagulation, and the loss of vascular integrity 5, 6 . Neisseria meningitidis thus rapidly causes major vascular damages leading to a fatal outcome in absence of treatment as if the first lines of immune defense were not sufficient.",

More specifically, an intriguing question that remains is how this bacterium escapes the neutrophil response triggered by the infection. Indeed, both clinical and experimental results point to the recruitment of an inflammatory cellular infiltrate 5, 7 including neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, which are typically seen around infected blood vessels [5] [6] [7] . However, although both neutrophils and monocytic cells frequently contain bacteria 5, 7 , this is not sufficient to clear the infection. The recruitment of neutrophils to infected tissues was also observed in a recently developed humanized mouse model in which grafting human skin allows the formation of a network of human dermal vessels that anastomose with the murine dermal vasculature and are perfused with murine blood 8 . In this model, intravenous bacteria exclusively adhere to the human endothelium, progressively proliferate to occupy the entire vessel lumen and recapitulate the human disease. Taken together, these studies illustrate the ability of the host to initiate an innate immune response upon meningococcal infections but raise pivotal questions regarding why neutrophils fail to clear these infections.",

This feature is not unique to N. meningitidis but extends to a number of bacterial and viral pathogens that can reach the blood circulation, interact with the endothelium and colonize vessels, including SARS-COV2, as recently described [9] [10] [11] . Of note, intravascular colonization by these pathogens generates an atypical situation in terms of neutrophil recruitment. Indeed, the textbook description in which bacteria are found in tissues and neutrophils are recruited to that sites following their rolling on the endothelium of postcapillary venules followed by their extravasation cannot apply for pathogens residing inside blood vessels. Whether the intravascular localization of Neisseria meningitidis might account for the incapacity of the innate immune system to clear this infection remains an open question. Therefore, studying the interaction of intravascular bacterial and viral pathogens with endothelial cells is critical to better understand their pathogenesis.",

Intravital imaging of 56 infected vessels confirmed the recruitment of neutrophils during the early phase of the infection (0-6 h) but only 46% of the infected vessels exhibited at least one neutrophil in their proximity 6 h p.i., pointing to a heterogeneous neutrophil response across the infected tissue ( Supplementary Fig. 1d) . Similarly, the numbers of neutrophils per mm 2 of endothelium progressively increased and reached the mean value of 93 \u00b1 27 neutrophils 6 h p.i. (Fig. 1d) . The secretion of murine cytokines in infected tissues was in good agreement with the kinetics of neutrophil recruitment. Murine neutrophil-attracting cytokines such as TNF, CXCL1, and CXCL2 were detectable as early as 6 h p.i. and progressively increased with time ( Supplementary Fig. 2a) . Similarly, human neutrophil-recruiting cytokines such as TNF and IL-8 were also produced by the human endothelium upon infection ( Supplementary Fig. 2b) .",

Indeed, neutrophil has been reported to induce vascular damage in other systems 17 intravital imaging to compare with neutrophil recruitment kinetics. Over 500 blood vessels on histological slices were analyzed for each time point and classified as healthy, congested (with accumulation of red blood cells), or breached (with perivascular extravasation of red blood cells). Representative images and quantitative results of each vascular condition are shown in Fig. 3f . The percentage of healthy vessels gradually declined down to only 4% 24 h p.i. Conversely, congestion and vascular rupture progressively increased with time. Interestingly, a significant increase in vascular congestion was observed as early as 3 h p.i. and thus before recruitment of neutrophils. The percentage of congested vessels continued to increase to reach a maximum percentage of 70% at 16 h p.i., which remained stable until 24 h p.i. A similar situation occurred with vascular rupture, with a slight increase at 6 h p.i. from 2 to 7% that progressively increased, reaching 25% at 16 h p.i. Neutrophil depletion led to a decrease in the number of congested vessels and a concurrent increase in the occurrence of breached vessels with released red blood cells ( Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 3e ). To confirm and extend these results, vessel permeability to serum content was then measured using Evans Blue 18 . This dye was injected intravenously and 10 min post-injection, the circulating dye was removed from blood vessels by myocardial perfusion of heparin-containing buffer. As expected, a 24 h infection led to an increase of vascular permeability evidenced by high Evans blue accumulation in the tissue. In the absence of neutrophils, vascular leakage due to the infection was further increased (Fig. 3h ). Altogether these data are in favor of a protective role for neutrophils during meningococcal infection. After being recruited, neutrophils incompletely control the number of bacteria in the infected vessels and thus partially reduce the vascular damage induced by the bacteria upon vascular colonization.",

Our results at this stage reveal a paradox, neutrophils are recruited upon vascular colonization and provide protection but fail to prevent the initiation and progression of the infection. A possible explanation of this incomplete neutrophil response is that the recruitment is insufficient in terms of number. This hypothesis is supported by the relatively low overall numbers of neutrophils (93 \u00b1 27 neutrophils mm \u22122 at 6 h p.i.) that are observed following N. meningitidis infection. As a comparison, TNF\u03b1 stimulation or similar inflammatory situations can lead to about fivefold this value 19 . We thus hypothesized that the unusual intraluminal location of the bacteria, rather than the bacterium itself, is responsible for this moderate recruitment. To test this hypothesis, bacteria were injected directly into the xenograft intradermally and the inflammatory infiltrate was evaluated. The amounts of injected bacteria were adjusted to reach the amount found following intravascular infection (Fig. 4a ). In these conditions, histological analysis of the human skin graft 3 h post intradermal infection showed a considerable infiltration of inflammatory cells in contrast to intravascular infection at the same time point (Fig. 4b ). This was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis that highlighted a tenfold increase in neutrophil numbers as early as 3 h post intradermal infection (Fig. 4c ). Even at 6 h post intravascular infection, such numbers were not reached (Fig. 1c) . These results point to the unexpectedly slow kinetics of neutrophil recruitment during vascular colonization and a particular impact of the vessel intraluminal location of the bacteria during infection.",

We thus analyzed in-depth whether bacteria equally infected distinct types of vessels. For this, infected vessels were categorized into three classes: capillaries, venules, and arterioles. The distinction between human venules and arterioles was based on a combination of parameters: morphology, the intensity of the UEA-1 lectin staining 20 , intensity and direction of blood flow, as well as an arteriole-specific staining approach using Hydrazide Alexa-Fluor633, as previously described 21 (Supplementary Fig. 4a , b). Capillaries were characterized by a luminal diameter below or equal to 10 \u00b5m. Remarkably, this classification revealed that N. meningitidis could infect all vessel types (Fig. 4d ). Observed infected venules and arterioles had a similar diameter, 43.73 \u00b1 7.52 \u00b5m and 49.13 \u00b1 3.77 \u00b5m, respectively (Fig. 4e) . In order to validate these observations made in an experimental mouse model, evidence of colonization of venules and arterioles in a human case were sought. Postmortem samples from a case of purpura fulminans were immuno-stained to visualize bacteria and tissue organization. Evidence of colonization of both venules and arterioles could be found in different tissues, such as in the liver and choroid plexus, in which aggregates of bacteria were associated with the endothelium (Fig. 4f , red arrows). N. meningitidis is thus able to colonize all types of vascular beds both in an experimental system and during human infections.",

To test this hypothesis, the recruitment of neutrophils to the different vessel beds was evaluated. Neutrophils were rarely recruited to infected capillaries (Fig. 4g) . The kinetics and percentage of infected vessels recruiting at least a single neutrophil were similar between venules and arterioles showing that some level of recruitment occurred in both of these vessel types (Fig. 4g) . Importantly, however, the number of neutrophils recruited was much higher in venules than in arterioles, with 248 \u00b1 115 versus 83 \u00b1 25 neutrophils per mm 2 of the endothelium, respectively, at 6 h p.i.

Neutrophils on the endothelium were highly motile and efficiently explored the infected endothelium by crawling on its surface (Supplementary Movie 4). On frequent occasions, neutrophils crawled in the direction of adherent bacterial aggregates. Neutrophils could efficiently internalize the adherent bacteria and thus detach them from the cellular surface ( Fig. 5d and Supplementary Movie 4). During long-term observations, bacterial aggregates initially adhering to the vascular wall could no longer be found following the arrival of neutrophils, demonstrating their efficiency in this context (Fig. 5a , red arrows and Supplementary Movie 4). This implies that neutrophils have the ability to detach bacteria tightly bound to the endothelial surface.

This is striking considering the massive infection observed in arterioles. The recruitment of neutrophils to arterioles was then examined in detail. Intravital imaging revealed that the few neutrophils recruited to arterioles were either located in an intra-or extraluminal location, occasionally both (Fig. 6a) . Neutrophil location was quantified in 24 arterioles over time, revealing that intraluminal and extraluminal or perivascular locations were represented in similar proportions (Fig. 6b) . During the course of the infection, the recruitment of both intraluminal and perivascular neutrophils progressively increased over time with similar kinetics and similarly low numbers per surface of the endothelium (Fig. 6c) . The few intraluminal neutrophils were frequently found to contain large amounts of bacteria (Fig. 6a, red arrows) . In contrast, perivascular neutrophils were never observed to contain bacteria and even though neutrophils were often closely wrapped around the vascular wall (Supplementary Movie 5). No evidence of perivascular neutrophils translocating into infected arterioles was observed. Following 4-6 h of infection, vessels were clogged with bacteria and intraluminal neutrophils progressively showed reduced motility ( Fig. 6d and Supplementary Movie 6) . These results show that when arterioles are infected, only limited amounts of neutrophils are recruited, and furthermore, their efficiency is limited. The few intravascular neutrophils are rapidly overwhelmed with bacteria filling the vessel lumen. Extravascular neutrophils fail to enter vessels and access bacteria.",

The above results raised the question of why neutrophils were efficiently recruited to venules but not to capillaries and arterioles despite the large accumulation of bacteria in all these vessel types. During infections caused by other pathogens, occurring inside tissues, neutrophils specifically exit the circulation through venules to reach the infection site. In this case, the specificity for venules is linked to the expression of a set of adhesion receptors on the endothelium surface, which are triggered by inflammatory signals coming from the infection site 22 . Although the intravascular location of the N. meningitidis infection generates a different situation, the difference in neutrophil response could be due to a differential expression of adhesion receptors. We first determined the consequence of meningococcal infection on the expression of a selection of neutrophil adhesion receptors on human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. While ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 cell surface levels barely increase 5 h after infection, the expression of E-selectin (CD62E) was strongly induced by the infection (Fig. 7a) , as previously reported 23 . Expression of E- selectin was highest at 5 h post infection, but was clearly detectable as early as 2 h post infection. This kinetics of expression being compatible with the kinetics of neutrophils recruitment observed during infection in vivo, we then determined the expression of E-selectin in the humanized mouse model of N. meningitidis infection. Low concentrations of fluorescently labeled anti-human CD62E monoclonal antibodies were introduced in the circulation of infected animals and accumulation of signals along infected vessel walls followed. Infection in the context of capillaries and arterioles did not lead to any specific signal (Fig. 7b ), where only a low level and constant background signal could be seen. In contrast, infected venules showed a gradual accumulation of E-selectin signal during the course of the infection (Fig. 7b) . These results are consistent with previous studies using TNF\u03b1 or LPS stimulation [24] [25] [26] . Interestingly, the signal was heterogeneous along the human endothelium surface and strongly colocalized with bacterial colonies (Fig. 7c) . Signals leading to E-selectin expression thus had a local component linked to bacterial adhesion. The role of E-selectin in N. meningitidis-induced neutrophil recruitment was then explored in vivo using a blocking antibody. As expected 27 , neutrophil recruitment was strongly impaired in venules upon E-selectin blocking (47\u00b127 neutrophils versus 188 \u00b1 53 neutrophils in the isotype control condition), while robust vascular colonization was taking place (Fig. 7d, e) . E-selectin is thus a central player in the recruitment of neutrophils to venules following N. meningitidis infection.",

            "text": "The ability of bacteria to adhere to the endothelium wall is the starting point for the innate immune response as this allows the concentration of bacteria at a specific focal point rather than their systemic distribution in the blood. In absence of adhesion, neutrophil recruitment is barely detectable. Bacterial accumulation on the endothelial surface is thus a trigger for neutrophil recruitment. The ability of bacteria to autoaggregate also enhances neutrophil recruitment. This is likely explained by the amplification of bacterial numbers at the site of infection due to the three-dimensional accumulation of bacteria. It could also be envisioned that the formation of aggregates leads to more perturbations in blood flow and subsequently more inflammatory signals. Nevertheless, type IV pili are central players in triggering the inflammatory response by allowing adhesion and autoaggregation. Bacterial adhesion also shapes the innate immune response by leading to the colonization of different vessel types including capillaries. In a previous study focusing on meningitis and infection of the brain, we had shown preferential colonization of capillaries in this organ 28 . This study, based on an in vivo model and clinical samples, extends these findings to other organs, confirms infection of capillaries, and shows that other vascular beds can be infected. Venules are readily infected and bacterial aggregates bound to the venular endothelial surface can be seen 2-3 h p.i. In this context, neutrophils are recruited rapidly and in large numbers at similar times. Neutrophil recruitment correlates with the expression of E-selectin at the surface of the venular endothelium, which promotes neutrophil adhesion and crawling. Upon venular infection, neutrophils are located inside the vascular lumen, actively crawl on the endothelium surface, and phagocytose bacteria. Evidence of the disappearance of aggregates from the endothelium surface upon neutrophil local recruitment is clearly seen, thus demonstrating their functional impact on bacterial clearance. Accordingly, depletion of neutrophils leads to more severe infection as measured by global bacterial numbers inside the tissue and evidence of vascular damage. Interestingly, at early time points post infection, high-resolution intravital microscopy of infected venules allowed direct observation of adhering bacteria being engulfed by neutrophils. Considering the intimate type IV pili-mediated adhesion of bacteria to the endothelial surface, allowing bacterial aggregates to resist high mechanical stress 29 , the phagocytosis of such bacterial colonies by neutrophils thus implies the engagement of intense forces that would warrant further investigation.",

Such neutrophils likely extravasated from nearby venules and migrated through the tissue toward the infected arterioles. Interestingly, these extraluminal neutrophils fail to enter arterioles from the outside and remain within the perivascular area for hours without any evidence of phagocytosis. Although a matter of debate, the ability of neutrophils within tissues to go back inside venules by a process termed reverse migration has been described 30 . In the case of meningococcal infections, the inability of these cells to enter vessels or even reach inside infected arterioles could simply be explained by the nature and thickness of the arteriolar vascular wall. It should be pointed out that the recruitment of neutrophils around arterioles can be seen at 6 h p.i. when there is now evidence of vascular leakage. The lumen of arterioles and capillaries thus provide a safe haven for the bacterium.",

In arterioles, it is generally accepted that the expression of such adhesion molecules is lower than in venules, leading to lower levels of interaction of neutrophils with the arteriolar endothelium 31 . Nevertheless, in certain instances, the expression of adhesion molecules in arterioles is significantly increased during inflammation. For instance, TNF\u03b1 treatment results in increased expression of P-and Eselectin, as well as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, in cremaster muscle arterioles 32 . Angiotensin II has also been reported to induce the recruitment of neutrophils to arterioles 33 . It nevertheless remains that during N. meningitidis infection, despite the impressive accumulation of bacteria within the lumen of arterioles, insufficient levels of adhesion molecules are expressed to provoke the efficient recruitment of neutrophils.",

They include vascular congestions, intravascular coagulation, and loss of vessel integrity. The rapid and massive occurrence of these damages lead to decreased tissue oxygenation and finally organ dysfunction. In addition to determining the role of neutrophils in this process, this study provides a detailed description of the kinetics of bacteria-induced vascular damages. At 2-3 h post infection, 30% of vessels in the infected tissue show evidence of congestion on histological slides. At these early time points, barely any neutrophils are recruited, suggesting that they have little or no role in the initial stages of vascular damage. At later stages (16-24 h) , nearly all vessels of the infected tissue become congested providing a striking illustration of how infection causes organ failure. At these same time points, a fraction of vessels lose their integrity and vascular contents are released in the tissue. Our study shows that neutrophils play a protective role in this second phase of the infection by limiting the extent of vascular leakage. This is associated with increased congestion, suggesting that neutrophils could enhance coagulation. Exactly how neutrophils limit vascular damage remains to be determined. Assuming that the bacteria themselves trigger the vascular damage, the effect of neutrophils on the number of bacteria could be sufficient to explain their protective role on the vessels. Alternatively, neutrophils could facilitate the coagulation response as previously seen in other models 34 . The specific impact of neutrophils on coagulation during N. meningitidis infection needs to be further explored as it could potentially limit further colonization by bacteria.",

The absence of endothelial adhesion receptor expression, such as E-selectin, in these vascular beds upon infection, provides an explanation for the reduced levels of intravascular neutrophil recruitment. At later time points post infection, vessels are entirely full of bacteria, to the point where the few neutrophils on site are trapped in bacterial colonies. The combination of coagulation and occupation of the luminal space by bacteria and congested red blood cells rapidly stops blood flow and consequently, neutrophils have limited access to reach the bacterial colonies.

Fc receptors were blocked using the anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (FcBlock clone 2.4G2) monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences, #553141, 1/400), and cells were stained for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with a combination of the following anti-mouse immunopheno-typing antibodies: from Biolegend: PacificBlue-conjugated anti-Ly-6C (clone HK1.4, #128014, 1/400), PacificBlue-or PE/Cy7-conjugated anti-Ly-6G/Ly-6C (GR-1) (clone RB6-8C5, #108430 or #108416, 1/400 and 1/200, respectively), PacificBlue-conjugated anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11, #103126, 1/200). From eBioscience: APC-conjugated anti-CD11b (clone M1/70, #17-0112-82, 1/200), PEconjugated anti-Ly-6C (clone HK1.4, #12-5932-82, 1/400). From BD Biosciences: BUV395-conjugated anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11, #564279, 1/200).Exclusion of nonviable cells has been achieved using eFluor780 Fixable viability dye (eBioscience, #65-0865) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After staining, cells were washed in 1\u00d7 PBS and fixed for 20 min at 4\u00b0C with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1\u00d7 PBS and washed with 1\u00d7 PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. Data were acquired using a BD LSR Fortessa TM flow cytometer controlled with the BD FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience). Data analysis was carried out using FlowJo software v10 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). Numbers of cells were expressed per mg of the skin according to the following formula: N \u00bc n\u00f0p=100\u00de W ; where N is the number of cells per milligram of skin, n the number of live cells obtained after skin dissociation (Trypan blue exclusion), P the percentage of the given cell population among the \"live cells\" gate determined by flow cytometry and W the weight in milligram of the corresponding biopsy before skin dissociation.",
