To investigate this in more detail, we performed a retrospective observational study in which we used the IgG antibody response from 11,118 longitudinal antibody measurements of 2,082 unique COVID convalescent plasma donors. COVID-19 symptoms and donor characteristics were obtained by a questionnaire. Antibody responses were modelled using a linear mixed-effects model. Our study confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is associated with patient characteristics like body mass index and age. Antibody decay was faster in male than in female donors (average half-life of 62 versus 72 days). Most interestingly, we also found that three symptoms (headache, anosmia, nasal cold) were associated with lower peak IgG, while six other symptoms (dry cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, fever, dyspnoea, muscle weakness) were associated with higher IgG concentrations.",

In the third step, fixed effects that were statistically insignificant in the second step were removed and additional donor information variables obtained from the questionnaires were added as fixed effects ( information concerned data on hospitalization, ICU admission, co-morbidities, and the presence of 18 symptoms as shown in Table 1 . This approach allowed separate estimation of the proportion of variance explained by donor characteristics and clinical information. Significance levels of individual variables were estimated using Satterthwaite's approximation (18) , as degrees of freedom cannot be calculated exactly in models that include both random and fixed effects. Because this approximation is slightly anticonservative, an alpha-level of 0.01 was chosen to determine statistical significance. Non-significant predictors were excluded after each step. Relative quality, taking into account both goodness of fit and model complexity, of the models was assessed by comparing the Akaike information criteria (AIC) after each step.",

To our knowledge, this is currently the largest study that describes such associations. Individual antibody responses were modelled using a linear mixed-effects model, from which peak IgG concentration and antibody half-life were determined. Symptoms and donor characteristics were obtained from a questionnaire. Our study shows that the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is associated with patient characteristics like sex, age, and BMI. Of note, we also found that specific COVID-19 symptoms are associated with antibody levels.",

A strength of our study are the longitudinal measurements, which enabled us to reliably estimate the peak level of each individual donor independent on the timing of the first antibody measurement. Only a quarter of the variation in peak IgG concentration between patients can be explained by associations with donor characteristics and disease symptoms. To a lesser degree, donor characteristics were also associated with differences in antibody half-life, which was also variable between donors, albeit less than the peak level. The antibody half-life was not correlated to peak levels. Whether these differences in antibody half-life reflect differences in protection for reinfection will be investigated, and this thoroughly characterized donor cohort can serve as bench mark for those studies.",

This association between symptoms and antibody levels may possibly reflect the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus frequently initiates infection in the upper airways (mild symptoms and low IgG levels) before spreading through the body (severe symptoms and high IgG levels). Headache, anosmia and nasal cold were common symptoms, each present in at least 50% of patients in our population. Fatigue was present in more than 70% of patients and was associated with higher peak IgG concentration, suggesting more severe illness. A previous study in a hospital cohort found that fatigue and dyspnoea are prognostic for severe infection, and a stuffed nose (comparable to nasal cold) for mild infection, which is in line with our findings (19) . Furthermore, we found higher age and BMI to be associated with higher peak IgG concentrations. Sex was not associated with FIGURE 3 | Predicted impact of various symptoms on anti-RBD IgG peak concentration. Estimated peak IgG concentrations when different symptoms are displayed. For each of the symptoms here, the difference in peak IgG as compared to the group without this symptom is statistically significant with p < 0.001. *The effect of sex on the intercept (peak IgG) was not statistically significant, but the variable is not excluded from the model due to its effect on the slope.",

The small group of patients that had been admitted to hospital displayed both higher peak IgG concentrations and shorter halflives. Probably this effect is the result of the presence of shortlived plasmablasts that produce high levels of antibodies. Previous studies found sex differences in COVID-19 immune responses, with higher IgG concentrations associated with male sex, older age, and hospitalization (20) (21) (22) . Although our results are consistent with these findings for age and hospitalization, we found that the association between male sex and higher peak IgG concentration was not significant after correction for age and BMI. This suggests that the previously found association with male gender was possibly due to the increased risk of severe disease in men. Most studies on differences in antibody response are performed in hospital cohorts, our study population consisted mainly of recovered patients that were not admitted to hospital (96.7%), and therefore disease severity is expected to be lower. Consistently, BMI in the non-hospitalized group was 25.9 compared to 28.8 in hospitalized patients. A strength of our study is the large number of recovered patients included in our study population. The status of Sanquin as the only blood bank in the Netherlands, combined with wellestablished connections with municipal health services, allowed us to invite people with a positive PCR test to become CCP donors after recovery. This allowed us to both include non-TABLE 3 | Variance of random effects in models of all three steps. Percentual variance decrease relative to the null-model is given in brackets.",

It should also be noted that some bias may be present in our data, as symptoms are self-reported by patients after recovery. Relatively mild symptoms, such as nasal cold, may therefore be underreported by patients who at the same time experienced more severe symptoms, such as fever or dyspnoea.
