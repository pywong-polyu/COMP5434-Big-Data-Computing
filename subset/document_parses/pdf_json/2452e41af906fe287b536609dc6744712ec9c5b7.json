This is due to the high risk of fatal complications, such as aortic rupture, severe aortic regurgitation, pericardial tamponade, and cerebral and coronary malperfusion (1), which are responsible for 33% mortality after 24 h and 50% mortality after 48 h (2). However, a very limited number of patients remain stable, with only mild to absent symptoms, and may thus survive the acute phase (1) . After a 14-day period, the aortic dissection is defined as chronic (1) . The global incidence of aortic dissection is 5 to 30 cases per 1 million people per year (3). We recently published our experience with ATAADs from 2014 to 2019. During the considered period, we treated 117 ATAADs in our center, which represents 3 to 5 ATAAD cases per month and had no chronic cases (4) . However, between February and May 2020, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic temporarily reduced health care accessibility. As such, these statistics were noticeably altered, with only three confirmed ATAADs, which represented a decrease of \u00be, compared to the usual volume. Nevertheless, we experienced two cases of chronic type A aortic dissection (CTAAD) in July 2020, which is a pathology we usually see only once every 5 years (4).",

She complained about the spontaneous onset of acute right lower-limb pain. The patient did not present any chest pain or dyspnea. The clinical examination revealed a painful but mild pretibial edema on the left lower limb, whereas no heart murmur was documented. D-Dimer levels were 570 mg/L (reference, <500 mg/L). On the same day, the patient was referred to the angiology department where a diagnosis of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the left lower limb was established. Her arterial pressure was 131/86 mm Hg in the right arm and 134/87 mm Hg in the left arm, and all peripheral pulses were palpable. The patient was discharged with a therapeutic anticoagulation treatment (rivaroxaban 20 mg, once daily), with a 3-month follow-up examination scheduled for May.

Thousands of patients experience delayed management of potentially life-threatening conditions including type A aortic dissection. This is mainly due to a saturation of hospital capacity and patients' fear about becoming infected by the coronavirus in the hospital environment. We noticed a decrease in the number of ATAADs that were referred to our emergency department during the peak phase of the pandemic. This decrease of acute aortic syndromes was also highlighted by El-Hamamsy et al. who found the volume of ATAADs to be 76.5% lower than usual in New York City between March and April 2020 (5). Similar observations concerning myocardial infarctions and emergency department visits in general have also been reported (6, 7) . Both of our patients exhibited atypical presentations with no specific symptoms or signs of ATAAD. We speculate that this played a role in their missed or delayed diagnoses. This may relate to the unexpected rise in CTAAD cases during the phase that followed the first peak of the pandemic. The absence of specific ATAAD symptoms in these patients was central to these delayed diagnoses. This phenomenon was reinforced by the pandemic, as patients altered their thresholds of symptoms that would normally compel them to seek medical advice. They waited longer before consulting a doctor than they would have before the pandemic.",
