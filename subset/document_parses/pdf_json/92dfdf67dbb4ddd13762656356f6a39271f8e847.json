The patient was immediately transferred to intensive care, where he was intubated and ventilated and remained for 49 days. Ventilation proved difficult with rising oxygen requirements and decreased lung compliance. During the first week, his fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) was consistently 0.6 -0.75 and intermittently as high as 0.95 (i.e. 95% oxygen), with low and deteriorating PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios ( Figure 2 ). This was consistent with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He underwent multiple cycles of prone positioning and treatment with nitric oxide (a pulmonary vasodilator) in attempts to improve his oxygenation and empirical treatment with antimicrobial agents despite no definite evidence of bacterial co-infection. After a repeat chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral early fibrotic changes ( Figure 1B) , and with no improvement in gas exchange, methylprednisolone was commenced at 1 mg/kg BD for 10 days.",

Molecular analysis identified TET2, SRSF2 and ASXL1 mutations by next-generation sequencing with no evidence of MPN associated mutations. These findings were highly suggestive of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Cytoreductive therapy was initially avoided due to concerns over myelosuppression during his critical illness. However, with persistent leucocytosis potentially contributing to on-going respiratory compromise, hydroxycarbamide was started on day 8.

He had multiple SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assessments during his hospital admission and was continued to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA even until day 31. Subsequent multiple testing from day 36 onwards revealed no further detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from his respiratory samples. He also had a CT scan of thorax on day 57, which demonstrated bilateral peripheral or subpleural fibrotic changes with associated ground glass appearances without overt consolidations (Figure 3) . These changes were thought to be consistent with a recent COVID-19 infection. When clinically well enough he had a bone marrow biopsy which confirmed a diagnosis with CMML-1 with 3% blasts/promonocytes by morphology. Karyotype was normal. After now successfully leaving hospital, he continues to make good progress in his physical recovery and will be reviewed in haematology outpatient clinic for the longer-term management of his CMML.",

Trends in WCC correlate well with levels of oxygenation; the most elevated WCC (80-100 x10 9 /L) corresponded to the patients' most severe period of hypoxaemia. Within 48 hours of initiating hydroxycarbamide, improvement was seen in WCC, correlating with improving hypoxemia as indicated by increasing PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio.

The increase in WCC can accumulate in small vasculatures particularly renal, cerebral, cardiac and pulmonary.

On balance, it was felt that the mortality risk associated with pulmonary hyperleucostasis was high and cytoreduction therapy with hydroxycarbamide was started cautiously. More intensive chemotherapy was not an option as patient was too unwell. As demonstrated, his lung perfusion improved with reduction of his WCC.
