The World Health Organization has estimated that in 2011 there were 1,400,000 deaths due to tuberculosis, 1,200,000 deaths due to HIV/AIDS, and 627,000 deaths due to malaria (but other sources have estimated the number of malaria deaths to be more than 1,000,000). In short, HIV, malaria, and TB account for at least 9,000 deaths each day. The impact of vaccines can be dramatic, for example, there were 2,600,000 deaths due to measles in 1980 but only 160,000 by 2011. The development and availability of the measles vaccine led to a reduction in the number of deaths due to this childhood disease of nearly 94%.",

Naturally, understanding the causes and modes of transmission of each disease is central to forecasting or mitigating its impact within and across populations at risk.

The records, beginning in 1592 and kept continuously from 1603 on, provided the data that Graunt used to begin to understand or identify possible causes of observed mortality patterns.

Variolation, essentially inoculation with a mild strain, was introduced as a way to produce lifelong immunity against smallpox, but with a small risk of infection and death. There was heated debate about variolation, and Bernoulli was led to study the question of whether variolation was beneficial. His approach was to calculate the increase in life expectancy if smallpox were to be eliminated as a cause of death. His approach to the question of competing risks led to the publication of a brief outline in 1760 [7] followed in 1766 by a more complete exposition [8] . His work received a mainly favorable reception; research that has become known in the actuarial literature rather than in the epidemiological literature. More recently his approach has been generalized [31] .",

The idea of invisible living creatures as agents of disease goes back at least to the writings of Aristotle (384-322 BC). The existence of microorganisms was demonstrated by van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) with the aid of the first microscopes. The first expression of the germ theory of disease by Jacob Henle (1809-1885) came in 1840 and was developed by Robert Koch (1843-1910), Joseph Lister (1827-1912), and Louis Pasteur (1822-1875) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The modern view is that many diseases are spread by contact through a virus or bacterium. We focus in this book on the problem of understanding the spread of disease at a population level. Similar modeling approaches can be used to study the dynamics of infection within a host for diseases including HIV. This area is the backbone of the field of mathematical and computational immunology and viral dynamics. An introduction to immunology may be found in the book by Nowak and May [67] .",

It is worth noting that the foundations of the entire approach to epidemiology based on compartmental models were laid, not by mathematicians, but primarily by public health physicians such as Sir R.A. Ross A particularly instructive example is the work of Ross on malaria. Sir Ronald Ross was awarded the second Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1902 for his demonstration of the dynamics of the transmission of malaria between mosquitoes and humans. He discovered the malarial parasite in the gastrointestinal tract of the Anopheles mosquito from which he was able to characterize the life cycle of malaria. He concluded that this vector-borne disease was transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito and in the process he developed a program for controlling or eliminating it at the population level.",

The study of graphs originated with the abstract theory of Erd\u00f6s and R\u00e9nyi of the 1950s and 1960s [33] [34] [35] , and has become important more recently in many areas, including in the study of social contacts, computer networks, and many other areas, as well as in the spread of communicable diseases. We will think of networks as bi-directional, with disease transmission possible in either direction along an edge. A brief taste of network models is given at the beginning of Chap. 4. It is however important to stress the fact that this book does not get involved in the study of stochastic models or in the study of epidemics in networks-areas that deserve their own volumes.",

In other words, we assume that a disease outbreak begins when a single infective transmits infection to all of the people with whom he or she is in contact. Our development via branching processes is along the lines of that of [26] . Another approach, using a contact network perspective taken in [20, 65, 66] begins with an infected edge, corresponding to a disease outbreak started by an infective individual who passes the infection on to only one contact. This approach is the one taken more commonly in studies of epidemics on networks. It is somewhat more complicated and leads to somewhat different results, although the methods are quite similar.",

However, there is also a positive probability that the infection will increase initially but will produce only a minor outbreak dying out before triggering a major epidemic.

Another approach would be to continue to use a network model throughout the course of the epidemic [63, 64, 76] . It is possible to formulate this model dynamically with the limiting case of this dynamic model, as the population size becomes very large, being the same as the compartmental model. Past experiences and data have shown that the spread of infection in small populations is better captured in small communities as a random process. For this reason, stochastic models have an important role in disease transmission modeling. The most commonly used stochastic model includes the chain binomial model of Reed and Frost, first described in lectures in 1928 by W.H. Frost but not published until much later [1, 78] . The Reed-Frost model was actually anticipated nearly 40 years earlier by P.D. En'ko [30] . The work of En'ko was brought to public attention much later by K. Dietz [28] . E.B. Wilson and M.H. Burke have given a description of Frost's 1928 lectures with a somewhat different derivation [78] . M. Greenwood introduced a somewhat different chain binomial model in 1931 [40] . The Reed-Frost model has been used widely as a basic stochastic model and many extensions have been formulated. The book [25] by D.J. Daley and J. Gani contains an account of some of the more recent extensions. Also, a stochastic analogue of the Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model has been described in [6] .",

One way in which models have expressed the idea of a reduction in contacts as an epidemic proceeds is to assume a contact rate of the form \u03b2Sf (I ) with a function f (I ) that grows more slowly than linearly in I .

There are seasonal outbreaks which may be closely related to the strain of the previous year, that is, modified by point mutations, or it may be less closely related or it may be unrelated. The level of relation of two strains, as measured by the response of hosts that have experienced a prior influenza infection, is what we refer to as strain crossimmunity. Cross-immunity measures the level of protection earned by individuals who were infected by a related strain in a previous year. Influenza models may consider the effect that a partially efficacious vaccination may have before an outbreak, as well as the role of antiviral treatment during an outbreak. Considering multiple modes of transmission is critical when the goal is to minimize the impact of a disease in a population. Cholera may be transmitted both by direct contact and by contact with pathogen shed by infectives. In tuberculosis some individuals progress rapidly to active tuberculosis, while others progress much more slowly. Also, active-tuberculosis individuals who fail to comply with long-term treatment schedules become prime candidates for the development of a drug-resistant strain. In HIV/AIDS, the infectivity of an individual depends strongly on the time since infection, while transmission depends on modes of transmission, mixing between individuals and more. In malaria, immunity against infection is boosted by exposure to infection or by genetics (sickle cell anemia).",

The analysis of a model for an endemic disease, carried out in Chap. 3, begins with the search for equilibria, which are, by definition, constant solutions of the model. Usually there is a disease-free equilibrium and there are one or more endemic equilibria, with a positive number of infected individuals. The next step is to linearize about each equilibrium and determine the stability of each equilibrium. Usually, if the basic reproduction number is less than 1, the only equilibrium is the disease-free equilibrium and this equilibrium is asymptotically stable. If the basic reproduction number is greater than 1, the usual situation is that the diseasefree equilibrium is unstable and there is a unique endemic equilibrium which is asymptotically stable.

Another possibility is that there is a unique endemic equilibrium but it is unstable. In this situation, there is often a Hopf bifurcation and an asymptotically stable periodic orbit around the endemic equilibrium. An example of such behavior may be found in an SIRS model, with a temporary immunity period of fixed length following recovery [51] and in an SV I R model [38] .

The qualitative behavior of a system with a backward bifurcation differs from that of a system with a forward bifurcation and the nature of these changes has been described in [11] . Since these behavioral differences are important in planning how to control a disease, it is important to determine whether a system can have a backward bifurcation.

One explanation for this discrepancy is that the estimates were based on transmission data in hospitals and crowded apartment complexes or in the scaling of the model used to estimate parameters [24] .

Individuals with different ages may have different reproduction and survival capacities. Diseases may have different infection rates and mortality rates for different age groups. Individuals of different ages may also have different behaviors, and behavioral changes are crucial in control and prevention of many infectious diseases. Young individuals tend to be more active in interactions with or between populations, and in disease transmissions. Age-structured models are studied in Chap. 13 .",

More than half of the deaths attributed to malaria are in children under 5 years of age due to their weaker immune systems. This suggests that in models for disease transmission in an age-structured population it is necessary to allow the contact rates between two members of the population to depend on the ages of both members. Another important motivation for using agestructured models for childhood diseases is that vaccination is age-dependent (e.g., measles).",
