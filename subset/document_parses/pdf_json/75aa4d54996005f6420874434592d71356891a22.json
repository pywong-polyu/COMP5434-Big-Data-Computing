Unlike mRNA vaccines, DNA vaccines are thermostable and can be cold-chain free, and also do not require the use of live virus. Indeed, at least 10 DNA vaccines for COVID-19 are in clinical trials globally, and at least 16 are in preclinical development (4) . However, the historic challenge of DNA vaccines has been a concern with poor immunogenicity in larger animals and humans. Ongoing efforts to enhance immunogenicity focus on DNA platform optimization using techniques such as codon optimization, alternative delivery strategies such as electroporation and gene guns, and the use of adjuvants (5) . Among these, electroporation has been notably successful, with 100-to 1,000-fold enhancements in plasmid delivery and gene expression relative to injection alone (6) . In fact, DNA vaccination with skin electroporation has been shown to increase antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses, IFN-\u03b3 levels, and humoral immune responses (7) .",

The most advanced DNA vaccine for COVID-19 currently in Phase II/III clinical trials also uses electroporation (10) . Electroporation facilitates DNA vaccination by transiently breaking down cell membranes to drive DNA into cells, which can lead to the expression of the Significance Low-cost and rapidly distributable vaccines are urgently needed to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics, especially for developing countries and other low-resource settings. DNA vaccines are inexpensive, rapidly developed, and safe, but require bulky and expensive electroporation devices for effective vaccination, which presents challenges to affordable and mass vaccination. We developed an ultralow-cost (<1 USD), handheld (<50 g), battery-free electroporation system combining a thumb-actuated piezoelectric pulser and a microneedle electrode array skin interface for DNA vaccination against COVID-19, which was shown to be immunogenic and well-tolerated in animal studies. This study provides a proof-of-concept that DNA vaccination against epidemics can be achieved using an ultra-low-cost electroporator that is inexpensive enough for single use and robust enough for repeated use if desired. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen. Plasma membrane poration requires the application of microsecond to millisecond pulses that generate electric fields of hundreds to thousands of volts per centimeter (11) . The use of electroporators has, however, been greatly limited due to high equipment costs (thousands of US dollars), lack of portability (>5 kg), need for electricity, complex manufacturing, and difficult scaling up. These limitations reduce access by patients and clinics in low-resource settings, such as in developing countries. These limitations are particularly notable in pandemic scenarios, such as COVID-19, where traditional electroporators would be challenging to rapidly mass-produce and distribute. Thus, there is a need for an inexpensive, safe, effective, and easily accessible electroporation platform to administer DNA vaccines that can be rapidly scaled in response to outbreaks, such as COVID- 19. To address this need for effective DNA vaccine delivery strategies to curb the COVID-19 pandemic and future ones, we developed an ultra-low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use microneedle electrode array (MEA) electroporator for enhancing the immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine. This electroporation system consists of a piezoelectric pulse generator and a metal MEA, which, together, we call the ePatch. The pulse generator is derived from a common household piezoelectric stove lighter, which is currently mass-produced by the billions. In this way, our pulse generator is easily accessible and costs as little as $0.23 (US dollars) to manufacture (12) . In our prior study, we have demonstrated, in vitro, that this pulse generator was able to transform electrocompetent Escherichia coli with a transformation efficiency comparable to a conventional benchtop electroporator that was >10,000 times more costly and >100-fold bigger (12) . Moreover, the piezoelectric pulse generator produces bipolar, oscillatory pulses, which can electroporate cells more effectively compared to conventional exponential decay or square-wave pulses (13) .",

To achieve such a high field strength, we used MEAs with very close (i.e., 0.9 mm) spacing, such that piezoelectric pulses of hundreds of volts can be used to achieve the very large, required field strengths. Much larger voltages would be needed to achieve this field strength if we used conventional clamp electrodes or penetrating electrodes with spacings of many millimeters. A second benefit of using MEAs is that they can be used to target delivery to the skin, which has been shown to provide greater immunogenicity for DNA and other vaccines compared to vaccination in the muscle (15, 16) . Finally, the microneedles are just 650 \u03bcm long, which can concentrate the electric field in the epidermis, which is especially rich in antigen-presenting cells, and keep electric fields away from stimulating sensory and motor nerves deeper in the dermis or muscle tissue below. Microneedles are an inexpensive and simple-to-use technology that has previously been employed for vaccine delivery to the skin (without electroporation) in preclinical and clinical studies (15, 17) . Alternatively, prior studies in our laboratory have demonstrated microneedles functionalized as electrodes for delivery of electric pulses to cause electroporation in cells in vitro (18, 19) .",

The resulting design consists of a piezoelectric pulse generator and a metal MEA (Fig.  1) . The electric pulses are generated based on piezoelectricity, a technique derived from the mechanism found in a common household gas lighter. The pulses are generated using a springlatch mechanism wherein a hammer strikes a piezoelectric crystal, producing a powerful mechanical force converted into highvoltage electrical energy that is used to generate a spark when applied across an air gap (i.e., when operated as a lighter), but can be used to pass current through tissue using microneedle electrodes. We previously described the theoretical principles of this spring-latch mechanism and its advantages in enabling tunable and consistent electric pulses independent of user force (12) .",

Each row of electrodes with the same electrical polarity consists of nine microneedles each separated by 0.8-mm spacing within each row, and with rows separated by 0.9-mm spacing ( Fig. 1 D and E). This close spacing serves to enable the large electric field strength needed for electroporation using microsecond pulses. The piezoelectric pulse generator is connected to the MEA using wire for positive and negative terminals (Fig. 1F ).

This interpretation is supported by additional skin imaging after the application of the red viability stain (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). Increased loss of cell viability is seen with increasing voltage, and tissue heating at the sites of microneedle electrode placement increased as well, reaching peak values up to 50\u02daC (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). Microscopic examination of the skin surface showed discoloration at the sites of each microneedle electrode penetration that persisted for at least 2 d, consistent with the observation of extensive cell death at the higher voltages using millisecond pulses (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 ).

Electroporation with MEA using either microsecond pulses from the ePatch or using millisecond pulses from the conventional electroporator resulted in strong green fluorescence evident across the skin surface exposed to the MEA when viewed en face on the skin surface (Fig. 6A) , and throughout the viable epidermis, with little evidence of GFP expression in dermis or stratum corneum, when viewed as a frozen histological section (Fig. 6B) . These images show that the transfected cells were almost exclusively identified within the epidermal layer beneath the stratum corneum. In contrast, when electroporation was carried out using the clamp electrode, GFP fluorescence was less intense (consistent with the quantitative findings in Fig. 4) . Moreover, although the transfected cells were mostly in the epidermis, we can also see evidence of GFP transfection in the deep dermal layer, notably in the hair follicles (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ). These findings confirm IM vaccination produced humoral immune responses that were higher at the 100-\u03bcg dose than the 10-\u03bcg dose, as measured by antigen-specific IgG titers (P < 0.001) and virus neutralization assay (P < 0.001) (Fig. 7) . ID injection of 10 \u03bcg of DNA vaccine yielded results similar to IM vaccination at the same dose (P > 0.05). When ID vaccination was carried out with electroporation by ePatch, immune responses were significantly higher than for ID or IM vaccination without electroporation at the same DNA dose (P < 0.001). Moreover, ePatch vaccination with 10 \u03bcg of DNA was not significantly different from IM vaccination with 100 \u03bcg of DNA, and reached an endpoint titer at about 1:2,700 serum dilution (P > 0.5). In comparison, serum antibody responses induced by ID or IM injection of 10 \u03bcg of DNA reached an endpoint titer at about 1:300 serum dilution. These results indicate that the level of binding antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the ePatch group was almost 10-fold higher than the level in the ID or IM injection groups, with a 10-\u03bcg DNA dose.

            "text": "Enables DNA Vaccination. DNA vaccines have great promise as a low-cost, rapidly developed, and broadly applicable vaccination method well suited for pandemics like COVID-19, as well as routine use. DNA vaccines do not have the stability problems of mRNA vaccines requiring frozen storage and do not have the slow development and manufacturing timelines of many conventional vaccines. However, in order to make DNA vaccines effective in humans, methods to enhance their immune response are needed, like electroporation, as seen, for example, in the SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine developed by INOVIO Pharmaceuticals, which has achieved improved immune responses by using electroporation in phase 2/3 clinical trials (36) . However, electroporation in this and other DNA vaccination studies requires an expensive electroporation device with a complex design powered by batteries or an electrical outlet and uses large needle electrodes that penetrate skin or muscle, which, altogether, limits rapid and widespread access to the vaccine. The ePatch overcomes this significant barrier to practical application of DNA vaccination. The delivery system is very inexpensive, made of components that are already manufactured at scale, simple to operate by minimally trained health workers, powered without battery or electrical outlet, and minimally invasive. As proof of principle, this approach provided enhanced immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccination, demonstrating stronger humoral immune responses and viral neutralization compared to IM or ID vaccination without electroporation, and also exhibited good tolerability and no apparent safety concerns.",

The ePatch was designed to enable rapid and widespread access to DNA vaccination, which is critical to combat COVID-19 and other pandemics, as well as to facilitate vaccination in hard-to-reach populations. We achieved this low cost by using a piezoelectric pulse generator found in disposable household gas lighters that are currently mass-produced (in billions) for pennies each (37, 38) , and an MEA produced by lithographic etching technology and 3D printing in widespread use to make components for disposable consumer products that likewise cost just pennies each (39) . The resulting cost, expected to be <1 USD, is several orders of magnitude lower than currently available electroporators that usually cost thousands of US dollars. While the ePatch is inexpensive enough to be completely disposed of after a single use, the piezoelectric pulser can, alternatively, be reused (as done when used as a lighter), with the MEA replaced after each use, for safety.",

Targeting antigen to these epidermal cells has been shown to improve immune responses compared to IM injection (44, 45) . While electroporation of the dermis has less value, diffusion of antigens produced in epidermal cells into the upper dermis is beneficial, due to the presence of dermal dendritic cells and a rich vasculature that enables drainage to lymph nodes, which also increases immunogenicity (46) .",

Of particular concern is stimulation of motor nerves and muscle cells below the skin, which can cause violent twitching reported for skin electroporation in other contexts (47, 48) . Indeed, we saw this in our animal studies, where electroporation with the clamp electrode caused strong muscle contractions at the site of electroporation upon application of each pulse. The animals were anesthetized, which indicates a direct stimulation of action potentials in muscle cells and/or motor nerves. These contractions were not seen when electroporating with MEAs that localized the electric field superficially, far away from muscles.",

By using MEAs with 0.9-mm spacing, we were able to electroporate skin with microsecond pulses from the ePatch with 300-V output, and achieved electroporation using millisecond pulses of just 10 V to 30 V from a conventional electroporator. These voltages are much lower than the 50 V to 200 V usually used with conventional millisecond pulsers (47, 49) , which reduces device cost and complexity, and increases safety.

This bipolar oscillating pulse is a natural result of the compression and extension of piezoelectric crystals induced by a spring shock in the case containing the piezoelectric crystal. Compared to conventional monopolar pulses, multiple studies showed that bipolar oscillating microsecond pulses produce not only a dielectric breakdown of the cell membrane but also a sonicating motion in the cell membrane, inducing more effective cell poration (13, 53) .

In addition, immune responses were characterized only in terms of antigen-specific antibody titers and pseudovirus neutralization. A more detailed immunological characterization is needed, including live virus challenge studies to evaluate protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.

Electroporation is an effective way to increase DNA transfection and immune response, but currently requires bulky, costly and complex instrumentation, which limits access, especially in a pandemic. To address this problem, we developed a low-cost, portable, and rapidly deployable electroporation system powered by an ultra-low-cost piezoelectric household stove lighter element that emits bipolar oscillating electric pulses well suited for electroporation. This ePatch administers the pulses using an MEA that has dense electrode spacing to create high field strength from moderate-voltage pulses and has a short microneedle length to target the electric field to the epidermis.",

When used to administer a DNA vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the ePatch produced robust humoral immune responses and viral neutralization, demonstrating at least 10-fold dose sparing compared to ID or IM injection without electroporation. We conclude that microsecond, oscillating pulses from an ultra-low-cost piezoelectric power source and administered using a densely spaced MEA with submillimeter microneedle electrodes can be used for DNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other pathogens and can expedite development, reduce cost, and increase access to life-saving vaccines.",

Nonviable cells were identified in the mouse skin after insertion of MEA without electroporation (no pulse), suggesting that a small number of cells were damaged by microneedle electrode insertion alone. The red and green signals are colocalized in the insertion holes because nonviable cells are also permeable to the SYTOX Green. After 5 and 10 pulses, the red signal did not increase in the skin, while the green signal became more dispersed in the skin, suggesting transient cell permeability induced by the piezoelectric pulses with little effect on cell viability.",
