Following oral administration, molnupiravir is rapidly hydrolysed by esterases to NHC, which is phosphorylated by host kinases to active intracellular metabolite EIDD-1931-5'-triphosphate (EIDD-2061) [1] . AGILE, a UK platform for early-phase trials of novel COVID-19 therapies [2] , has evaluated molnupiravir within its AGILE Candidate-Specific Trial (CST)-2 seamless phase Ib/IIa protocol. We previously reported phase Ib evaluation of molnupiravir across three dosing arms (300, 600 and 800 mg twice daily), establishing that 800 mg twice daily for 5 days was suitable for progression to phase II [3] , which is currently recruiting.",

A strong correlation between saliva and plasma NHC concentrations implies (assuming a one compartment model) that salivary accumulation is dependent upon the plasma concentration. Mucosal permeability and protein binding are major factors in determining salivary drug accumulation, since only unbound drug is available for diffusion into saliva[9]. NHC exists predominantly in unbound form in plasma (unbound fraction \u22650.99) and in vitro studies demonstrated that molnupiravir and NHC are not substrates for major drug transporters (e.g. ABCB1; p-glycoprotein) [10, 11].However, NHC is a substrate for human nucleoside transporters in vitro (e.g. CNT1, ENT2)[12] which could modulate non-plasma concentrations of NHC in addition to other factors relating to the drug characteristics or surrounding milieu. Passage of drugs into non-plasma compartments can also be attributed to factors such as pH (e.g. mouth), inflammation (e.g. eye) and flow rate. For example, pharmacokinetics of drug in tears may be affected due to increased lacrimation or infection. Higher turnover or flow rate of saliva may also contribute to the lower concentrations observed. Additionally, the marked variability in nasal and tear NHC concentrations could be associated with the challenging collection procedures.There are a number of limitations. The small sample size, which is typical of early phase studies, only allowed for a descriptive interpretation of NHC pharmacokinetics and was underpowered for statistical comparisons between matrices. We utilised a truncated sampling schedule between 0-4 hours to limit infection risk, therefore NHC elimination over the 12hour dosing interval could not be fully assessed in non-plasma compartments. Missing samples led to exclusions from the analysis, particularly for evaluation of R NP:P , contributed to data variability and limited data interpretation. Finally, the active triphosphate metabolite, not quantified. Despite the limitations these data add to our understanding of NHC pharmacokinetics, principally at sites of COVID-19 infection.To our knowledge this is the first report describing penetration of NHC into nasal secretions and tears, and to a lesser extent into saliva. These data support the evaluation of molnupiravir as prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
