            "text": "Abstract Background The generic term \"exacerbation\" does not reflect the heterogeneity of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). We utilised a novel algorithmic strategy to profile exacerbation phenotypes based on underlying aetiologies. Methods Patients hospitalised for AECOPD (n=146) were investigated for aetiological contributors summarised in a mnemonic acronym ABCDEFGX (A: airway virus; B: bacterial; C: co-infection; D: depression/anxiety; E: eosinophils; F: failure (cardiac); G: general environment; X: unknown). Results from clinical investigations were combined to construct AECOPD phenotypes. Relationships to clinical outcomes were examined for both composite phenotypes and their specific aetiological components. Aetiologies identified at exacerbation were reassessed at outpatient follow-up. Results Hospitalised AECOPDs were remarkably diverse, with 26 distinct phenotypes identified. Multiple aetiologies were common (70%) and unidentifiable aetiology rare (4.1%). If viruses were detected (29.5%), patients had longer hospitalisation (7.7\u00b15.6 versus 6.0\u00b13.9 days, p=0.03) despite fewer \"frequent exacerbators\" (9.3% versus 37%, p=0.001) and lower mortality at 1 year ( p=0.03). If bacterial infection was found (40.4%), patients were commonly \"frequent exacerbators\" (44% versus 18.4%, p=0.001). Eosinophilic exacerbations (28%) were associated with lower pH (7.32\u00b10.06 versus 7.36\u00b10.09, p=0.04), higher venous carbon dioxide tension (P vCO 2 ) (53.7\u00b110.5 versus 48.8\u00b112.8, p=0.04), greater noninvasive ventilation (NIV) usage (34.1% versus 18.1%) but shorter hospitalisation (4 (3-5) versus 6 (4-9) days, p<0.001) and lower infection rates (41.4% versus 80.9%, p<0.0001). Cardiac dysfunction and severe anxiety/depression were common in both infective and non-infective exacerbations. Characteristics identified at exacerbation often persisted after recovery. Conclusions Hospitalised AECOPDs have numerous causes, often in combination, that converge in complex, multi-faceted phenotypes. Clinically important differences in outcomes suggest that a phenotyping strategy based on aetiologies can enhance AECOPD management.",

Study investigators administered the COPD Assessment Tool (CAT) [7] , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [8] and Medical Research Council Dyspnoea (MRCD) scale [9] . Results from nasopharyngeal virus PCR (146 out of 146), spontaneously expectorated sputum culture (136 out of 146), C-reactive protein (CRP) and fever (\u2a7e38\u00b0C) (both 146 out of 146) were used to identify aetiologies \"A\" (airway virus), \"B\" (bacteria) or \"C\" (co-infection) (figure 2). Inevitably, many AECOPDs have clinical features of infection without identification of a specific microorganism. We assigned putative \"B\" (bacterial) aetiology if fever or CRP \u2a7e20 mg\u00b7dL \u22121 [10] not specifically validated for AECOPD hospitalisations, we chose high threshold values for HADS previously shown to have 95% specificity for verified anxiety/depression in an inpatient population [11] .

            "text": "Our study has a number of limitations. Our sample size was not adequate to examine associations between clusters of aetiologies ( phenotypes) and pertinent outcomes. This will likely require very large-scale multicentre studies of exacerbation characteristics, which have been identified as a priority for future AECOPD research [29, 30] . The very low inpatient mortality (1 out of 146, 0.7%) may reflect exclusion of patients mechanically ventilated at the time of admission and the requirement for adequate cognition to complete questionnaires. We employed routine clinical investigations to define phenotypes, which limits the precision and reliability of diagnosing bacterial infection. However, this strategy was intentionally applicable to \"real-life\" practice. Virus and bacterial detection at AECOPD may potentially be \"false positives\" reflecting colonisation, and even virus PCR may give \"false negatives\" [11] . Pre-hospital antibiotic (45.2%) and/or oral corticosteroid (23.2%) use were common and may have influenced phenotypes. We phenotyped AECOPDs only once at hospital admission, but \"evolution\" of AECOPD phenotypes over the course of an exacerbation is an area for future study. Finally, other important AECOPD aetiologies may not have been captured in our methodology. While our strategy focussed on treatable aetiological components of the acute hospitalisation episode, phenotyping the chronic disease state (e.g. emphysema predominant) is also key to individualisation of care. Understanding relationships between the chronic disease phenotype and the acute exacerbation phenotype is an area for future research.",
