We aim to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on radiotherapy (RT) practice in a hub cancer center. Methods: Retrospective data collection of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection, identified by pathognomonic symptoms feedback at triage realized at the entrance to RT division. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of oncologic disease, COVID-19-related symptoms, and signed written informed consent. Results: Between 1 March and 30 June 2020, 1,006 patients accessed our RT division for RT simulation or treatment. Forty-four patients matched inclusion criteria (4.4% of all patients): 29 women and 15 men. Seventeen patients had metastatic disease. Twenty-one patients reported fever, 6 presented dyspnea, 4 complained of ageusia and anosmia, and 3 developed conjunctivitis. Thirty-six patients underwent nasal swab, with 7 positive results. From our cohort, 4 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed with computed tomography scan imaging: 3 were related to COVID-19 infection, while the fourth was evaluated as an RT adverse event. From the entire series, 4 patients died: 3 during hospitalization in intensive care unit of complications of COVID-19 and 1 of other causes neither COVID-19 nor cancer-related. Conclusions: Cancer hub allows for safe RT practice continuation while minimizing the spread of contagion in this frail patient population. A challenge for the future will be to understand pandemic consequences in cancer natural history and manage its clinical impact.",

Our data highlight how increasing safety measures are effective to identify patients at risk and to isolate them with a proper diagnostic pathway. In particular, all positive cases were identified during the first phase of pandemic, when PPE was scarcely available or contradictory (recommendations for use of masks) and contagion understanding was weak. With the implementation of checkpoints, sanitation devices, and population awareness campaigns, patients became adequately trained to recognize suspicious symptoms and communicate them to competent physicians. As a result, no COVID-19-positive patients have reached the division since June, allowing us to work safely and protect patients and staff.",

In order to protect oncologic patients, considering the effectiveness of our measures, it will be prudent follow these recommendations until the end of the pandemic. All the preventive measures adopted during the first wave of the pandemic were effective in containing the viral spread, laying the foundation for a more responsible approach in the subsequent phases of the outbreak. Recent studies highlighted how the pandemic emergency caused a shift from a patient-centered ethic to a public health-centered ethic in order to control the spread. [31] [32] [33] The pandemic promoted the establishment of novel guidelines for the management of oncologic patients. Remote consulting and tele-visits were implemented in order to lower patients' access to hospitals and for RT wards hypofractionated regimens were preferred. It is likely that some of these changes in clinical routine will be maintained at the end of the emergency, defining a novel patient-centered ethic. [31] [32] [33] A challenge for the future will be to understand the pandemic's consequences in cancer's natural history and to better manage its clinical effects.",
