Several tumour tracking techniques require the implantation of fiducial markers around the tumour, a procedure that involves unnecessary risks and costs. Markerless tumour tracking (MTT) negates the need for implanted markers, potentially enabling accurate and optimal radiotherapy in a non-invasive way. Methods and analysis We will perform a phase I interventional trial called MArkerless image Guidance using Intrafraction Kilovoltage x-ray imaging (MAGIK) to investigate the technical feasibility of the MTT technology developed at the University of Sydney (sponsor). 30 participants will undergo the current standard of care lung stereotactic ablative radiation therapy, with the exception that kilovoltage X-ray images will be acquired continuously during treatment delivery to enable MTT. If MTT indicates that the mean lung tumour position has shifted >3 mm, a warning message will be displayed to indicate the need for a treatment intervention. The radiation therapist will then pause the treatment, shift the treatment couch to account for the shift in tumour position and resume the treatment. Participants will be implanted with fiducial markers, which act as the ground truth for evaluating the accuracy of MTT. MTT is considered feasible if the tracking accuracy is <3 mm in each dimension for >80% of the treatment time.",

This may result in the increase in treatmentrelated toxicity due to the enlarged beams, and the risk of decreased local control when the tumour moves outside of the treated region. 11 Every 1 Gy increase in tumour dose results in a 4% improvement in survival, 12 and every 1 Gy decrease in mean lung dose results in a 2% reduction in pneumonitis. 13 A strategy to combat the problem of motion is to adapt to tumour motion in real-time during treatment 14 for example, using tumour tracking. Tumour tracking aims to monitor the tumour position during treatment. When paired with treatment adaptation approaches such as gating 15 and multileaf collimator (MLC) adaptation, 16 tumour tracking has the potential to improve dose coverage of the tumour and reduce dose to the healthy tissues as the radiation beam is always adapted to the moving tumour. 17 Consequently, treatment-related toxicity is potentially minimised, as without the need to encompass tumour motion, smaller and more precise radiation beams can be used (figure 1).",

MTT uses the kilovoltage (kV) x-ray imaging system, which is available on 90% of standard radiotherapy treatment systems. The feasibility of MTT has previously been validated retrospectively with both stage I and stage III patients with lung cancer. 25 26 The proposed MTT approach has previously been integrated into the existing lung SABR radiotherapy workflow. 23 As part of the standard SABR treatment planning routine a four-dimensional (4D) CT is acquired to define a snap-shot of the tumour motion range. MTT makes use of the 4D-CT to build a model of the patient anatomy. The anatomic model contains information of the positions and shape of the tumour, the diaphragm and the thoracic anatomy throughout the respiratory cycle. As shown in figure 2 , during treatment delivery, intrafraction kV X-ray images will be acquired from the on-board imager and streamed to a separate computer using a frame-grabber software. First, the anatomic model is used to segment Open access the tumour in the intrafraction kV X-ray images. Next, the three-dimensional tumour position is estimated from the two-dimensional segmented position using a statistical motion model. 26 This process is repeated for every new kV image at a frequency of seven frames per second. The tracked tumour position and its agreement with the planned tumour position is visualised for the operator throughout the treatment. When the tumour has shifted away from its planned position by more than 3 mm for a period of <10 seconds a warning signal will indicate the need to pause the treatment and apply a specified shift of the patient couch to account for the motion.",
