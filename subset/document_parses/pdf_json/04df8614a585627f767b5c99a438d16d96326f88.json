We hypothesized that the degree and severity of reactogenicity after the second injection reflects the magnitude of antibody production against the SARS CoV-2 virus spike protein (spike IgG). Blood samples were obtained from 67 healthy Japanese healthcare workers three weeks after the first injection and two weeks after the second injection of the BNT162b2 vaccine to measure spike IgG levels. Using questionnaires, we calculated an adverse event (AE) score (0-11) for each participant. The geometric mean of spike IgG titers increased from 1,047 antibody units (AU/mL) (95% CI: 855-1282 AU/mL) after the first injection to 17,378 AU/mL (14,622-20,663 AU/mL) after the second injection. The median AE score increased from 2 to 5. Spike IgG levels after the second injection were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with spike IgG after the first injection. AE scores after the second injection were not significantly associated with log-transformed spike IgG after the second injection, when adjusted for age, sex, and log-transformed spike IgG after the first injection. Although the sample size was relatively small, reactogenicity after the second injection may not accurately reflect antibody production.",

Although proposed causes may be related to racial differences and geographic differences of non COVID-19 corona virus exposure, we should consider a fixed dosing regimen as a potential cause of different prevalence of adverse reactions. Dose-dependent increases in adverse effects have been observed with mRNA vaccines 1-3 and the current recommended dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (30 \u00b5g), which was determined for western subjects, would result in a higher dose for people with smaller body mass, such as Japanese.",

Although there is no definite cut-off of value for spike IgG sufficient to prevent COVID-19 infection, the FDA authorized only the use of high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (spike IgG > 840 AU/mL), for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection, early in the course of the pandemic. 14 Prendecki et al. reported that one COVID-19 na\u00efve individual whose spike IgG titer was 61.8 AU/mL, developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection 5 weeks after the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. 15 The authors also stated that spike IgG titers < 250 AU/mL might not be sufficient for virus neutralization. The lowest IgG titers observed in this study exceeded the latter value by nearly 10-fold. Spike IgG levels after the second injection were higher in subjects < 50 years than in those \u2265 50 years. Previous studies did not show age-dependent efficacy of BNT162b2 for subsequent COVID-19 infection. 3, 6 Thus, these results raise concern regarding the recommended dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in younger Japanese people. The current infection situation in Japan makes dose response trials with BNT162b2 vaccine almost impossible. However, if the level of spike IgG three weeks after the first vaccination is > 1000 AU/mL, the second injection dose could be reduced in younger people, which would enhance the Japanese vaccination rate.",

The hospital chairman decided to administer the first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (30 \u00b5g per dose injected into the deltoid muscle) to hospital employees during the fourth week of March and the second dose during the third week of April (April 12 to April 16). Since we received the ethical approval for the study on April 12 the time available to acquire informed consent and to conduct the study was quite short, so we asked mainly healthcare workers in our hospital department to participate in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all 69 participants. Blood samples were obtained from participants before the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (median: 20 days [interquartile range (IQR): 20 to 21 days] after the first dose) and 2 weeks after the second dose (median: 13 days [IQR: 11 to 14 days] after the second dose). A SARS-CoV2 IgG assay was performed with chemiluminescent immunoanalysis of microparticles used for quantitative detection of IgG antibodies against the spike protein of the SARS CoV-2 virus (spike IgG) employing the Architect system (Abbott Diagnostics) with a cut-off <50 antibody units/mL (AU/mL) in both blood samples. To exclude the possibility of previous Covid-19 infection, we also measured IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of Covid-19",
