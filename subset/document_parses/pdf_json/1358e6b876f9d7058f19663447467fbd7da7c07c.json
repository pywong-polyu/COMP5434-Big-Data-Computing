Systematic reviews have also demonstrated that evolution of pharmacists' non-dispensing patient-facing and targeted clinical role beyond medicines supply have improved access to primary care services. Beneficial impact has been demonstrated on health system indicators and in patients with chronic diseases [7, 8] with small improvements in clinical outcomes, quality of life, and reduction of health service utilization, with medicines use education and counselling by pharmacists at different points of care [9] . Positive effects of integration of clinical pharmacists into primary care general practice clinics on primary outcomes related to medication use or clinical outcomes have also been reported in 19 of the 38 studies included in another review [10] . Meta-analyses of 17 studies with common endpoints such as blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin, cholesterol and/or Framingham risk score, favour pharmacist intervention, with significant improvements in clinical outcomes in intervention patients compared to control patients [10] . A small but prospective beforeafter intervention study (Pharmacists in Practice Study, that is, PIPS) in primary care clinics has also reported a significant decrease in medication related problems with significant positive impact on adherence to medications and patient satisfaction with pharmacists' consultation [11] . Thus, collaborative work as part of the health care team may, in all settings including primary care, improve overall patient care and health outcomes. A retrospective study evaluating clinical pharmacists' activity in general practice has also reported significant financial returns on investment with efficient delivery of clinical interventions in high volume [12] . Extrapolating this to countries where patients pay for health care, development of clinical pharmacy services in primary care may decrease cost to the patient and improve access to good pharmaceutical care across sectors, medication adherence and patient outcomes.",

However, these are virtually non-existent in primary care. In 2011, Shah [24] developed in Western India, a practice in community with a registered medical practitioner, with the aim of improving access to clinical pharmacy services. Lack of willingness of doctors and management in hospitals and community pharmacies towards development of consultation areas and clinical pharmacist-led medicines optimisation clinics (MOCs) led to pioneering an independent model of community practise with direct access and referral-based services, incorporating essential, advanced and enhanced services, and a remote clinic [24] . Establishing supplementary and independent prescriber status or widespread patientfocussed clinical pharmacy services necessary to deliver health agendas in India are long-term aspirations. However, implementation of a blend of in-community, hospital and virtual clinics, in-patient and healthcare interface services with application of artificial intelligence and digitalisation could enhance patient care.",

This is due to lack of patient and practice focus at the undergraduate BPharm degree and diploma in pharmacy. Clinical pharmacy/pharmacy practice was first introduced in academia in India as a master's degree in 1996 [25] followed by the PharmD in 2008 [26] . The lag in Pharmacy Practice Regulations (PPR) that followed only in 2015 [27] led to challenges. Thus, it is essential to outline here this timeline (Table 1) .",

But, the lag in introduction of practice regulations [27, 31] and void in planning and early on inclusive organisational structure at the PCI ( Fig. 1) for clinical pharmacy practice and professionals had led to open-ended roles, responsibilities and PharmD graduates' led community-based pharma clinics. This led the PCI in its 2015 clarification [31] to not permit pharma clinics to 'diagnose disease and prescribe medicines' , a likely result of unanticipated practice challenges with the PharmD graduates' title of 'Dr' causing a dilemma. But, a lack of direct patient care opportunities for a significant number of the 8,000 + PharmD graduates annually led to protests and inclusion of \"PCI's\" PharmD clinical pharmacists in the 2019 amendment [28] to PPR 2015 to optimise therapy but 'only hospital-centric and only in association with physicians or other health professionals, recognising only PharmD graduates as clinical pharmacists and belatedly, for the first time, in 2021 [29] , outlining roles and responsibilities in hospitals (as appropriate)' .",

Time cannot be more apt to work with the MoH&FW, towards these reforms with development of national and local clinical guidelines under the purview of a proposed 'National Clinical Evidence-Based Review committee'. With select representation of clinical experts and nominated members of the Indian Medical Association, National Medical Council, Indian Pharmaceutical Association, Pharmacy Council of India and Indian Nursing Council, open consultation with councils, practitioners across states, and central and state governments will lead to national guidelines for management of different disorders/diseases, followed on by appropriate implementation and may lead to local guidelines based on health scenarios. These guidelines may be accessible through Specialist National Organisation portals or websites, or National Programmes/WHO/relevant others. This amalgamated with development of clinical pharmacy services and medicines optimisation clinics across sectors and at health interfaces may present adequate avenues in the social movement of the WHO patient safety challenge towards safer and better health outcomes. With a target to reduce harm with medicines by 50% by 2022 [1] and the inherent challenges of the pandemic, it is never too late for clinical pharmacists to join the existing movement. But, as suggested by Giberson and co-workers [4] , an opportunity exists for health leadership and policy makers to support and implement additional, existing and evidence-based models of costeffective pharmacist-delivered patient care.",
