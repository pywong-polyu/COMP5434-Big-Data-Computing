            "text": "During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries introduced aggressive physical distancing strategies, such as closing schools and businesses, cancelling sporting events and asking people to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility, as a way to slow the spread of the outbreak. 1 Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that social isolation induces widespread brain changes 2 and is associated with several psychiatric symptoms and disorders. 3 Studies in rodent and macaque showed that isolation promotes neurophysiological effects comparable to those seen in human mood disorders, such as increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, associated with negative affective changes (anhedonia, anxiety, guilt, fear, aggression). [4] [5] [6] Findings in human populations during prolonged periods of isolation, as observed in polar expeditions or solitary confinement in prisons, show that living in these conditions has an associated psychological toll, such as disturbed sleep, impaired cognitive ability and negative affect. 7, 8 Past and present comparisons Experience from recent epidemics (2002) (2003) (2004) severe acute respiratory syndrome and 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks) shows that imposed distancing measures were accompanied by increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. [9] [10] [11] [12] As for the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers expect the impact on mental health to be wide-ranging, substantial and possibly long-lasting. 13 Shi et al, 14 in a Chinese population-based study, described a high prevalence of mental health symptoms, with rates of 27.9% for depression, 31.6% for anxiety and 29.2% for insomnia. In another study, conducted in China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wang et al 15 reported that female gender, being a student and specific physical symptoms (e.g. myalgia, dizziness, coryza) were associated with a greater psychological effect of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression. Specific up-to-date and accurate health information and certain precautionary measures were associated with a lower psychological effect of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression. 15 The present study was conducted during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. Pre-pandemic studies show that in the Portuguese population there is an estimated prevalence of 9.32% for depression, 6.06% for anxiety disorders 16 and 27.7% for insomnia symptoms; 17 however, it is still unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health status of the Portuguese population immediately following the lockdown in the first wave.",

Additionally, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as insomnia, were assessed, using three gold-standard self-reported questionnaires. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a 21-item questionnaire designed to evaluate the intensity of depressive symptoms in the past week, using a four-point Likert scale. 18 The total score ranges from 0 to 63, with the highest scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), a 21-item questionnaire with the aim of evaluating the intensity of anxiety symptoms in the past week, using a fourpoint Likert scale. 19 The total score ranges from 0 to 63, with the highest scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms. Insomnia was assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a seven-item self-reported questionnaire developed to measure the nature, severity and impact of insomnia in the past 2 weeks, using a five-point Likert scale. 20 The total scores of these assessment tools are interpreted as follows, based on the established literature: BDI, normal (0-9), mild (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , moderate (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) and severe (30-63) depression; BAI, normal (0-7), mild (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) , moderate (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) and severe anxiety; and ISI, normal (0-7), subthreshold (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , moderate (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) and severe (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) insomnia.

This difference might be secondary to the use of different rating scales or the different time frames used (the first month of the state of emergency versus a 3-day period a week after the state of emergency started). Nonetheless, both studies report higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms when compared with the pre-pandemic Portuguese population samples. Although causality could not be established, the higher severity of symptoms was potentially secondary to psychological effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that these results may indicate a transitory increase in depressive, anxious and insomnia symptoms, which will not necessarily progress to the development of a disorder. According to a longitudinal study by Fancourt et al, 25 conducted during the first lockdown in England, people started to recover as time went by, presenting with lower levels of symptoms, suggestive of an adaptive process to their circumstances.",

Every additional 10 years of age resulted in an average decrease of 0.697 points in the BDI score. The student category remained statistically significant for depressive symptoms, even after adjusting for confounding factors such as age in the multivariate regression model. This highlights that being a student on its own is a significant risk factor for depressive symptoms during the isolation period. These findings may be explained by the fact that young people tend to receive information from anxiety-provoking social media, allied to the fact that, in Portugal, universities interrupted classroom teaching before most other activities halted, with many students likely having to return to their parents' homes, and as a consequence, losing some level of independence and preventing them from the usual social interaction with peers. Curiously, this intriguing association between student status and depressive symptoms had already been reported in China by Wang et al, 15 reflecting probable commonalities in the way isolation is experienced in different cultures. Absence of short-/medium-term goalsan issue that students share with the unemployed, who also present higher depression scoresmight also be contributing to this issue.",

However, the methods used allowed for a quick questionnaire implementation and simple enrolment of participants. Third, the BDI and BAI scales are known to overestimate the levels of symptoms, 38, 39 which may influence the depressive and anxiety results. Nevertheless, we considered using these scales as they were both validated for the Portuguese population, 21, 22 and are still a mainstay in the rapid screening and assessment of mental health. 40 On the other hand, we believe this study has some strengths by using a questionnaire that is not only broad in the mental health dimensions evaluated (depression, anxiety and insomnia), but also provides adequate coverage of the most likely predictors of such dimensions.",
