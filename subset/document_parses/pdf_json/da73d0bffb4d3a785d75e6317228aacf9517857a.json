The production supply chains have been massively disturbed. It is estimated that a significant number of Fortune 1000 firms have been severely affected by the pandemic. Manufacturing companies operating in and through India are also affected by Covid-19. However, Covid-19 also offers an opportunity to revisit the competitiveness of Indian manufacturing. Traditionally, India's manufacturing growth has been based mostly on its domestic market. The disruptions due to Covid-19 are likely to offer new models of working and at the same time, opportunities to build capabilities and explore new international markets. The paper gives a perspective on Indian manufacturing involving various stakeholders such as industry associations, professional bodies, academic institutes, and industry to tackle the issue of enhancing manufacturing competitiveness. In a post-Covid-19, India will have to decide a mix of conventional manufacturing facilities, the automated special purpose, and industry 4.0. One perspective is to have an increased level of automation and implementation of Industry 4.0, with localized skills and global aspirations and another view is to have traditional manufacturing facilities that can ramp up its capabilities to satisfy increased demand of products. This paper presents a conceptual framework to assess Indian manufacturing.",

Manufacturing creates and sells goods to other sectors (Pharma, agriculture machinery, capital goods, etc.) and in turn, buys materials and services from them (Deshmukh 2016 ). (b) Steel, automotive sector, light engineering, pharmaceuticals, food processing, electronics, machine tools, textiles, etc., are the major manufacturing sectors where India has developed considerable competence (Deshmukh 2016) . Manufacturing triggers demand everything from raw materials to intermediate components/ products. (c) The manufacturing sector has the potential to offer employment opportunities directly or indirectly. This is especially important given the severe reduction in employment all over the globe due to Covid-19. In view of WHO (2020) guidelines for the necessity of the medical equipment, India is poised for a big market for the manufacturing of medical items. (d) Manufacturing has a synergistic and cascading effect on many other sectors such as agriculture. Through more intensive efforts on agro-based Industries, given the rural population and reliance on agri-sector, the manu-facturing sector is going to play a significant role in the post-Covid-19 scenario. (e) Retail services are mostly the act of using manufactured goods. India is ranked No. 2 in Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) in 2019 and the retail industry contributes to about 10% of the GDP (Invest India Statistics 2020). (f) The entrepreneurial and enterprising mindset has stimulated the rise of low-cost manufacturing clusters in India (for example-Manufacturing cluster in Ludhiana (in Punjab), Pune-Nasik (in Maharashtra), Coimbatore (in Tamilnadu) . These clusters have contributed significantly. The growth effects of such industrial clusters and its implications for India are highlighted in (Narayana 2014). Such clusters have also helped to reduce regional disparities. (g) Manufacturing's role in terms of employment creation is crucial. Given the strategic importance of the manufacturing sector in India, it must adjust to the challenges posed by Most of the economies that enhanced competitiveness leveraged manufacturing effectively and countries in East Asia provide excellent examples of this (Singh et al. 2007) . In one of the early studies, Dangayach and Deshmukh (2003) elaborated on the strategic role of manufacturing in the Indian context. Momaya and Anuprita (2006) have assessed the competitiveness of Indian Auto manufacturers. Bhawsar and Chattopadhyay (2015) have given a synoptic view of various connotations attached to competitiveness and reviewed the relevant literature on competitiveness.",

There will be a gradual opening of facilities and industry. People with limited economic resources and with months of lockdown would see a reduction in demand for products and services. Many employees are likely to become jobless, and effectively demand will become much less. (b) Supply line would also be disrupted with the non-availability of labor, and it will take time to resume and become fully operational. Many items would lose their shelf life and will have to be returned to the company. The reverse supply chain will have to work faster and be effective. (c) The manufacturing organizations need to reorganize their supply chains, reorganize their workforce, and even suppliers. It may be equivalent to developing a new supply chain. (d) China may face minimum disruption at the supplier level, but global demand for \"Made-in-China\" items may temporarily shrink. (e) This is an opportunity for Indian manufacturing to take proactive steps and push their products into the global market. Initially, these may be medical items (like ventilators/respirators) Later, the competence and goodwill gained may be utilized to produce other items as well. The disruptions due to Covid-19 are likely to offer new markets. It has triggered the demand for a variety of products. For example, Ventilators, respirators, PPE, Medicines, and associated items as required for the medical sector, items from the pharmaceutical side, etc. It is to be noted that healthcare systems are going to be the major driver for Indian Manufacturing (f) It is evident that the disruptions caused due by Covid-19 also calls for a relook the way the Indian manufacturing sector has set its priorities and the way we measure performance. Covid-19 also offers an opportunity to revisit the competitiveness of Indian MSME's, and consequently, we need to rethink for our manufacturing policy. Traditionally, India's manufacturing growth has been based mainly on its domestic market with its limitations and potential. However, during the last decade, the industry became too dependent on Chinese products. China has emerged as one of the largest raw material and component suppliers.",

Improvement in quality is manifest in many of the initiatives such as the adoption of ISO9000/14000, 5-S, Lean manufacturing practices, TPM (Total Productive Management) practices, etc. The number of Deming prize winners' companies (32 out of 72 companies outside Japan are Indian companies winning this prestigious prize since the year 2000!) is an indicator of this. The use of appropriate technology in the manufacturing process has made the process competitive. Innovation and competition make it inevitable for the manufacturing sector (especially, MSMEs) to equip with new technology and modernization. It is expected that Covid-19 will accelerate this process. The major challenge is to continuously provide innovative and customized products using the best available process technologies (Singh et al. 2007 ). According to Ajitabh and Momaya (2004) in such a kind of environment, a firm's competitiveness will depend on its ability to provide goods and services more efficiently than others involved in the marketplace. It is also to be noted that the practice, research, and literature on competitiveness are still in the infantile stage, and have enormous scope for improvements, especially in the Indian context (Momaya 2019) .",

PEST analysis is used as a strategic tool to understand the environment, possible growths, political stability of the state, business position, prospects, environmental opportunities and threats, etc. According to Ward and Rivani (2005) PEST analysis assumes that specific external and indirect circumstances that characterize the business environment can influence the organizational capacity to produce value. PEST analysis provides a \"satellite view\" to assess the external environment (Ward and Rivani 2005) . It is particularly relevant for the manufacturing sector post-Covid scenario. It is envisaged that this analysis will also help identify the proper focus.",

Table 1 gives the drivers for global manufacturing competitiveness as reported by Deloitte (2016) . As organizations internationalize and expand their global manufacturing footprint, they must consider the multiple factors that underpin the competitiveness of a country. To understand and explain the dynamics of a country's overall manufacturing competitiveness, they must be examined as two major, inextricably linked forces-market and government.

(vii) Covid-19 has forced us to relook at the Government, corporate, and society. Corporate social responsibility represents a form of corporate self-regulation that integrates into the existing business model. In the manufacturing environment, corporates social responsibility mostly involves areas such as environmental and labor regulations. With Industry 4.0, robotics and industrial automation will heavily influence job opportunities; In India, we must look at low cost and people-oriented automation, which will drive the corporates to perform their socially responsible role.

However, more empirical and longitudinal studies are needed to assess how these dimensions have translated in achieving manufacturing competitiveness if any. (e) Industry 4.0 may provide a good template for taking a proactive role in manufacturing. There will be a healthy mix of cyber and physical systems. Health-care solutions, for example, drone-based systems for drug administration may require innovative inputs from augmented/virtual reality. It will be worthwhile to examine the mix of such cyber and physical systems leading to enhanced business performance. (f) It is vital to establish some causality due to some factors responsible for competitiveness. These factors may depend on the type of product and may be subject to government interventions. These interventions will be guided by societal expectations and available resources, especially post-Covid-19. (g) As a Post Covid-19 relief package for assistance, the Ministry of Micro and Small Enterprises (Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise 2020) has announced the Lean Manufacturing Competitiveness Scheme (LMCS). Under this scheme, the MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) will be assisted in reducing their manufacturing costs, through proper people management, better space utilization, improved process flows, reduced lead time, etc. LMCS is expected to improve quality of products with lowers costs, which are essential for competing in national and international markets. The larger enterprises in India have been adopting LMCS to remain competitive, but MSMEs have generally stayed away from such programmes. LMCS has been approved as a pilot project in 100 Mini Clusters for implementation. The objective is to enhance the manufacturing competitiveness of the MSME Sector. It will be interesting to do an impact study of such packages. (h) Covid-19 has underlined the failure of huge supply chains. It has also emphasized the need for localized solutions keeping in view a huge domestic market. It will be interesting to study how higher self-reliance can be achieved for sustainable manufacturing. Various connotations related to self-reliance need to be examined. Currently, self-reliance is taken in a myopic sense and may appear to be contrary to the notion of globalization. Covid-19 has offered an opportunity to relook at these notions. The complex interplay of selfreliance with globalization needs to be explored. Such exploration may motivate interdisciplinary studies. (i) Competition Commission of India (CCI) has allowed the companies to make agreements with each other to collectively work in increasing efficiency of production, supply, distribution, storage, acquisition, etc. This will enable companies to go for collaborations. CCI approval will also help Indian organizations to cope with significant changes in supply and demand patterns arising out of the extraordinary situation caused by Covid-19. Though there is no empirical evidence to suggest that collaborations improve competitiveness, it is expected that collaboration will act as a strong enabler for sharing know-how and good practices. More empirical, product-specific studies are needed. (j) We visualize that there will be a variety of options coming up for Indian companies.",

There will be multiple partnerships that can be with different business models depending on the expectations of the prospective partners (both from India and abroad).

It will be interesting to define and examine the role and working conditions of workers in the manufacturing sector. There is a challenge to leverage the huge labor force and leverage opportunities for automation coming via Industry 4.0. Haldar et al. (Haldar et al. 2016 ) have examined the potential for export competitiveness in select cases. Learning from such studies needs to be mapped into Industry 4.0 vis-\u00e0-vis the role of labor productivity, flexibility, and its impact on competitiveness. (l) To understand, second-order and third-order effects and effects due to delay, system dynamic based framework will provide an opportunity to visualize various policy scenarios and their policy implications which will guide investment in thrust areas of manufacturing. For example, it may be worth developing various scenarios and asking various \"What if \"questions: What will be the impact of delay of raw material supplies on the production of ventilators? What will be the effect of incentives on this sector? What will happen if the mix of labor and automation is changed?",
