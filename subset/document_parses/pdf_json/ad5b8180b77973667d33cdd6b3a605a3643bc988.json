The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in receptor recognition, virus-cell membrane fusion and virus entry. Our previous studies have reported that 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified chicken ovalbumin (HP-OVA) serves as a viral entry inhibitor to prevent several kinds of virus infection. Here, our results reveal that HP-OVA can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner without obvious cytopathic effects. Further analysis suggests that HP-OVA can bind to both the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and disrupt the S protein-ACE2 interaction, thereby exhibiting inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our findings suggest that HP-OVA can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of deadly COVID-19.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has characterized the epidemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" (Song and Karako, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , which has aroused widespread concern in the world and has brought significant threats to international health and social stability, thus calling for the development of highly effective therapeutics and prophylactics (Kampf et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus and belongs to the \u03b2-coronavirus genus, which shares high genetic sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and bat SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) (Tian et al., 2020) . Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has lower pathogenicity and higher transmissibility than SARS-CoV, which may explain the severity of the epidemic (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Peiris et al., 2004; Li et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Similar to other two coronavirus strains, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is the first step of crossspecies transmission. SARS-CoV-2 contains four important structural proteins: the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S, E, and M proteins promote virus assembly and entry into host cells, and the N protein is needed for RNA synthesis (Li, 2016; Schoeman and Fielding, 2019; Ortiz-Prado et al., 2020) . The S protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 cells is composed of a receptor-binding unit S1 and a membrane-fusion unit S2 (Rota et al., 2003; Walls et al., 2020) . First, S1 can bind to the cellular surface receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) to initiate infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Second, S2 helps viral genomes enter host cells by fusing the host cell and viral membranes. The interactions between the S protein and the ACE2 receptor play an important role in viral entry into host cells (Wu et al., 2012; Huo et al., 2020a; Tai et al., 2020) . Therefore, it might be a potential approach to screen special antibodies or small-molecule inhibitors for blocking the RBD and ACE2 interaction and preventing virus infection (Chu et al., 2008; Du et al., 2009; Huo et al., 2020b) .",

The fusion inhibitors EK1C4 , IPB02 (Zhu et al., 2020) and nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) (Musarrat et al., 2020) potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S proteinmediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry can be blocked by the protease inhibitor camostat mesylate and the cathepsin L inhibitor E-64d (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Apilimod, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve), can significantly reduce the entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirus into 293/hACE2 cells via early endosomes in a dosedependent manner (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2020) . Several SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies such as CR3022, m396 and S309 have been further demonstrated to interact with SARS-CoV-2 S protein. However, only S309, rather than CR3022 and m396, showed potent crossneutralizing activity on SARS-CoV-2, indicating that subtle difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV may limit the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 (Hussain et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020) . Until now, there are still some disadvantages to these antiviral agents. They generally produce toxic responses, have a short half-life and cause acute side effects. Therefore, these weaknesses might affect their clinical use, and there is an urgent need to find new and effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Furthermore, one kind of anhydride-modified bovine protein, \u03b2-lactoglobulin (\u03b2-LG), was clinically applied to treat HPV infection (Hua et al., 2019) . Therefore, we decided to investigate whether anhydride-modified proteins could be utilized as anti-SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. In particular, 3hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified OVA is convenient for anhydride modification, which is isolated from chicken eggs and less expensive than rabbit serum albumin (RSA), which is purified from animal sera. Luckily, due to the broad-spectrum antiviral effect of anhydride-modified proteins, we screened the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of different anhydride-modified proteins and found a potential candidate, HP-OVA, which is highly effective in inhibiting infection by blocking the RBD and ACE2 interaction. In this study, we verify the entry-inhibitory activity of HP-OVA against SARS-CoV-2, and the results suggested that HP-OVA could be developed as a novel viral entry inhibitor used to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Based on those researches, we try to investigate the antiviral effect of HP-OVA against infection by SARS-CoV-2. At present, pseudovirus (PsV) has become an ideal tool to analyze cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 without safety concerns and possess the morphological characteristics of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2, with the S protein on the envelope membrane. As demonstrated in previous studies (Yin et al., 2018) , the pseudotyped system of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a classic model that mimics the process of viral entry and studies the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and host cells. Here, we first utilized SARS-CoV-2 PsV to perform a series of transduction assays. Results showed that HP-OVA exhibited potent inhibitory activity against the entry of SARS-CoV-2 S PsV to the 293T/ ACE2 cells (293T cells stably expressing hACE2) in a dosedependent manner, with an IC 50 of 0.70 \u00b1 0.49 \u03bcM ( Figure 1A) . Notably, the inhibitory activities on Vero E6 cells were consistent with those on ACE2/293T cells, with an IC 50 of 1.21 \u00b1 0.15 \u03bcM, while unmodified OVA had no antiviral activity ( Figure 1B) . To investigate whether HP-OVA has the same effect on SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and also employs ACE2 for cell entry, we conducted a pilot experimental test in vitro on the anti-SARS-CoV PsV activity using both 293T/ACE2 cells and Vero E6 cells. We found that HP-OVA potently inhibited SARS-CoV infection, with an IC 50 of approximately 0.85 \u00b1 0.26 \u03bcM and 0.49 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcM, respectively ( Figures 1C,D) .",

Our preliminary work have revealed that HP-OVA is highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion and SARS-CoV-2 S PsV infection, suggesting that HP-OVA might be a viral entry inhibitor by interacting with either the S protein of coronaviruses or ACE2 receptor on the target cellular surface. To investigate this hypothesis, SARS-CoV-2 S ( Figure 3A ) or ACE2 ( Figure 3B ) was transiently overexpressed in HEK-293T cells, and flow cytometry was used to analyze the binding activity. As shown in Figures   3C -F, HP-OVA notably bound to HEK-293T cells overexpressing both S and ACE2 proteins in a dose-dependent manner, while unmodified OVA showed no corresponding effect. To further confirm the specific targets, the binding of HP-OVA to S or ACE2 molecules was subsequently determined by ELISA. The results also showed that HP-OVA could bind to both the S (RBD) protein ( Figure 4B ) and ACE2 protein ( Figure 4C ) in a dose-dependent manner. We further determined the binding of HP-OVA to the spike S2 protein of SARS-CoV-2 by ELISA. As shown in Figure 4B , HP-OVA could also bind to S2 protein, while the binding ability to S2 proteins is weaker than RBD protein. In addition, we found that HP-OVA could not bind to an irrelevant coating protein antigen control BSA, indicating to the specific binding to both S and ACE2 proteins ( Figure 4B) . These results indicated that HP-OVA inhibits SARS-CoV-2-mediated viral entry at the cell surface attachment step by directly interacting with S protein and ACE2 receptor.",

            "text": "Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 603830 8 DISCUSSION Currently, the rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in an urgent requirement for effective therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. Initially, without licensed vaccines or approved antiviral drugs, COVID-19 treatment was mainly based on the experience of clinicians. Nonspecific antiviral drugs, including IFN-\u03b1 (recombinant human IFN-\u03b11b, IFN-\u03b12a), lopinavir/ ritonavir (Aluvia, HIV protease inhibitors), chloroquine phosphate, favipiravir and ribavirin, have been clinically used as antiviral therapies according to the National Health Commission (NHC) of the People's Republic of China Lu, 2020) . To date, many potential drugs have been expected to have therapeutic potential, including inhibition of TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020) (i.e., camostat mesylate, nafamostat, loprazolam, and rubitecan) and antiviral drugs inhibiting viral RdRp (i.e., remdesivir, and favipiravir) (Elfiky, 2020; Lung et al., 2020) and 3CLpro (i.e., poziotinib, fostamatinib, ziprasidone, and telcagepant) (Jo et al., 2020; Ul Qamar et al., 2020) as well as virus/host cell membrane fusion (i.e., EK1C4, nelfinavir mesylate, and IBP02) (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . However, the efficacies in vivo still require further confirmation, and their potential use for the treatment of infection by other coronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear. Therefore, drug development for treating COVID-19 is timely and important due to its rapid expansion. Viral entry inhibitors have proven effectiveness and safety for the treatment of viral infections, and targeting viral entry may have a greater potential in the development of pan-CoV inhibitors for future coronavirus outbreaks (Chu et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017; Pu et al., 2019) . Combined with our previous studies, we focused on HP-OVA because chicken OVA is the main protein in egg white, making up 60-65% of the total protein. Second, HP-OVA is convenient to synthesize by anhydride modification with OVA, which is isolated from chicken eggs and less expensive than RSA, which is purified from animal sera. Third, HP-OVA exerts a broad-spectrum effect on a series of HIV strains by blocking HIV entry. Our research demonstrated that HP-OVA could inhibit Vero E6 cell infection with live SARS-CoV-2, with an IC 50 value of 4.78 \u03bcM and an IC 90 value of 12.23 \u03bcM. Furthermore, HP-OVA obviously inhibited pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry into two different target cells, with an IC 50 value of 0.70 and 1.21 \u03bcM, respectively. Notably, HP-OVA also showed inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV infection of 293T/ACE2 and Vero E6 cells, with an IC 50 value of 0.85 and 0.49 \u03bcM, respectively. Furthermore, our results showed that HP-OVA displayed low cytotoxicity on all tested cell lines, with CC 50 values ranging from 113.50 to 182.50 \u03bcM. The CC 50 values of HP-OVA were more than 100 times higher than its IC 50 for inhibiting authentic SARS-CoV-2 PsV infection and its SI values ranged from 150.83 to 260.29, indicating that HP-OVA might be safe as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidate for use in patients. Therefore, this study suggests that HP-OVA has broad-spectrum antiviral activity by inhibiting viral entry, and it can be used for the treatment and prevention of infection by not only SARS-CoV-2 but also other human coronaviruses (HCoVs).",

However, several studies have reported that mucosal immunization by topical administration with soluble proteins, including OVA, without any adjuvants, are usually unable to induce strong local immune responses (Staats et al., 1994; Walker, 1994; Di Tommaso et al., 1996) . Our previous studies have also certified that HP-OVA has no harmful or deleterious impact on the function of immune cells (Li et al., 2010a) . Actually, anhydride-modified proteins, such as anhydride-modified bovine \u03b2-lactoglobulin, have been studied and utilized as microbicides against HIV and HPV in clinics for years, and their effectiveness and safety as drugs have been verified (Neurath et al., 1996; Guo et al., 2016; Hua et al., 2019) .",

To date, various species have been used as animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including hACE2 transgenic mice, African green monkey, Baboon, Cynomolgus macaque, and Ferret and Syrian hamster. However, there is currently no single, simple and optimal animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Khoury et al., 2020; Mu\u00f1oz-Fontela et al., 2020) . In additional, there are several significant differences between the pathogenesis and kinetic of human infection and animal models. Furthermore, it is also not clear which is the best outcome metric to study-for example, should an intervention aim to reduce the viral titer, pathology or lethality? The most suitable animal model and outcome measure for a particular application depends on the therapeutic intention, as well as the cost, timing and availability. Taken all consideration, we have not verified the antiviral effectiveness of HP-OVA against SARS-CoV-2 infection on animal models. The next stage of assessing HP-OVA's efficacy will be typically involved animal testing, which is extremely important and will strengthen our findings.",

Strategies capable of disrupting the S protein interaction with ACE2 could be of significant therapeutic value and could contribute to/favor the resolution of the pandemic that is developing worldwide because the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 is 10 to20-fold higher than that of the S protein of SARS-CoV, which may contribute to the higher contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV (Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020) . Our preliminary results indicated that HP-OVA could bind to both ACE2 and the S protein (RBD domain) directly. In addition, HP-OVA interferes to the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, leading to the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. The unmodified OVA protein can not interfere to the binding of S protein and ACE2 receptor. Our previously study reported that the binding ability of HP-OVA is closely correlated with the number of the positively charged side chains of lysine and arginine residues were converted to negatively charged side chains after modification by HP (Li et al., 2010a) . Thus, the positively charged side chains of HP-OVA might account for the antiviral activity of HP-OVA since unmodified OVA did not showed either an affinity of binding to ACE2 or S protein (RBD domain), as well as the inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Our previous studies have certified that anhydride-modified proteins could inhibit several kinds of viruses, including HIV, HPV, RSV and MERS-CoV. It is worth mentioning that the specific antiviral inhibitors are only effective against SARS-CoV-2, whereas the non-specific antiviral agents may also be effective against other pathogens, such as SRAS or other coronavirus.

Another problem for development of chemically modified OVA as pan-CoV inhibitor-based therapeutic and prophylactic for the treatment and prevention of the current COVID-19 pandemic is the potential risk of causing side effects in people who are allergy to egg protein (Honma et al., 1996) . Fortunately, egg allergy occurs seldom in adults, but mostly in young children (less than five years old) (Mine and Yang, 2008) . Therefore, we expect that there will be only very few adults with egg allergy, and those people should be excluded from the clinical trials of HP-OVAbased microbicide.",
