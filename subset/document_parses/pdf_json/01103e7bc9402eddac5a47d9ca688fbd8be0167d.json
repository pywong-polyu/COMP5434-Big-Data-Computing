Understanding their concerns and informational needs, as well as those of other essential workers, is important for building an effective communication strategy for the whole population. This study presents the results of a survey of 1,591 hesitant U.S. essential workers, conducted in December 2020, when they were the only group eligible for the vaccine, aiming to describe their concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and related policies. Results show that freedom of choice, concerns about equal access to the vaccine and being able to live a life with no restrictions once vaccinated, were important issues since the early days of the distribution campaign. Vaccine communication campaigns and distribution policies should address both population's non-medical and medical concerns with the same relevance.",

Polls' respondents frequently report they trust their doctor and healthcare professionals to share information regarding vaccines safety. Although healthcare workers had access to the vaccine as early as December 2020, recent polls have reported that approximately 18% of them are still skeptical about getting vaccinated. iii It is important to understand the reasons for their skepticism, because these professionals play a key role as communicators to their patients, family and community members. Understanding what type of additional information might reduce their skepticism is important for building an effective communication strategy for the whole population. We surveyed essential workers in the USA in December 2020, 68% of which were working in the healthcare setting, nursing home and public health, and asked them what would be important for them to know to make them more likely to take the COVID-19 vaccine. We believe that, even if demand and supplies have change over the past six months, these data are very informative to the current discourse on vaccine acceptance because people are more likely to remember and believe the first message received, iv therefore what they believed in December 2020 may still be influencing their own and community members' actions today. Our survey asked the essential workers if they needed more information about the safety of the vaccine but also if they had concerns that might have originated from exposure to misinformation, such as the 5G origin of the disease or that you can get COVID-19 from the vaccine. We also asked what they thought about the severity of the pandemic, perceived risks and benefits of the vaccine and opinions about freedom of speech and freedom of health choices in the context of COVID-19 vaccination policies. Finally, we investigated their main sources of information to understand to what extent exposure to social media was influencing their opinions and needs for additional information.",

Table 2 displays the differences in informational needs and related concerns about vaccine safety, effectiveness and policies by socio-demographic characteristics and use of social media. Concerns about potential injuries caused by the vaccine and equal access to the vaccine differed by gender (Chi, respectively) . Opinions about freedom of choice and freedom of speech--expressed as the need to know that those with concerns about the vaccine would be able to express themselves--differed by level of education (Chi, p-value= 0.03 and Chi, p-value=0.004, respectively). The need for additional information was associated with vaccine acceptance (Chi, p-value<0.05) for nine out of the fourteen topics investigated.

Concerns related to freedom of choice, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement were the most important among the hesitant individuals, even at a time when data on safety and effectiveness were limited compared to today. This illustrates that vaccine hesitancy is a complex construct which reflects not just the hesitancy toward a pharmaceutical product but also toward the policies that are developed and used for its distribution. This is clearly a scenario in which ideology influences medical choices with implications for vaccine policy. Mandating vaccination may appear to be an easier strategy to increase vaccine uptake compared to developing better communication efforts. However, it is a strategy with the potential to backfire and further polarize society. Communication efforts should be focused on risks and benefits only because policies that somehow affect the freedom discourse might further alienate the most hesitant individuals.
