The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) represents a promising target for antiviral therapy. The lack of selectivity for some of the reported 3CLpro inhibitors, specifically versus cathepsin L, raises potential safety and efficacy concerns. ALG-097111 potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (IC 50 \u00bc 7 nM) without affecting the activity of human cathepsin L (IC 50 > 10 mM). When ALG-097111 was dosed in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2, a robust and significant 3.5 log 10 (RNA copies/mg) reduction of the viral RNA copies and 3.7 log 10 (TCID 50 /mg) reduction in the infectious virus titers in the lungs was observed. These results provide the first in vivo validation for the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro as a promising therapeutic target for selective small molecule inhibitors.",

            "text": "Inhibition of the HCV and HIV viral proteases with antiviral drugs is a proven successful therapeutic approach [1] . With the continuing global COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent need for effective SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, investigators have repurposed previously discovered antiviral drugs initially designed against other viruses. These efforts have resulted in the approval of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue inhibiting the nsp12 polymerase, previously developed for Ebola [2, 3] . A second nsp12 inhibitor, MK-4482/EIDD-2801, is currently being evaluated in the clinic [4, 5] . The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) represents another promising target for antiviral therapy with no human homologue. Currently, the most advanced drug candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, is PF-07304814, a phosphate prodrug of PF-00835231 [6] , discovered more than 15 years ago in the context of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak [7] . Since the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, several reports of 3CLpro inhibitors with in vitro potency against SARS-CoV-2 have been reported [8] . However, the lack of selectivity of some of these compounds, specifically versus cathepsin L, raises questions on the overestimation of the 3CLpro component of in vitro cellular potency and its translation towards in vivo activity [9] . Cathepsin L is involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells and therefore contributes to non-selective 3CLpro inhibitor potency in commonly used cell lines. GC-376, a broad spectrum inhibitor of 3C, 3C-like proteases and cathepsin L, failed to show a clear antiviral effect in monotherapy in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection [10] . In another study modest antiviral activity was observed in the K18-hACE2 SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model [11] . Until now the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro remains to be validated as a promising therapeutic target; which is only possible with a 3CLpro inhibitor that lacks activity against other proteases such as cathepsin L. We applied a structure-based strategy with early monitoring of cathepsin L inhibition in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition. As a result, we identified ALG-097111, a potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor, which has demonstrated proof of concept by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in an in vivo SARS-CoV-2 hamster model.",

Strikingly, the potent antiviral effect of K117777 was abolished when TMPRSS2 was expressed in A549-ACE2. Off target activity of 3CLpro inhibitors could lead to an inaccurate assessment of the potential activity of a lead candidate in vivo. Indeed, the antiviral potency in cell-based assays will be overestimated when tested on cell lines not reproducing all entry pathways. Moreover, these non-selective inhibitors will have to compete in vivo for viral and host enzymes, likely leading to a further reduction of the antiviral potency. In addition, cysteine cathepsins are key regulators of both the innate and adaptive immunity to pathogens [25, 26] . In particular, Cathepsin L primes Tcells by processing the antigens in the lysosomal compartment of Antigen Presenting Cells (APC's), by presenting the proteolytic degradation peptides on the MHC class II [27] , processing the MHC class II [28] and different Toll-like receptors (TLR3, -7 and e9) [29, 30] and by controlling the secretion of different cytokines [25, 26] . Therefore, 3CLpro inhibitors that lack selectivity toward cathepsin L, may potentially have counter-effective side effects by dampening the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 [31] . This may be expected to aggravate the already impaired T-cell immunity of COVID-19 patients who often suffer from lymphocytopenia, reduced expression of MHCII and pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
