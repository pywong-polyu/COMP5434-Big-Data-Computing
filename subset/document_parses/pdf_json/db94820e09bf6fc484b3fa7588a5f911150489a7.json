The Chinese government took strong national intervention measures on January 23 to control the spread of the epidemic. We are trying to show the impact of these controls on the spread of the epidemic. We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size. Our SEIR and AI model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The epidemic control measures taken by the Chinese government, especially the city closure measures, reduced the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

They predicted that the number of infections in Wuhan would reach 190,000 by February 4. This estimate clearly overestimated the trend of the outbreak. On January 27, Biao Tang [21] et al. used epidemic data from January 10 to January 22 to predict the epidemic regeneration coefficient of 6.47 (95% confidence interval 5.71-7.23) by the SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model and statistical calculation method. Their model estimated that the number of infections would peak on approximately March 10. In early February, Norden E. Huang [22] et al. proposed a simple data-driven model based on natural growth, predicting that the number of infections would peak on approximately February 5, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases between 37,000 and 44,000. On February 24, 2020, Huwen Wang et al. [23] used SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model and proposed that the infection coefficient R0 decreased from 2.5 to 0.5 with virus variation and government policy, which had an impact on the prediction. On 19 March 2020, Joseph T. Wu et al. [24] used SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model and they study the influence of infection rate, removal rate in different age groups and migration data on prediction model. On March 25, 2020, Moritz U.G.Kraemer et al. [25] used GLM (generalized linear models) model to consider the impact of population migration and age on the number of infected people.",

On February 28, Zhong Nanshan et al. [26] used the SEIR model and LSTM model of population migration in Wuhan to predict the trend of the epidemic. The model focused on the impact of population migration in Wuhan on epidemic trends. On April 29, Jayson S.jia et al. [27] used a gravity model to prove that the population migration in Wuhan was closely related to epidemic trends in non-Wuhan regions. On May 4, Shengjie Lai et al. [28] used the SEIR model to predict the trend of the epidemic. their findings suggest that the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44-94) by February 29 without NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions). On June 28, Solomon Hsiang et al. [29] used the SIR model and linear regression model to predict the trend of the epidemic. Their models suggest that if the Chinese government had not taken effective measures, the number of infected people in China would have increased 465 times by March 22. In the early stage of the epidemic, due to the lack of sufficient data, it was difficult for scholars to accurately predict the trend of the epidemic [20] [21] [22] [23] . Additionally, a number of recent studies have shown that the development of the epidemic is closely related to population movement [24] [25] [26] . Therefore, it is still necessary to study the epidemic trend of COVID-19 at the current stage, which is of practical significance for the analysis, prevention and control of the epidemic [30] . According to the characteristics of the Wuhan and non-Wuhan regions, the SEIR model and deep learning model were established, respectively, considering the population flow. By using the actual data and referring to the existing literature and reports, the parameters of the new model were fitted. Finally, the model was used to estimate and analyze the epidemic trend.",

We selected Beijing and Henan provinces with strong representativeness, and the prediction effect of the DNN model is shown in Fig 9. Based on the model in this study, it is estimated that if Wuhan did not adopt city closure measures, for the vast majority of provinces such as Beijing, Chongqing and Guangdong, the cumulative number of increased infections in each province would have increased to about 1.5 times within 4 weeks. This shows that the closure of the city had a great effect on inhibiting the further spread of the disease.",

[28] used the SEIR model to predict the trend of the epidemic. their findings suggest that the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44-94) by February 29 without NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions). Without NPIs, the cumulative number of increased infections would have increased to 18 times within 3 weeks. In their model prediction, NPI contains more than just city closure measures, which make their predictions bigger than ours. Solomon Hsiang et al. [29] Additionally, we can see that the cumulative increase in the number of infections in different provinces did not occur in the early stages of the epidemic. Most provinces experienced a dramatic increase in the number of people infected within 3-7 days without closure. We believe this is due to the incubation period lasting for 2-14 days and the population migration in Wuhan was closely related to epidemic trends in non-Wuhan regions. If the city did not take measures to close the city, the new sources of infection in the city were mainly due to the latent period of the Wuhan migration population, and the outbreak was delayed by 3-7 days. Jayson S.jia et al. [27] also proved our point. They used a gravity model to prove that the population migration in Wuhan was closely related to epidemic trends in non-Wuhan regions. The correlation coefficient between the cumulative number of increased infections and the population migration in Wuhan increased from 0.522 on January 1 to 0.919 on January 24.",

The SEIR model could well predict the epidemic situation in Wuhan, which was dominated by primary cases, and the AI model which added population migration data could well predict the epidemic situation in non-Wuhan areas in China with a large number of input infections.
