The motivation to protect patient safety and a piecemeal approach to virtual care adoption facilitated the absorptive and adaptive resilience of cardiac care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, ad hoc changes to clinic roles and workflows, challenges in building relationships through remote methods, and widened inequities were barriers that threatened virtual care sustainment.",

However, amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, health systems have rapidly adopted and expanded virtual care technologies at an unprecedented scale and pace [2, 3] . Virtual care refers to \"any interaction occurring remotely between patients and/or members of their circle of care, through any form of communication or information technology with the aim of facilitating or maximizing the quality and effectiveness of patient care\" [4] . Such interactions may be synchronous or asynchronous and can be mediated through a variety of technologies, including video consultations, telemonitoring, and electronic medical records (EMRs). These technologies have played a pivotal role in facilitating access to health care during the pandemic [5] , especially for patients with chronic illnesses who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 [6, 7] . As nations plan for the provision of future health care services, what remains in question is: how can rapidly virtualized health care services be effectively sustained?",

In the face of acute or chronic [10, 11] stressors or challenges (also known as \"shocks\") [12] , an imperative for health systems is to be resilient [13] . Health systems resilience is commonly characterized as \"the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons that are learned during the crisis, reorganize if conditions require it\" [14] . Of importance is not only the ability to return to equilibrium after experiencing shocks but also the ability to create a new equilibrium, especially when shocks are persistent and intense. Blanchet et al [15] describe resilience processes as absorptive, adaptive, and transformative. With suitable preparation, health systems may absorb some shocks without considerable changes in the amount or allocation of resources. Greater demands however require systems to adapt policies and workflows and reallocate resources. As demands on the system increase in intensity or duration, systems may need to transform by fundamentally changing the services or procedures they offer.",

With the need to deliver health care remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, adopting and sustaining virtual care may constitute important components of health system resilience. Although virtual care adoption has been a prominent subject of research [16] [17] [18] [19] that has largely been enabled by theories such as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [20] , such theories often neglect the broader context in which virtual care adoption occurs [21, 22] , thereby limiting their ability to capture the novel phenomenon of virtual care adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is equally important to align evaluations of virtual care adoption with health system priorities, such as resilience, to complement the existing literature on virtual care adoption. Yet, few studies emerging from the evolving literature on COVID-19 have discussed virtualization efforts from this perspective.",

This occurred 2 days before the World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 global pandemic [23] . Between April and September 2020, 1113 scheduled in-person visits were converted to virtual visits by the Ontario Telemedicine Network (n=134, 12%) or by phone (n=979, 88%). Clinicians affiliated with the clinic also had remote access to the hospital's EMRs, which centralizes documentation and decisions related to the patient's care. Clinicians also had the option to enroll patients in the Medly program-a mobile phone-based telemonitoring program for patients with heart failure. The program uses a rules-based algorithm [24] that delivers tailored self-care messages to patients and clinical decision support based on the daily input of weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptom data. The program, which is described elsewhere [25] , was designed to support patients' self-management and promptly identify symptom deterioration between regularly scheduled in-person visits. The program became part of standard care in 2016. Clinical alerts were largely managed by a Medly coordinator (a registered nurse within the Heart Function Clinic), and alerts were escalated to cardiologists as required. To support the clinic's rapid virtualization, two nurses from another cardiology department within the hospital were assigned to the Medly team on a part-time and temporary basis. No limits were established for the duration of enrollment in the Medly program. Most patients in the Medly program use their existing devices (phone, weight scale, and blood pressure monitor); however, equipment is made available to patients who do not have the means to supply their own devices.",

For these patients, the personal benefits of virtual care were unclear and thus did not justify the new work involved, even when the monetary costs of participation were covered by the health care system (ie, equipment provided by the program). For example, a patient stated: The adoption of multiple virtual care technologies by clinicians allowed many patients to newly engage with or expand their use of virtualized care. Using multiple virtual care technologies to connect with the health care system was perceived as positive by patients, as they thought that using such technologies would help them overcome the limitations of each virtual care technology. For instance, data collected through the Medly system, which was originally designed to provide care between in-person appointments, were also used to provide additional context for virtual visits and allow for safe and effective remote medication titration. With different types of information captured and provided by various technologies, patients felt reassured that the quality of their care was maintained despite the reduced capacity of the health care system to see them in-person.

Visual assessment, touch, and diagnostic exams were some of the elements missing in virtual care that hampered a comprehensive and timely assessment. For example, one clinician stated: Patients and clinicians also had fewer opportunities to interact directly with each other in this new setting. For example, clinicians mentioned that they spoke with patients' caregivers (eg, family member) instead of patients. Patients who participated in the telemonitoring program would only be contacted by the health care team if they reported worsening or severe symptoms. Consequently, stable patients who only presented mild heart failure symptoms were less satisfied with their relationship with the health care team because they did not know how the program was impacting their care management.

Yet, few have explored the role of virtual care in health systems resilience amidst shocks, especially in high resource settings. In this study, we sought to understand the experiences, barriers, and facilitators of the rapid virtualization of cardiac care during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of patients, clinicians, and staff. Across the five themes identified in this study, it was found that the motivation to protect patient safety and a piecemeal approach were factors that facilitated the rapid virtualization of cardiac care, whereas ad hoc virtual care roles and workflows, difficulties in building patient-clinician relationships, and widened inequities served as barriers. Through the lens of health systems resilience, we found that the large and likely prolonged disruption to the Heart Function Clinic that was introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic prompted resilience processes for maintaining cardiac care services. This study illustrates how virtual care can facilitate health systems resilience despite shocks that hinder or constrain health care delivery.",

We observed that the COVID-19 pandemic created conditions in which the motivation to protect patient safety acted as an organizing vision that promoted the adoption and expanded use of virtual care technologies [33] . Drawing upon the UTAUT [20] may explain how these factors shaped clinicians', patients', and staff members' behavioral intentions to use virtual care during the pandemic and in the future. According to the UTAUT, performance expectancy (ie, the benefits introduced to end-users after completing a task) shapes users' behavioral intentions to use a technology [20] . Our research shows that the conditions associated with the pandemic changed the performance expectancy of virtual care by promoting its increased adoption. In particular, virtual care was perceived to have a greater relative advantage within a pandemic context, as patients and clinicians sought to avoid nonessential, in-person hospital visits. Findings that have been corroborated elsewhere have shown that reduced rates of emergency department visits and hospitalizations for heart failure were observed during the early phase of the pandemic [34] . As circumstances evolve with the COVID-19 pandemic, patient and clinician interest in, and use of, virtual care may shift as in-person settings are perceived to be safer. Consequently, the relative advantage [20] of virtual care may decrease as circumstances improve. Continuing to frame virtual care as a safety net for traditional, in-person care (regardless of whether in-person delivery has been restricted) may facilitate its sustained use by patients and clinicians.",

Alternatively, this may reflect the unanticipated technical challenges (eg, poor quality and dropped calls) that clinicians faced when using dedicated technologies. Other studies have documented the widespread adoption of general-purpose videoconferencing tools, such as FaceTime, Skype, and Zoom, during the COVID-19 pandemic [35] .

The drastic loss of administrative infrastructure when working in a virtual care environment led to perceptions of reduced productivity and increased workloads from clinicians.

When feedback fell short of their expectations, patients' perceptions of virtual care were negatively impacted. We posit that unclear expectations for virtual care may stem from the fact that dedicated virtual care technologies deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic were designed and implemented to fulfill purposes that were different from their roles in the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, virtual visits were previously considered as a care option; however, they are now regarded as essential during the pandemic.

Health systems facing similar shocks may benefit from facilitating similar leadership commitments to research and quality improvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such actions will facilitate the oft-forgotten component of learning that is integral to continued health systems resilience [13] . Our rapid evaluation serves as an indicator of learning from the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it will continue to guide efforts throughout and beyond the pandemic. A critical issue that remains with respect to governance is identifying the leadership capacities that are needed to facilitate transformations in health care settings that promote virtual care sustainment. Transition management principles [40] , which are used to \"explore, understand, operationalize, guide and accelerate transitions with networks of change agents\" [41] , can offer guidance.

Fourth, three cardiologists from the Heart Function Clinic were not represented due to scheduling challenges. Finally, despite our efforts to purposefully recruit participants with a range of demographic characteristics, the patients we interviewed were predominately young, White, residing in suburban areas, and college educated.

Despite the absorptive and adaptive resilience demonstrated by cardiac care services, we identified barriers that were experienced by patients, clinicians, and staff within a virtual care environment, including a lack of administrative support, the use of ad hoc virtual care roles and workflows, difficulties in building patient-clinician relationships, and widened inequities. If left unaddressed, these barriers threaten the sustainment of virtual care, thereby leaving the opportunity to strengthen health systems through virtual care unrealized. We argue that resilience processes that are implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic need to be transformative. This involves the reconsideration of clinical roles and workflows, the redesign of virtual care systems, and active efforts for engaging populations that continue to be underserved. To assist health settings, we present recommendations for promoting virtual care sustainment, which will help them build resilience to the shocks inherent in and created by complex processes within complex adaptive systems, such as the health care system. Through such transformations, health systems enduring shocks may emerge strengthened and more resilient than before.",

You know it diminishes the quality of life if you have to subject yourself to this sort of regimentation. [Patient 2] Piecemeal Virtual Care Solutions To accommodate physical distancing restrictions and the need to work from home, clinic appointments were cancelled, deferred to a later date, or changed to virtual visit appointments. Multiple virtual care technologies, including existing and new technologies, dedicated technologies (eg, EMRs and telemonitoring systems), and general-purpose technologies (eg, phone calls and FaceTime; implemented after obtaining consent), were rapidly deployed using a piecemeal approach to facilitate virtual visits. A clinician said: ...we'd had a good experience of [telemonitoring] already, so it was kind of a no-brainer to try and onboard as many patients as would be appropriate to the [telemonitoring] platform, and follow them that way, in conjunction with the telephone follow-ups or Ontario Telehealth visits to try and keep them physically out of the hospital.

[Patient 3]For clinicians however, the value of using multiple virtual care technologies was mixed. A piecemeal approach to virtual care allowed clinicians to act rapidly, as it provided the flexibility needed to select technologies based on their needs and backup options when technical challenges occurred (eg, switching to a phone call when a video call freezes). Yet, switching between multiple siloed virtual care systems often duplicated administrative work that reduced care efficiency. To improve the sustainability of virtualized clinic services, clinicians expressed a strong desire for connectivity between virtual care systems:It is extremely important, I think, having[telemonitoring] connect with our online EMR system, so it does pull the blood work, but it doesn't pull other things. We have to manually input medications, which is very tricky...Everything in one system would allow us to work a lot more seamlessly and it would be more efficient, and it would be possible probably to look after more patients if everything was combined.",

            "text": "It was widely accepted among participants that virtual care technologies were integral for facilitating access to cardiac care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, clinicians had different views on how these technologies would impact people's access to care after the pandemic. For example, one clinician said: I don't foresee clinics going back to the way they were. I think they'll be reserved for people who are unwell or who need their diagnostics done. The ones that can afford it, the ones that want to see their doctor, they're going to want to come see their doctor again even if they could do that virtually. But for [some of] the patients...the risk/benefit ratio really favors just sitting and doing it from home. [Clinician 8] A critical barrier of sustaining virtual care was its paradoxical impact on inequities; while virtual care technologies could potentially improve the distribution of health care services, they often targeted patients who already had access to health care. Thus, as populations with access to care enjoyed faster and more convenient care, inequities continued to widen. One clinician said: I'll give you examples of patients that are the highest risk patients-and I see a lot of patients that were recently admitted-but you take the homeless people, the people that are under-housed with a touch of dementia\u2026Like [telemonitoring] is not going to work for them. And those are exactly who you need it to work for. [Clinician 8] Clinicians rejected the notion that a single virtual care technology could serve the needs of all patients. Instead, a dynamic approach to virtual care involving an ecosystem of technologies that are allocated based on the needs and means of patients was envisioned for the future. A clinician stated \u2026not losing humanism and not losing the patient perspective about what things should or shouldn't be pushed versus pulled by [patients] is part of what we need to figure out as we move digital health forward\u2026We're still pushing things at patients; we haven't been able to provide a venue of tools and an explanation of what those tools are.
