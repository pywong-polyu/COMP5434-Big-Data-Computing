Rapid diagnostics is required for clinical decision making regarding isolation of patients and appropriate therapy. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the Panther Fusion\u00ae respiratory panel using published laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays (LDT). Study design: Analytical sensitivity of Panther Fusion\u00ae Flu A/B/RSV was assessed by testing dilutions of cell culture isolates. Clinical performance assessment included the complete Panther Fusion\u00ae respiratory panel (Flu-A/B/RSV, PIV 1-4 and AdV/hMPV/RV) and consisted of a retrospective and a prospective study-arm. The retrospective evaluation included 201, stored (\u221280\u00b0C) samples collected between February 2006 and January 2017.

Fast and reliable laboratory testing is essential for patient management [1] [2] [3] . Many laboratories have developed multiplex qRT-PCR assays to detect respiratory viruses, but more recently also commercial PCR assays have become available. Some of these assays can be used at point-of-care (POCT) and can consist of a limited panel (e.g. Influenza A and B viruses) [4] [5] [6] or a comprehensive panel detecting a large number of viruses and even atypical respiratory bacteria [7] [8] [9] . In contrast to some POCT respiratory virus PCR assays, which can be fast and easy to perform, most laboratory developed tests (LDT) require highly qualified personnel to perform and interpret the results, much longer times to result (up to \u223c6 h) and more hands-on time because of, among others, separated nucleic acid extraction, amplification, analysis and QC.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 277, "end": 280, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 281, "end": 284, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 285, "end": 288, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 573, "end": 576, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 577, "end": 580, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 581, "end": 584, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 685, "end": 688, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 689, "end": 692, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 693, "end": 696, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "We have evaluated the Panther Fusion\u00ae and accessory respiratory virus panels.

The relative analytical sensitivity of the Panther Fusion\u00ae system was slightly less for Flu A/B and RSV compared to the LDT, which corresponded with a slightly less clinical PIV-4 (sensitivity 71.9 %) and AdV (sensitivity 78.9 %) compared to LDT. In addition, for Panther Fusion\u00ae Sam et al., found presumed false positive results for hMPV in 7 samples. In our study we also found 9 hMPV-positive samples in Panther Fusion\u00ae (Ct > 36.2) that were negative in our LDT. Amplification curves were re-evaluated and all exhibited low-fluorescence, which could result in ambiguous interpretation. It is not uncommon that multiplex syndromic PCR panels are less sensitive compared to well-established LDT assays [17, 18] . These syndromic panels often are dependent on uniformed nucleic acid isolation and PCR procedures, which are a trade-off between sensitivity and consolidation. Linear regression showed good correlations between LDT and Panther Fusion\u00ae for all viruses, except RV and PIV-4. These findings could be explained by the large sequence diversity of RV. In addition, the RV LDT assay was not designed to detect all rhinovirus type C strains efficiently, which also contributes to the lower correlation. The number of PIV-4 positive samples in both assays was low (n = 23) and appear to be divided in two different subgroups. Whether this can be attributed to genetic differences between PIV-4A and PIV-4B strains and potential primer/probe mismatches could not be investigated. Primer and probe sequences are unknown, since commercial companies do not tend to share these data. Although for AdV a good correlation between both assays was demonstrated, Panther Fusion\u00ae missed 2 high positive AdV-2 samples in the retrospective study. Most likely this was not due to mismatch of primer/probe for AdV-2 as other AdV-2 samples included in the study were detected properly. Why these two AdV-2 samples with low Ct values were missed in the Panther Fusion\u00ae remains unclear.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 870, "end": 874, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 875, "end": 878, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The Panther Fusion\u00ae respiratory assays are officially only CE-IVD approved for nasopharyngeal swabs.

All internal controls where within the assay limits, according to the Panther Fusion\u00ae software. However, the software only declares a result as invalid if the internal control is negative and no other virus is tested positive. As a consequence a certain degree of PCR inhibition will be tolerated by the Panther Fusion\u00ae. In specific cases laboratories could formulate additional cut-off values for the internal control, but these would have to be monitored and interpreted by the user. In addition, in case of for instance a high positive influenza A virus result the internal control may be negative, presumably by competition, but the result will not be rejected by the Panther Fusion\u00ae software.

Discrepant results were found for all viruses, except PIV-2 (Fig. 2). A total of 88 samples were positive in LDT but negative in the Panther Fusion\u00ae assay.
