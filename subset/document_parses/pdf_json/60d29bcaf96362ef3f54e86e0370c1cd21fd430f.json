Although the main symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, respiratory difficulties, fatigue, and loss of smell and taste, up to severe complications such as interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, a large portion of cases are asymptomatic (Kronbichler et al., 2020) .",

Furthermore, asymptomatic cases can lead to significant subclinical lung abnormalities in a short time, suggesting that the absence of symptoms may not imply the absence of harm. In a recent review and meta-analysis published by Kronbichler et al. (2020) , the first systematic analysis of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in the literature, the authors focused on the role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers in disease transmission. They concluded that they represent a significant portion of COVID-19 patients and their early identification is extremely important to prevent transmission. The authors also reported that more than half of the 506 asymptomatic patients from 34 studies included in their metaanalysis had lung alterations on computed tomography, mainly ground-glass opacities, although with normal laboratory findings in the majority of cases. A similar result was reported in a study on the outbreak of the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February 2020; in fact, 73% of the cases were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, and over half of them presented lung abnormalities at computed tomography (Tabata et al., 2020) .",

In homeless shelters characterized by the physical proximity of residents, elevated population density, a limited use of face masks, and often precarious hygienic conditions outside the shelter, the reported prevalence of COVID-19 is higher than the general population (Karb et al., 2020) . Also, homeless persons have more physical and mental comorbidities, usually undiagnosed and uncontrolled, that may worsen the disease's course. In these congregated living settings, asymptomatic cases represent the most common means of contagion, as reported by Baggett in Boston (Baggett et al., 2020) , Tobolowsky in Seattle and King County (Tobolowsky et al., 2020) , and Imbert in San Francisco (Imbert et al., 2020) (Table 1) .",

Tests were performed at admission and routinely afterward. Additional prevention measures were implemented, including mandatory use of face masks, daily health education programs, application of hygiene protocols, and adequate distancing. As of October 31, 2020, we evaluated 298 persons and identified twelve positive cases, with a prevalence of infection of 4%. Most of the positive cases (75%) were asymptomatic at the time of the testing and in the 14 days before, while only three patients had symptoms that included fever, diarrhea, and cough ( Figure 1 ).",

Prevention measures including routine surveillance with molecular and nasopharyngeal antigen swabs and serological tests, in addition to other measures such as strict hygiene rules inside and outside the shelter, adequate distancing protocols, continuous symptom screening, and health education programs, should be implemented in all homeless shelters to intercept new clusters of infection and prevent outbreaks. Concurrently, temporary shelter closures may have severe effects on residents and public health, and alternative residential solutions should be carefully planned and made promptly available in case of outbreaks.",
