These antibodies are typically developed in response to natural infection, but not in response to any vaccine currently available in South Africa. While there is some waning of antibodies, in this context we expect about 95 percent of donors who ever developed antibodies to have detectable levels at the time of testing [4] while a small proportion (we estimate in the range of 5-10 percent) of individuals who experience infection never develop detectable antibodies. [5] Results Figure 1 shows the distribution of specimens by age group, race, sex and province. We found no statistically significant dependence of seroprevalence on either age or sex. However, unsurprisingly, there were statistically and epidemiologically significant differences between provinces, and among race groups in each province. Hence:",
