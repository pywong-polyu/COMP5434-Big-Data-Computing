Results: In total, CVC-insertion was successful in 27 (90%) of the patients and the first attempt was successful in 24 (78%) of patients. Success rates of CVC were 80% < 5 kg and 100% \u22655 kg. Comparing the two groups we found a clear trend towards longer needle insertion time in patients weighing < 5 kg (33 vs. 24 [15-37]s, P = .07), whereas, the total time for catheter insertion and the duration of the whole procedure were similar in both groups (199 [167-228] vs. 178 [138-234] and 720 vs. 660 s. In total, we report 3 (10%) cases of local hematoma as procedure-related complications.

A potential problem in the use of conventional US is the probe-connecting wire, which sometimes hinders the fluency and handling during the procedure and might inhere the risk of crossinfections. Recently, a novel wireless, bluetooth US transducer has been released and might simplify the use of US in cannulation.

However, CVC-placement can be challenging and multiple anatomic sites may have to be attempted and an unsuitable length of time may be needed to gain access. Many of the paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery need multiple surgeries and cardiac catheterization procedures, which makes it important not to use multiple anatomic sites in order to protect the vessels. Moreover, it appears that difficulties in CVC-placement relate to vessel size and are therefore influenced by the body weight of young patients. Therefore, the valuable information-offered by US guidance in general -about the potential anatomical peculiarities is even more important in this delicate patient population. However, application of US guidance for CVCplacement in paediatric patients might especially be challenging due to the small diameter of the vascular structures and deserves scientific attention. In the present study, we report a total success rate for CVCplacement of 90%, a first-attempt rate of 78%, a mean total procedural time of about 11 min, and absence of serious complications related to CVC-placement. When comparing patients < 5 and \u2265 5 kg of body weight, we found that first attempt success rates, success rates within 3 attempts, as well as overall success rates were slightly lower in the group < 5 kg. In addition, we found a clear trend towards higher needle insertion time in patients weighing < 5 kg.

We can state that its use is clinically feasible and suitable for neonates and small infants. The assessment of the applicability of the WUST used in our study revealed high rates on the Likert scale: all participant anaesthesiologists pointed out the very good visualization of the vessel, as well as the very good image quality. In open feed-back comments, application of the WUST has been described as expeditious and user-friendly, since also modifications and adjustments of the image settings could be performed by the operator from the probe's built-in controls without the assistance of a second operator. The most stated drawback was the higher weight of the transducer, which could increase the likelihood of compressing the internal jugular vein, especially with the decreasing vessel diameter in neonates and small infants, and subsequently, might limit its use in small neonates.",
