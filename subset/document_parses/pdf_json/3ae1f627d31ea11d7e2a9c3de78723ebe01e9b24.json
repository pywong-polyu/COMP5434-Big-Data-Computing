Remarkably, the security and janitorial work groups had substantially higher rates of positive results (62.5% and 45.4%, respectively) than the other work groups.

Countries in the Americas occupy three of the first four places in number of deaths: the United States of America (USA) with 232,166, Brazil with 161,106 and Mexico with 93,772 (World Health Organization, 2020).Quantified as number of deaths per million population, Brazil occupies the 6 th place globally with 757.9, Mexico the 9 th with 723.1, and the USA the 11th with 701.4.",
