FDA's public education campaigns help educate youth about the potential risks of using tobacco products and three separate experimental copy testing/ad testing studies (N = 1907) were conducted in support of the FDAs \"The Real Cost\" (TRC) Cigarette and ENDS Campaigns. These studies provided data for the current investigation which used harm perception items to assess perceived risks of cigarette or ENDS use among adolescents after viewing a public health education advertisement. Eligible youth aged 13-17 who were susceptible, or experimenting, with cigarettes or vaping products were recruited online and randomized into either an ad viewing exposure group, or a non-ad viewing control group. The ads focused on health effects, addiction, or both. Effect sizes on key harm perception measures between groups were computed and standardized to allow for comparisons. Both TRC Cigarette and TRC ENDS ads were able to change harm and addiction perceptions (p < .05); however, effect sizes were significantly larger for items related to health effects for ENDS vs cigarettes (p < .05). When designing youth focused ENDS education campaigns, practitioners should present novel facts in order to take advantage of large effect sizes. Evaluators of early campaign efforts to educate youth about these products may anticipate significant increases in healthrelated risk perceptions.",

ENDS are the most commonly used tobacco products among U.S. middle and high school students with 19.6% of high school students (3.02 million) and 4.7% of middle school students (550 thousand) reporting using ENDS in 2020 (Gentzke et al., 2020) . As evidenced by the success of \"The Real Cost\" campaign and other youth prevention ENDS efforts, mass media campaigns can be effective in reducing tobacco use among youth (Duke, 2019; Schar et al., 2006) . In fact, the U.S. has seen a dramatic shift in perceptions about smoking due to decades of sustained tobacco control efforts that have included large mass media campaigns to educate the public about the risks of smoking (Cummings and Proctor, 2014) . As a relatively new product, information about the health risks of ENDS is still emerging; however, the extreme popularity of these products among youth accompanied by the risks of nicotine exposure to the developing adolescent brain have made combating youth ENDS use a core priority for the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018).",

As part of this authority, FDA launched \"The Real Cost\" campaign in 2014 to educate young people ages 12-17 about the dangers of cigarette smoking. \"The Real Cost\" campaign ads focused on the risks of tobacco use by highlighting consequences youth are concerned about, such as loss of control due to addiction, dangerous chemicals in tobacco products, and cosmetic health effects like tooth loss and skin damage. An evaluation of \"The Real Cost\" demonstrated that, in its first two years, the campaign has prevented up to 587,000 youth ages 11 to 19 from initiating smoking, half of whom might have gone on to become established adult smokers (Duke, 2019) .",

A significant body of research has demonstrated the importance of \"novel and unique information\" in public health education, including tobacco education (Brennan et al., 2017; Sangalang et al., 2016) . This indicates the importance of messaging on beliefs of which a large proportion of the population do not currently hold and are therefore available to be moved through campaign messaging. In other words, messaging on facts that are already known and agreed upon may have diminishing returns. In addition, beliefs where mean awareness is dramatically above the midpoint are limited in regard to messaging as they do not allow for movement on those beliefs, due to ceiling effects (Hornik and Woolf, 1999) .",

The goal of this study is to see if there is more opportunity to influence ENDS beliefs as there has been less messaging, and less negative public perceptions, regarding ENDS beliefs than those of cigarettes. This manuscript addresses this gap by presenting findings from three separate copy testing studies (Study 1four cigarette ad viewing groups and one control group, and Studies 2 & 3 -each with one ad viewing group and one control group). The current study uses data from these copy testing studies, a form of message testing, to assess differences in key ENDS perceptions between those who saw an ENDS prevention ad for \"The Real Cost\" campaign and those who did not. Effect sizes were then compared between the \"The Real Cost\": Cigarette ad study and the \"The Real Cost\": ENDS ad studies that use similar messaging strategies.",

Participants in the ad viewing groups were exposed to a single ad and were asked several outcome measures to understand various components of the ad. Participants in both the ad viewing and control groups were asked questions about their perceptions of harm related to tobacco use. The harm perception items are the focus of this study. The following questions regarding perceptions of harm of using cigarettes and perceptions of harm of using ENDS were asked in both the TRC:C and TRC:E studies respectively: \"If I smoke/vape I will damage my body,\" \"If I smoke/vape I will damage my lungs\" and \"If I smoke I will be controlled by cigarettes/If I vape I will become addicted to vaping\". There were four items in Study 1 and 12 items in Study 2 & 3 that were not used in the current analysis as the ads did not focus on these perceived harms. These items were never intended as a scale as each item focuses on an isolated harm that does not apply to every ad. The items that were not analyzed focused on long term consequence such as shortening of life and developing cancer. All items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from \"Strongly Disagree\" (1) to \"Strongly Agree\" (5). As mentioned previously, the current analyses are derived from three different study data sets, one study testing ads for TRC:C, and two studies testing ads for TRC:E. Each of the three studies had a control group for comparisons. This manuscript focuses on these comparable harm perceptions questions by assessing differences in these perceptions between control and exposure for both TRC:C and TRC:E and the effect size associated with these differences. This paper also compares effect sizes between TRC:C and TRC:E to better assess an increase in harm perceptions with these campaign ads.",

Effect sizes generally varied by campaign and to a certain degree by ad type within the campaign and by belief being asked about. The largest effect sizes were seen for the TRC:E ad Epidemic for the beliefs \"Damage my Body\" and \"Damage my Lungs\". As shown in Table 4 , the effect size of based on exposure to this ad was significantly larger than the effect size for exposure to any of the TRC:C ads for the same beliefs. Magic, the other TRC:E ad tested, had an effect size that was comparable to the effect sizes of the TRC:C ads for the beliefs \"Damage my Body\" and \"Damage my Lungs\". It is important to note that the content of the two TRC:E ads are substantively different from each other. Epidemic, the first TRC:E ad, substantiates a variety of health risks related to using ENDS while Magic, the second ad, solely focuses on the fact that youth who use ENDS are more likely to also use cigarettes. It's possible that the Epidemic ad gave a more powerful message and thus had a stronger impact. Conversely, while Magic did not message directly on physical harms of ENDS use individuals who viewed the ad still had higher perceptions of risks to one's body and lungs than those in the control group.",

Generally, the TRC:C ads had small to medium effect sizes whereas the TRC:E ads had medium to large effect sizes using Sawilowsky's new effect size standards (Sawilowsky, 2009 ) (d = 0.01, very small; d = 0.02, small; d = 0.5, medium; d = 0.8, large; d = 1.2 , very large; d = 2.0, huge). When looking at differences in how ads performed between those who viewed an ad and the control condition, it becomes clear that this was primarily due to how low negative perceptions were among the control group for the ENDS ads as opposed to being a result of the ENDS ad viewing group having a much higher perception of risk than the cigarette ad viewing group. Perceptions of risks of ENDS use among the TRC:E control group are very low, suggesting that beliefs about ENDS have more room for change than beliefs for cigarettes. Given these findings as well as findings from literature previously cited, it is the assumption of the authors that the larger effects sizes seen in the ENDS studies are primarily due to differences in familiarity of knowledge about smoking and vaping. The harms associated with using cigarettes have been known for decades and there have already been effective multimedia campaigns aimed at educating youth on the harms of cigarette use (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014; Lantz et al., 2000) . That being said, results from this paper do suggest that both TRC:C and TRC:E ads which were tested have the potential to change perceptions among the target audience. ",

This lack of information about ENDS products relative to cigarettes presents an opportunity to change youth perceptions about these products through focused public health education. As the risks of cigarettes are already well known and generally believed by the public, ads messaging on the risks of cigarette use may only result in modest changes in beliefs among those who view them. Conversely, for ads that message on the risks of new and novel tobacco productsfor which the risks are likely less well knownit may make sense to expect to see larger changes in beliefs.",
