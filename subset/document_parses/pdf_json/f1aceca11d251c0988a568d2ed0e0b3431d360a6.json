The elimination of populations of O. moubata would contribute to the prevention and control of these two serious diseases. Anti-tick vaccines are an eco-friendly and sustainable means of eliminating tick populations. Tick saliva forms part of the tick-host interface, and knowledge of its composition is key to the identification and selection of vaccine candidate antigens. The aim of the present work is to increase the body of data on the composition of the saliva proteome of adult O. moubata ticks, particularly of females, since in-depth knowledge of the O. moubata sialome will allow the identification and selection of novel salivary antigens as targets for tick vaccines.",

Unconfirmed historical records of this tick include those from Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Botswana (northern parts); however, as indicated by Bakkes et al. [3] , these may prove to be records of different species should they be further studied. O. moubata is mainly sylvatic and associated with warthogs and other animals inhabiting burrows, but it is also synanthropic and colonises human dwellings and farm animal housing, particularly that of pigs [4] . In South Africa, Angola, Zambia and Malawi, the medical and veterinary impact of O. moubata is significant due to its function as a vector of Borrelia duttoni, a spirochete that causes tick-borne human relapsing fever, and of African swine fever virus. Tick-borne human relapsing fever caused by B. duttoni is endemic in extensive zones of east Africa, where it affects up to 6.4% of the population and is responsible for perinatal mortality rates as high as 436/1000 [5, 6] . African swine fever virus is an acute febrile haemorrhagic disease of swine, with a lethality rate close to 100%, which limits pig production and causes enormous economic losses in affected countries [7, 8] .",

In addition to these drawbacks, chemical agents are ineffective for the elimination of O. moubata from human dwellings and animal pens because they do not penetrate holes, cracks and fissures deeply enough to reach the ticks which take refuge in them, as was observed in a study on Ornithodoros erraticus in Spain [11] .",

These studies have resulted in the identification of a range of tick molecules involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying tick haematophagy, tick-host interactions and pathogen transmission [14] . We recently applied omics technologies to O. moubata to analyse and characterise the transcriptome and proteome of the female tick midgut (mialome) before and after tick feeding [17, 18] . The obtained omics datasets allowed us to select several vaccine candidate antigens, which were produced as recombinant proteins or as synthetic peptides and tested for vaccine efficacy in animal immunisation trials. Some of these candidates proved effective against Ornithodoros spp. and thus may potentially be of use in vaccine formulations for tick control [19] .",

This had already been described by D\u00edaz-Martin et al. [22] , who also confirmed the massive presence of lipocalin proteins in female saliva. A superabundance of lipocalins would have hampered the detection of the less abundant proteins, whose levels most likely would have remained below the limit of detection of the assays. Proof of this was the fact that when the saliva samples were equalised and the \"excess\" superabundant proteins removed, the number of proteins identified in female saliva increased significantly [22, 29] . At the time of its publication, the work of D\u00edaz-Mart\u00edn et al. [22] provided interesting novel information on the saliva proteome of males and females, and revealed for the first time differences in the salivary composition of male and females soft ticks. However, that study had one drawback: the method applied to increase the number of identifications, namely, protein equalisation with the ProteoMiner Kit (BioRad), which precluded quantification of the components.",

            "text": "In ixodid ticks, observed differences between males and females in salivary composition are not surprising, since the feeding behaviour and the anatomy and functions of the salivary glands of the sexes differ [30, 31] . However, the differences reported between O. moubata males and females in salivary composition were somewhat surprising, since typically soft tick adults, and specifically O. moubata adults, do not show anatomical differences in their salivary glands and feed in a similar way. They ingest equivalent amounts of blood relative to their body weight and do so for a similar length of time, about 1 h. This means that both sexes have to overcome the same barriers and host defence responses to complete blood ingestion, and thus are expected to use the same repertoire of salivary proteins for the evasion of host defences [22] . In the present study, the different sets of proteins identified by LC-MS/MS in female and male saliva suggest a qualitative difference in their composition, which agrees with the findings of a previous report [22] . However, it should be noted that the reference database used in the present study for protein identification, i.e. the O. moubata sialotranscriptome, was only based on data from female salivary glands. Consequently, it might be assumed that (i) it is most likely that the majority of the proteins identified in the present study, including those found in males only, are also present in female saliva; and (ii) that the differences observed between the sexes are most probably due to quantitative differences in expression rather than to the actual absence/presence of particular proteins in either sex. As discussed below, the results of the SWATH-MS also lend support to this idea.",

Several published SWATH studies have demonstrated that SWATH-MS increases the sensitivity and the reproducibility of protein and peptide identification across multiple replicates [32, 33] . Therefore, SWATH-MS might identify and quantify a higher number of proteins expressed simultaneously in O. moubata male and female saliva than LC-MS/MS, which in turn allows for a comparison of protein expression (Table 2; Additional  file 3: Table S1 ). Up to 40 of these proteins were identified by both methods, 24 exclusively by LC-MS/MS and 125 exclusively by SWATH (Fig. 3a) . In male saliva, 195 and 165 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS and SWATH-MS, respectively (Table 2; Additional file 3: Table S1 ).

            "text": "Lipocalins are a large multigene protein family which have dual functions as histamine and serotonin scavengers and as modulators of vertebrate inflammation and immunity [16] . Moubatin belongs to a lipocalin clade that includes proteins that inhibit platelet and neutrophil aggregation by scavenging of thromboxane A2 and proteins that inhibit complement activation by sequestering the C5 component [35] . TSGP1 belongs to the serotonin and histamine-binding group of the soft tick lipocalins [36] . The present results confirm a previous report by Oleaga et al. [21] regarding the great abundance of TSGP1 discovered in the proteome of the salivary glands of O. moubata, and support the notion that, in O. moubata, TSGP1 is the main scavenger of histamine and serotonin. These pro-inflammatory biogenic amines accumulate at the tick-feeding site and need to be efficiently removed for the tick to successfully feed [34] . Regardless of its function, TSGP1 is highly immunogenic and strongly recognised by the serum of pigs bitten by O. moubata, which has made it a useful tool for the serological diagnosis of parasitism by O. moubata [37] . In fact, a recombinant form of TSGP1 has already been used in several seroepidemiological studies on the exposure of pigs to this tick in Madagascar, Mozambique and Nigeria [38] [39] [40] .",

Among these, proteases, protease inhibitors, antioxidants, and proteins involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids were the more abundant groups, representing between 0.8 and 0.4% of the salivary protein content (Fig. 4a) . In these groups, the more abundant proteins were a carboxypeptidase (B7QF76), a metalloprotease (Q09JT3), SCO-spondin-like (XP_021004313), enolase (D4P967), aldehyde dehydrogenase (B7QAL5), catalase (A0A2U8T6B2) and phospholipase A2 (M9W8K4) (Additional file 4: Table S2 ). For several of these proteins, classified as housekeeping proteins, it has been well established that they can also play important extracellular functions at the host-parasite interface, which help ticks to feed [41, 42] . For instance, in O. moubata, salivary enolase acts as a pro-fibrinolytic plasminogen activator receptor [43] , and salivary secreted phospholipase A2 plays a role as an antagonist ligand of host P-selectin preventing P-selectin-mediated endothelial activation [44] .",

Serpin 2 is a well-characterised serine protease inhibitor that inhibits trypsin and thrombin, and interferes with platelet aggregation and blood clotting [45, 46] .

The signal peak areas of the differentially expressed proteins in each of the samples analysed are shown using a heat map after z-score normalisation, using Euclidean distances. The heat map shows two main clusters comprising the F1-F3 samples and M1-M3 samples, which correspond to the saliva of females and males, respectively (Additional file 6: Figure  S2 ). Figure 5 shows the top ten proteins that are differentially (P < 0.05) overexpressed in the saliva of female and male ticks. As expected according to the results reported above, the top ten overexpressed proteins in females were five lipocalins, including moubatin and TSGP1, phospholipase A2, apyrase, a metalloprotease, a salivary secreted basic tail protein and a salivary basic tailless protein Table S3 ). Apyrase has been identified in the saliva of most haematophagous vectors, including soft and hard ticks. This enzyme hydrolyses ATP and ADP to AMP, and prevents platelet and neutrophil aggregation and thrombus formation, thus facilitating blood feeding [47, 48] . A recombinant form of the salivary apyrase of O. moubata induced protective, strong humoral responses in animal vaccine trials that reduced tick feeding and survival [47] .",

However, remarkable differences were found in the ratios of salivary proteins that males and females secrete, which raises the question of the biological significance of these differences. It can be speculated that this may be related to post-feeding blood processing or attraction and mating [52] , but neither our present results nor a revision of the literature offered evidence to support, or rule out, such a notion, or shed light on this.",

            "text": "Previous studies on the salivary transcriptome of O. moubata adults were handicapped by the superabundance of lipocalins, especially in female saliva, that impeded the identification of less abundant proteins. Equalisation of saliva samples increased protein identification but precluded quantification of the protein components of saliva [22, 29] . To overcome these obstacles, we analysed the proteome of the saliva of male and female O. moubata via two MS techniques, conventional LC-MS/MS and quantitative label-free SWATH-MS, and carried out a PIT analysis using the recently obtained sialotranscriptome of O. moubata females as a reference database for protein identification [20] . SWATH-MS proved superior to LC-MS/MS for the study of female saliva, since it increased by 61.2% the number of identified proteins, enhanced the reproducibility of the results and provided a quantitative picture of the salivary components. Additionally, the PIT analysis demonstrated its usefulness for proteomics studies of O. moubata, a non-model organism for which there are no genomic sequences available. PIT is being increasingly and successfully used in proteomics studies of tick saliva, which are fuelled by the increasing number of tick sialotranscriptomes available as a result of the more frequent application of next-generation sequencing techniques to tick salivary glands [17, 31] . We identified 299 non-redundant proteins in O. moubata saliva and quantified the expression of 165 of these in both male and female saliva, among which 13 were significantly overexpressed in females and 40 in males. These results provide evidence of important quantitative differences between the sexes in the saliva proteome, and confirm in part results obtained in earlier work using different methodological approaches. These findings expand our knowledge of the O. moubata sialome, particularly that of females, by increasing the number of identified novel salivary proteins with different functions at the tick-host feeding interface. The integration of this new information on the O. moubata sialotranscriptome will allow a more rational selection of salivary candidates as antigen targets for tick vaccine development and testing in animal immunisation tests. For example, superabundant proteins, such as lipocalins, should not be considered as vaccine targets because their massive presence in saliva would most likely preclude their complete neutralisation by vaccine-induced antibodies. Finally, we believe that the testing of multiantigenic vaccine formulations that include protective intestinal and salivary antigens should be encouraged, since these formulations will target different biological processes and may provide synergic protective effects leading to the development of more effective vaccines for the control of O. moubata infestations and pathogen transmission.
