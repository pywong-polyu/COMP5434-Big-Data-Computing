Establish a \"Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter\" distributed crawler framework to collect data. The system can judge the positive and negative emotions of the reviewer based on the comments, and can also reflect the depth of the seven emotions such as Hopeful, Happy, and Depressed. Finally, we improved the sentiment discriminant model of this system and compared the sentiment discriminant error of COVID-19 related comments with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results show that our model has better generalization ability and smaller discriminant error. We designed a large data visualization screen, which can clearly show the trend of public emotions, the proportion of various emotion categories, keywords, hot topics, etc., and fully and intuitively reflect the development of public opinion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Since December 2019, COVID-19 has been a hot topic for people to discuss on the Internet. In this era of highly developed networks, the open nature of the network and the democratic atmosphere have promoted the development of online public opinion. The situation of epidemic public opinion can affect major industries such as commerce, medical care, transportation, education, and even contribute to scientific research. Analyzing the epidemic situation and public opinion scientifically and systematically to trace the development of public opinion and analyze the changes in public sentiment. It can serve individuals, governments, and even countries. Providing a reliable reference when weighing the \"pros and cons\" can also predict the key events that can detonate public opinion in the future, so analyzing and visualizing epidemic public opinion data is an indispensable task. Traditional analysis systems include public opinion communication analysis, public opinion feedback analysis, and public opinion subject analysis. The traditional public opinion analysis system has two directions, content analysis, and empirical analysis. Scientifically and systematically analyzing the dynamic development of public opinion from the perspective of the epidemic has the following significance: (1) It can assist the government to implement precise policies and alleviate social panic. During times of public crises, governments must act swiftly to communicate crisis information effectively and efficiently to members of the public [Chen, Min, Zhang et al. (2020) ]. The government can implement soothing measures based on changes in public sentiment. Only by keeping abreast of public sentiment dynamics can be the level of public opinion guidance be strengthened; (2) Formulate appropriate isolation measures for the changes in public sentiment, reduce social problems, and reduce various conflicts caused by public unrest. For example, family conflicts, doctor-patient relationship conflicts, and business conflicts caused by emotional unrest; (3) Formulate corresponding economic policies stimulus emotional changes to promote economic recovery. It can also adjust the market according to the changes in people's emotions and demand relationships to achieve the purpose of promoting consumption; (4) It can provide a basis for universities to formulate school opening policies and adjust the school opening time; (5) These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 [Zhan, Cheng, Yu et al. (2020) ]. Therefore, we designed and implemented a COVID-19 public opinion and emotion monitoring system. The system is divided into three modules: text mining, text cleaning and sentiment analysis. In terms of text mining, we use the \"Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter\" distributed crawler framework to crawl corpus, and take Weibo comments as experimental objects. In terms of text cleaning, the system will automatically assemble the corpus in the database and complete the corresponding cleaning work. In terms of sentiment analysis, we try to construct a Chinese word segmentation dictionary using a new idea. In order to make up for the lack of effectiveness of the emotion dictionary in recognizing \"infinitive adjective sentences\", we designed a set of preparatory schemes for emotion mapping, and considered the influence of adverbials in the sentence on emotion expression. Finally, we converted the research results into interactive charts and hosted them on the big data visualization platform.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1532, "end": 1563, "text": "[Chen, Min, Zhang et al.

Unfortunately, concerning some social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, etc., limited access token dates, API data content, and access times can significantly hamper data collection. Crawler techniques using web crawling have no such limitations. Li et al. [Li, Xu, and Pan (2018) ]'s approach is based on Python's selenium to launch the browser, simulate login, analyze the page, and finally get the data from Weibo. Selenium is a great way to deal with the complex login mechanism involved in crawling Weibo data. However, as a suite of tools for automating web browsers, it is not ideal for crawling large amounts of data. Faced with the low data capture rate of a single crawler, Yin et al. [Yin, He and Liu (2018) ] propose an improved distributed scheme. With the good asynchronous capability of Scrapy, this scheme introduces the distributed components of the Scrapy-Redis and Redis database into the Scrapy framework and establishes a more efficient distributed crawler system.

Chen et al. [Chen, Li, Wang et al.

In a specific sentence, the non-emotional part of the aspect related information is weighted, and the problem of polarity detection in the dictionary is effectively improved. To sum up, although the construction of domain dictionaries is relatively mature, there are not many involved in the construction of basic dictionaries, or the scale of the selected basic dictionaries is too small. Due to the different application scenarios, we need to select the appropriate basic emotion dictionary and build a reasonable field emotion dictionary. This research integrates resources such as Tsinghua commendatory and derogatory dictionary, Weibo public opinion dictionary, Dalian University of technology emotion ontology vocabulary, uses SO-PMI mutual information algorithm to build an emotion dictionary related to COVID-19, which applies to the network language environment, and subdivides the emotional particles to analyze seven emotional results.

The experimental results show that the sentiment discrimination model of this system is more sensitive to the positive elements in the sentence. Although we have considered the influence of adverbials in the sentence on the pessimistic tone, the effect is limited. We have not given reliable experiments to prove that the system's decision process is equally effective in other corpus environments. And this model has not considered the emotional impact of the expression package on the comment text. Our future work includes the following 3 aspects. First, we will consider the effect of expression packs on emotional expression. The use of emoticons in online language can greatly enhance the emotional color, but our data mining process artificially removes these factors. Netizens of different ages have different understandings of the same set of emoticons, and we cannot obtain comments through normal channels. The age information of the person. Second, we will continue to expand the Chinese sentiment dictionary of online public opinion related to the spread of the virus. Online language is changing with each passing day, and different online groups each have a set of online slang. Traditional dictionaries cannot recognize these words very accurately. A good dictionary can increase the efficiency of word segmentation and improve the generalization ability, accuracy, and recall rate of the model. Finally, we will optimize the crawler framework, moderately increase the request frequency, and improve the overall crawling efficiency. To ensure that the crawler still has enough information crawling ability when it touches some sensitive information, we even introduced a scheme to disguise anonymous proxy access, but it greatly slowed down the data crawling speed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and our future work"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Constructing
