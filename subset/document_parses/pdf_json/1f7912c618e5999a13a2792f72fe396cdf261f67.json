            "text": "The projection of new biosensing technologies for genetic identification of SARS-COV-2 is essential in the face of a pandemic scenario. For this reason, the current research aims to develop a label-free flexible biodevice applicable to COVID-19. A nanostructured platform made of polypyrrole (PPy) and gold nanoparticles (GNP) was designed for interfacing the electrochemical signal in miniaturized electrodes of tindoped indium oxide (ITO). Oligonucleotide primer was chemically immobilized on the flexible transducers for the biorecognition of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. Methodological protocols based on cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize the nanotechnological apparatus. The biosensor's electrochemical performance was evaluated using the SARS-CoV-2 genome and biological samples of cDNA from patients infected with retrovirus at various disease stages. It is inferred that the analytical tool was able to distinguish the expression of SARS-CoV-2 in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the early, intermediate and late stages. The biosensor exhibited high selectivity by not recognizing the biological target in samples from patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. The proposed sensor obtained a linear response range estimated from 800 to 4000 copies \u00b5L \u22121 with a regression coefficient of 0.99, and a detection limit of 258.01 copies \u00b5L \u22121 . Therefore, the electrochemical biosensor based on flexible electrode technology represents a promising trend for sensitive molecular analysis of etiologic agent with fast and simple operationalization. In addition to early genetic diagnosis, the biomolecular assay may help to monitor the progression of COVID-19 infection in a novel manner.",

In January 2020, genome sequencing identified a new coronavirus related to a respiratory disease named SARS-CoV-2, a singlestranded positive-sense RNA virus (+ssRNA), enveloped and shaped like a crown, belonging to the \u03b2-coronaviruses genus [1] . An evolutionary analysis concerning 160 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 revealed grouping of three central variants characterized by amino acid changes. Its genome revealed three main conserved target sequences i) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp gene), ii) envelope protein gene (E gene), and iii) nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene). Because of the error rate of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), mutations and frequent recombination are common, thus accelerating the evolution and adaptation to the host processes [2] .",

According to Iqbal et al. , the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 involves membrane fusion or endocytosis mechanism; release of viral genome; translation of viral polymerase protein; RNA replication; subgenomic transcription; translation of viral structural protein; viral structural proteins combination with nucleocapsid; formation of mature virion; and release of mature virion via exocytosis mechanism.

At this point, lymphocyte response is activated, and a plateau phase can be observed. At the last stage, viral titers decline due to the adaptive immune response (after day 8).

In this context, numeric simulations have shown the effectiveness of combined antiinflammatory treatments, antiviral drugs and interferon in reducing the duration of the infection's plateau phase and improving the time of recovery [9] . Despite its long response time and relatively complicated operation, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the current protagonist method for detecting viral RNA. The minimum laboratory response time is foreseen between 2 and 4 h and may extend up to 1 week if the samples need to be sent to public health laboratories designated by health authorities. Of note, the diagnostic evaluation via qRT-PCR needs to be carried out in certified laboratories with expensive equipment and highly trained technicians. Such limitations hinder the fast and simple diagnosis of suspected patients and monitor infected patients.",

In the case of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, the target sequence will hybridize to the primer, thus inducing the transduction of the biorecognition event into a quantifiable change proportional to its concentration. This platform addresses a key element of traditional nucleic-acid detection assays while reducing the overall cost and achieving low detection limits comparable to qRT-PCR-based tests. Using flexible devices, we combine the portability with sensitivity and selectivity of the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at laboratory-level in biological samples.",

Also, a linear part can be visualized at lower frequencies, indicating the diffusional process. In this work, the Randles equivalent circuit was used to adjust the impedance data. Randles equivalent circuit includes the resistance of the electrolytic solution (Rs), R CT , constant phase element (CPE), and Warburg impedance (Z W ). The results obtained from the theoretical simulation with the Randles equivalent circuit were presented in Table S5 . Fig. S5 represents the potentiodynamic scans during the electropolymerization of PPy on flexible ITO substrate. Anodic oxidative polymerization was carried out in a potential range from \u22120.4 to +1.0 V in HCl solution at 0.5 M. The result revealed that the potential for initializing the electropolymerization of pyrrole was above 0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl. Consequently, a well-adhered homogeneous PPy black film was electrodeposited on the electrode surface, causing a significant increase in anode current. The absence of a cathodic peak suggests the occurrence of an irreversible reaction of PPy electropolymerization. Thus, this behavior is associated with the immobilization of bulk anions in the polymeric matrix during doping [15] . Of note, six polymeric cycles were performed to obtain the polymeric matrix with a maximum current response. The decrease in polymer conductivity after six polymerization cycles is related to the increase in the PPy film thickness, which causes a lower diffusion rate [16] . We emphasize that 0.5 M HCl as dopant acid is a suitable medium to synthesize uniform polypyrrole films. Although it exhibits lower cycling stability compared to other electrolytes, the PPy film doped by HCl shows the longest charge-discharge time, highest capacitance and current density compared to other doping ions (eg, sulfates and phosphates) [17] . After the polymeric coating, the modifications of the working electrode were characterized by electrochemical measurements using the electrolytic solution containing 10 mM K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ]/K 3 [Fe (CN) 6 ] in PBS (pH 7.4; 10 mM) (Fig. 3) . The PPy film exhibited a high current density (Ipa = 537.17 \u00b1 2.98 \u00b5A) and a low impedimetric response with an electron transfer resistance of 0.04 \u00b1 0.002 k\u2126. This response is justified by forming the stable PPy film that features high conductivity, high electronic affinity, and a \u03c3-\u03c0 conjugate system that favors charge mobility throughout the molecule structure. Thus, these characteristics contribute significantly to improving the analytical performance and robustness of the biodetection systems. In addition, to access the approximate electroactive area of the electrode, we used the Randles-Sevcik equation [18] .",

The amino group present in Cys can be protonated, showing a positive electrical charge that attracts negatively charged electrolytes, such as [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3-/4-. This process favors the occurrence of oxidation-reduction reactions in regions adjacent to the electrode surface [22] .

Adequate reproducibility was obtained with a relative standard deviation value of 1.31% for the nanostructured sensor system. The reproducibility was determined from the standard deviation's percentage value for three independent sensor systems produced with the same methodological protocol and experimental conditions in a single day. The repeatability was confirmed considering the relative standard deviation of less than 1% for all assays with the SARS-CoV-2 gene employing variable concentrations. To evaluate the repeatability, the analytical response of each sensor was tested at least three times in a single day.

The signal output (R CT ) at the stable stage was measured. The average resistance output of the biosensor was 989 \u2126 with a standard deviation of \u00b1 1.29%. This impedimetric result suggests that the biosensor may exhibit prolonged stability over days.

It is emphasized that nasopharyngeal secretion contains 95% water, 2% mucin, 1% electrolytes, 1% lipids, and 1% of other proteins, such as albumin, immunoglobulins, lysozyme, kallikrein, and lactoferrin [27] .

An inversely proportional correlation between \u2206R CT values and CT values was found (Table S6 ). It is known that the lower the CT value, the greater the number of viral copies present in the clinical sample. In this sense, samples with higher viral expression (lower CT values) exhibited more significant impedimetric signals due to identifying a greater number of SARS-CoV-2 N gene sequences. The data were statistically analysed using kappa coefficient values. All values were significant (p < 0.01) for PCR method and biosensing platform used for SARS-CoV-2 detection in biological samples.

The sensor system exhibited interesting analytical performance parameters: comparable detection and quantification limits, high selectivity, specificity, and signal repeatability. Of note, most electrochemical tests depend on the analytical signal amplification using methylene blue [31] , toluidine blue [32] , acridine orange, and Ru(bpy) 3 2+ [33] . Here, the proposed biosensor is free of markers aiming to reduce the consumption of chemical reagents, analysis time, and, consequently, overall costs of the process. Finally, the flexible electrode technology used in the PPy-GNP-Cys-Primer-BSA biosensor allows more significant functional and design versatility in developing new emergency care tests. Although the clinical applicability of the electrochemical biosensor is promising, it should be noted that the technology is in development stage, being tested with a greater number of samples in accordance with analytical validation guidelines. It is expected to achieve the prototyping of the system to enable the accessibility, portability, and connectivity of the bioanalysis tool.",

The nanostructured platform shows a high reproducibility (variation of 1.31%), a large surface area, and signal transduction capability. The biomolecular recognition was achieved through surface chemistry, allowing for the stable and oriented immobilization of the DNA primer. The bioactivity assays were carried out with synthetic oligonucleotide samples and clinical cDNA samples, requiring reduced volume and without labeling agents. Our electrochemical biosensor showed significant specificity, selectivity, and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 258.01 copies \u00b5L \u22121 and a limit of quantification of 781.84 copies \u00b5L \u22121 . Different electrochemical profiles were obtained for the initial, intermediate, and late stages of the viral infection, showing the innovative performance of the PPy-GNP-Cys-Primer-BSA system. Where, the resistance variation values were significantly correlated with the CT values of the RT-PCR analyses. As a result of this finding, the electrochemical technique can be a viable alternative for SARS-CoV-2 differential diagnosis. Biosensors are alternative technologies for detecting new COVID-19 cases, contact tracing, and implementing treatments. Although the proposed biodetection system has not yet been tested in real nasal swab specimens without any purification and pre-treatment strategy, the results achieved were promising for the progressive development of an emergency care biosensor with scalability, ease of operation, compactness, and low cost.

The surface coverage is related to the number of N gene sequences hybridized with a DNA primer on the sensor surface. The formation of hybrid DNA on the sensor layer increases the degree of surface coverage.
