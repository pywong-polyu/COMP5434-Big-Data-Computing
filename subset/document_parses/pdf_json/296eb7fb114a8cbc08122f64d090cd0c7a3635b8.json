Prolonged immune response is proposed as an underlying mechanism of long COVID, 16 possibly because females, who are at higher risk for long COVID, produce more robust innate and immune responses than males. 29 This may prove advantageous against COVID-19 mortality, but be a double-edged sword if such immune responses increase the vulnerability for long COVID. 30 A recent study found proinflammatory cytokine levels were similar in those who developed long COVID and those who reported full symptom remission four months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the long COVID group had higher interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) and interferon lambda (IFN-\u03bb1) levels eight months post-infection. 31 Further, recovered participants showed naive B and T cells three and eight months post-infection but they were absent at both time-points in the long COVID group, suggesting chronic B and T cell activation.",

Although predominantly marked by new onset chronic debilitating fatigue, ME/CFS is also characterized by impaired memory and concentration, post-exertional malaise, various hypersensitivities to noxious stimuli, and diffuse pain/headaches without any known medical or psychological cause. 34 Studies have revealed a range of both hormonal and neurological abnormalities in ME/CFS patients [reviewed in 35 ] closely paralleling those aforementioned ones stemming from childhood and adolescent trauma. It should be noted that numerous studies suggest the rates of early life trauma in CFS may exceed 50%. [36] [37] [38] One study showed that greater early childhood trauma exposure was positively correlated with increasing levels of core symptoms in ME/CFS, suggesting a proportional relationship and continuum of severity. 39 Severe HPA axis dysregulation can cause chronic brain and spinal cord changes resulting in a state of neural vulnerability known as central sensitization. 40 Characterized by pain hypersensitivity, central sensitization offers a template of chronic risk which interacts poorly with new insults, including, but not limited to, acute illness (such as COVID-19 infection and its associated inflammatory reactions) and psychosocial stressors (such as the known societal and other challenges associated with the pandemic). It should be noted that a large metanalysis comparing various conditions associated with central sensitization found the strongest association between early trauma and ME/CFS, 41 suggesting a phenotypic propensity for early trauma to inform chronic fatigue and other related symptoms. Consistent with previous reports, myalgias, headaches, chest pain, burning sensation, and internal tremors were frequently endorsed long COVID symptoms in our sample, implicating central sensitization in the pathophysiology of the syndrome.
