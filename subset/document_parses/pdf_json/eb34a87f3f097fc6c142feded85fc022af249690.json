Additionally, according to previous studies, the state of immersion in natural environments is found to induce sophisticated psychophysiological changes. These findings underline the advantage of physical interaction with nature [12, 13] . However, the above positive effects were obtained in highly natural environments, such as forests and lakes, and whether a visit to an urban greenspace can elicit similar health benefits is still unclear [12, 13] .",

Urban dwellers only need to go out of their homes to have physical contact with nature. However, unlike forests or urban parks, residential greenspaces are usually incomplete natural environments with smaller areas and higher levels of air pollution and noise. According to previous reports, residential greenspace may buffer the negative effects of urban stressors, but there still remains controversy about the health benefits of residential greenspace exposure, and its function of relieving pain is yet to be investigated [17] [18] [19] [20] . Therefore, we designed this research to evaluate whether a physical visit and image viewing of a residential greenspace can affect pain perception during experimental pain stimulation, and further checked the differences between them in relieving pain and related psychophysiological responses.",

Due to the characteristics of environmental interventions, blinding is hard to carry out for participants [46] . Besides, owing to environmental education and propaganda, the role of nature in health boosting is underlined in public awareness, which may result in a placebo effect in painful conditions [47, 48] . Therefore, we interviewed those with personal opinions, and found that up to 50% of participants thought that the greenspace relieved their pain, which implies a potential placebo effect. Although the placebo effect is deemed as a part of nature-based interventions [49] , we still checked the results of participants who were not aware of pain relief provided by nature and tried to identify additional effects. As a result, we found that, though the difference in pain intensity became non-significant, the level of pain tolerance was still significantly higher in greenspace, which indicates that greenspace exposure may be more than a placebo. According to Kline [50] , the pain relief of greenspace exposure could result from the fact that the natural stimulus may distract the attention from pain perception. In addition, Stanhope, et al. [14] proposed other potential reasons for pain relief in a short-term greenspace exposure. For instance, phytoncides may influence the human immune system, enhance natural killer cells' activity and treat some types of pain [51, 52] .",

According to the relevant studies, the subtle effects of image viewing may be related to the following factors. First, conventional two-dimensional static media may not be able to duplicate a visual experience of real nature, thus may fail to deliver environmental effects. Second, the benefits of displayed nature may be regulated by the media adopted, and dynamic videos may be better than static pictures in pain relief [6] . Third, the environmental effects are likely to be affected by subjective preference [55, 57] . Meidenbauer, et al. [58] argued that the emotional benefits of nature exposure were regulated by subjective preference, which was associated with aesthetic experience. In the current study, the negative association between scenic beauty and negative emotions (stress and anxiety) somewhat supported the above theory. However, due to the display equipment and photography, the image of greenspace was poorly evaluated by the participants, which may be a reason for the subtle effects. In general, our findings suggest that, in addition to the known positive roles of urban parks in nature exposure, residential greenspace may also provide beneficial health resources for urban dwellers, and physical visits are encouraged to maximize these benefits [10, 59] . Hence, more stay-in facilities are recommended in the urban greening of neighborhood areas. On the other hand, though the image of greenspace was not effective in the current study, future studies may consider more attractive images of nature, and resort to advanced media technologies to explore solutions using simulated nature exposure for healthcare.",
