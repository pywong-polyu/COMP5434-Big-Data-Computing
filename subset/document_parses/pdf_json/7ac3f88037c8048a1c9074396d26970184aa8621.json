            "text": "Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease has spread rapidly worldwide, and the outbreak of the disease was designated a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Such outbreaks would certainly be catastrophic for some of the best-ranked health systems and would be more catastrophic in countries with more fragile health systems. Accordingly, the World Health Organization and other organizations have been appealing to donor countries to support a rapid response plan. The primary objectives of this response plan are to appeal for funds from donors and to distribute these funds to the most affected countries based on the requirements. Methods: In this study, we developed a mathematical model to provide initial insights into the efficient and equitable distribution of urgent funds to high-priority countries. Three phases were proposed for the construction of this mathematical model. In the first phase, the final epidemic sizes in all the target countries were predicted by using three epidemiological models. In the second phase, the urgent requirements for each country were estimated in parallel with the estimates issued by the humanitarian response plan, based on the size of the epidemic and several other factors. In the third and final phase, a multi-objective optimization model was proposed. The first objective was to maximize the funds from donors to cover all the requirements. The second objective was to minimize the unmet demands by ensuring a fair distribution of the urgent funds based on the requirements of the target countries. Results: Predictions of the basic reproduction numbers and the final epidemic sizes were calculated for all target countries. The urgent requirements were estimated, and the requirements issued by the humanitarian response plan for all target countries were also considered. Moreover, a proposed response plan for the distribution network was demonstrated. Donors must provide urgent funds exceeding US$ 2,608,084,209 to cover at least 40 % of each target country's requirements. Overall, results demonstrate the importance of an urgent and fair distribution of funds to the target countries to overcome the outbreak of COVID-19. Conclusions: Rapid responses by donor countries to humanitarian appeals will facilitate the immediate and fair distribution of relief supplies to the poorest countries. This distribution may help to support health systems, restrain the spread of COVID-19, and prevent an unlimited catastrophe.",

In such areas, few central public health laboratories are able to perform COVID-19 diagnostic tests, and this limited capacity leads to delays in the treatment and isolation of patients. The situation is further complicated by a shortage of healthcare workers and a lack of available personal protective equipment to protect them from infection, as well as the unavailability of ventilators, medicines, beds, and basic necessities such as electricity and water. All of these challenges are expected to lead to very high infection rates relative to those in other countries, as well as very high basic reproductive numbers (R0). Additionally, it is difficult to adhere to health sector instructions and to avoid breaking local curfews. The majority of people live on daily wages basis, and classical social systems cannot respond to such challenges. Furthermore, traditional cultural and social practices such as handshaking and hugging, community gatherings in worship spaces, low levels of health literacy and COVID-19 awareness, the paucity of masks and effective handwashing, multi-generational housing, and high population densities increase these challenges. Substandard technological infrastructure also poses challenges to delivery systems and the ability to work at home or remotely.",

Three of these countries, Colombia, Ukraine, and Venezuela, were excluded because they have a good gross domestic product (GDP), high rankings on Human Development Index (HDI), and LEGA-TUM Prosperity Index (LPI) indicators. Thus, we selected the poorest and most war-torn nations with the most affected and vulnerable population groups and those with ongoing humanitarian response plans as the high-priority countries. Table 1 lists these high-priority countries with related information, including population count, population density, GDP, health system rank [4] , poverty rate, HDI rank [5] , LPI rank, and LPI in the health sector ranking [6] . Table 1 reports some factors and indexes that elicited interest in the global ranking sectors. Population density is an important factor for the spread of COVID-19. An inverse proportionality between population density and physical distance has been identified, which affects the increased or decreased spread of the virus.",

These authors used a SEIR model to construct a virtual community and measured the cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in two scenarios. The results identified additional costs associated with averting isolation and quarantine. They estimated a median medical cost of US$ 6500 per COVID-19 case. The authors considered the average hospitalization cost for each SARS patient in China and Canada. In Guangzhou, China, the total direct and indirect medical cost per SARS patient was US$ 2900 (Du et al. 2007 ) [41] , and the average hospital stay was 17 days.

Therefore, it is difficult to impose curfews. Most people cannot provide sanitation and protection for themselves and their dependents. In most of these countries, it is difficult to find water to drink or use for personal hygiene. Therefore, the estimation of the requirements that must be satisfied is intertwined with other sectors. Although the GHRP issued estimates of the requirements of priority countries, we aimed to estimate the urgent costs that would cover only the direct expenditures related to fighting COVID-19, regardless of the infrastructure costs, the basic operational costs, or the interactions of the health sector with other sectors. The populations were divided into three categories, namely, infected people (i.e., confirmed cases demonstrated by laboratory testing to be infected with the virus, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms according to WHO), susceptible people (i.e., those who are potentially infected and must be quarantined in the epicenters), and the poorest members of the population, who require support with sterilizers, masks, hygiene, and cleaning tools.",

Constraint (21) ensures that the donor countries cannot send more than the maximum funds from donor country i. Constraint (22) guarantees that the funds sent from donor i are greater than or equal to the funding available from the same donor i. Constraint (23) reflects that humanitarian organization j received funds from the donor countries that were equal to or exceeded the requirements. Constraint (24) dictates that the humanitarian organization j sends the same funds received from the donor countries. Constraint (25) ensures that humanitarian organization j cannot send funds exceeding the available funds. Constraint (26) dictates that the funds received must satisfy the demand of each target country k. We considered that if the funds are available, the remaining material, medical, and other requirements would be provided. Constraint (27) represents the equity constraint, which refers to fairness in the distribution of funds among the target countries. In other words, constraint (27) enforces the requirement to satisfy a percentage of the total demand for funds in the recipient countries. Constraint (28) indicates the non-negative distribution of funds from the donor country i to the humanitarian organization j, and the subsequent donation of funds from the humanitarian organization j to the recipient countries.",

Additionally, most governments have hidden the scale of the disaster for political and other reasons. Therefore, the actual number of the affected people is much larger than the reported number. The big difference between our estimates and the GHRP estimates was in some countries. Our estimates were significantly higher than the GHRP's estimates in Iraq, Myanmar, and Nigeria, while the GHRP's estimates were significantly higher than our estimates in countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, and South Sudan. This difference may be due to several considerations, the most important of which are the size of the epidemic, populations, and other factors. As for the rest of the countries, there are slight differences, and in general, our total estimates were slightly less than the total of the GHRP's estimates.

The mathematical model is implemented using LINGO 14. Furthermore, the prioritization weights were determined based on some criteria, where the current funding of the humanitarian organizations in [1] [2] [3] were standardized to determining the prioritization weights w ij , \u2200j. The HDI ranks [5] in Table 1 were standardized for determining prioritization weights u jk , \u2200k. Table 6 presents the numerical results corresponding to the solutions x ij , which represent the decisions to send funds from the donors willing to fight COVID-19 via the GHRP to the humanitarian originations. Regardless of the requirements of other countries for funding to fight COVID-19, US$ 2,833,839,760 must be sent from the donors to the target countries through humanitarian organizations to cover 67.6% of the total requirements. USA sent the largest amount of funding, US$ 637,497,360. WHO received the largest amount of funding at US$ 453,405,800. Table 7 lists the amounts of funding that should be distributed from the humanitarian originations to the high-priority target countries. The minimum funds sent to the target countries covered at least 62.3% of their total requirements, according to the GHRP estimates. Palestine and Libya have the lowest equity rate 44%, while Cameroon has the highest equity rate at 196% according to our estimates. Sudan and Somalia have the lowest equity rate 37% and 38%, while Cameroon also has the highest equity rate at 149% based on the GHRP's estimates.",

Therefore, it gives the governments and the humanitarian organizations a glance overview of the optimal and fair distribution of aid funds, as well as the unmet demands of countries.

However, poorer countries cannot face this pandemic alone and are in a dire need of support and assistance. The GHRP identifies the priority countries as targets for support. This work was designed to predict the scale of the pandemic in high-priority countries using SIR, logistic, and generalized SEIR models. Next, the urgent requirements of the target countries were estimated based on several factors. Subsequently, a multi-objective optimization model was proposed to maximize the funds received from the donors and humanitarian organizations and to minimize the unmet demands of the target countries. This model achieved a minimum ratio of equitable distribution among the high-priority target countries. Moreover, this paper suggested a response plan that would guarantee the fair and efficient distribution of funds among the high-priority target countries. In future studies, the proposed model can be extended to include new objectives or can be applied to other situations. Furthermore, to increase the similarity of the model to real-world scenarios, some parameters, such as the final epidemic size and demand, can be considered uncertain. A stochastic or robust model might be valuable in this case. Moreover, the authors [61] applied the Multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to determine the priority groups for the COVID-19 vaccine. Hence, we can consider the MCDM approach to determine the priority of the countries for urgent support.",
