The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and examine the factors associated with the acceptance in Bangladesh. In between January 30 to February 6, 2021, we conducted a web-based anonymous cross-sectional survey among the Bangladeshi general population. At the start of the survey, there was a detailed consent section that explained the study's intent, the types of questions we would ask, the anonymity of the study, and the study's voluntary nature. The survey only continued when a respondent consented, and the answers were provided by the respondents themselves. The multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 605 eligible respondents took part in this survey (population size 1630046161 and required sample size 591) with an age range of 18 to 100. A large proportion of the respondents are aged less than 50 (82%) and male (62.15%). The majority of the respondents live in urban areas (60.83%). A total of 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted group, only 35.14% showed the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the vaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccine's efficacy and safety or COVID-19 becomes deadlier in Bangladesh. The regression results showed age, gender, location (urban/rural), level of education, income, perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 in the future, perceived severity of infection, having previous vaccination experience after age 18, having higher knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccination were significantly associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. The research reported a high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Bangladesh. To diminish the vaccine hesitancy and increase the uptake, the policymakers need to design a well-researched immunization strategy to remove the vaccination barriers.

Scholars of vaccine hesitancy and adoption are warning policymakers and the scientific community that a successful vaccine is only the beginning. Based on previous experiences with pandemic vaccines and vaccine hesitancy more broadly, a wellresearched strategy for rollout and adoption might be required in every country [6] . Most current disease outbreak experience-the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, witnessed poor immunization amongst adults, one study showing that 26 percent of refusers were worried about safety and 17 percent did not believe in the vaccine [7] . A recent study conducted in the USA revealed that approximately 68% of all respondents are willing to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 with concerns about side effects and efficacy [8] . In a comprehensive survey of 19 nations conducted in June 2020, 72% of participants suggested they were either likely or very likely to take a vaccine, ranging from 89% in China to only 55% in Russia [9] .",

            "text": "The question arises, \"Why are people unwilling to get vaccinated against a devastating disease?\". There is a plethora of research on the factors that influence vaccine uptake. Prior studies on seasonal and H1N1 influenza vaccinations have shown that vaccine attitudes and beliefs are linked to vaccination intentions, which are a good predictor of vaccination uptake [10, 11] . According to one UK-based study, higher vaccination intentions were linked to the belief that the COVID-19 disease would last a lot longer, while lower vaccination intentions were linked to the belief that the dangers of COVID-19 had been inflated by the media [12] . Another study examined the links between vaccine intention and sociodemographic characteristics, concluding that lower vaccination intention was connected to younger age and Black and minority ethnicity [13] . However, the factors affecting vaccine intention and uptake might vary substantially by territory, culture, and socioeconomic conditions. In Bangladesh, from the very beginning of the pandemic, a substantial amount of unawareness, rumors, and misinformation among general people about COVID-19 have been reported [14] . It is also expected that there might be considerable misinformation and hesitancy in taking COVID-19 vaccines. Bangladesh govt. has revised its plan to inoculate 3.5 million instead of 6 million in February 2021 due to lukewarm response to online registration for COVID-19 vaccination [15] . It also relaxed the age limit to 40 years from previously stated 55 years for general people. This points to the unwillingness of the people of Bangladesh about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Bangladesh govt. has ordered and paid for at least 30 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that will be delivered in installments across 2021 and also will receive another 68 million shots under the Covax initiative [16] , led by the World Health Organization and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance [15] .",

The percentage of yes, no and don't (Fig 3) . Attitudes and beliefs towards vaccination, perceived barriers, and perceived risks were also inspected in Table 2 . A large proportion of respondents (74.71%) agreed with the statement \"vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control a disease\" while 15.54% disagreed and 9.75% were neutral. A small proportion of 10.91% agreed with the statement \"Young (less than 30) and children do not need any vaccination against COVID 19\" while 54.55% disagreed and 34.55% were neutral. A large proportion (39.01%) of respondents were neutral with the statement \"The COVID-19 vaccines that are being inoculated worldwide are not effective and safe\" while 37.85% agreed and 23.14% disagreed. A lower portion (28.10%) of the respondents reported that it would not be hard to find a provider or clinic that could give him/her the 23.47% of respondents indicated that they would experience highly severe COVID-19 symptoms, 36.36%, and 40.17% indicated medium and low, respectively. The results from multivariate logistic regressions are shown in Table 3 . Parameter estimates of the multivariate logistic regression indicate the odds of occurring the event into the concerned categories of the predictor variable compared to the odds of occurring the event into the reference category of the same predictor variable. Here, the odds of accepting the vaccine is defined as the ratio of the probability of accepting the vaccine and the probability of rejecting the vaccine [25]. The model was based on 605 cases with complete data and showed an association between willingness to be vaccinated (yes/no) and predictor variables. Another model was based on 370 cases (vaccine accepted group) that explored the association between willingness to immediate vaccination and predictor variables. The potential predictors were trained in the model if they showed significant association (at a 10% level of significance) with the corresponding response variable in Table 4 . The findings indicate that the odds of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among female respondents is 62% lower than the male respondents. The respondents aged 30 to 50 and 51 to 70 had a 6.79 and 7.89 times higher (respectively) chance to accept the COVID-19 vaccine compared to respondents aged 18 to 29. The odds of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine among respondents who live in rural areas is 81% lower in comparison with the respondents who live in urban areas. The participants who have a university degree and who are hon's (undergrad) running students had 21.38 times higher odds of taking the COVID-19 vaccine compared to the participants who had a lower educational qualification (HSC/Alim/Vocational education/Nursing or less). Respondents with income 30.000 to 39,999 showed 4.35 times higher odds, income 40,000-49,999 had 8.95 times higher odds, income 50,000-74,999 displayed 8.44 times higher odds, and income 75,000 or over had 6.31 times higher odds to accept the COVID19 vaccine compared to respondents with income less than 30,000. Respondents with previous vaccination experience after the age of 18 years had 4.79 times higher odds compared to respondents who do not have any vaccination after age 18 years. People who disagreed with the statement \"the vaccines that are being inoculated worldwide are effective and safe\" had a 90% lower likelihood to accept the COVID-19 vaccine relative to those who agreed with it. Participants who believe they have a medium and a high chance to be infected with COVID-19 in the future showed respectively 3.19 times and 8.68 times higher The odds of accepting vaccines immediately was 47% lower among female respondents than male. The odds of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine immediately was 2.03 times higher among rural respondents compared to urban respondents. Hindu participants displayed 3.79 times higher odds of taking the COVID-19 vaccine immediately compared to Muslim participants. The odds of taking the COVID-19 vaccine immediately was 84% lower for the respondents who heard about any vaccine (s) that have been approved globally for mass inoculation compare to respondents who did not hear about any vaccine (s) that have been approved globally for mass inoculation. Married people had almost 2 times higher odds of being vaccinated immediately compared to unmarried people. Participants who disagreed with the statement \"the vaccines that are being inoculated worldwide are effective and safe\" had a 68% lower likelihood to accept the COVID-19 vaccine immediately compared to those who agreed with it. . The findings of this study showed that a large proportion of respondents wanted to get vaccinated and the acceptance rate nearly touched the threshold to achieve herd immunity (60%). However, the majority of them would delay their vaccination due to uncertainty of the safety and efficacy of the newly developed vaccine. We also found COVID-19 vaccine acceptability has a statistically significant correlation with socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, higher educational qualification, employment status. These findings are consistent with other researches conducted in the recent times in different countries. Determining the factors of acceptability of vaccine or immediate vaccination are complex and context-specific and the factors vary with time, place, and type of vaccines [30, 31] . In this study, the vaccine acceptability was higher among males, older, and highly educated people. Higher acceptability was also found among people who live in urban areas and have higher incomes. The sociodemographic factors were also found as significant factors for pandemic vaccine acceptability in the UK, France, Australia, the US, and Japan [21, 22, [32] [33] [34] . In Saudi Arabia, only age and marital status were found as significant factors in determining the willingness of accepting the COVID-19 vaccines [31] . We found that one of the strong correlates of vaccine acceptability was previous vaccination experience in adulthood. People who think they are at a higher risk of being infected with COVID -19, who believe that COVID-19 might be highly severe for them, and good knowledge about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination were also found to be significantly linked with vaccine acceptability. The previous vaccination, vaccination beliefs, and attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination were also found as significant determinants in Italy, UK, China [21, 23, 35, 36] . Higher knowledge about COVID-19 symptoms, transmission routes, and prevention and control measures against COVID-19 were found associated with the willingness of accepting COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Greece [37] .",

Gender, religion, region, and marital status were found to be associated with immediate vaccination. People who live in rural areas and males were more likely to be vaccinated immediately. The previous vaccination experience after the age of 18 was significantly associated with vaccine acceptance, though, it was not a significant factor for immediate vaccination which conflicts with other studies in different countries [7, 32, 33] . Employment status and knowledge about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination were not significant in immediate vaccination decision-making among the Bangladeshi people.",

To increase vaccine acceptability among rural people, baseless rumors and myths (especially on social media) against the COVID-19 vaccines must be checked and they should be reached out with scientific facts describing the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. To inspire females to get vaccinated, specialist doctors' opinions can be spread through social media, television, radio, and print media. General people and celebrities who have already taken the vaccine should share their experience (of no, mild, or severe side-effects) on social media and other mass media. Topics on infectious diseases, their preventive measures, and vaccination should be included in the textbooks to better prepare for future pandemics.",

Our study divided participants based on the acceptance levels (immediate or delayed acceptance or refusal to accept) and provides associated factors that influence the vaccine acceptability and immediate vaccination. This study sheds light on the current scenarios of public attitudes and willingness regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the findings, policymakers can identify the most priority groups (older than 70, rural, and women) or communities that need special attention in COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Since a higher vaccination rate is the key factor to achieve herd immunity, mass people must be inspired to get vaccinated [40] . This research will help the policymakers make an effective vaccination strategy for a greater uptake rate of vaccines in a bid to control the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Almost half (51.40%) of respondents provided a positive answer with the question \"Is COVID-19 deadlier for elderly people (60+ years)\" and 84.63% of respondents provided the correct answer to the question \"Do only elderly and sick people die of COVID-19?\". Very few (30.51%) of the participants thought that COVID-19 is a normal disease like cold/cough and fever.
