The key nodes with a degree greater than 30 were extracted from the network, containing 154 genes. These 154 key genes shared 23 genes with differentially expressed genes, which serve as potential diagnostic markers for breast cancer. The 23 genes were used as features to construct the SVM classification model, and the model had good predictive ability in both the training dataset and the validation dataset (AUC 0.960 and 0.907, respectively).",

The occurrence and development of breast cancer is a process involving and synergistic action of multiple genes in multiple stages (Kretschmer et al., 2011) . Therefore, the differential change of gene expression profile has always been a hot topic in breast cancer research (Manjili et al., 2012) . At present, some studies have screened differentially expressed genes in breast cancer patients. Studies have shown that Grb14 is highly expressed in 23.1% of breast cancers, and this high expression is associated with better overall and disease-free survival, and can be used as a better independent prognostic factor (Huang et al., 2013) . In adipose tissue of mammary gland, the overexpression of leptin can promote cell proliferation and cancer (Jard\u00e9 et al., 2011) .

It contains clinical data on a variety of human cancers, genomic mutations, mRNA expression, miRNA expression, methylation, and other data, which is a very important source of information for cancer researchers (Tang et al., 2018; Tian and Wang, 2021; Zhu et al., 2021) .

This suggests that the genes we screened are indeed associated with breast cancer. Pathways and Biological Functions Differentially Expressed Genes Involved DAVID bioinformatics tool was employed to complete the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. From the result of enrichment, we can see that the differentially expressed genes are involved in a number of cancer-related biological functions, such as cellular protein metabolic process, negative regulation of gene expression, epigenetic, response to drug, cell development, transcriptional activator activity, RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory region sequence-specific binding et al.

Then a network is constructed by integrating the real gene interaction information from the KEGG pathways. The network contains 1277 nodes and 7345 edges, and the size of the nodes is represented by the degree (Figure 3A) . Of the 1277 nodes (genes), 175 were differentially expressed genes (a total of 1060) previously screened between breast cancer and normal control samples, and the remaining 1102 genes were obtained by pathway enrichment analysis. If the key genes (nodes with large degree) are removed, the stability of the KEGG pathway gene interaction network will be seriously threatened, and the network topology will be lax. Therefore, although the nodes with large degree only account for a small part of the nodes in the network, which conforms to the power law distribution of the degree distribution of the biomolecular network ( Figure 3B ), they are essential key nodes. The nodes with large degree in the network are called Hub nodes. These nodes are generally the key nodes in the network, because their changes may affect more genes that interact with them. We tend to select the top 10% nodes in the network as Hub nodes. However, under this threshold, there are many nodes with the same degree and their degree is 38. Therefore, in order to ensure less omission of breast cancer diagnostic markers, we select nodes with a degree greater than 30 on the basis of this threshold. So, we filtered the degree attribute according to the attribute table exported after topology analysis and set the filter condition as degree >30, 154 genes, known as Hub genes, were identified as candidate genes potentially associated with breast cancer.",

For example, THE TT genotype of CYP3A4 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of breast cancer (Liu et al., 2019) . RXRG protein is an independent predictor of breast cancer specific survival and distant metastasis-free survival (Joseph et al., 2019) . ADH1A has been found to be a potential biomarker for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of breast cancer (Wu and Yu, 2021) . It is worth noting that the remaining genes, such as GNGT1 and UGT1A7, have not been documented to be associated with breast cancer. However, the literature has linked these genes to other cancers.

Therefore, to explore the characteristic changes of breast cancer from the level of genes and the discovery of biomarkers of breast cancer diagnose will play an important role in guiding the treatment of breast cancer. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have made it easier for researchers to understand how diseases occur and develop at the genome-wide level. RNA-Seq refers to transcriptome sequencing technology, which is a highthroughput sequencing technology to reflect the expression level of mRNA, small RNA and noncoding RNA or some of them by determining their sequences with high-throughput sequencing technology. TCGA is an open and free database resource that integrates multiple cancer data types. A large sample size of RNA-Seq data for breast cancer can be obtained. In this study, the Level 3 gene expression data of RNA-SeqV2 in 1104 breast cancer tumor samples and 110 normal control samples adjacent to cancer were downloaded from the TCGA database, and the genetic characteristics of breast cancer were analyzed at the whole genome level using these data.

Through the enrichment analysis of GO function, it was found that these genes were mainly enriched in biological processes such as cellular protein metabolic process, negative regulation of gene expression, epigenetic, response to drug, cell development, transcriptional activator activity, RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory region sequence-specific binding et al. In addition, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of these genes showed that they were significantly enriched in 28 pathways such as Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Chemical carcinogenesis, Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome, Drug metabolism -cytochrome P450, Transcriptional misregulation in cancer, cAMP signaling pathway et al. By integrating the interaction information of genes in these pathways, a KEGG pathway network was constructed, and the hub nodes in the network were extracted, and 154 candidate genes potentially related to breast cancer were obtained. By integrating with the list of differentially expressed genes, 23 potential diagnostic markers of breast cancer were finally obtained. Some of these genes have been shown to play important roles in the development of breast cancer, which confirms the reliability of the results of this study. However, the remaining genes have not been studied in relation to the risk of breast cancer.
