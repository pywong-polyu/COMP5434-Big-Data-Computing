Coronavirus 2019 has shown how fragile our global preparedness for infectious diseases is. The world is a small-connected globe with short travel time between its remote parts. COVID-19 has spread globally and swiftly with major impacts on health, economy, and quality of life of communities. At this point in the time, April 9, 2020, >1,500,000 patients have been infected and >88,000 patients have died worldwide within the last 3 months. The status is evolving and the costly lessons learned over time are increasing. These lessons are global as this virus is. They involve different domains of health sciences including virology, public health, clinical, critical care, and disaster management. This review addresses our current knowledge of COVID-19 pandemic from the basic virology and transmission, through prevention, infection control, clinical management, and finally disaster management including the recovery period. This review has a multidisciplinary approach, which is needed at this time. After this difficult period passes, we have to carry the lessons we learned for the future so that we can be better prepared. One thing that has clearly emerged from this ongoing crisis is that infectious diseases have no borders and we have to work together, using the one world, one health approach, if we are to minimize the enormous impact such pandemics can cause.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Thus, if emerging and re-emerging viral infections are a common occurrence, why do we feel so threatened when a new viral disease emerges?

[10, 11] The main mode of transmission of CoV is via respiratory droplets or by direct/indirect contact with contaminated secretions [ Table 1 ]. The virus particles can remain infectious on inanimate objects from hours to several days. [12] Like other CoV, the primary cellular target of COVID-19 virus is cells of the respiratory tract. Infection is mediated by the binding of the viral envelop spike protein with the cell surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. [9] Interestingly, this is the same receptor that SARS-CoV uses for its entry into its target cells. Although SARS-CoV-2 is of animal origin, the virus has clearly adapted to its new human host. A recent study analyzing the viral genome of over 100 cases indicated that the virus has mutated from the original S to the new L stain. [13] The later strain was suggested to be more aggressive. Although this report has yet to be verified, it is not surprising, since RNA viruses tend to be less stable and typically have a much higher mutation rate compared to DNA viruses.

The infection can be transmitted during an incubation period in which the symptoms can be short and nonspecific including fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing.

This virus can spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. [14] A fecal-oral transmission was suggested in children having COVID-19 in whom RT-PCR rectal swabs were positive after having negative RT-PCR results of the nasopharyngeal swabs indicating gastrointestinal tract viral shedding. [20] Because there is no cure for the COVID-19, and a vaccine has not yet been developed, supportive care and prevention of complications are the main pillars of current management. Therefore, emphasis should be on control and prevention of the disease spread within the community, especially for those who are most vulnerable. Members of a community should limit exposure by avoiding large public gatherings and close contacts. Furthermore, they should practice good hygiene by washing their hands for a minimum of 20 s, covering their mouth and nose when sneezing and coughing, and disinfecting surface areas. Those who are at high risk (with comorbidities or immune suppression) are advised to isolate themselves at home. [18] Health-care providers should strictly follow the infection control measures in their health-care settings. They should regularly and properly wash their hands when moving between patients and should use proper personal protective equipment (PPE) when managing infected patients. Furthermore, early laboratory confirmation of infected cases, their isolation and quarantine, and contact tracing is pivotal for infection control. The public health professional's role is to identify close contact of symptomatic patient as early as possible for isolation and treatment as well as prompt referral to health-care facilities for laboratory proper diagnostic tests.

[34] The two main radiological signs in COVID-19 include the ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidations.

GGO is an area of increased attenuation with hazy margin and does not affect the vascular or bronchial margin [ Figure 2 ]. Consolidation which is an area of opacification can be within the GGO, can surround the GCO (reversed halo sign), or can be alone [ Figure 3 ]. Han et al.
