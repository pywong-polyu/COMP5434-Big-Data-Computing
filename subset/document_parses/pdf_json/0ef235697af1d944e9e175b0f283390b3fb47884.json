            "text": "Pathogen adaptation to public health interventions, such as vaccination, may take tortuous routes and involve multiple mutations at distinct locations in the pathogen genome, acting on distinct phenotypic traits. Despite its importance for public health, how these multilocus adaptations jointly evolve is poorly understood. Here we consider the joint evolution of two adaptations: the pathogen's ability to escape the vaccineinduced immune response and adjustments to the pathogen's virulence and transmissibility. We elucidate the role played by epistasis and recombination, with an emphasis on the different protective effects of vaccination. We show that vaccines reducing transmission and/or increasing clearance generate positive epistasis between the vaccine-escape and virulence alleles, favouring strains that carry both mutations, whereas vaccines reducing virulence mortality generate negative epistasis, favouring strains that carry either mutation, but not both. High rates of recombination can affect these predictions. If epistasis is positive, frequent recombination can lead to the sequential fixation of the two mutations and prevent the transient build-up of more virulent escape strains. If epistasis is negative, frequent recombination between loci can create an evolutionary bistability, such that whichever adaptation is more accessible tends to be favoured in the long-term. Our work provides a timely alternative to the variant-centered perspective on pathogen adaptation and captures the effect of different types of vaccines on the interference between multiple adaptive mutations.",

            "text": "Per-capita growth rate of strain ij: In panel a, we highlight how each of the possible vaccine protections affect the epidemiological dynamics. In particular, vaccines may: reduce the risk of infection (\u03c1 1 ), reduce within-host pathogen growth (\u03c1 2 ), reduce infectiousness (\u03c1 3 ), reduce virulence (\u03c1 4 ), and/or hasten infection clearance (\u03c1 5 ). In panel b, we highlight the two-locus, diallelic evolutionary model. Each locus undergoes mutation (\u00b5 V , \u00b5 E ), while recombination occurs between loci (\u03c3I T ). Selection occurs through the additive selection coefficients (s E , s V ), and epistasis (s EV ); each of these is defined in terms of the per-capita growth rates of the different strains, r ij [42, 50]. In turn, the per-capita growth rates, r ij , depend upon the epidemiological model (and so are not constant), and are the average growth rate of strain ij across the two selective environments, vaccinated and unvaccinated hosts. Note that \u03b4 Ei is the Kronecker delta, and is equal to one if E = i and zero otherwise. If both vaccine-escape and virulence are advantageous (s E > 0 and s V > 0), but epistasis is negative (s EV < 0), alleles E and V are in competition. Starting from the strain N A equilibrium (solid black circle), strains N V and EA will increase in frequency, producing negative LD until the population is in the vicinity of the curve, \u0393(f E ) (dashed black curve; see Sup. Info. S1.6). Along \u0393(f E ), strains EA and N V are in direct competition, and so whichever allele (E or V ) has the larger selection coefficient will go to fixation (panel a, \u03c3 = 0); blue curves correspond to fixation of strain EA, red curves to fixation of strain N V . Recombination can create an evolutionary bistability such that 'faster' growing strains tend to reach fixation, even if they are competitively inferior (panel b, \u03c3 = 0.05); here the colours indicate which strain would fix in the absence of recombination. Each simulation starts with a monomorphic pathogen population (only the N A genotype is present initially) at it's endemic equilibrium following vaccination; mutation introduces genetic variation and allows pathogen adaptation to vaccination.

Hence, each simulation start with a monomorphic pathogen population (only the N A genotype is present initially) and mutation introduces genetic variation and allows pathogen adaptation to vaccination.

Panels a, c are when epistasis is positive, while panels b, d are when epistasis is negative. In panels a, b, double-mutations are not possible (e.g., strain N A cannot mutate to strain EV and vice-versa), whereas in panels a, d double mutations occur at the same per-capita rate as single mutations. If epistasis is positive (panel d), this leads to a substantial, transient build-up of LD, whereas if epistasis is negative (panel c), this has negligible effect. Each panel shows 100 simulations starting from a monomorphic pathogen population (only the N A genotype is present initially) at it's endemic equilibrium following vaccination; mutation introduces genetic variation and allows pathogen adaptation to vaccination.

            "text": "on the genetic background N is a weighted average across two environments: unvaccinated 122 and vaccinated hosts; the weights are the fraction of infections of a given strain that are found 123 in either environment (Fig. 1b; Sup. Info. S1.4). However, depending upon how much allele 124 V increases transmissibility relative to increasing virulence (as compared to allele A), on 125 the genetic background N allele V can be unconditionally favoured even in an unvaccinated 126 population, or unconditionally disfavoured even in an entirely vaccinated population. As Negative epistasis and evolutionary bistability 199 What are the dynamical implications of the sign of epistasis? First, suppose the vaccine 200 protections produce negative epistasis (i.e., vaccines reduce virulence mortality, \u03c1 2 , \u03c1 4 ; Fig. 201 2a), and there is directional selection favouring alleles E and V (s E > 0, s V > 0) at the strain 202 N A endemic equilibrium. In this circumstance, strains EA and N V will initially increase, 203 at a rate dictated by the strength of selection for allele E and V , respectively. As negative 204 epistasis disfavours strain EV , the increase in strains EA and N V will cause an increase 205 in negative LD until alleles E and V are sufficiently abundant such that f E + f V \u2248 1. At 206 this point, and assuming mutations and recombination are sufficiently infrequent, dt\u2248 (s E \u2212 s V )f E (1 \u2212 f E ).(4) From (4), epistasis no longer directly impacts the dynamics of allele frequencies. Instead 209 whichever of alleles E or V is more strongly selected for (larger selection coefficient) will 210 increase in frequency at the expense of the other; that is, strains EA and N V are in direct 211 competition with each other. This competition will cause the population to evolve along 212 the curve in(f E , f V , D)-space such that f V = 1 \u2212 f E and D = \u2212f E (1 \u2212 f E ) (denoted \u0393(f E ) 213 inFig. 3) according to equation(4), until either strain EA or strain N V outcompetes the 214 other(Fig. 3).215Recombination affects these dynamics: by removing LD from the population, recombi-216 nation prevents LD from increasing in magnitude [46, 47]. Consequently, the combination of 217 strain competition and recombination mean that it no longer need be true that the 'fitter' 218 strain ultimately reaches fixation if doing so requires the population to first pass through an 219 intermediate state with a large amount of LD. As such, recombination can create a bista-220 bility between the N V -and EA-strain equilibria (Fig. 3b); in fact, in the limiting case 221 of quasi-linkage equilibrium [51-53], recombination greatly increases the likelihood that the 222 N V -and EA-equilibria are simultaneously locally stable attractors (Sup.

Specifically, if one allele (either E or V ) is more muta-225 tionally accessible, or is associated with more rapid growth from the strain N A equilibrium 226 (i.e., has a larger selection coefficient), even if this allele is competitively inferior to the other 227 in the long-term (in the absence of recombination), it is likely to reach fixation and exclude 228the other(Fig. 3a,b).229Positive epistasis and the evolution of virulence 230 Next, suppose epistasis is positive (i.e., vaccines reduce infection/transmission, \u03c1 1 , \u03c1 3 , and/or 231 increase clearance, \u03c1 5 ;Fig. 2b), and s E > 0 and s V > 0 at the strain N A equilibrium.232 When does strain EV (and so positive LD) transiently increase in the population? If the 233 selection coefficients are of comparable magnitude, s E \u2248 s V , alleles E and V increase in the 234 population at a similar speed, and so positive epistasis acts to transiently favour strain EV 235 (and positive LD; Fig. 4a).

Since for p = 0 or p = 1, v iA (t) = v iV (t), it follows that 876 the difference between v N V (t) and v N A (t)will be greatest for intermediate vaccination rates 877 (intermediate p). Thus intermediate vaccination rates will maximise the direct epistatic 878 contributions of the vaccine protections \u03c1 2 , \u03c1 3 , \u03c1 4 , and \u03c1 5 . On the other hand, the (positive) 879 epistatic contribution of \u03c1 1 will generally be the greatest as vaccination rate increases, as 880 although the impact of \u03c1 1 depends upon the difference between v N V (t) and v N A (t), its effect 881 is also directly proportional to\u015c(t), which increases with p. 882 S1.6 Negative epistasis and evolutionary bistability 883 Negative epistasis occurs whenever the main vaccine protections are to reduce virulence 884 mortality (\u03c1 2 , \u03c1 4 ).

However, as f E + f V \u2192 1, direct competition between strains EA and 892 N V sets in and any further increase in allele E or V comes at the expense of the other.

Although each of these adaptations have been wellfavouring one adaptative route or the other, but not both.From a public health standpoint, the least desirable situation is the evolution of strains that escape vaccine immunity and are more virulent; this occurs when epistasis is positive. LD (strain EV over-representation) can build-up transiently (Sup. Info.Fig. S3). This suggests stochasticity and chance are far more likely to play important evolutionary roles if epistasis is positive. By breaking up LD, recombination can prevent the transient evolution of more virulent, vaccine-escape strains, while if such strains are favoured in the long-term, recombination leads to the sequential fixation of mutations. Often, vaccine-escape mutations will reach quasi-fixation first, followed by the evolution of higher virulence. In this (e.g., virulence evolution). Reducing the evolutionary likelihood of vaccine-escape (by reducing \u00b5 E ) could induce collateral evolutionary damage by tilting the competitive balance in favour of virulence (assuming \u00b5 V is also not small). Importantly, the consequences of virulence evolution will depend upon the mechanism of protection offered by universal vaccines.For example, in influenza there are two broad categories of universal vaccine candidates: weakly blocking infection and by decreasing disease severity, vaccines inducing a broadly protective T-cell immune response will also favour selection for increased virulence.

Thus if recombination is sufficiently frequent to overwhelm selection, strain N V cannot evolve, despite being selectively fitter than strain EA. This bistability induced by recombination creates an advantage for faster growth, as recombination will tend to 'lock-in' this advantage in the long-term, when in the absence of recombination, long-term selection would favour an alternate strain.This bistability is distinct from the one documented in single-locus models[11, 12]. In those models, bistability occurred at the virulence locus because pathogens could either evolve to specialize in unvaccinated hosts (low virulence) or specialize in vaccinated hosts 916 (high virulence); as virulence was modelled as a continuous trait[11, 12], the population evolved towards the more accessible of the two fitness 'peaks' from the wild-type virulence.In contrast, here the fitness 'peaks' correspond to the different adaptations (strain EA vs. strain N V ), and the fitness 'valley' separating the peaks is generated by negative epistasis between alleles E and V . Recombination breaks up negative LD, preventing the population from crossing the fitness valley, and so creates an evolutionary bistability. The potential for recombination to create an evolutionary bistability has also been observed in models of multidrug resistance[41]. In that case, it prevented the loss of resistance in the absence of treatment, but the principle was similar.Positive epistasis is produced whenever the primary vaccine protections are to reduce infection/transmission (\u03c1 1 , \u03c1 3 ) and/or to increase clearance (\u03c1 5 ).Assume both traits are under directional selection (s E > 0 and s V > 0) and epistasis is positive.
