            "text": "Patient involvement in research has the potential to improve the quality, relevance and impact of health research, as well as the transparency of the process and the accountability of the wider community of researchers. 1, 2 Additionally, involvement of patients of mental health services and caregivers in research projects can improve quality of research activities, filter out irrelevant research questions, empower patients to actively contribute to improvement of services, reduce stigma and support meaningful dissemination. 3, 4 Recruitment strategies have also been shown to be more successful if designed in collaboration with patients. 5 Patients who are involved in research also help to ensure that the interventions are patientfriendly. 6 Nevertheless, patient involvement in South-East European (SEE) countries is in early stages of development, and patient involvement in research is practically non-existent. Indeed, patients in this region may not be even familiar with the concept of patient involvement. The present study was conducted as part of a large, 3.5-year research project Implementation of an effective and cost-effective intervention for patients with psychotic disorders in low and middle-income countries in South Eastern Europe (IMPULSE), funded by the European Commission (grant number 779334), to improve treatment and care of people with psychosis in five SEE countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. 7 The IMPULSE study focused on involving mental healthcare of patients and caregivers in all stages of the study, and to our knowledge, this was the first time that mental health patients were invited to advise on research in this region. The current study was created to explore patients' experiences of participating in newly set up lived experience advisory panels (LEAPs) within the IMPULSE study.",

In total, five meetings were organised per each country. Each LEAP included six to eight members who were patients recruited from services participating in the IMPULSE study. Gender, age and experience of using services were taken into account when selecting the LEAP members, to ensure diversity of perspectives.

However, because most of the countries were in a total or partial lockdown because of COVID-19, not all patients could sign the consent forms. Instead, they gave verbal approval (which was witnessed and recorded) and signed the consent forms later. The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. All procedures involving human participants were approved by the Ethics After collecting consent from participants, the interview was scheduled for a convenient time for each participant. At the beginning of the interview, participants were reminded about the aim of the interviews, that the participation is voluntary and that they were free to stop the interview at any time without any consequence. They were also assured about confidentiality and informed that the session would be audio-recorded. In addition, participants were informed of what would happen with the data gathered from the interview and how interviews work. Participants were compensated with \u20ac25 for their participation. The majority of semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews were conducted through telephone calls (n = 17), and four interviews were conducted in-person at the patient-led organisation Menssana in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. All interviews were done in local languages, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by professional services. The audio recordings were deleted after verbatim transcription, and no field notes (e.g. on non-verbal cues) were taken during or after the interviews. The transcripts were not returned to participants for correction for two reasons: most participants did not have email addresses and we could not deliver the hard copies of the transcripts because of COVID-19 lockdown conditions.",

In exploring patients' experiences, seven themes were identified, covering a range of topics. We found a largely positive experience of LEAP participation that supported maintaining motivation and active engagement of participants, openness in communication and perception as equal partners. Participants highlighted active and open exchange of attitudes and emotions, as well as opportunities to share their experiences and help others regarding long-term treatment. This is extremely important because mental health patients often have few social connections, 9 feel a low sense of belonging compared with other social groups, 10, 11 and have access to less social capital compared with the general population. 12, 13 It has also been argued that actively involving patients in research projects has visible positive effects on them, including a sense of being heard and empowered, learning new skills, increased trust in research and connection with the community. 6 Paying patients to participate in research activities can also act as a mechanism to encourage greater social inclusion. 14 Engagement in which a person feels useful to himself and others has contributed to identification with a new social role and experience that could also help overcome the experience of inferiority or stigmatisation, and social exclusion.",

This outcome came about despite the fact that participants were seen as fellow partners throughout the LEAP process, including the data analysis process by the authors of the present study. Moreover, the LEAP leaders from all countries have explained the role of the LEAP members since the beginning of LEAP groups, which included a clear distinction between patients and advisory panellists. Participation in research as a therapeutic activity has received only limited attention in the literature, although catharsis and increased awareness of problems, 15 as well as empowerment, treatment and sense of purpose, 16 have been recorded. The ability to speak and express oneself freely in meetings is also an advantage, and could lead to empowerment, as evidenced by other research. 17 Most participants did not identify challenges related to their LEAP membership. However, a small number of participants expressed weak or unclear motivation as a barrier to involvement, which may be related to their personal characteristics or the way they function. Negative cultural stereotypes about mental illnesses that produce and maintain stigma, 1 as well as doubts about one's abilities, are usually cited as obstacles in the literature. Other participants identified the following challenges: passivity, scepticism, anxiety and physical disability. It is possible that the motivational issues of patients with negative symptoms reflected low expectations of successful performance. 18 The participants reported the diversity of their own experiences with hospital treatment, the importance of pharmacotherapy and alliances with professionals. Attitudes were mixed, both positive and negative. They reported dissatisfaction with communication, loss of control over their lives and the negative attitude of the community toward them. On the other hand, empathic attitudes of psychiatrists were singled out as crucial for mental health patients to feel that they were 'on the right path' to recovery. In line with our findings, Morselli and Elgie 19 emphasised the importance of trust, openness and respect for the relationship between patients and professionals.",
