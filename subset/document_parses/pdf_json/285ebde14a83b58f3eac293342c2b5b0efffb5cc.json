To that end, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided guidance on strategies that healthcare facilities may use to conserve N95s. This guidance includes extended use and reuse of previously single-use N95 FFRs coupled with various modalities of decontamination and augmenting respirator supplies with reusable devices like elastomeric respirators. 1, 2 In the healthcare setting, there is consensus that elastomeric filter cartridges should be replaced if they become visibly soiled, wet, damaged, or notably harder to breathe through. 2 Otherwise, the recommended timing for replacing elastomeric filter cartridges varies from every 30 days to annually. 3, 4 We previously determined that unopened P100 elastomeric filter cartridges received from the strategic national stockpile (SNS), which were 6 years past their shelf-life, offered similar filtration efficiency to the N95 respirator. 5 Our current study evaluates how these filters performed following use in the real-world (ie, healthcare) setting. Information pertaining to this topic is lacking.",

We saw a small but nonsignificant decrease in filter efficiency in 1 of the 2 filter pairs that had been in use for 6 months. Our findings suggest that similar SNS supplies of well-kept but expired P100 filters may be used in the healthcare setting for at least 6 months, in contrast to other published literature regarding the duration of use of filter cartridges. 2, 3 The quantitative data demonstrated in our study is a strength, although the small sample size is a limitation. Tests were performed in duplicate to address this issue. We were unable to test the same exact filter cartridges before and after use because the testing process renders the filter device unusable. We caution that these findings may not be applicable to nonexpired filters, but we intuitively suspect that the duration of use could be longer.",
