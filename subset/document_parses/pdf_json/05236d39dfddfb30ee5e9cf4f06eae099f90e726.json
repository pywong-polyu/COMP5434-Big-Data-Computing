Since the beginning of the spring academic semester (early March), the vast majority of adolescents have stayed home and completed courses online. As Chinese government has been actively containing the pandemic since the outbreak, there has been very few newly confirmed cases daily from May 2020 with a clear nationwide downward trend. Thus, a small number of schools and universities have gradually reopened their doors by that time (The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China, 2020). In a self-reported survey, many adolescents reported having amily's income, academic activities, and social communication being affected to varying degrees due to the pandemic . However, little is known about the trajectories of evolution of adolescents' mental health throughout the course of COVID-19.",

At the onset of the pandemic, World Health Organization divided China into three categories based on the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in early 2020 (WHO, 2020) : high-risk areas (Hubei province) = >10,000 confirmed cases; moderate-risk areas (e.g., Guangdong province) =1,000 -9,999 confirmed cases; low-risk areas (e.g., Sichuan province) = <1,000 confirmed cases. In moderate to low risk areas, the principle of management mainly involved residents' self-health monitoring (e.g., daily temperature measurement). Residents were allowed to go out with masks and a non-exposure green health codes was required before entering restaurants and shopping malls. However, in a district had a confirmed COVID-19 positive patient, residents would be restricted from leaving the neighborhood with living necessities uniformly distributed by the local government institute. Nucleic acid tests would also be carried out regularly until the absence of newly confirmed cases for 14 consecutive days. Previous studies suggested that news about confirmed COVID-19 cases in communities could have adverse effects on adolescents' mental health by eliciting fear and anxiety . As an extremely contagious virus, COVID-19 could be transmitted through asymptomatic virus-carriers (Bai et al., 2020) , which further increased adolescents' and their families' fear of new cases in their community. Accordingly, we focused on depression and anxiety symptoms for adolescents with heightened risk of contracting COVID-19 (with confirmed cases in their community) during the quarantine period.",

In a previous study that adopted the same screening scales to assess Chinese adolescents regardless the status of confirmed cases in their community, the prevalence of probable depressive (21.6% to 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (11.4% to 14.7%) has increased from the COVID-19 outbreak to the initial remission (Li et al., 2021) . Synthesizing with these findings, we proposed two main observations. First, the prevalence of depression and anxiety in adolescents living in communities with confirmed cases of COVID-19 was higher than the general adolescents' population (Li et al., 2021) . One cross-sectional survey of a large sample also supported our results, suggesting adolescents who lived in communities with confirmed cases were 1.55-1.59 times more likely than other students to develop depressive and anxiety symptoms (Ma et al., 2020) . Second, these adolescents' overall psychological distress became worse with the pandemic lockdown. As suggested by other studies, long-term home-isolation may increase the risk of mental health conditions for adolescents. It might be explained by the chronic stress associated with unexpected changes in living patterns (i.e., delay in returning to school, long-term home quarantine, and confinement for social distancing), which led to a host of physical and mental health problems (Majumdar et al., 2020) .",

Much literature has also identified female gender as a risk factor for depression and anxiety in general and especially during COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020b; Zhao et al., 2020) . Our data revealed that senior graduate students were more likely to report depressive and anxiety symptoms than their junior and postgraduate peers. Similar to other studies (Li et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2020) , greater stress from graduation-and employment-related concerns during the quarantine period experienced by senior students might explain this result. Furthermore, our study showed that being single child was susceptible to experience depressive symptoms. Previous studies also reported that sibling relationship was a protective factor for adolescents' mental health (Prime et al., 2020) . Chen and her colleagues conducted a three-cities survey to understand this phenomenon. They concluded that being the single child of the household may increase adolescents' sense of isolation and of anxiety from parents who were perceived to be more overly protective . In addition, in line with previous studies, students living in urban areas were more likely to report greater anxiety symptoms compared to their rural peers (Ozdin and Bayrak, 2020) . A possible explanation to this result lied in the fact that urban communities were more densely populated and posed higher risk of infection, which directly increased residents' anxiety level. Our study was also consistent with previous COVID-19 studies (Goularte et al., 2021; McCracken et al., 2020; Ozdin and Bayrak, 2020) , in that high incidence of depression and anxiety was found among adolescents with previous histories of mental illness.",

            "text": "Meanwhile, we further investigated some psychological factors of interest and examined their impact on mental health among adolescents living in communities with confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the quarantine period. In line with previous studies (Li et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) , our data further confirmed that having greater levels of perceived social support was a protective factor for adolescents' overall mental health. These findings pinpointed the importance of social support in facilitating adolescents' positive adaptation to public health emergencies (Bai et al., 2005) . Cao et al have found that social support was negatively correlated with the adolescents' anxiety during COVID-19. The same study also indicated that social support not only reduces the psychological stress during the pandemic but also changed the attitude regarding help-seeking behaviors in public (Cao et al., 2020) . Previous studies on SARS also found that a high level of social support also helped individuals to enhance self-care and self-efficacy, thus promoting good psychological adjustment in the face of the public health crisis (Mak et al, 2009 ). Furthermore, our study evidenced the importance of coping skills in predicting depression and anxiety, which was consistent with related previous studies (Fu et al., 2020; Lew et al., 2019) . Specifically, positive coping was found to improve mental health resistance. In contrast to the protective effect of positive coping, negative coping was a significant risk factor for depression and anxiety. These results highlighted the crucial role of integrating coping trainings into post-pandemic psychological interventions. More positive coping and less negative coping were also found to increase the likelihood of resilience in the face of psychological distress (Fan et al, 2015; Zheng et al, 2012) .",

First, the current sample was selected from adolescents living in the community with confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the outbreak period (Time 1). However, the potential changes in the infection status at Time 2 and Time 3 in the communities where the adolescents were from might impose a confounding effect. Meanwhile, variability of the infection prevention measures across China might also impact participants' psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, it was also challenging to obtain an accurate total number of confirmed cases in each community, which might further lead to bias when analyzing the mental health outcomes of our sample. In our study, we were unable to obtain the pre-pandemic levels of depression and anxiety among these participants, which also limited understanding of the impact of the outbreak on participants' psychological distress. Furthermore, as social support and coping styles were only measured at Time 1, we were also unable to learn about its evolution during the lockdown. Finally, the confounding factors caused by measurements at different time points might bring some bias to the results, such as relatives or friends being infected with COVID-19, seasonality, and life events during pandemic lockdown. Finally, our participants were vast majority sampled from Guangdong Province, which was a moderate-risk area by the time of our sample collection. It is uncertain whether our findings could be generalized to all adolescents over the country, especially those living in high-risk areas.",

The most common trajectory was identified as Resistance Group, and the other was characterized as Dysfunction Group. Female gender, senior grade, living in urban, single child status and history of mental illness were all found to be significant predictors of persistent clinical level of psychological symptoms. More social support and higher level of positive coping were protective factors for mental health whereas higher level of negative coping negatively predicted among adolescents. Therefore, these factors should be taken into consideration for designing effective psychosocial intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. ",
