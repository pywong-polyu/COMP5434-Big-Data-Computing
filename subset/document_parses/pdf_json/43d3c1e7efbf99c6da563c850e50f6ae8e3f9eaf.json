With this respect, Peck et al. showed that introducing a specific molecule exerting immunomodulatory function in neutral fibroblasts, resulted in the production of EVs with enhanced immunomodulatory capacity. Specifically, they selected tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2), a target gene of canonical Wnt-\u03b2-catenin pathway. Applying TDO2-enriched EVs in an animal model of acute myocardial infarction, greatly improved heart function.",

In a cell killing assay, such EVs were able to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumor cell lines.

A summary of recent findings in the field of tumor-related EVs, with emphasis on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), is presented in a review by Lu et al. OSCC represents 90% of oral cancers and is associated with low survival rate, thus constitutes a serious health problem. One of novel treatment options for OSCC may constitute EV isolated from therapeutically-approved cells, such as MSCs.",

It has been investigated that COVID-19 disturbs the renin-angiotensin system, thereby exacerbating heart function. To improve heart condition, EVs derived from therapeutically beneficial cells, such as MSCs or cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), can be applied.",

It is known that upon delivery to a living organism, EVs are rapidly cleared by phagocytes, which significantly reduces their therapeutic potential. As FIGURE 1 | Characteristics, bioengineering and role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in health and disease. EVs contain bioactive cargo in the form of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids which exert biological effects on target cells and thereby influence their fate. To improve functionality and specificity of EVs, they can be engineered by surface modification and/or loading a specific therapeutic cargo. Native and modified EVs can be used as next-generation cell-free therapeutics to improve health. On the contrary, EVs released in pathological conditions by, e.g. cancer cells or infected cells, participate in disease spreading and progression.",

These advancements may boost therapeutic potential of EVs and their applicability to treat human diseases. Concluding, this Research Topic provides the state-of-the-art of recent discoveries in the field of EVs and highlights the importance of further research needed to fully explore their therapeutic potential. Transferring this knowledge to clinical practice will be a milestone achievement in contemporary medicine.",
