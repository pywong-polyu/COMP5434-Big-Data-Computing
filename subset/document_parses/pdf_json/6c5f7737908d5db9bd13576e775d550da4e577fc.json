            "text": "The fundamental objective of earthquake engineering is to protect lives and livelihoods through the reduction of seismic risk. Directly or indirectly, this generally requires quantification of the risk, for which quantification of the seismic hazard is required as a basic input. Over the last several decades, the practice of seismic hazard analysis has evolved enormously, firstly with the introduction of a rational framework for handling the apparent randomness in earthquake processes, which also enabled risk assessments to consider both the severity and likelihood of earthquake effects. The next major evolutionary step was the identification of epistemic uncertainties related to incomplete knowledge, and the formulation of frameworks for both their quantification and their incorporation into hazard assessments. Despite these advances in the practice of seismic hazard analysis, it is not uncommon for the acceptance of seismic hazard estimates to be hindered by invalid comparisons, resistance to new information that challenges prevailing views, and attachment to previous estimates of the hazard. The challenge of achieving impartial acceptance of seismic hazard and risk estimates becomes even more acute in the case of earthquakes attributed to human activities. A more rational evaluation of seismic hazard and risk due to induced earthquakes may be facilitated by adopting, with appropriate adaptations, the advances in risk quantification and risk mitigation developed for natural seismicity. While such practices may provide an impartial starting point for decision making regarding risk mitigation measures, the most promising avenue to achieve broad societal acceptance of the risks associated with induced earthquakes is through effective regulation, which needs to be transparent, independent, and informed by risk considerations based on both sound seismological science and reliable earthquake engineering.",

            "text": "The study of earthquakes serves many noble purposes, starting with humankind's need to understand the planet on which we live and the causes of these calamitous events that challenge the very idea of residing on terra firma. Throughout history, peoples living in seismically active regions have formulated explanations for earthquakes, attributing their occurrence to the actions to disgruntled deities, mythical creatures or, later on, the Aristotelian view that earthquakes are caused by winds trapped and heated within a cavernous Earth (which is echoed in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1). While it is easy for us to look on these worldviews as quaint or pitifully ignorant, our modern understanding of earthquakes and their origins is very recent (when my own father studied geology as part of his civil engineering education, the framework of plate tectonics for understanding geological events had yet to be formulated and published). The discipline of seismology has advanced enormously during the last century or so, and our understanding of earthquakes continues to grow. The study of seismicity was instrumental in understanding plate tectonics and the analysis of seismic waves recorded on sensitive instruments all over the world has revealed, like global X-rays, the interior structure of our planet. As well as such advances in science, the development of seismology has also brought very tangible societal benefits, one of the most laudable being to distinguish the signals generated by underground tests of nuclear weapons from those generated by earthquakes, which made a comprehensive test ban treaty possible (Bolt 1976) .",

A great deal of effort has been invested in developing predictions of earthquakes, since with sufficient prior warning, evacuations could prevent loss of life and injury. There have been some remarkable successes, most notably the prediction of the February 1975 Haicheng earthquake in China (Adams 1976 ); however, the following year, the Tangshan earthquake on 28 July occurred without warning and took the lives of several hundreds of thousands of people. More recently, there has been a focus on earthquake early warning systems (e.g., Gasparini et al. 2007) , which can provide between seconds and tens of seconds of advance warning that can allow lifesaving actions to be taken. However, whether strong ground shaking is predicted a few seconds or even a few days ahead of time, the built environment will still be exposed to the effects of the earthquake. Consequently, the most effective and reliable approach to protecting individuals and societies from the impact of earthquakes is through seismically resistant design and construction.",

            "text": "To be cost effective in the face of limited resources, earthquake-resistant design first requires quantification of the expected levels of loading due to possible future earthquakes. Although not always made explicit, to demonstrate that the design is effective in providing the target levels of safety requires the analysis of the consequences of potential earthquake scenarios, for which the expected shaking levels are also required. The practice of assessing earthquake actions has progressed enormously over the last half century, especially in terms of identifying and quantifying uncertainties related to the location, magnitude, and frequency of future earthquakes, and to the levels of ground shaking that these will generate at a given location. The benefit of incorporating these uncertainties into the estimates of ground shaking levels is that the uncertainty can be taken into account in the definition of the design accelerations. This is not to say that seismic safety relies entirely on estimating the 'correct' level of seismic loading: additional margin is included in structural design, as has been clearly demonstrated by the safe performance of three different nuclear power plants in recent years. In July 2007, the magnitude 6.6 Niigata Ch\u016betsu earthquake in western Japan occurred very close to the Kashiwazaki-Kawira nuclear power plant (NPP) . At all seven reactor units, recorded accelerations exceeded the design motions ( Fig. 1 ) without leading to any loss of radioactive containment. The magnitude 9.0 T\u014dhoku earthquake in March 2011 on the opposite coast of Japan generated motions at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP that also exceeded the design accelerations (Grant et al. 2017) ; the ensuing tsunami led to a severe nuclear accident at the plant, but the plant withstood the ground shaking without distress. A few months later, motions recorded at the North Anna NPP due to the M 5.8 Mineral, Virginia, USA earthquake also exceeded design acceleration levels without causing damage (Graizer et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "Seismic safety in critical structures such as NPPs depends therefore on both the margins of resistance above the nominal design accelerations and the degree to which the estimates of the site demand, to which the design motions are referenced, reflect the uncertainty in their assessment. Therefore, for a nuclear regulator, capture of uncertainty in the assessment of seismic shaking levels provides assurance regarding the provision of adequate safety. However, the inclusion of large degrees of uncertainty can be viewed quite differently by other groups. For example, since inclusion of uncertainty generally leads to higher estimates of the accelerations (in theory broader uncertainty bands could lead to lower accelerations, but in practice it tends to push estimates in the opposite direction), owners and operators of these facilities may be averse to the inclusion of large intervals of uncertainty, especially if these are viewed as unnecessarily wide. For the public, capture of broad ranges of uncertainty in the estimates of earthquake hazard could be interpreted either way: on the one hand, it could be viewed positively as nuclear safety being enhanced through consideration of events that are stronger than what has been previously observed, whereas on the other hand, it could be seen as evidence that the science is too unsure to inform rational decision making and, in the face of such unknowns, safety cannot be guaranteed. The challenge therefore is two-fold: to develop impartial quantification of earthquake hazard and risk, and for these estimates to then be objectively accepted as the baseline for decision making regarding the management of the risk. This article discusses important advances in the estimation of earthquake hazard, and also explores, with concrete examples from practice, why impartial hazard estimates are sometimes met with stern-or even belligerent-resistance.",

The frameworks that have been developed for estimating seismic hazard due to natural earthquakes should be taken advantage of in the field of induced seismicity given that the controversy surrounding these cases often makes it imperative to correctly identify the degrees of uncertainty. Equally important, however, is to bring into the quantification of induced seismic hazard an engineering perspective that relates the hazard to risk. I make the case in this article that to date the assessment of induced seismic hazard has often not quantified uncertainty well and, perhaps more importantly, has failed to relate the hazard to a rational quantification of risk. These shortcomings are particularly important because the challenges of the hazard estimates being accepted by different groups are often particularly acute, much more so than is the case of natural seismicity. A key question that the article sets out to address is whether it is possible for robust estimates of seismic hazard associated with potential induced earthquakes to be adopted at face value. This leads to the question of whether the hazard estimates can be used as a starting point in discussions surrounding the rational management of the associated risk and its balance with the benefits of the industrial activity with the potential to cause seismic activity. This article discusses a number of case histories in which such objectivity was glaringly absent, and also explores options that might facilitate the impartial acceptance of estimates of induced seismic hazard.",

This does not necessarily mean no damage since designing all structures to resist all levels of earthquake loading without structural damage would be prohibitively expensive. The structural performance targets will generally be related to the consequences of structural damage or failure: single-family dwellings are designed to avoid collapse and preserve life safety; hospitals and other emergency Examples of consequence functions that translate damage states to damage or cost ratios, from a Italy, b Greece, c Turkey and d California, (Silva et al. 2015) services to avoid damage that would interrupt their operation; and nuclear power plants to avoid any structural damage that could jeopardise the containment of radioactivity. Earthquake engineering in this context is a collaboration between Earth scientists (engineering seismologists) who quantify the hazard and earthquake engineers (both structural and geotechnical) who then provide the required levels of seismic resistance in design. Until now, the way that the risk due to induced seismicity has been managed is very different and has been largely driven by Earth science: implicit assumptions are made regarding the exposure and its fragility, and the risk is then mitigated through schemes to either reduce the hazard at the location of the buildings by either relocating the operations (i.e., changing the exposure) or by controlling the induced seismicity.

Illustration of the effect of seismic strengthening measures on fragility curves for a specific building type and damage state (Bommer et al. 2015a) Historical studies can extend the earthquake record back much further in time in some regions, albeit with reduced reliability regarding the characteristics of the events, and geological studies can extend the record for larger earthquakes over much longer intervals at specific locations. The first recordings of strong ground shaking were obtained in California in the early 1930s, but networks of similar instruments were installed much later in other parts of the world-the first European strong-motion recordings were registered more than three decades later. Even in those regions where such recordings are now abundant, different researchers derive models that yield different predictions. Consequently, seismic hazard analysis is invariably conducted with appreciable levels of uncertainty, and the same applies to risk analysis since there are uncertainties in every element of the model.",

            "text": "Faced with these uncertainties, there are two challenges for earthquake hazard and risk assessment: on the one hand, to gather data and to derive models that can reduce (or eliminate) the uncertainty, and, on the other hand, to ensure that the remaining uncertainty is identified, quantified, and incorporated into the hazard and risk analyses. In this regard, it is very helpful to distinguish those uncertainties that can, at least in theory, be reduced through the acquisition of new information, and those uncertainties that are effectively irreducible. The former are referred to as epistemic uncertainties, coming from the Greek word \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7 which literally means science or knowledge, as they are related to our incomplete knowledge. The term uncertainty traditionally referred to this type of unknown, but the adjective epistemic is now generally applied to avoid ambiguity since the term uncertainty has often also been applied to randomness. Randomness, now usually referred to as aleatory variability (from alea, Latin for dice), is thought of as inherent to the process or phenomenon and, consequently, irreducible. In reality, it is more accurate to refer to apparent randomness since it is always characterised by the distribution of data points relative to a specific model (e.g., Stafford 2015) , and consequently can be reduced by developing models that include the dependence of the predicted parameter on other variables. Consider, for example, a model that predicts ground accelerations as a function of earthquake size (magnitude) and the distance of the recording site from the source of the earthquake. The residuals of the recorded accelerations relative to the predictions define the aleatory variability in the predictions, but this variability will be appreciably reduced if the nature of the surface geology at the recording sites is taken into account, even if this is just a simple distinction between rock and soil sites (Boore 2004) . In effect, such a modification to the model isolates an epistemic uncertainty-the nature of the recording site Fig. 6 Schematic illustration of the classical approaches for mitigating seismic risk due natural and induced earthquakes by controlling different elements of the risk; in practice, explicit consideration of the exposure and its fragility has often been absent in the management of induced seismicity, replaced instead by vague notions of what levels of hazard are acceptable and its influence on the ground acceleration-and thus removes it from the apparent randomness; this, in turn, creates the necessity, when applying the model, to obtain additional information, namely the nature of the surface geology at the target site.",

Section 9 discusses seismic hazard and risk analysis for induced earthquakes through adaptation of the approaches that have been developed for natural seismicity, including the characterisation of uncertainties. Section 10 then discusses the mitigation of induced seismic risk, explaining the use of traffic light protocols (TLP) as the primary tool used in the scheme illustrated in Fig. 6 , but also making the case for induced seismic risk to be managed in the same way as seismic risk due to tectonic earthquakes. Section 11 addresses the fact that for induced seismicity, there is often concern and focus on earthquakes of magnitudes that would generally be given little attention were they of natural origin, by reviewing the smallest tectonic earthquakes that have been known to cause damage. This then leads into Sect. 12 and four case histories of induced earthquakes that did have far-reaching consequences, despite their small magnitude. In every case it is shown that the consequences of the induced seismicity were not driven by physical damage caused by the ground shaking but by other non-technical factors, each one illustrating a failure to objectively quantify and rationally manage the perceived seismic risk. Part II closes with a discussion of the implications of the issues and case histories presented in terms of achieving objective and rational responses to earthquake risk arising from induced seismicity.

The article is addressed in the first instance to seismologists and engineers, since both of these disciplines are vital to the effective mitigation of earthquake risk (and, I shall argue, the contribution from earthquake engineering to confronting the challenges of induced seismicity has been largely lacking to date). However, if both impartial quantification of earthquake hazard and risk, and objective evaluation of hazard and risk estimates in the formulation of policy are to be achieved, other players need to be involved in the discussions, particularly regulators and operators from the energy sector, who may not have expertise in the field of Earth sciences or earthquake engineering. Consequently, the paper begins with a presentation of some fundamentals so that it can be read as a standalone document by non-specialists, as well as the usual readership of the Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering. Readers in the latter category may therefore wish to jump over Sects. 2 and 3 (and may feel that they should have been given a similar warning regarding Sect. 1.1 and 1.2).",

For safety-critical structures such as nuclear power plants (NPPs), the presence of a fault capable of generating surface rupture would normally be an exclusionary criterion that would disqualify the site. Meehan (1984) relates the story of several potential NPP sites in California that were eventually abandoned when excavations for their foundations revealed the presence of active geological faults. For extended lifeline infrastructure, however, such as roads, bridges, and pipelines, it is often impossible to avoid crossing active fault traces and in such circumstances the focus moves to quantifying the sense and amplitude of potential surface slip, and to allow for this in the design. An outstanding example of successful structural design against surface fault rupture is the Trans-Alaskan Oil Pipeline, a story brilliantly recounted by the late Lloyd Cluff in his Mallet-Milne lecture of 2011. The pipeline crosses the Denali fault and was designed to accommodate up to 6 m of horizontal displacement and 1.5 m of vertical offset. The design was tested in November 2003 by a magnitude M 7.9 earthquake associated with a 336-km rupture on the Denali fault, with a maximum slip of 8.8 m. In the area where the pipeline crosses the fault trace, it was freely supported on wide sleepers to allow it to slip and thus avoid the compressional forces that would have been induced by the right-lateral strike-slip motion (Fig. 10) . No damage occurred at all and not a drop of oil was spilt and thus a major environmental disaster was avoided: the pipeline transports 2.2 million barrels of crude oil a day. Failure of the pipeline would also have had severe economic consequences since at the time it transported 17% of US crude oil supply and accounted for 80% of Alaska's economy.",

Tsunamis can be the most destructive of all earthquake effects, as was seen in the 2004 Boxing Day M 9.2 earthquake that originated off the coast of Indonesia (e.g., Fujii and Satake 2007) and caused loss of life as far away as East Africa (Obura 2006) , and the tsunami that followed the 2011 T\u014dhoku M 9.0 earthquake in Fig. 10 The Trans-Alaska pipeline crossing of the Denali fault, restored to its original configuration following the 2003 Denali earthquake to be able to withstand right-lateral displacement in future earthquakes (Image courtesy of Lloyd S Cluff)",

There can be significant scope for reducing loss of life due to tsunami through early warning systems that alert coastal populations to an impending wave arrival following a major earthquake (e.g., Selva et al. 2021) ; for tsunami the lead times can be much longer than early warning systems for ground shaking, for which reason these can be of great benefit.",

There are several scales of intensity, the most widely used defining 12 degrees of intensity (Musson et al. 2010) , such as the European Macroseismic Scale, or EMS (Gr\u00fcnthal 1998) . For the lower degrees of intensity, the indicators are primarily related to the response of humans and to the movement of objects during the earthquakes; as the intensity increases, the indicators are increasingly related to the extent of damage in buildings of different strength. The intensity assigned to a specific location should be based on the modal observation and is often referred to as an intensity data point (IDP) . Contours can be drawn around IDPs and these are called isoseismals, which enclose areas of equal intensity. The intensity is generally written as a Roman numeral, which reinforces that notion that it is an index and should be treated as an integer value. An isoseismal map, such as the one shown in Fig. 12 , conveys both the maximum strength of the earthquake shaking and the area over which the earthquake was felt, and provides a very useful overview of an earthquake. Intensity can be very useful for a number of purposes, including the inference of source location and size for earthquakes that occurred prior to the dawn of instrumental seismology (e.g., Strasser et al. 2015) . However, for the purposes of engineering design to mitigate seismic risk, intensity is of little use and recourse is made to instrumental recordings of the strong ground shaking.",

Many different parameters are used to characterise accelerograms, each of which captures a different feature of the shaking. The mostly widely used parameter is the peak ground acceleration, PGA, which is simply the largest absolute amplitude on the accelerogram. Integration of the accelerogram over time generates the velocity time-history, from which the peak ground velocity, PGV, is measured in the same way (Fig. 13) . In many ways, PGV is a superior indicator of the strength of the shaking to PGA (Bommer and Alarc\u00f3n 2006) .",

The concept of the response spectrum is illustrated in Fig. 14 . The response spectrum is the basic representation of ground motions used in all seismic design, and all seismic design codes specify a response spectrum as a function of location and site characteristics. The response spectrum can be scaled for damping ratios other than the nominal 5% of critical although the scaling factors depend not only on the target damping value, but also on the duration or number of cycles of motion (Bommer and Mendis 2005; Stafford et al. 2008a ).",

            "text": "An essential element of any seismic hazard assessment is a model to estimate the value of the ground-motion parameter of interest at a particular location as a result of a specified earthquake scenario. The models reflect the influence of the source of the earthquake (the energy release), the path to the site of interest (the propagation of the seismic waves), and the characteristics of the site itself (soft near-surface layers will modify the amplitude and frequency of the waves). The parameters that are always included in such a model are magnitude (source), distance from the source to the site (path), and a characterisation of the site. Early models used distance from the epicentre (R epi ) or the hypocentre (R hyp ) but these distance metrics ignore the dimensions of the fault rupture and therefore are not an accurate measure of the separation from the source for sites close to larger earthquakes associated with extended fault ruptures. More commonly used metrics in modern models are the distance to the closest point on the fault rupture (R rup ) or the shortest horizontal distance to the projection of the fault rupture onto the Earth's surface, which is known as the Joyner-Boore distance (Joyner and Boore 1981) or R jb . Site effects were originally represented by classes, sometimes as simple as distinguishing between 'rock' and 'soil', but nowadays are generally represented by explicit inclusion of the parameter V S30 , which is the shear-wave velocity (which is a measure of the site stiffness) corresponding to the travel time of vertically propagating shear waves over the uppermost 30 m at the site. The reference depth of 30 m was selected because of the relative abundance of borehole data to this depth rather than any particular geophysical significance. The modelling of site effects has sometimes included additional parameters to represent the depth of sediments, such as Z 1.0 or Z 2.5 (the depths at which shear-wave velocities of 1.0 and 2.5 km/s are encountered). The more advanced models also include the non-linear response of soft soil sites for large-amplitude motions, often constrained by site response models developed separately (Walling et al. 2008; . Another parameter that is frequently included is the styleof-faulting, SoF (e.g., Bommer et al. 2003) . Figure 15 shows an example of predictions from a model for PGV, showing the influence of magnitude, distance, site classification and style-of-faulting.",

The maximum response is plotted against the period of the oscillator and the complete response spectrum of the accelerogram is constructed by repeating for a large number of closelyspaced periods; building photographs from Spence et al. (2003) model of Boore and Atkinson (2008) , which was shown to provide a good fit to European strong-motion data (Stafford et al. 2008b ). The range of periods for which reliable response spectral ordinates can be generated depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the accelerograms, especially for records obtained by older, analogue instruments, although processing is generally still required for modern digital recordings as well . The maximum usable response period of a processed record depends on the filters applied to remove those parts of the signal that are considered excessively noisy (Akkar and Bommer 2006) .",

The former is generally used in regions with abundant datasets of accelerograms, whereas simulations are generally used in regions with sparse data, where recordings from smaller earthquakes are used to infer the parameters used in the simulations. Stochastic simulations can also be used to adjust empirical models developed in a data-rich region for application to another region with less data, which preserves the advantages of empirical models (see Sect. 5.2). A common misconception regarding empirical models is that their objective is to reproduce as accurately as possible the observational data. The purpose of the models is rather to provide reliable predictions for all magnitude-distance combinations that may be considered in seismic hazard assessments, including those that represent extrapolations beyond the limits of the data. The empirical data provides vital constraint on the models, but the model derivation may also invoke external constraints obtained from simulations or independent analyses.",

This recognition prompted the adoption of the term ground motion prediction equations or GMPEs.

This stress transfer is due to the contractive tendencies of the soil skeleton during earthquake shaking. Once liquefied, the shear resistance of the soil drastically reduces and the soil effectively behaves like a fluid, which can result in structures sinking into the ground. Where there is a free face such as a river or shoreline, liquefaction can lead to lateral spreading (Fig. 20) . Liquefaction can result in buildings becoming uninhabitable and can also cause extensive disruption, especially to port and harbour facilities. However, there are no documented cases of fatalities resulting from soil liquefaction, unless one includes flow liquefaction (e.g., de Lima et al. 2020;). As with landslide hazard assessment, the assessment of liquefaction triggering hazard can also be compared to risk analysis, with the shaking once again representing the hazard, the presence of liquefied soils the exposure, and the susceptibility of these deposits to liquefaction the fragility. In the widely used simplified procedures (e.g., Seed and Idriss 1971; Whitman 1971; Idriss and Boulanger 2008; Boulanger and Idriss 2014) , the ground motion is represented by PGA and a magnitude scaling factor, MSF, which is a proxy for the number of cycles of motion. Geyin and Maurer (2020) present fragility functions for the severity of liquefaction effects as a function of a parameter that quantifies the degree of liquefaction triggering. Structural fragility functions can be derived in terms of the resulting soil displacement or another measure of the liquefaction severity (Di Ludovico et al. 2020) , so that liquefaction Fig. 20 Lateral spreading on the bank of the Lempa River in El Salvador due to liquefaction triggered by the M 7.7 subductionzone earthquake of January 2001; notice the collapsed railway bridge in the background due to the separation of the piers caused by the spreading effects can be incorporated into seismic risk analyses although this requires in situ geotechnical data and information regarding the foundations of buildings in the area of interest ).",

            "text": "The purpose of a seismic hazard assessment is to determine the ground motions to be considered in structural design or in risk estimation. Any earthquake hazard assessment consists of two basic components: a model for the source of future earthquakes and a model to estimate the ground motions at the site due to each hypothetical earthquake scenario. Much has been made over the years of the choice between deterministic and probabilistic approaches to seismic hazard assessment. In a paper written some 20 years ago , I described the vociferous exchanges between the proponents of deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) as \"an exaggerated and obstructive dichotomy\". While I would probably change many features of that article if it were being written today, I think this characterisation remains valid for the simple reason that it is practically impossible to avoid probability in seismic hazard analysis. Consider the following case: imagine an important structure very close (< 1 km) to a major geological fault that has been found to generate earthquakes of M 7 on average every ~ 600 years (this is actually the situation for the new Pacific locks on the Panama Canal, as described in Sect. 7.2). Assuming the structure has a nominal design life in excess of 100 years, it would be reasonable to assume that the fault will generate a new earthquake during the operational lifetime (especially if the last earthquake on the fault occurred a few centuries ago, as is the case in Panama) and therefore the design basis would be a magnitude 7 earthquake at a distance of 1 km. However, to calculate the design response spectrum a decision needs to be made regarding the exceedance level at which the selected GMM should be applied: if the median motions are adopted (setting = 0 ), then in the event of the earthquake occurring, there is a 50% probability that the design accelerations will be exceeded. If instead the 84-percentile motions are used (mean plus one standard deviation), there will be a 1-in-6 chance of the design accelerations being 1 3 exceeded. The owner of the structure would need to choose the level commensurate with the desired degree of safety, and this may require more than one standard deviation on the GMM. Whatever the final decision, the hazard assessment now includes a probabilistic element (ignoring the variability in the GMM and treating it as a deterministic model, which implies a 50% probability of exceedance, does not make the variability disappear).",

If the target return period were selected as 10,000 years, say, then the response spectrum would need to be obtained by including 1.55 standard deviations of the GMM, yielding accelerations at least 2.5 times larger than the median spectral ordinates.",

            "text": "In practice, most seismic design situations are considerably more complex in terms of the seismic sources and the earthquakes contributing to the hazard than the simple case described above. For example, the site hazard could be still be dominated by a single geological fault, located a few kilometres away from the site at its closest approach, but of considerable length (such that individual earthquakes do not rupture the full length of the fault and will thus not necessarily occur on the section of the fault closest to the site), and which is capable of generating earthquakes of different magnitudes, the larger earthquakes occurring less frequently (i.e., having longer average recurrence intervals) than the smaller events. A deterministic approach might propose to assign the largest magnitude that the fault is considered capable of producing to a rupture adjacent to the target site. However, this would ignore two important considerations, the first is that the smaller earthquakes are more frequent (as a rule-of-thumb, there is a tenfold increase in the earthquake rate for every unit reduction in magnitude) and more frequent earthquakes can be expected to sample higher values of , or expressed another way, the more earthquakes of a particular size that occur, the more likely they are to generate higher-than-average levels of ground shaking. The second consideration is that ground-motion amplitudes do not increase linearly with increasing earthquake magnitude, as shown in Fig. 21 . Consequently, more frequent scenarios of M 6, sampling higher values, could result in higher motions at the site than scenarios of M 7. Of course, the rate could simply be ignored, and a decision could be Campbell and Bozorgnia (2014) and Chiou and Youngs (2014) 1 3 taken to base the design on the largest earthquake, but the rationale-which is sometimes invoked by proponents of DSHA-would be that by estimating the hazard associated with the worst-case scenario one effectively envelopes the various possibilities. However, for this to be true, the scenario would need to correspond to the genuine upper bound of all scenarios, which would mean placing the largest earthquake the fault could possibly produce at the least favourable location, and then calculating the ground motions at least 3 or 4 standard deviations above the median. In most cases, such design motions would be prohibitive and in practice seismic hazard assessment always backs away from such extreme scenarios.",

Envisage, for example, a site in a region with several seismogenic faults, including smaller ones close to the site and a large major structure at greater distance, all having different slip rates. A classical DSHA would simply estimate the largest earthquake that could occur on each fault (thus defining the magnitude, M) and associate it with a rupture located as close to the site as possible (which then determines the distance R); for each M-R pair, the motions at the site would then be calculated with an arbitrarily chosen value of and the final design basis would be the largest accelerations (although for different ground-motion parameters, including response spectral ordinates at different periods, different sources may dominate).

This situation arises both because of the inherent uncertainty in the location of earthquake hypocentres and the fact that not all faults are detected, especially smaller ones and those embedded in the crust that do not reach the Earth's surface. Consequently, some sources of potential future seismicity are modelled simply as areas of 'floating' earthquakes that can occur at any location within a defined region. The definition of both the location and the magnitude of the controlling earthquake in DSHA then becomes an additional challenge: if the approach genuinely is intended to define the worst-case scenario, in many cases this will mean that the largest earthquake that could occur in the area would be placed directly below the site, but this is rarely, if ever, done in practice. Instead, the design earthquake is placed at some arbitrarily selected distance (in the US, where DSHA was used to define the design basis for most existing NPPs, this was sometimes referred to as the 'shortest negotiated distance'), to which the hazard estimate can be very sensitive because of the swift decay of ground motions with distance from the earthquake source (Fig. 22) .",

(2014) at rock sites (V S30 = 760 m/s) plotted against distance for a magnitude M 6.5 strike-slip earthquake; both plots show exactly the same information but the left-hand frame uses the conventional logarithmic axes whereas the right-hand frame used linear axes and perhaps conveys more clearly how swiftly the amplitudes decay with distance 1 3 2008). Consequently, PSHA is an integration over three variables: M, R and . Rather than identifying a single scenario to characterise the earthquake hazard, PSHA considers all possible scenarios that could affect the site in question, calculating the consequent rate at which different levels of ground motion would be exceeded at the site of interest as a result. For a given value of the ground-motion parameter of interest (say, PGA = 0.2 g), earthquakes of all possible magnitudes are considered at all possible locations within the seismic sources, and the value of required to produce a PGA of 0.2 g at the site is calculated in each case. The annual frequency at which this PGA is produced at the site due to each earthquake is the frequency of events of this magnitude (determined from the recurrence relationship) multiplied by the probability associated with the value (obtained from the standard normal distribution). By assuming that all the earthquake scenarios are independent-for which reason foreshocks and aftershocks are removed from the earthquake catalogue before calculating the recurrence parameters, a process known as de-clustering-the frequencies can be summed to obtain the total frequency of exceedance of 0.2 g. Repeating the exercise for different values of PGA, a hazard curve can be constructed, as in the lower right-hand side of Fig. 23 . The hazard curve allows rational selection of appropriate design levels on the basis of the annual exceedance frequency (or its reciprocal, the return period): return periods used to define the design motions for normal buildings are usually in the range from 475 to 2,475 years, whereas for NPPs the return periods are in the range 10,000 to 100,000 years. Since PSHA calculations are effectively a book-keeping exercise that sums the contributions of multiple M-R-triplets to the site hazard, for a selected annual exceedance frequency the process can be reversed to identify the scenarios that dominate the hazard estimates, a process that is referred to as disaggregation (e.g., McGuire 1995; Bazzurro and Cornell 1999 ). An example of a hazard disaggregation is shown in Fig. 24 ; to represent this information in a single scenario, one can use the modal or mean values of the variables, each of which has its own merits and shortcomings (Harmsen and Frankel 2001) .",

For distance, the minimum value will usually correspond to an earthquake directly below the site (unlike the upper left-hand panel in Fig. 23 , the site is nearly always located within a seismic source zone, referred to as the host zone), whereas the upper limit, usually on the order of 200-300 km, is controlled by the farthest sources that contribute materially to the hazard (and can be longer if the site region is relatively quiet and there is a very active seismic source, such as a major fault or a subduction zone, at greater distance). Standard practice is to truncate the residual distribution at a limit such as 3 standard deviations; the lower limit on is unimportant. There is neither a physical nor statistical justification for such a truncation (Strasser et al. 2008) but it will generally only impact on the hazard estimates for very long return periods in regions with high seismicity rates (Fig. 26 ).",

Leaving aside hazard sensitivity calculations undertaken for research purposes, all seismic hazard assessments have a risk goal, whether this is explicitly stated or only implicit in the use of the results. When I have made this point in the past, one counter argument given was that one might conduct a PSHA as part of the design of strong-motion recording network, but in that case I would argue that the 'risk' would be installing instruments that yield no or few recordings. To be meaningful, hazard must be linked to risk, either directly in risk analysis or through seismic design to mitigate risk. In the previous section I referred to return periods commonly used as the basis for seismic design, but in themselves these return periods do not determine the risk level; the risk target is also controlled by the performance criteria that the structure should meet under Illustration of the effect of truncating the distribution of ground-motion residuals by imposing different values of \u03b5 max in PSHA calculations for regions of low (upper) and high (lower) seismicity rates the specified loading condition, such as the 'no collapse' criterion generally implicit in seismic design codes as a basis for ensuring life safety. For a NPP, the performance target will be much more demanding, usually related to the first onset of inelastic deformation. In effect, the return period defines the hazard, and the performance targets the fragility, both chosen in accordance with the consequences of failure to meet the performance criterion. For NPPs, the structural strength margins (see Fig. 1 ) mean that the probability of inelastic deformations will be about an order of magnitude lower than the annual exceedance frequency of the design motions, and additional structural capacity provides another order of magnitude against the release of radiation: design against a 10,000-year ground motion will therefore lead to a 1-in-1,000,000 chance of radiation release.",

This is not the same as the smallest magnitude, M lower , used in the derivation of the recurrence relation in Eq. (4), but rather it is the smallest earthquake that is considered capable of contributing to the risk (and is therefore application specific). This can be illustrated by considering how seismic risk could be calculated in the most rigorous way possible, for a single structure. For every possible earthquake scenario (defined by its magnitude and location), a suite of acceleration time-histories could be generated or selected from a very large database; collectively, the time-histories would sample the range of possible ground motions for such a scenario in terms of amplitude, frequency content, and duration or number of cycles. Non-linear structural analyses would then be performed using all these records, and the procedure repeated for all possible scenarios. For a given risk metric, such as a specified level of damage, the rate can be determined by the proportion of analyses leading to structural damage above the defined threshold, which can then be combined with the recurrence rate of the earthquake scenarios to estimate annual rates of exceeding the specified damage level (Fig. 27) .",

The usual interpretation of such a result is that the short-duration motions from these smaller earthquakes lack the required energy to cause damage. Now, in practice, such an approach to seismic risk analysis would be prohibitively intensive in terms of computational demand, for which reason several simplifications are made. Firstly, the earthquake scenarios and resulting acceleration time-histories are represented by the results of hazard analyses, and secondly the dynamic analyses are summarised in a fragility function. Usually, the hazard is expressed in terms of a single ground-motion parameter that is found to be sufficient to act as an indicator of the structural response; it is also possible, however, to define the fragility in terms of a vector of ground-motion parameters (e.g., Gehl et al. 2013) . In a Monte Carlo approach to risk assessment, individual earthquake scenarios are still generated, but for each one the chosen ground-motion parameter is estimated rather than generating suites of accelerograms. If the hazard is expressed in terms of a simple hazard curve, the risk can be obtained by direct convolution of the hazard and fragility curves (Fig. 28) . However, in this simplified approach it is necessary to avoid inflation of the risk through inclusion of hazard contributions from the small-magnitude events that are effectively screened out in the more rigorous approach. This is the purpose of the lower magnitude limit, M min , imposed on the hazard integral, although there has been a great deal of confusion regarding the purpose and intent of this parameter (Bommer and Crowley 2017) . In an attempt to address these misunderstandings, Bommer and Crowley (2017) proposed the following definition: \"M min is the lower limit of integration over earthquake magnitudes such that using a smaller value would not alter the estimated risk to the exposure under consideration.\" The imposition of M min can modify the hazard-in fact, if it did not, it would be pointless-but it should not change the intended risk quantification. For NPP, typical values for M min are on the order of 5.0 (e.g., McCann and Reed 1990) .",

This has been done through the use of a CAV (cumulative absolute velocity, which is the integral of the absolute acceleration values over time) filter, which prevents ground motions of low energy from contributing to the hazard estimate. The original purpose of CAV was to inform decision-making following safe shutdown of NPPs and re-start following earthquake shaking (EPRI 1988) . However, CAV filters have been proposed as an alternative to M min (EPRI 2006a; Watson-Lamprey and Abrahamson 2007) and these have prompted the development of new GMMs for the Fig. 27 Schematic illustration of rigorous risk assessment for a single structure and a defined response condition or limit state; a for each earthquake scenario, a suite of accelerograms is generated and used in dynamic analyses of a structural model, and b the results used to determine the rate at which damage occurs (Bommer and Crowley 2017) conditional prediction of CAV (Campbell and Bozorgnia 2010) . Other ground-motion parameters or vectors of parameters might serve the same purpose equally well. In practice, different parameters may perform better in different applications, depending on which measures of ground-motion intensity are found to be most efficient for defining the fragility functions of the exposure elements for which risk is directly or indirectly being assessed or mitigated.",

This includes the subtle issue of how the horizonal component of motion is defined from the two recorded components of each accelerogram. Early GMMs tended to use the larger of the two components but there has subsequently been a trend towards using the geometric mean of the parameters from each horizontal component and numerous variations of this convention, all of which seek to approximate a randomly oriented component Watson-Lamprey and Boore 2007; Boore 2010) . There is no basis to identify an optimal or most appropriate definition, but it is very important that the component definition employed in the hazard analysis is consistent with the way the horizontal earthquake loading is applied in the structural analyses related to the risk mitigation or analysis. For example, if the geometric mean component is adopted in the hazard analysis but a single, arbitrarily selected horizontal component of the accelerograms is used to derive the fragility functions, then there is an inconsistency that requires accommodation of the additional component-to-component variability (Baker and Cornell 2006) .

            "text": "The issue of deterministic vs probabilistic approaches can also arise in the context of risk assessment. A purely deterministic quantification of potential earthquake impacts that gives no indication of the likelihood of such outcomes is of very limited value since it does not provide any basis for comparison with other risks or evaluation against safety standards. In this sense, the context of risk provides strong motivation for adopting probabilistic approaches to seismic hazard assessment. Here it is useful to consider what are the key features that distinguish PSHA and DSHA. The first is that PSHA explicitly includes consideration of earthquake rates and the frequency or probability of the resulting ground motions, whereas DSHA generally ignores the former and only accommodates the latter implicitly. Another important difference is that PSHA considers all possible earthquake scenarios (that could contribute to the risk) whereas DSHA considers only a single scenario. Estimation of the total risk to a structure or portfolio of buildings clearly needs to consider all potential sources of earthquake-induced damage, and informed decisions regarding the mitigation or transfer of the risk clearly require information regarding the probability of different levels of loss. There are situations, however, in which the estimation of risk due to a single specified earthquake scenario can be very useful, including for emergency planning purposes, and for non-specialists understanding risk estimates for a single scenario can be much more accessible than a complete probabilistic risk assessment. A risk assessment for a single scenario does not need to be fully deterministic: the scenario can be selected from disaggregation of PSHA and even if it is selected on another basis, its recurrence interval can be estimated from the relevant recurrence relationship. Furthermore, the variability in the predictions of ground shaking levels can be fully accounted for through the generation of multiple ground-motion fields, sampling from the between-event variability once for each realisation and from the within-event variability for each location. The sampling from the within-event variability can also account for spatial correlation (e.g., Jayaram and Baker 2009 ) which creates pockets of higher and lower ground motions that influence the resulting hazard estimates when they coincide with clusters of exposure (e.g., Crowley et al. 2008) ).",

            "text": "In defining the seismic source characterisation (SSC) and ground motion characterisation (GMC) models that define the inputs to PSHA, decisions have to be made regarding models and parameter values for which a single 'correct' choice is almost never unambiguously defined. The nature of the available data in terms of geological information regarding seismogenic faults, the earthquake catalogue for the region, and strong-motion recordings from the area, is such that it will never cover all of the scenarios that need to be considered in the hazard integrations, so there is inevitably extrapolation beyond the data. Moreover, different experts are likely to derive distinct models from the same data, each reflecting valid but divergent interpretations. Consequently, there is uncertainty in most elements of a PSHA model including the seismic source boundaries, the temporal completeness of the catalogue (which in turn influences the calculated recurrence rates), the value of Mmax, and the choice of GMM. These are all examples of epistemic uncertainty, as introduced in Sect. 1.2. Aleatory variabilities are characterised by distributions based on observational data, and they are then incorporated directly into the hazard integrations, influencing, as shown above, the shape of the hazard curve. Epistemic uncertainties are incorporated into PSHA through the use of logic trees, which were first introduced by Kulkarni et al. (1984) and Coppersmith and Youngs (1986) and have now become a key element of PSHA practice. For each element of the PSHA input models for which there is epistemic uncertainty, a node is established on the logic tree from which branches emerge that carry alternative 1 3 models or alternative parameter values. Each branch is assigned a weight that reflects the relative degree of belief in that particular model or parameter value as being the most appropriate; the weights on the branches at each node must sum to 1.0 (Fig. 30 ). The logic tree in Fig. 30 has just four nodes and two branches on each node, which is much simpler than most logic trees used in practice but serves to illustrate the basic concept. The PSHA calculations are repeated for every possible path through the logic tree, each combination of branches yielding a seismic hazard curve; the total weight associated with each hazard curve is the product on the weights on the individual branches. The logictree in Fig. 30 would result in a total of 16 separate hazard curves, which would be associated with the weights indicated on the right-hand side of the diagram. Whereas aleatory variability determines the shape of the hazard curve, the inclusion of epistemic uncertainty leads to multiple hazard curves. The output from a PSHA performed within a logic-tree framework is used to summarise the statistics of the hazard-the annual frequency of exceedance or AFE-for each ground motion level, calculating the mean AFE (Fig. 31 ). For seismic design rather than risk analysis, it could be argued that since the starting point is the selected AFE, the mean ground-motion amplitude at each AFE should be determined instead (Bommer and Scherbaum 2008) . Such an approach would yield appreciably different results, but this is not standard practice, and the mean hazard curve should be calculated as illustrated in Fig. 31 .",

The second decision can be stated in terms of the following question: in light of the unavoidable uncertainty associated with the estimation of the seismic hazard, what degree of confidence is required that the hazard assessment has captured the hazard levels? This is a critical question, and it is the reason that capturing the epistemic uncertainty is one of the most important features of seismic hazard analysis.",

However, if the fractiles are required, then the distinction does become important.

I would propose that the best practice, usually exemplified in large projects for nuclear sites, is excellent, and moreover that it frequently defines the state of the art.

Firstly, there needs to be consistency between the SSC and GMC models, with the latter explicitly considering and accommodating the full range of independent variables defined in the former and vice versa. Consistent definitions of independent variables are also important. For example, if the magnitude scale adopted in the homogenised earthquake catalogue used to derive the recurrence parameters is different from the scale used in the GMMs, an adjustment is required. The easiest option is to use an appropriate empirical relationship between the two magnitude scales to transform the GMM to the same scale as the earthquake catalogue, but it is important to also propagate the variability in the magnitude conversion into the sigma value of the GMM (e.g., . Fortunately, these days such conversions are not often required because most GMMs and most earthquake catalogues are expressed in terms of moment magnitude, M (or M w ).",

            "text": "Another important issue of consistency arises for SSC models that include area source zones because most modern GMMs used distance metrics such as R rup or R jb that are defined relative to extended fault ruptures. The easiest way to integrate over a seismic source zone is to discretise the area into small elements, effectively defining the distance to the site as R epi or R hyp , which then creates an inconsistency with the distance metric used in the GMMs. Some freely available software packages for performing PSHA integrate over areal sources in this way, leading to consistent underestimation of the hazard when deployed with GMMs using R rup or R jb (Bommer and Akkar 2012) . In this case, converting the GMM from a finite rupture distance metric to a point-source metric is not advisable since the variability associated with such conversions is very large (e.g., Scherbaum et al. 2004a) , although it should also vary with both magnitude and distance (e.g., Thompson and Worden 2018) . The approach generally used is to generate virtual fault ruptures within the source zone, the dimensions of which are consistent with the magnitude of each scenario Campbell and Gupta 2018; Fig. 33 ). The availability of PSHA software packages such as OpenQuake with the facility to generate such virtual ruptures facilitates avoidance of this incompatibility in hazard calculations. The specification of the geometry and orientation of the virtual ruptures creates considerable additional work in the construction of the SSC model and the generation of the ruptures also adds a computational burden to the calculations. Bommer and Montaldo-Falero (2020) demonstrated that for source zones that are somewhat remote from the site, it is an acceptable approximation to simply use point-source representations of the earthquake scenarios. Within the GMC model, a potential inconsistency can arise if multiple GMMs are used with different definitions of the horizontal component of motion. Several studies have presented empirically derived conversions between different pairs of definitions (e.g., Beyer and Bommer 2006; Shahi and Baker 2014; Bradley and Baker 2015; Boore and Kishida 2017) , making it relatively easy to adjust all the GMMs to a common definition. However, since some of these conversions apply both to the medians and the sigma values, they should be applied prior to the hazard calculations rather than as a post-processing adjustment.",

Valuable resources to this end are the hazard code validation and comparison exercises that have been conducted by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center in California (Thomas et al. 2010; Hale et al. 2018 ). The second is confirmation that the SSC and GMC models have been correctly entered into the hazard calculation code, which is an important consideration for the logic trees developed for site-specific assessments at the sites of safety-critical structures such as NPPs, which will often have several hundred or even thousands of branch combinations. The GMC model can usually be checked exactly by predicting the median and 84-percentile ground-motion amplitudes for a large number of M-R combinations. For the PSHA for the Thyspunt nuclear site in South Africa (Bommer et al. 2015b) , we performed such a check on the GMC model implementation with two independent implementations external to the main hazard code. For the SSC model, the full logic trees for individual sources were implemented, in combination with a selected branch from the GMC model, in two separate hazard codes by different teams of hazard analysts. The results were compared graphically (Fig. 35) ; the differences were seen to be small and not systematic, with higher hazard estimates being yielded by one code or the other for each source, suggesting that within the tolerance defined by the differences in the algorithms embedded in the codes (and in particular the generation of virtual ruptures), the results could be considered consistent and therefore confirmed the model implementation. While this is more rigorous than the approaches generally applied in PSHA studies, it does provide a robust check; a similar approach was implemented in the PSHA for the Hinkley Point C NPP site in the UK ).",

In other locations, public dissemination of site-specific PSHA reports is less common, but similar value in terms of demonstrating openness can be achieved through publication in the scientific literature of papers describing the studies, as has been done, very encouragingly, for recent hazard assessments at nuclear new-build sites in the UK Villani et al. 2020) . Such articles can also contribute to the assurance associated with the study by virtue of having undergone peer review by the journal prior to publication. I would also note that dissemination of high-level PSHA studies, whether by release of the full reports or through publications in the literature, can also contribute to the improvement of the state of practice.",

In this section, I discuss the development of such logic trees for site-specific hazard assessment. This is not intended as a comprehensive guide on how to construct SSC and GMC models, which would require the full length of this paper. The focus is very specifically on recent developments, most of which have arisen from experience on high-level PSHA projects for nuclear sites, which assist in the construction of logic trees that fulfil their intended purpose. The first sub-section discusses and defines exactly what is the purpose of logic trees, and then their application is discussed for ground-motion predictions in rock, for adjustments for local site effects, and for seismic source characterisation models. The order may seem somewhat illogical since the SSC model would normally be the starting point for a PSHA. The reason for reversing the order here is that recent innovations in GMC modelling have made the construction of logic trees much more clearly aligned with their purpose, and these improvements have also now been adapted to site response modelling; the final subsection discusses the possibility, and indeed the necessity, of adapting the same approaches to SSC modelling.",

The 'centre' could be understood as the model or parameter value considered to be the best estimate or choice for the region or site based on the modeller's interpretation of the currently available data.

For the SSC model, these factors are the location (and hence distance) and recurrence rate of earthquakes of different magnitude, and the maximum magnitude, Mmax. For the GMC model, the factor is the amplitude-defined by the median predictions and the associated sigma values-of the selected ground-motion parameter at the site due to each magnitude-distance pair defined by the SSC model. The logic tree is not intended to be a display and ranking, like a beauty contest, of available models. All available data and models that may be relevant to the characterisation of the hazard at the site should be considered in the development of the logic tree, but there is absolutely no requirement to include all the available models in the final logic tree. Models that are not included in the logic tree are not really being assigned a zero weight, which could be interpreted to imply that the model has been evaluated as irrelevant (possibly by virtue of being very similar to another model that is already included) or unreliable; the model may simply not be needed for the logic tree to capture the full CBR of the variables of interest: earthquake locations and recurrence rates, Mmax, median ground-motion predictions, and sigma in the groundmotion prediction. All models considered should appear in the PSHA documentation but none of them needs to feature in the logic trees, especially if it is finally decided to construct new models instead of using existing ones.",

The weights are assigned as relative indicators of the perceived merit of each alternative model or parameter value; the absolute value of the weights is not the critical feature but rather the ratios of the weights on the branches at each node: a branch assigned a weight of 0.3 is considered three times more likely to be the optimal model or value than a branch with a weight of 0.1. A potential pitfall in debates that focus on the interpretation of logic-tree branch weights is that we can lose sight of the fact that all that matters in the end is the full Fig. 39 Schematic illustration of the concepts of centre, body, and range in relation to the distribution of a specific parameter implied by a node or set of nodes on a logic tree (USNRC 2018) distribution that results from the combination of the branches and their associated weights (i.e., both axes of the histogram in Fig. 39 ).

Such tools are generally not required, however, if the GMC logic tree is constructed by populating the branches with alternative scaled models of a single GMM, which has been given the name of a backbone GMM approach (Bommer 2012) . In its simplest form, the backbone GMM is simply scaled by constant factors, but many more sophisticated variations are possible, with the scaling varying with magnitude and/or distance. In the example shown in Fig. 41 , it can be appreciated that the spread of the predictions increases with magnitude, reflecting the larger epistemic uncertainty where data are sparser. What can also be clearly appreciated is that the relationship between the branch weights and the resulting distribution of predicted accelerations is much more transparent than in the case where the logic tree is constructed using a number of different published GMMs.",

One of these is the fact that in using the latter approach, there is an implicit assumption that the range of predictions from the available GMMs that happen to have been published covers the range of Atkinson (2005) , Atkinson and Boore (2006) , and Boore and Atkinson (2008) (for M 5.5 and M 7.5 plotted against distance; the arrows indicate magnitude-distance combinations for which the three median predictions converge epistemic uncertainty. In practice, this is very unlikely to be the case, and even in regions with abundant ground-motion data, such as California, it is recognised that the range of predicted values from local GMMs, like the NGA-West2 models (Gregor et al. 2014) does not capture the full range of epistemic uncertainty in ground-motion predictions for that region (Al Atik and Youngs 2014) . If the same models are used to populate a GMC logic tree for application to another region (with less abundant ground-motion data), an even broader additional range of epistemic uncertainty is likely to be required. Figure 42 illustrates the backbone GMM model developed in the Hanford PSHA project (PNNL 2014), in which the total range of epistemic uncertainty comes from the inherent uncertainty associated with the backbone GMM in its host region (light grey shading) and the additional uncertainty associated with adjusting the backbone GMM for applicability to source and path characteristics in the target region and to the rock profile at the Hanford site (dark grey shading).",

Many studies have looked into the use of locally recorded ground-motion data to test and rank the applicability of candidate GMMs (Scherbaum et al. , 2009 Arango et al. 2012; Kale and Akkar 2013; Mak et al. 2017; Sunny et al. 2022) .

I believe that this approach should be strongly preferred since the degree to which two regions can be identical in terms of ground-motion characteristics is obviously open to question: if the selection is based on testing that simply identifies the most applicable models (in terms of how well they replicate local data), it does not necessarily mean that these GMMs are genuinely applicable to the target region without further adjustment. Moreover, even if the source and site characteristics of the host and target regions are genuinely similar, it is unlikely that the generic site amplification in any GMM will match the target site characteristics (an issue discussed further in sub-Sect. 5.3). With these considerations in mind, Cotton et al. (2006) proposed a list of selection criteria, all of which were designed to exclude poorly derived GMMs that are unlikely to extrapolate well to larger magnitudes and all the distances covered by hazard integrations, and also to exclude models from clearly inappropriate settings (i.e., subduction-region GMMs for crustal seismic sources). The selected models were adjusted for parameter compatibility, and then adjusted to match the target source, path, and site conditions. Predicted median PGA values from the Hanford GMC logic tree, as a function of magnitude for different distances. The solid black line is the backbone GMM, and the thin black lines the other models from the same host region, which collectively define the inherent uncertainty (light grey shading); the dark grey shading corresponds to the additional uncertainty associated with adjusting the backbone GMM to the characteristics of the target region and site; the dashed, coloured curves are other GMMs not used in the model development but plotted for comparative purposes (PNNL 2014) The general approach proposed by Cotton et al. (2006) has continued to evolve since first proposed, with Bommer et al. (2010) formalising the list of exclusion criteria and making them more specific. The most important developments, however, have been in how to adjust the selected GMMs to the target region and site. Atkinson (2008) proposed adjusting empirical GMMs to better fit local data, starting with inspection of the residuals of the local data with respect to the model predictions. This so-called referenced empirical approach is relatively simple to implement but suffers from important drawbacks: if the local data are from predominantly small-magnitude earthquakes, the approach is not well suited to capturing source characteristics in the target region, and for a site-specific study, unless the local database includes a large number of recordings from the target site, it will not help to better match the target site conditions. Another approach is to use local recordings, even from small-magnitude events, to infer source, path, and site parameters for the target region. The main parameters of interest are as follows:",

Once a suite of such parameters is available, they can be used to generate GMMs through stochastic simulations. Hassani and Atkinson (2018) performed very large numbers of such simulations to generate stochastic GMMs that could be locally calibrated by specifying local values of \u0394 , Q , and 0 . While this is a very convenient tool, the simulations are based on a point-source model of earthquakes, hence finite rupture effects in the near field are not well captured. There is consequently strong motivation to retain the advantages offered by empirical GMMs, which prompted Campbell (2003) to propose the hybridempirical method to adjust empirical GMMs from one region to another. The basis of the hybrid empirical method is to determine suites of source, path, and site parameters (i.e., \u0394 , Q , and 0 ) for both the host and target regions, and then to use these, via FAS-based simulations, to derive ratios of the spectral accelerations in the host and target regions, which are then used to make the adjustments (Fig. 43 ). This is essentially the approach that was used by Cotton et al. (2006) to adjust the selected GMMs to the target region.",

An alternative approach is to select GMMs on the basis of how well suited they are to being modified. As Fig. 43 shows, at the core of the hybrid-empirical adjustments is the assumption that ratios of FAS can serve as a proxy for scaling of response spectral accelerations, Sa. Since the relationship between Sa and FAS is complex (Bora et al. 2016 ), especially at higher frequencies, the method works better if the scaling of Sa implicit in the empirical GMM is consistent with the scaling of FAS from seismological theory. This applies, in particular, to the scaling with magnitude ( Fig. 44) .",

This has the advantage that the uncertainty in the estimates of the parameters such as \u0394 , Q , and 0 can be modelled explicitly, thus creating a more tractable representation of the epistemic uncertainty. For this to be possible, the selected GMM should have a functional form that isolates the influence of individual factors such as \u0394 , Q , and 0 . If such a model can be identified, then the backbone and hybrid-empirical approaches can be combined to construct the logic tree. The adjustable GMM is selected as the backbone and then the GMC logic tree is constructed through a series of nodes for host-to-target region adjustments. The NGA-West2 model of Chiou and Youngs (2014) has been identified as the most adaptable of all current GMMs for active crustal seismicity, having a functional form that both conforms to the scaling illustrated in Fig. 44 and also isolates the influence of \u0394 and Q in individual terms of the model . The Chiou and Youngs (2014) GMM also has the added advantage of magnitudedependent anelastic attenuation, which allows a reliable host-to-target region adjustment for path effects to be made even if only recordings of small-magnitude earthquakes are available. For the stress parameter adjustment, however, the magnitude scaling of stress drop would need to be accounted for in the uncertainty bounds on that node of the logic tree.",

This is not straightforward because determination of the required parameters for the host region would need to have been made assuming geometric spreading consistent with that implicit in the GMM. Moreover, there may be no clearly defined host region, even for a nominally Californian model such as Chiou and Youngs (2014) , since many of the accelerograms in their database, especially for larger magnitudes, were recorded in other parts of the world. Therefore, rather than seeking a suite of source, path, and site parameters for the host region of the backbone GMM, inversions can be performed Fig. 43 Illustration of hybridempirical adjustments to transform a GMM from its host (H) region to the target (T) region where the PSHA is being conducted; FAS is Fourier amplitude spectrum and Sa is spectral acceleration that define a suite of parameters (for a virtual host region) that are fully consistent with the backbone model . Al Atik and Abrahamson (2021) have inverted several GMMs, including Chiou and Youngs (2014) , hereafter CY14, to obtain model-consistent site profiles of shear-wave velocity, V S , and 0 ; Stafford et al. (2022) then used these to invert CY14 for source and path properties. The suites of parameters obtained by Al Atik and Abrahamson (2021) and by Stafford et al. (2022) fully define the host region of CY14; inversion of ground-motion FAS in the target region then allows the construction of a GMC logic tree consisting of successive nodes for source, path, and site adjustments (although, as discussed in sub-Sect. 5.3, the site adjustment should generally be made separately).",

With regards to the first point, it is worth noting that only 8% of the earthquakes in the CY14 database were associated with normal ruptures, so for applications to seismic sources dominated by normal-faulting earthquakes, this might be viewed as an additional source of epistemic uncertainty. Additionally, the derivation of CY14, in line with the earlier Chiou and Youngs (2008) models, assumed that the records with usable spectral ordinates at long periods represented a biased sample of high-amplitude motions; their adjustment for this inference resulted in appreciably lower predicted spectral accelerations at long periods than are obtained from the other NGA-West2 models, and this divergence might also be considered an epistemic uncertainty since both approaches can be considered to be technically defensible interpretations.

In early practice, each published GMM included in the logic tree was accompanied by its own sigma value, but it has become more common practice now to have a separate node for sigma values.

In practice, strong-motion databases tend to include, at most, records obtained over a few decades, and consequently the variation of the ground-motion amplitudes from site to site is used as a proxy for the variation over time at a single location. However, for accelerograph stations that have generated large numbers of recordings, it is observed that the variability of the motions is appreciably smaller than predicted by the ergodic sigmas associated with GMMs (Atkinson 2006) .

Subsequently, as much larger ground-motion datasets became available, it became apparent that the deviations may well be systematic and indicate higher probabilities of these higher residuals than predicted by the log-normal distribution (Fig. 45) . In some projects, this has been accommodated by using a mixture model that defines a weighted combination of two log-normal distributions in order to mimic the 'heavy tails.' Again, this is a refinement that is only likely to impact on the hazard results at low AFEs and in regions of high activity.",

As noted in sub-Sect. 2.2.3, modern ground-motion prediction models always include a term for site amplification, usually expressed in terms of V S30 . For an empirically constrained site amplification term, the frequency and amplitude characteristics of the V S30 -dependence will correspond to an average site amplification of the recording sites contributing to the database from which the GMM was derived. The amplification factors for individual sites may differ appreciably from this average site effect as a result of different layering in the uppermost 30 m and to differences in the V S profiles at greater depth (Fig. 46) . For a site-specific PSHA, therefore, it would be difficult to defend reliance on the generic amplification factors in the GMM or GMMs adopted for the study, even if this also include additional parameters such as Z 1.0 or Z 2.5 . Site amplification effects can be modelled using measured site profiles and this is the only component of a GMC model for which the collection of new data to provide better constraint and to reduce epistemic uncertainty does not depend on the occurrence of new earthquakes. Borehole and non-invasive techniques can be used to measure V S profiles at the site and such measurements should be considered an indispensable part of any sitespecific PSHA, as should site response analyses to determine the dynamic effect of the near-surface layers at the site.",

If the site-specific V S profile is appreciably different from the profile implicit in the GMM used to predict the rock motions, there is an inconsistency for which an adjustment should be made (Williams and Abrahamson 2021; Fig. 47) . In a number of site-specific PSHA studies, this has been addressed by making an adjustment for differences between both the GMM and target V S profiles and between the damping associated with these profiles, in order to obtain the rock hazard, before convolving this with the AFs obtained from SRA for the overlying layers. Such host-to-target V S -adjustments (e.g., Al ) became part of standard practice in site-specific PSHA studies, especially at nuclear sites (e.g., Biro and Renault 2012; PNNL 2014; Bommer et al. 2015b ; Tromans The scheme for including such adjustments to obtain hazard estimates calibrated to the target rock profile and then convolving the rock hazard with the AFs for overlying layers is illustrated in Fig. 48 .",

However, there are practical challenges in the implementation of this approach, the first of which is that neither the GMC model for the baserock horizon nor the site response analyses for the overlying layers can be built until the baserock elevation is selected and characterised. Therefore, the development of the GMC model cannot begin until the site profile has been determined, possibly to considerable depth. Once the baserock is determined, then it is necessary to obtain estimates for the 0 parameter at a buried horizon, which is challenging unless there are recordings from borehole instruments at that horizon or from an accelerograph installed on an outcrop of Upper: V S profiles for the sandy SCH site and the clayey NES site, which have almost identical V S30 values; lower: median amplification factors for the two sites obtained from site response analyses (adapted from Papaspiliou et al. 2012) the same rock (which even then may be more weathered than the buried rock horizon). Several studies have proposed empirical relationships between V S30 and 0 (Van Houtte et al. 2011; Edwards and F\u00e4h 2013b; Laurendeau et al. 2013 ), but these tend to include very few values from very hard rock sites that would be analogous to many deeply buried rock profiles (Ktenidou and Abrahamson 2016) . Consequently, there has been a move towards making the site adjustment in a single step rather in the two consecutive steps illustrated in Fig. 48 . In the two-step approach, there is first an adjustment to the deeper part of the target site profile, through the V S -correction, and then an adjustment to the upper part of the profile through the AFs obtained from SRA. In the one-step approach, the adjustment for the full profiles-extended down to a depth at which the host and target V S values converge-is through ratios of AFs obtained from full resonance site response analyses of both profiles (Fig. 49) ; for the V S -adjustments in the two-step approach, it is common to use quarter-wavelength methods (Joyner et al. 1981) .",

If the target profile is also hard rock and only linear SRA is to be conducted, the inputs can be obtained from stochastic simulations for scenarios identified from disaggregation of preliminary hazard analyses. Alternatively, surface motions at the reference rock profile can be generated from the GMM, since the profile is consistent with the model, and then deconvolved to the base of the profile to define the input to the target profile. The sensitivity to the input motions is likely to be less pronounced that in the two-step case since the site adjustment factors applied are the ratio of the AFs of the host and target profiles. The approach does, however, bring several advantages, including the fact that the reference rock model and the site adjustment factors can be developed in parallel and independently. If the convolution approach-often referred to as Approach 3, as in Fig. 48 , after the classification of methods by McGuire et al. (2021) -is used, then the entire PSHA for the reference rock profile can be conducted independently of the target site characterisation. The GMC logic-tree is constructed by applying host-to-target region source and path adjustments to the backbone GMM, creating a logic tree that predicts motions calibrated to the target region but still for the reference rock profile associated with the GMM. The reference rock hazard therefore does not correspond to a real situation, but this reference rock hazard can then be easily transformed to surface hazard at any target profile. This can be enormously beneficial when hazard estimates are required at several locations with a region, as discussed further in sub-Sect. 6.5.",

This approach is computationally more demanding but can be advantageous when the site adjustment factors depend on the amplitude of the rock motions, for the case of non-linear site response, or depend on magnitude and distance, as has been found to be the case for short-period linear site amplification factors for soft sites .

Uncertainty is usually modelled in the V S profile, as a minimum. Common practice for a long time was to define the V S profile and associated measure of its uncertainty defined as standard deviation of ln(V S ). Profiles were then generated to by randomly sampling from the distribution defined by this standard deviation, superimposing a layer-to-layer correlation structure; the profiles could also include randomisations of the layer thicknesses and also the MRD curves. This procedure, however, treated all of the uncertainty in the site profiles as aleatory variability whereas in fact at least part of this uncertainty is epistemic. Consequently, there has been a move towards adopting logic trees for SRA, a common procedure being to define the best estimate profile and upper and lower alternatives, inferred from in situ measurements (Fig. 50 ). EPRI (2013a) provides guidance on appropriate ranges to be covered by the upper and lower bounds as a function of degree of site information that is available. Assigning weights to V S profiles in a logic tree, however, is in many ways directly akin to assigning weights to alternative GMMs in a GMC logic tree, and the same pitfalls are often encountered. Figure 51 shows the AFs obtained from the three V S profiles in Fig. 50 , from which it can appreciated that at some oscillator frequencies, the three curves converge, suggesting, unintentionally, that there is no epistemic uncertainty in the site amplification at these frequencies. This is the same issue depicted in Fig. 40 and results from constructing a logic tree that does not allow easy visualisation of the resulting distribution of the quantity of interest, in this case the AFs at different frequencies. These observations have prompted the development of what could be considered a 'backbone' approach to SRA, although it is implemented rather differently.",

Site response analyses are then performed for all combinations of branches, which can imply an appreciable computational burden. The output will be a large number of weighted AFs, which are then re-sampled at each oscillator frequency, using a procedure such as that proposed by Miller and Rice (1983) to obtain an equivalent discrete distribution (Fig. 52 ). The computational demand of the required SRA calculations in this approach is significant, although sensitivity analyses can be performed to identify nodes that have little effect on the results, which can then be dropped, and by using simplified schemes to map the influence of the variability in some elements of the model into the distribution directly (e.g., Bahrampouri et al. 2019 ).",

Distinguishing between elements of aleatory variability (which should be included directly in the hazard integrations) and elements of epistemic uncertainty (that are included in the logic tree) is generally quite straightforward for most components of SSC models: for a given source zonation, locations are an aleatory variable, whereas alternative zonations occupy branches of the logic tree; similarly, the hazard calculations integrate over the distribution of focal depths, but alternative depth distributions are included as a node in the logic tree.",

While we know that this is practically impossible, every effort should be made to locate and characterise seismogenic faults whenever possible. In the Eighth Mallet-Milne lecture, James Jackson counselled that to make robust estimates of earthquake hazard and risk one should \"know your faults\" (Jackson 2001) . Jackson (2001) provides an excellent overview of how faults develop and rupture, and how to interpret their influence on landscapes, as well as technological advances-in particular satellite-based InSAR techniques-that have advanced the ability to detect active faults. Most of the examples in Jackson (2001) are from relatively arid regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions. There are other environments in which detection of faults, even if these break the surface in strong earthquakes, can be much more challenging, particularly in densely vegetated tropical regions. For example, the fault associated with the earthquake in Mozambique in 2006 ( Fig. 8 ), which produced a rupture with a maximum surface offset of ~ 2 m, was previously unknown. The earthquake occurred in an active flood plain overlain by thick layers of young alluvial deposits and there was nothing in the landscape to indicate the presence on a major seismogenic fault .",

The location of the DCPP, near San Luis Obispo, on the coast of central California, is in a region that had been studied far less than areas to the north and south, which had been the focus of extensive research by the University of California at Berkeley and UCLA, respectively. The operator of the DCPP, Pacific Gas and Electricity (PG&E), funded major research efforts in central California, many of them through the US Geological Survey (USGS), including installation of new seismograph networks, re-location of earthquake hypocentres, and extensive geophysical surveys. I distinctly recall working with Norm Abrahamson (on another project) in San Francisco one day when PG&E seismologist Marcia McLaren walked in to show Dr Abrahamson a plot of earthquake epicentres, obtained with a new crustal velocity model and advanced location procedures that consider multiple events simultaneously, which appeared to form a straight line adjacent to the shoreline, about 600 m from the NPP (Fig. 53 ). The revelation caused some consternation initially because there was no mapped fault at this location, the seismic design basis for the DCPP being controlled mainly by the scenario of a magnitude M 7.2 earthquake on the Hosgri fault, located about 4.5 km from the power plant (Fig. 54) ; consistent with other NPPs licensed in the USA in the same era, the design basis was deterministic.",

High-resolution magnetic and bathymetric surveys undertaken subsequent to the discovery of the aligned epicentres confirmed the clear presence of this structure (Fig. 55 ). The Shoreline Fault itself is not a very large structure but a scenario was presented wherein a major earthquake on the Hosgri fault would continue along the Shoreline fault, situating an event as large as M 7.5 a few hundred metres from the plant (Hardebeck 2013) .

            "text": "The work undertaken for the ACP identified several large strike-slip faults in central Panama, the most important of which turned out to be the Pedro Miguel fault, which runs approximately north-south and in very close proximity to the new Pacific locks. The fault was identified initially from surface offsets of streams and other geomorphological expressions, followed by an extensive programme of trenching (Fig. 56 ). The evidence all pointed consistently to a long, strike-slip fault that had last undergone major right-lateral slip a few hundred years ago, with evidence for earlier movements of comparable size. Here an interesting side note is in order: when the first trenches were opened and logged, there was some discussion of whether some observed fault displacements had occurred as the result of two large earthquakes at different times or one very large earthquake. Although the latter scenario may appear to be the more extreme scenario, it would actually result in lower hazard than the former interpretation, which may seem counter intuitive to some. The single large earthquake would have very long recurrence interval, whereas the somewhat smaller (but still very substantial) earthquakes imply a higher recurrence rate. Due to the non-linear scaling of ground motions with magnitude (Figs. 21 and 44), the larger magnitude of the less frequent characteristic earthquake would not compensate for the longer recurrence interval, hence in PSHA calculations, higher hazard results from the interpretation of the displacements being due to multiple events.",

The Camino de Cruces was a cobblestone road, built in 1527, that extended from the Pacific coast of Panama almost half-way across the isthmus to the source of the Chagres River. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Spanish conquistadores transported gold, silver, spices and textiles plundered from South America to Panama via ship. The precious cargo was then transported by mule along the Camino de Cruces and then by boat along the Chagres to join ships on the Caribbean coast that would sail the booty to Europe. Exploration of the Camino de Cruces, which is now embedded in the jungle and requires a few hours of hiking to be reached from the nearest road, revealed a 3 m offset of the cobblestones, which aligned perfectly with the orientation and slip direction of the Pedro Miguel fault identified from the trenches (Fig. 57 ). Adjacent stream banks were also displaced by the same amount. Historically, the few damaging earthquakes known to have occurred in Panama were assigned to sources in the ocean to the north or south of the isthmus, which are zones of active tectonic deformation. An earthquake in 1621 was reported to have caused damage, particularly to the old Panama City (located to the east of today's capital) and had been located by different researchers in both the northern and southern offshore deformation zones. However, through careful re-evaluation of the historical accounts of the earthquake effects, V\u00edquez and Camacho (1994) had concluded that the 1621 earthquake was located on land, probably in close proximity to Panam\u00e1 Vieja. This led to the conclusion that the 1621 earthquake had occurred on the Pedro Miguel fault, an earthquake of magnitude ~ 7 along the route of the Panama Canal. The implications of these findings, and the resistance these conclusions have encountered, are discussed further in Sect. 7.2.",

There are also many cases of geological investigations leading to reduced hazard estimates by demonstrating that a fault has a low slip rate and/or low seismogenic potential. Such studies will generally require a well-established geological framework for the region with clear dating of formations or features of the landscape. A good example is the GAM and PLET faults close to the Thyspunt NPP site in South Africa (Fig. 35 ), which were assigned probabilities of only 20% of being seismogenic on the basis of lack of displacements in well-defined marine terraces (Bommer et al. 2015b ).

(2006) , but the 2475-year hazard estimates of Sigbjornsson and Elnashai (2006) for Dubai were very significantly higher.

To perform a sensitivity analysis, we assumed the fault to behave as a characteristic earthquake source and the slip rate was estimated indirectly from the maximum rate that could pass undetected based on the available information. To infer this limiting slip rate, we employed contours of the base of the Tertiary and the approximate base of the Mesozoic rocks that are overlain by sediments known as sabkhas; the latter are composed of sand, silt or clay covered by a crust of halite (salt), deposits that were formed by post-glacial flooding between 10 and 15 Ma ago, hence we conservatively assumed an age of 10 Ma. The Brown (1972) map is at a scale of 1:4,000,000 and it was assumed that any offset in the contours resulting from accumulated slip on the fault would be discernible if at least 1 mm in length on the map, implying a total slip of 4 km and a slip rate of 0.4 mm/year. Additional constraint on the slip rate was inferred from the GPS measurements obtained at two stations in Oman (Vernant et al. 2004 ); making the highly conservative assumption that all the relative displacement is accommodated on the WCF yields a slip rate of 2.06 mm/year, although in reality most of this displacement is actually owing to the rotational behaviour of the Arabian plate. We then assumed a characteristic earthquake magnitude of M 7 \u00b1 0.5; the relationship of Wells and Coppersmith (1994) indicates M 8 if the entire fault ruptures, but such events would be difficult to reconcile with the lack of observed offset. With the slip rate of 0.4 mm/year, the hazard was re-calculated for Dubai: the inclusion of the WCF increased the hazard estimates but even for an AFE of 10 -6 , the increase in the ground-motion amplitude is less than a factor of two. To produce a 475-year PGA for Dubai that would match that obtained by Sigbjornsson and Elnashai (2006) , a slip rate on the fault of 6.0 mm/year would be required.",

This principle was invoked in a site-specific PSHA for the Angra dos Reis NPP in southeast Brazil (Almeida et al. 2019) .

Rather than modelling all of these structures as individual sources, with logic-tree branches for uncertainty in their probability of being seismogenic, slip rates and characteristics magnitudes, their collective impact on the hazard was modelled through an equivalent source zone (red polygon in Fig. 59 ) imposed on top of the other area source zones defined for the PSHA. Each fault was assigned a slip rate, dependent on its length, which would not be inconsistent with the lack of strong expressions in the landscape, and a maximum magnitude inferred from its length. These parameters were then used to define magnitude-recurrence pairs that generated an equivalent catalogue of larger events, for which a recurrence model was derived (Fig. 60 ).

Source zones are generally defined as polygons, within which specified characteristics of the seismicity are assumed to be uniform. One of the common assumptions is that the seismicity is spatially uniform, and earthquakes can therefore occur at any location within the source zone with equal probability. This has often led to the suggestion (by reviewers) that the SSC logic tree should also include a branch for zoneless models, in which the locations of future seismicity are essentially based on epicentres in the earthquake catalogue for the region (e.g., Frankel 1995; Woo 1996) . For a region in which the spatial distribution of seismicity is tightly clustered, the zoneless approaches are likely to yield distinctly different hazard distributions compared to hazard estimates obtained with source zones (e.g., Bommer et al. 1998 ). In my view, however, there should be no automatic imperative to include both source zones and zoneless approaches, because such an admonition places the focus in the construction of the SSC logic tree on selecting and weighting models rather than on the distributions of magnitude, distance and recurrence rate that drive the hazard. There is, in any case, a third option between zoneless approaches and areal source zones, namely zones with smoothed seismicity: source zones can be defined in which certain characteristics are uniform throughout (such as Mmax, style-of-faulting, and focal depth distributions) but with the a-and b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter recurrence relationship varying spatially (Fig. 61) . The spatial smoothing is based on the earthquake catalogue but with the degree of smoothing controlled by user-defined parameters (which is also true of the zoneless approaches).",

When these questions are not answered by the localising structures of active geological faults, the question then arises to what degree is the earthquake catalogue spatially complete? Or expressed another way, can the observed spatial distribution of seismicity be assumed to be stationary for the forthcoming decades covering the design life of the facility under consideration? Spatial completeness can be a particularly important issue in mapping of seismic hazard. In 2004, I served on a panel to review the development of a new seismic hazard map for Italy (Meletti et al. 2008) , an endeavour that was triggered in large part by two earthquakes of M 5.7 earthquake of 31 October and 1 November 2002, which caused the collapse of a school building in San Giuliano and the deaths of 25 children.",

There can be no prescription for how source zones should be defined because the process will necessarily have to adapt to the specific characteristics and data availability in any given application. However, some simple guidelines can assist in creating a more transparent and defensible seismic source zonation, which is fundamental to achieving acceptance of the resulting hazard assessment. Firstly, the study should clearly explain the definition of a seismic source zone being adopted in the study, which needs to be more specific than a bland statement regarding uniform seismicity. The definition should list the earthquake characteristics that are common across a source zone, and those which are allowed to vary, whether through spatial smoothing (for recurrence parameters) or through aleatory distributions (for style-of-faulting, for example). Boundaries between source zones will then logically correspond to distinct changes in one or more of the common characteristics. Secondly, the criteria for defining boundaries should also be clearly specified, together with the data to be used in implementing each criterion. To the extent possible, evidence should be given that demonstrates the role of each criterion in controlling the location, size, and rate of seismicity, either in general or in the region where the study is being performed. These criteria should then be consistently and systematically applied to develop the source zonation model. A good example of both clear definition of source zone characteristics and the application of consistent criteria for their definition can be found in the SSC study for the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS-SSC) project (USNRC 2012a). The discussion of criteria for defining source boundaries and using data to apply these criteria should not give the impression that the process, once defined, can be somehow automated. Inevitably, expert judgement plays a significant role, as discussed further in Sect. 6. The boundaries of seismic source zones are a clear example of epistemic uncertainty, and this is often reflected in the definition of multiple source zonation models with alternative boundaries, especially in site-specific studies for which the configuration of the host zone (containing the site) and its immediate neighbours can exert a strong influence on the hazard results.",

            "text": "As previously noted in Sect. 4.1, for compatibility with the distance metrics used in current GMMs, hazard calculations need to generate virtual fault ruptures within area source zones. The geometry of these virtual ruptures should reflect the geological structure and stress orientations in the region, and their dimensions should be related to the magnitude of the earthquake; for the latter, several empirical scaling relationships are available, including those of Stafford (2014) , which were specifically derived for application in PSHA. Careful consideration needs to be given to the physical characteristics of these Meletti et al. 2008) virtual ruptures, since they are not only a tool of convenience required because of the use of R jb and R rup in GMMs; the ruptures should correspond to physically realisable events. Rupture dimensions are often defined by the total rupture area and source models will generally define the thickness of the seismogenic layer of the crust; consequently, for the largest magnitudes considered, the length may be very considerable, exceeding the dimensions of the source zone within which the rupture initiates. This is usually accommodated by allowing the source zones to have 'leaking boundaries', which means that the ruptures can extend outside the limits of the source zone. This makes it even more important to clearly define the meaning of a source zone since in effect it implies the presence of seismogenic faults that may straddle two or more source zones, but rupture initiations are specified separately within each zone. Particular caution is needed if the host zone is relatively quiet and there are much higher seismicity rates in more remote sources, especially if the specified orientations allow virtual ruptures to propagate towards the site. In one project in which I participated, the preliminary hazard analyses showed major hazard contributions coming from a source zone whose closest boundary was a considerable distance from the site. Disaggregating the contributions from this source in isolation, it became apparent that the ruptures associated with the largest earthquakes in this source were almost reaching the site. The recommendation of Bommer and Montaldo-Falero (2020) to use only point-source representations rather than virtual ruptures in remote source zones eliminates this potential pitfall.",

This becomes akin to a zoneless seismicity model or smoothed seismicity with limited spatial smoothing, which should be justified through a geologic or tectonic explanation for why higher seismic activity is localised in that area. Such technical justifications are particularly needed when the consequence of such small source zones is to maintain the observed seismicity at a certain distance from the site under study. Another issue that needs to be addressed with very small seismic source zones is that for many of the virtual ruptures, the majority of their length may lie outside the source boundaries. This could partially be addressed by assigning smaller Mmax values, but this would also need a robust and independent technical basis rather than simply being an expeditious measure to accommodate the decision to define a source zone of small area.",

For a single seismic source zone, the hazard curve obtained at a site scales directly with the exponent of the activity rate (a-value) of the Gutenberg-Richter recurrence relationship. The rates of future earthquakes are generally inferred from the rates of past earthquakes, both for fault source and area sources, hence the reliability of the hazard assessment will depend on the data available to constrain the rate and the assessment of the associated uncertainty. Focusing on source zones rather than fault sources, the recurrence model relies on the earthquake catalogue for the region. As already noted in Sect. 3.3, instrumental monitoring of earthquakes has been operating for at most a few decades in many parts of the world, which is a very short period of observation to serve as a basis for establishing long-term rates. The catalogue can usually be extended through retrieval and interpretation of historical accounts of earthquake effects; the very first Mallet-Milne lecture by Nick Ambraseys was largely devoted to the historical seismicity of Turkey (Ambraseys 1988) . This work revealed that the 20 th Century had been an unusual quiescent period for seismicity in southeast Turkey, for which reason the instrumental earthquake catalogue was a poor indicator of the long-term seismic hazard in the region, where several large earthquakes has occurred in the nineteenth Century and earlier (Ambraseys 1989) .",

The earthquake catalogue for this region was very sparse but investigations were undertaken that established that this was not the result of absence of evidence for seismic activity. By identifying the locations at which newspapers and other records were available over different historical periods and noting that these did include reports of other natural phenomena (Albini et al. 2014) , the absence of seismic events was confirmed, thus corroborating the low recurrence rates inferred from the catalogue. Without this evidence for the absence of earthquake activity, broad uncertainty bands on the recurrence model would have been required, inevitably leading to increased seismic hazard estimates.",

The estimation of completeness periods is a key source of epistemic uncertainty in the derivation of recurrence rates, but this uncertainty can be constrained by establishing probabilities of earthquake detection over different time periods based on the operational characteristics of seismograph networks and the availability of historical records. The uncertainty in magnitude values, whether the standard error of instrumentally determined estimates or the standard deviation in empirical relations to convert other magnitudes to moment magnitude (or to convert intensities for the case of historical events), should also be taken into account. These uncertainties are usually assumed to be symmetrical (normally distributed) but they lead to errors because of the exponential nature of earthquake recurrence statistics (i.e., because there are more earthquakes at smaller magnitudes). The effect of this uncertainty is to alter the activity rate-upwards or downwards-but it does not alter the b-value (Musson 2012b); however, if the magnitude uncertainties are not constant, which will often be the case, then the b-value is also affected (Rhoades 1996). Tinti and Mulargia (1985) proposed a method to adjust the magnitude values to correct for this uncertainty; in the CEUS-SSC project, Bob Youngs developed an alternative approach that adjusts the effective rates (USNRC 2012a).",

Ideally, the recurrence parameters should also be coupled with Mmax values, which will generally be the case when the penalised maximum likelihood approach is used.

The key to the backbone approach is a more transparent relationship between the models and weights on the logic-tree branches and the resulting distribution of parameters that move the needle in the hazard calculations. For a given source configuration, a backbone approach is easily envisaged. Stromeyer and Gr\u00fcnthal (2015) actually proposed an approach that would qualify as a backbone approach: in the first step, the uncertainty in the a-and b-values is propagated, through their covariance matrix, to the estimates of rate at any fixed value of magnitude. The one-dimensional distributions of rates are then re-sampled at each magnitude into an equivalent distribution following Miller and Rice (1983) ; this is directly comparable to the way that the distribution of AFs is re-sampled at each oscillator frequency in the approach of Rodriguez-Marek et al. (2021a; Sect. 5.3) .",

Since the alternative zonations will automatically overlap one another, the logic tree is unlikely to satisfy the MECE criterion. With multiple source zone configurations, it also becomes more difficult to visualise the distributions of location and recurrence rates simultaneously. Maps could be generated that depict the effective rate of earthquakes of a specified magnitude over a spatial grid (Fig. 64 ), but it would be challenging to represent this information for the full range of magnitudes simultaneously. Herein may lie an interesting challenge for researchers working in the field of seismic source modelling: to develop visualisation techniques that would enable the full implications of an SSC logic tree, in terms of space and rate over the full range of magnitudes from M min to Mmax, to be visualised.

In Sect. 5, I have discussed current approaches to the construction of logic trees, the tool ubiquitously employed in site-specific PSHA projects to manage epistemic uncertainty.

The compilation and assessment of existing data is a non-negotiable part of any seismic hazard study, and the collection of new data, particularly for site-specific studies for important facilities, is strongly recommended. However, it is also important to be conscious of the fact that the data will never be sufficient-at least not in any foreseeable future-to allow the unambiguous definition of the unique models for the characteristics and rates of potential future earthquakes and for the ground motions that such events could generate. Consequently, there is always epistemic uncertainty, and the full distribution of epistemic uncertainty cannot be objectively measured. For some practitioners and researchers, this seems to be difficult to accept. Examining the performance of GMMs against local ground-motion data may usefully inform the process of constructing a GMC logic-tree but any quest for a fully objective and datadriven process to select and assign weights to models to occupy the branches is futile. Similarly, procedures to check the consistency of source models with the available earthquake catalogue may also be usefully informative-subject to various assumptions regarding the completeness of the catalogue-but I would argue that at most such techniques can demonstrate that a source model is not invalid (which is not the same as validating the model); this seems to be reflected in the change from \"objective validation\" to \"objective assessment\" in the titles of the papers proposing such testing of source models by Musson (2004) and Musson and Winter (2012) .",

Put bluntly, multiple expert hazard assessments should not be conducted as a plebiscite or referendum. Some confusion around this issue arose because of an unfortunate use of words in the original SSHAC guidelines-discussed below-which stated the goal to be capture of the centre, body, and range of the informed technical community (or CBR of the ITC; Budnitz et al. 1997) . The intent of this wording was to imply that the study should capture the full distribution of uncertainty that would be determined by any group of appropriately qualified and experienced subject-matter experts who became informed about the seismicity of the region and seismic hazard of the site through participation in the assessment. Regrettably, this intent was often overlooked and the objective of capturing the CBR of the ITC was interpreted as meaning that the views of all experts in the field should be reflected in the logic tree. Such a view may be admirably inclusive and democratic but is unlikely to lead to a robust scientific characterisation. This is important in the context of this paper that is focused on achieving acceptance of the results of seismic hazard assessments, since one could easily lean toward favouring an approach that ensured that many views and models from the broad technical community were included on the basis that this might lead to broader acceptance (if one assumes that all the experts whose views were included would look positively on their preferred model being part of a broad distribution rather than clearly identified as the best model). My view is that we should always make the best possible scientific assessments, and that we should conduct these assessments and document them in ways that are conducive to their acceptance, but the scientific assessment should never be compromised by the desire to achieve acceptance.",

A final closure letter from the PPRP indicating concurrence that the technical bases of the PSHA input models have been satisfactorily justified and documented, that the hazard calculations have been correctly performed, and that the project was executed in accordance with the requirements of the SSHAC process, is generally viewed as the key indicator of success. Since the PPRP is, in effect, the arbiter for adherence to process, there is very serious onus on the PPRP to diligently fulfil the requirement of their role, always maintaining the delicate balance between engagement with the project and independence from the technical work. The role of the PPRP Chair, who is charged with steering the review panel along this narrow path, is possibly the most challenging, and in some ways most important, position in a SSHAC hazard study.",

The intent was that the greater investment of time and resources at the higher study levels would lead to an enhanced probability of regulatory assurance (which, for NPP sites, is the essential level of acceptance of a site-specific PSHA). The enhanced assurance is assumed to be attained by virtue of the higher-level studies being more likely to capture the CBR of TDI, although this remains the basic objective at all study levels.",

A decade after the original guidelines were issued, USNRC convened, through the USGS, a series of workshops to review the experience of implementing the guidelines in practice. The outcome of these workshops was a series of recommendations (Hanks et al. 2009 ), the most important of which was that detailed guidelines were also required for Level 3 studies. This led the drafting of NUREG-2117 (USNRC 2012b), which provided clear guidance and checklists for the execution of both Level 3 and Level 4 seismic hazard studies. A very significant development was that in NUREG-2117, the USNRC made no distinction between Level 3 and Level 4 studies in terms of regulatory assurance, viewing the two approaches as alternative but equally valid options for reaching the same objective. The key difference between Level 3 and 4 studies is illustrated in Fig. 67 : in a Level 4 study, each evaluator/ integrator expert, which may be an individual or a small team, develops their own logic tree for the SSC or GMC model, whereas in a Level 3 study the evaluator/integrators work as a team to produce a single logic tree. In a Level 4 study, there are interactions among the evaluator experts but also with a Technical Integrator Facilitator (TFI), sometimes individually and sometimes collectively.",

            "text": "From a logistical point of view, the Level 4 process is rather cumbersome and Level 3 studies have been shown to be considerably more agile. Moreover, the role of TFI is exceptionally demanding, considerably more so than that of the TI Leads or even the PTI in a Level 3 study. In my view, the Level 3 process offers two very significant advantages over Level 4, in addition to the points just noted. Firstly, if the final logic tree in a Level 4 is generated by simply combining the logic trees of the individual evaluator experts, then it can become enormous: in the PEGASOS project, the total number of branch combinations in the full logic tree was on the order of 10 26 . Such wildly dendritic logic trees pose enormous challenges from a computational perspective, but their size does not mean that they are more effectively capturing the epistemic uncertainty. Indeed, such an unwieldy model probably makes it more difficult to visualise the resulting distributions and inevitably limits the options for performing sensitivity analyses that can provide very valuable insights. The second advantage of Level 3 studies is the heightened degree of interaction among the evaluator experts. In a Level 4 study, there is ample opportunity for interaction among the experts including questions and technical challenges, but ultimately each expert is likely to feel responsibility for her or his own model, leaving the burden of robust technical challenge to the TFI. In a Level 3 study, where the experts are charged to collectively construct a model that they are all prepared to assume ownership of and to defend, the process of technical challenge and defence is envigorated. Provided the interactions among the experts take place in an environment of mutual respect and without dominance by any individual, the animated exchanges and lively debates that will usually ensue can add great value to the process. In this regard, however, it is important to populate the TI Teams with individuals with diverse viewpoints who are prepared to openly debate the technical issues to be resolved during the course of the project. If the majority of the TI Team members are selected from a single organisation, for example, this can result in a less dynamic process of technical challenge and defence, especially if one of the TI Team members, or indeed the TI Lead, is senior to the others within their organisation.",

The insights and lessons learned from these applications led to the drafting of NUREG-2213, which includes detailed guidance on all four study levels, including Level 1, for which the requirements may surprise some people since there seemed to have been a view in many quarters that any PSHA not specifically characterised as SSHAC Level 2, 3 or 4, would, by default, be a SSHAC Level 1, which is very much not the case.",

For plants east of the Rocky Mountains, the studies were based on the CEUS-SSC model, which was the outcome of a regional SSHAC Level 3 study, and regional GMMs for hard rock (EPRI 2013b). The application and adaptation of these regional SSC and GMC models to each site were carried out as Level 2 studies, generally focusing on the modification from the reference hard rock condition of the GMMs to local site conditions. This highlighted the need to provide clear guidance on how to conduct Level 2 studies, which is now provided in NUREG-2213. More recently, USNRC commissioned a study to explore the application of the SSHAC Level 2 procedures to site response analyses for PSHA, the findings of which are summarised in a very useful and informative report .",

In order to bridge this gap, the current SSHAC implementation guidelines allow for enhanced Level 2 studies in order to provide recognition for studies conducted fulfilling all of the requirements of a Level 2 study but also availing themselves of some the additional benefits to be accrued by including elements of a Level 3 study. Prior to the issue of NUREG-2213, a number of PSHA projects made the claim to be a Level 2 + or Level 2-3 study, but there was no basis for such qualifications. The augmentations might include enlarged TI Teams, PPRP observation (by one or two representatives of the panel) at some working meetings, and one or more workshops (a Level 3 study is required to conduct three formal workshops with very specific scopes and objectives). While a Level 3 study should continue to be viewed as the optimal choice to achieve regulatory assurance for a site-specific PSHA at a nuclear site, encouragement should be given to all studies that can move closer to this target, and in that regard the option of an augmented or enhanced Level 2 study is a positive development. In effect, this is the approach that has been applied at some UK new-build nuclear sites (Aldama-Bustos et al. 2019).",

I am cautious because I would not want this to be invoked as a justification for any company or utility that simply wants to minimise investment in the seismic hazard study for their site, but I will assume that if these suggestions are taken up in practice, it would be for the technical reasons I am laying out. The SSHAC Level 3 process is built around three formal workshops (Fig. 68) ; the normal format is for the SSC and GMC workshops to be held back-to-back, which has logistical advantages in terms of mobilisation of the PPRP, overlapping for joint sessions at Workshops 1 and 3. These common days for both teams are designed to facilitate identification of interfaces between the two components of the PSHA input models and to discuss hazard sensitivities. I would strongly favour maintaining these two workshops in any study, although it should be possible in many circumstances to combine the kick-off meeting and Workshop 1. Within this general framework, however, I think there could be significant benefits in structuring the main body of the process in different 1 3 ways because of the very different nature of SSC and GMC model building. The SSC process tends to be data driven, with the TI Team evaluating geological maps, fault studies and geochronology data, geophysical databases (elevation, gravity, magnetism, etc.), and the historical and instrumental earthquake catalogues, as well as models proposed for regional tectonic processes and seismogenic potential of key structures. On the GMC side, the database is generally limited to ground-motion recordings and site characterisation, and much of the work lies in developing the framework for how to build the models for reference rock motions and for site amplifications. I would argue that advances made in these areas in recent years are beginning to reach a kind of plateau in terms of establishing an appropriate basic framework (as presented in Sects. 5.2 and 5.3), which will be refined but possibly not fundamentally changed.",

If this is the case, the work of the GMC TI Team will focus on using the available groundmotion data and site characterisation (V S and lithology profiles, local recordings to infer kappa, and, in some cases, dynamic laboratory tests on borehole samples to constrain MRD curves). Such endeavours may not be particularly assisted by the conduct of a formal GMC Workshop 2 and are generally better advanced through formal and informal working meetings (with PPRP observers present at the former). At the same time, for key issues on the SSC side, workshops that extend beyond the usual three days may be very useful, especially if there is the flexibility to break out from the formality of these workshops. Imagine a case, for example, where one or two faults close to the site potentially exert a controlling influence on the hazard but their seismogenic potential is highly uncertain. In such a situation, an alternative format could be 'workshop' that began with a day of presentations on what is known about the structures, followed by a one-or two-day field trip to visit the structures in the field, possibly including what geologists sometimes refer to as a 'trench party', and then another day or two of working meeting in which the observations could be discussed by the SSC TI Team and several Resource and Proponent Experts. This more flexible approach might lead to the GMC sub-project being classified as an augmented Level 2 study, whereas the SSC sub-project could effectively exceed the basic requirements for a Level 3 study. The classification that would then be assigned to the whole process is not clear although it would perhaps be discouraging for a study organised in this way to only be given Level 2 status. There may be a case, in the next iteration of the SSHAC guidelines, to provide more flexibility for how the central phase of a Level 3 study is configured, allowing for differences in how the SSC and GMC sub-project navigate the route between Workshops 1 and 3.",

The CEUS-SSC model (USNRC 2012a) was produced through a SSHAC Level 3 project and the EPRI (2013b) GMC model was generated through a SSHAC Level 2 update of GMMs that had been produced in an earlier Level 3 study (EPRI 2004) and then refined in a Level 2 update (EPRI 2006b). The EPRI (2013a) GMC model has since been superseded by the SSHAC Level 3 NGA-East project Youngs et al. 2021) . In view of the large number of NPP sites east of the Rocky Mountains, the use of regional SSC and GMC SSHAC Level 3 studies, locally updated through Level 2 projects, was clearly an efficient way to obtain reliable hazard assessments in a relatively short period of time. Such a use of regional SSC and GMC models developed through Level 3 studies to be updated by local Level 2 studies is illustrated in Fig. 69 . An alternative scheme is for the seismic hazard at all the sites in a region to be evaluated simultaneously in a single project, an example of which is the recently completed SSHAC Level 3 PSHA that was conducted for the six NPP sites in Spain; this was made possible because the study was commissioned by an umbrella organisation representing all the utilities who own and operate the different plants.",

The seismic hazard only reports the effects of these uncertainties, it does not create or expand them\". The starting point for any seismic hazard study should be a recognition that there are epistemic uncertainties, and the study should then proceed to identify and quantify these uncertainties, and then propagate them into the hazard estimates. But the objective is always to first build the best possible input models for PSHA and then to estimate the associated uncertainty (in other words, all three letters of the acronym CBR are equally important). The purpose of the SSHAC process is not only to capture uncertainties, and it is certainly not the case that one should automatically expect broader uncertainty bands when applying higher SSHAC study levels. In the not-too-distant past, the indications are that many seismic hazard assessments were rather optimistic about the state of knowledge and how much was truly known about the seismicity and ground-motion amplitudes in a given region. Attachment to those optimistic views regarding epistemic uncertainty have prompted some of the opposition to the SSHAC process, as discussed in Sect. 7.2.",

For example, for the GMC model, one might look at the range of epistemic uncertainty in the NGA-West models, as measured by the model-to-model variability (rather than their range of predicted values), and then make the inference that since these models were derived from a data-rich region, their uncertainty range should define the lower bound on uncertainty for the target region. However, there are many reasons why such an approach may not be straightforward. Firstly, the uncertainty defined by the NGA-West2 GMMs displays a trend of decreasing in the magnitude ranges where the data are sparser, although this is improved with application of the Al Atik and Youngs (2014) additional uncertainty penalty (Fig. 71) . Secondly, the site-specific PSHA might be focused on a region that is much smaller than the state of California for which the NGA-West2 models were developed (using a dataset dominated by other regions in the upper range of magnitudes). The dynamic characterisation of the target site is also likely to be considerably better constrained than the site conditions at the recording stations contributing to the NGA-West2 database, for which just over half have V S30 values inferred from proxies rather than measured directly .",

In general, such comparisons are not likely to provide a particular useful basis for assessing the degree of uncertainty in a site-specific study, and certainly it would be discouraging to suggest that the uncertainty captured in hazard estimates for other sites should define the minimum threshold, unless one were able to access such information for a study in which there was abundant seismological and excellent site characterisation information, whence the uncertainty might then be taken as a minimum threshold. Otherwise, an expectation of matching some threshold level of uncertainty might remove the motivation to collecting new data and performing analyses that would help to constrain the model and reduce the uncertainty. At the end of the day, the onus lies with the PPRP to make the judgement as to whether the uncertainty bounds defined are consistent with the quality and quantity of the information available for the hazard assessment. In site-specific PSHA studies in which I have participated, there have been occasions when the PPRP has questioned uncertainty ranges for potentially being too broad as well as the more commonly expected case of challenging uncertainty intervals viewed as being too narrow.",

There are important differences between PSHA and DSHA but turning the choice between the two approaches into an issue that takes on almost ideological overtones does nothing to promote seismic risk mitigation, as discussed in Sect. 3.1. McGuire (2001), a pioneer and proponent of PSHA, presents a very balanced discussion of how both deterministic and probabilistic approaches to seismic Fig. 71 Model-to-model variability of median predictions at a site with V S30 = 760 m/s from four NGA-West2 models (see Fig. 21 ) with and without the additional epistemic uncertainty intervals proposed by Al Atik and Youngs (2014) , for strike-slip earthquakes of different magnitude on a vertically dipping fault hazard and risk analysis can be useful for different types and scales of application. Articles by the advocates of DSHA have tended to adopt a less constructive attitude towards probabilistic approach and have generally tried to utterly discredit PSHA (e.g., Krinitzsky 1995a Krinitzsky , 1995b Krinitzsky , 1998 Krinitzsky , 2002 Paul 2002; Casta\u00f1os and Lomnitz 2002; Wang et al. 2003; Peresan and Panza 2012; Stein et al. 2012; Wyss et al. 2012; Bela 2014; Mulargia et al. 2017) . While some of these articles are amusing to read, none of them take us any closer to seismic hazard assessments that enable risk-informed decision making that optimises the use of limited resources. For the reader with time to spare, I would particularly recommend the paper by Panza and Bela (2020) and its 105-page supplement, which offers very interesting insights.",

The first two bullets, which respectively claim that PSHA underestimates and overestimates the hazard, warrant some brief discussion. Regarding the first bullet, the accusation is essentially that PSHA is unsafe whereas DSHA somehow provides a greater level of assurance. In some cases, earthquakes have occurred that exceed the size and location of potential future events defined in seismic hazard models; examples of this are highlighted in Fig. 62 . Another example of this is the March 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake in Japan, which exceeded the magnitude of the earthquake defined as the design basis for the Fukushima Daiichi NPP, which resulted in the tsunami defences being inadequate (although, as explained in Sect. 1, the resistance to ground shaking was not exceeded). These are, however, examples of shortcomings in how the hazard has been estimated-and perhaps in particular how uncertainties have not been adequately characterised-rather than an inherent failure of the PSHA approach (Geller 2011; Stein et al. 2011; Hanks et al. 2012) . Other examples cited in the ISSO statement refer to cases of recorded ground motions exceeding ground motions specified in probabilistic hazard maps. Such comparisons overlook the nature of probabilistic seismic hazard maps-which are not predictions much less upper bound predictions-and are not a meaningful way to validate or invalidate a PSHA-based hazard map (e.g., Iervolino 2013; Sect. 12.3 of Baker et al. 2021 ). The only meaningful comparison between recorded motions and probabilistic hazard maps would be that proposed by Ward (1995) : if the map represents motions with a 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years (i.e., a return period of 475 years), then one should expect motions in 10% of the area to exceed the mapped values during an observational period of 50 years. The misleading claim by the proponents of DSHA is that it leads to seismic safety by establishing the worst-case ground motions, something which is clearly not the case, although its application will also be very conservative in many situations (only the degree of conservatism will be unknown).",

Indeed, while scenario-based hazard assessments have their place (see Sect. 9), it is high time that the use of DSHA as the basis for establishing design ground motions, especially for safety-critical structures, should be abandoned. In this regard, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could play an important role. IAEA guidelines on seismic hazard assessment for nuclear sites still allow DSHA, which is unavoidable for as long as this is viewed as an acceptable approach by nuclear regulators in any member country. However, the current guidelines also encourage comparison of the results obtained with the two approaches: \"The ground motion hazard should preferably be evaluated by using both probabilistic and deterministic methods of seismic hazard analysis. When both deterministic and probabilistic results are obtained, deterministic assessments can be used as a check against probabilistic assessments in terms of the reasonableness of the results, particularly when small annual frequencies of exceedance are considered\" (IAEA 2010) . Exactly what is meant by the term 'reasonableness' is not clarified but it would seem more appropriate to specify that the PSHA results should be disaggregated (which is mentioned only in an Appendix of SSG-9) and to evaluate the M-R-triplets controlling the hazard, rather than to compare the PSHA results with the ground motions that would have been obtained by arbitrarily selected values of these three parameters. Nuclear safety goals should ultimately be defined in probabilistic terms and probabilistic estimates of risk cannot be obtained using the outputs from DSHA. And in terms of safety goals, PSHA offers a rational framework to select appropriate safety targets and the level of confidence that the selected target is being reached (Fig. 32) .",

As noted in Sect. 6.4, the final logic tree resulted in branch combinations exceeding Avagadro's number, which created severe computational challenges. When the results were released, they met with stern and sustained opposition led by Dr Jens-Uwe Kl\u00fcgel (Kl\u00fcgel 2005 (Kl\u00fcgel , 2007 (Kl\u00fcgel , 2008 (Kl\u00fcgel , 2011 , representative of one of the Swiss NPPs (and, coincidentally, a signatory to the ISSO statement discussed in Sect. 7.1). The basic motivation for Dr Kl\u00fcgel's crusade was very clear: the PEGASOS results represented a very appreciable increase in the existing seismic hazard assessment for the Swiss plants (Fig. 72) . The plants were originally designed using deterministic hazard estimates but in the 1980s, PSHAs were performed to provide the input to probabilistic risk analyses (PRA); the PEGASOS results were significantly higher.",

However, none of these exchanges touched the core issue: the old hazard results being defended were incorrectly calculated. As shown in Fig. 73 , it was possible to reproduce the hazard curve from the 1980s PSHA, based on the available documentation, but only by neglecting the sigma in the GMM-which does not, by any modern standard, constitute a PSHA. When the hazard calculations were repeated assigning an appropriate sigma value, the median hazard curve at the surface was slightly higher than that obtained from the PEGASOS calculations. This information was shared with Dr Kl\u00fcgel but had no effect on his campaign to invalidate the hazard results from PEGASOS.",

To fully appreciate the challenge that this new data presented, it is helpful to understand the historical context. Following the failure of the French project to build the Panama Canal, the canal was eventually built by the United States, in what was truly a colossal engineering project that involved the creation of a new country (prior to November 1903, Panama was a province of Colombia) and the effective annexation of part of that country by the US (the Panama Canal zone). Before embarking on the project, two separate groups had lobbied for different routes for an inter-oceanic canal through the isthmus of Central America, one in Panama and the other in Nicaragua. On the day that the US Senate finally came to vote on which route to adopt, the Panamanian option was selected by 42 to 34 votes. On the morning of the vote, senators had received postcards with Nicaraguan postage stamps depicting active volcanoes (Fig. 75) , which is believed to have swayed several undecided lawmakers to vote in favour of the Panama option. For the history of how There is no doubt that the Central American republics to the north of Panama are tectonically very active: destructive earthquakes are frequent occurrences in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and the official crests of all these nations depict volcanoes. By contrast, seismicity during the instrumental period has been very much lower in Panama (Fig. 76) . However, the choice of Panama over Nicaragua as the canal route seems to have established in the Panamanian psyche not so much that Panama is of lower hazard-or, more accurately, that destructive earthquakes in Panama are less frequent-than its neighbours, but rather that it is actually aseismic. During one of my visits, I encountered a magazine in my hotel room extolling the benefits of Panama as an ideal location for holidays or retirement, in which one of the headline claims was as follows: \"Panama has no hurricanes or major earthquakes. Panama is even blessed by nature. It is the only country in Central America that is absolutely hurricane-free. Panama also has none of the destructive earthquakes that plague its Central American neighbors. Your Panama vacation will never have to be re-scheduled due to natural events. Your property investment will always be safe.\" In light of this widely held view in Panama, it is perhaps not surprising that the implications of the paleoseismological studies were met with disbelief and denial.",

(2018) documented observations in the major excavations created for the approach channel for the new Pacific locks, and concluded that the Pedro Miguel fault was not present, countering the recommendation to design the dam that would contain the channel for up to 3 m of fault displacement. This has been taken up by some in Panama to call for a new revision of the hazard map and building code without the Pedro Miguel fault as a seismic source. However, while there may be uncertainty about the structure and location of the Pedro Miguel fault and its splays (which could question the fault slip specified for the dam design), the evidence from many other locations for the existence and recent activity of this fault is compelling and has important implications for seismic hazard; this impressive body of evidence is difficult to discount on the basis of observations at one location. The evidence that supports the existence of the fault is also consistent with an updated understanding of the tectonics of Panama, which rather than being a rigid microplate bounded by active offshore regions (e.g., Adamek et al. 1988) , is now understood to be undergoing extensive internal deformation (Rockwell et al. 2010b ), which could be expected to produce faults with multiple splays, some of which may have been exposed in the excavations studied by Schug et al. (2018) . The debate regarding the Pedro Miguel is likely to continue for a while yet but with several major engineering projects underway in central Panama-including another bridge crossing the canal and the westward extension of the Metro system-it is an issue with farreaching consequences.

The most straightforward and unambiguous test is direct comparison of the hazard curve with the recurrence frequencies of different levels of ground motion calculated from recordings obtained at the same site over many years. Such empirical hazard curves have been generated for the CU accelerograph station in Mexico City by Ordaz and Reyes (1999) , as shown in Fig. 78 . The agreement between the empirical and calculated hazard is reassuring but it can be immediately noticed that the hazard curve is only tested in this way for return periods up to about 35 years, reflecting the time for which the CU station, installed in 1962, had been in operation. Fujiwara et al. (2009) and Mak and Schorlemmer (2016) applied similar approaches to test national hazard maps, rather than sitespecific estimates, in Japan and the US, respectively. In practice, statistically stable estimates of the return periods of different levels of motion require observation periods that are much longer than the target return period: Beauval et al. (2008) conclude that robust constraint of the 475-year hazard would require about 12,000 years of recordings at the site of interest. For the return periods of interest to safety-critical infrastructure-which for NPPs is on the order of 10,000 years or more-it becomes even more unlikely that sufficient data are available. Moreover, for genuine validation the recordings would need to have been obtained at the same site, which would require incredible foresight or extremely good luck to have had an accelerograph installed at the site several decades before the facility was designed and constructed.",

            "text": "Many researchers have tried to extend the period for which empirical observations are available by using intensities rather than ground-motion recordings to test seismic hazard estimates. While much longer periods of macroseismic observation are available in many regions of the world, the approach either requires the intensities to be transformed to ground-motion parameters using empirical relationships (e.g., Mezcua et al. 2013) , which introduce large uncertainties, or by performing PSHA in terms of intensity (e.g., Mucciarelli et al. 2000) . Hazard calculated in terms of intensity is of little use as engineering input and it is also difficult to establish whether intensity-based hazard is consistent with hazard in terms of response spectral accelerations, not least because the variability associated with intensity predictions is generally normal rather than the lognormal distribution of ground-motion residuals (which are therefore skewed towards larger absolute values). The simple fact is that we will likely never have the required data to genuinely validate seismic hazard estimates-and if we did, we could dispense with PSHA and simply employ the data directly. Testing of individual components of Fig. 78 Comparison of hazard curve for PGA obtained from PSHA with empirical estimates of exceedance rates of PGA obtained from recordings at the same location (redrawn from Ordaz and Reyes 1999) the hazard input models is often worth pursuing-see, for example, the proposal by Schorlemmer et al. (2007) for testing earthquake likelihood models-but our expectations regarding the degree of validation that is obtainable should be kept low. Oreskes et al. (1994) provide a sobering discussion of verification and validation of models in the Earth sciences, concluding that \"what typically passes for validation and verification is at best confirmation, with all the limitations that this term suggests.\" Oreskes et al. (1994) define confirmation as agreement between observation and prediction and note that \"confirmation is only possible to the extent that we have access to natural phenomena, but complete access is never possible, not in the present and certainly not in the future. If it were, it would obviate the need for modelling.\"",

The proposals are to use Bayesian updating to modify the hazard modelsessentially to change the weights on logic-tree branches-using observational data (e.g., OECD 2015; Secanell et al. 2018) . I should clarify that I have no fundamental objection to Bayesian methods or to their application to engineering seismology. Based on experience as an expert witness in a dispute involving extensive damage to a power plant caused by a large earthquake in southern Peru in 2001, where the closest ground-motion recording was obtained at 70 km, I have proposed a Bayesian approach to estimating the ground shaking levels at the site of interest from multiple datasets and modelling (Bommer and Stafford 2012) . Without over-extending this discussion, I would raise two objections to Bayesian updating of PSHA input models: (1) the same data should not be used to develop and to test a model, so to apply such techniques requires a conscious decision to leave some data aside when developing the SSC and/or GMC models, which runs contrary to the principle of establishing the best-constrained models possible; (2) down-weighting or even removing logic-tree branches based on short-term observations will influence the long-term hazard estimates in ways that are difficult to justify. Bayesian modification of PSHA input models has been largely proposed and promoted by the French nuclear industry and may well be a response to regulatory transition in that country from being one of the last bastions of DSHA to a gradual adoption of probabilistic approaches. Fortunately, the approach has gained little traction globally and has not been widely adopted.",

            "text": "There is, however, one perfectly legitimate use of empirical data to limit hazard estimates in PSHA, and it corresponds, paradoxically, to cases of ground motions at very long return periods and very high amplitudes of shaking. During the early decades of strong-motion recording (from 1933 to the mid-1960s), expectations of the largest possible motions were strongly correlated with the maximum recorded amplitudes ). Nowadays, large-amplitude recordings (PGA > 1 g, PGV > 100 cm/s) are no longer a surprise-and due to spatial variability, we should probably expect to see even larger amplitudes. However, there are likely to be physical bounds on the levels of motion that can be recorded in earthquakes, due to three factors: (1) the most intense seismic radiation that can emanate from the source of the earthquake; (2) the interaction of radiation from different parts of the source and from different travel paths; and (3) the limits on the strongest motion that can be transmitted to the surface by shallow geological materials (Bommer et al. 2004b) . The need to impose physical constraint on very low probability hazard estimates was highlighted by the PSHA for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada (Stepp et al. 2001 ). Due to the long design life of the post-closure facility and the need for very low probability of failure, the hazard calculations were extended to annual exceedance frequencies of 10 -8 , leading to ground motion levels that very likely exceed physical limits (Andrews et al. 2007) . Physical limits on the levels of ground shaking that could occur at Yucca Mountain were estimated from the accelerations that would have toppled precariously balanced rocks (e.g., Brune 1999) and other fragile geological features that can be reliably aged, thus allowing the hazard estimates to be capped (Baker et al. 2013; Fig. 79) . Such geological indicators of limiting ground-motion amplitudes have since been used in seismic hazard assessments for the Diablo Canyon NPP in California (Rood et al. 2020) and other facilities (Stirling et al. 2021) . Physical limits on ground motions related to the limited strength of near-surface deposits have been explored from the perspective of site response analyses and the maximum accelerations that can be transmitted (e.g., Pecker 2005).",

In 2012, the Arag\u00f3n government announced a project to build a new public hospital in the city of Teruel. Due to the location in the lowest hazard region of Spain (PGA < 0.04 g), the NCSE-02 building code did not require seismic design. However, Sim\u00f3n et al. (2016) published a study of the Concud fault, which is located some 400 m from the hospital site, from which it was inferred that it undergoes alternating periods of fast (0.53 mm/year) and slow (0.13 mm/year) slip, currently being in a fast slip phase. Following a very unconventional procedure, Sim\u00f3n et al. (2016) developed a linear recurrence relationship combining their geological data with regional seismicity data at lower magnitudes-referring to the concept of characteristic earthquakes but completely ignoring the model formulation proposed by Youngs and Coppersmith (1985) -and then used this Fig. 79 Mean hazard curve at Yucca Mountain in terms of PGV, compared with unexceeded ground motions inferred from precariously balanced rocks (PBR) and lithophyse (LMT is lower mean tuff properties for these fragile geological features) using different approaches for calculating their fragility (Baker et al. 2013) to determine the earthquake magnitude with a 500-year recurrence interval (a completely erroneous attempt to determine the hazard for the 475-year return period specified in the Spanish building code), yielding a result of magnitude 5.33. Empirical prediction equations are then used to estimate an intensity of VII (actually 7.4) and this was then transformed to a PGA via an outdated empirical correlation model between these two parameters (Sim\u00f3n G\u00f3mez et al. 2014 ). This updated hazard assessment caused the hospital construction to be suspended.",

In September 2004, during filling of the Ito\u00edz reservoir located about 20 km north of the fault, a sequence of moderate earthquakes occurred, prompting a request from the Spanish Ministry of Environment for a PSHA for the Ito\u00edz dam site, which was carried out by the Spanish geological survey (IGME). Field work undertaken by IGME concluded that none of the faults in the region of the dam showed evidence of Quaternary displacements with the exception of the Leyre fault, which was considered capable of producing earthquakes as large as M 6.6 \u00b1 0.26 with a recurrence interval of 6,000 years. Garc\u00eda-Mayordomo and Insua-Ar\u00e9valo (2011) conducted a PSHA with area source zones and the Leyre fault as a distinct source (Fig. 81) , noting that \"Even though the recent activity of the fault is still under investigation, it was decided to take a conservative approach and consider it in the hazard calculations\". The result of the PSHA was a 1,000-year PGA at the Ito\u00edz dam site that was twice the acceleration specified in the NCSE-02 building code. However, the new hazard model for the Ito\u00edz dam site had a collateral impact regarding the design of the Yesa dam, located just 2.5 km south of the fault (Fig. 81) , which at the time was being raised from a height of 78 m to 108 m to double the capacity of the reservoir. The indication of a highly active fault so close to the dam raised doubts regarding the project to increase the dam height. However, subsequent investigations of the thrust (i.e., shallow-dipping reverse) fault by Carbonel et al. (2019) demonstrated that the Leyre fault is not active, highlighting the fact that offsets on faults are not necessarily indicators of seismogenic activity since they can also result from non-seismogenic processes such as evaporite dissolution, salt movement, and landslides. Moreover, fault plane solutions for earthquakes in the region-including the Martes earthquake of July 1923 (Fig. 81b )-consistently show normal-faulting mechanisms rather than reverse (Stich et al. 2018) . Another controversial Spanish fault features prominently in the case history presented in Sect. 12.3.",

The final zonations-from Zone 4 to Zone 1 in order of increasing hazard-were assigned at the level of municipalities, requiring that for any municipality crossed by a PGA contour defining the boundaries between one zone and another, a choice was made regarding which zone to assign. A national zonation was proposed (Fig. 82 ) but under legislation that devolves a degree of power to the regions of Italy, each region could move municipalities into an adjacent zone at their own discretion. Several municipalities were consequently downgraded to lower hazard: 63 in the Province of Trento were moved from Zone 3 to Zone 4 and six in Sicily were assigned to Zone 2 instead of Zone 1. In the region of Basilicata, however, just before the deadline for finalising the national hazard zonation, four municipalities were raised from Zone 2 to Zone 3 (Fig. 83) . One of these was the municipality of Scanzano Jonico, which had been designated by the Council of Ministers as the selected site for a national repository for high and intermediate nuclear waste (Peruzza and Pessina 2016) . Legislation regarding the waste repository forbid the construction of such a facility in hazard Zones 3 and 4, hence the deft upgrading of Scanzano Junico resulted in the automatic cancellation of the waste repository project.",

I do refer to many of the landmark papers that have been published in this field-and a number of my own papers too since I am presenting my own perspectives on this topic-but several readers are likely to consider that I have missed some key citations, for which I can only apologise. I would, however, point the reader to excellent overview and review papers that have been published and which help one to navigate through the enormous body of published literature (e.g., Suckale 2009; Ellsworth 2013; Davies et al. 2013; Keranen and Weingarten 2018; Foulger et al. 2018) , and I trust that new overview papers will appear in due course to maintain and update the condensed road maps for those seeking to extract the essence from the ongoing research in this field.",

In the case of reservoir-induced seismicity, the earthquakes occur in the same way as tectonic events through fault rupture, the primary mechanism triggering the fault slip being an increase in pore pressure due to infiltration of water driven by the hydraulic gradient created by the reservoir.",

The first very clearly identified case of seismicity induced by fluid injection was at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Denver, Colorado, where waste fluid from weapons production was injected in a 3.6 km disposal well. The injections began in March 1962 and within a few months gave rise to numerous seismic events, the larger of which were felt by local residents (Healy et al. 1968 ). The injections were finally suspended in February of 1966, but seismicity continued for some time afterwards, the largest event (M 4.8) occurring in August 1967. This prompted an experiment conducted between 1969 and 1980 in the Rangley oilfield in northwest Colorado as a collaboration between the USGS and Chevron, to explore the Fig. 86 Mohr's circle diagram illustrated how elevation of pore pressure, leading to a reduction in effective stresses, can bring a fault to failure (Rubinstein and Babaie Mahani 2015); \u03c3 1 and \u03c3 3 are the maximum and minimum normal stresses, and the symbols with primes correspond to the effective stresses relationship between in situ stress, fluid injections, and fault slip potential based on friction coefficients measured on laboratory tests of rock samples (Raleigh et al. 1976 ). The experiments confirmed that the faults slipped when the pore pressure reached the estimated level required to overcome the shearing resistance.",

This is illustrated by the Mohr's circle diagram in Fig. 86 . There are several mechanisms through which the pore pressure within the fault can be raised, the most rapid being direct injection into the fault plane itself, as is believed to have happened in the Pohang enhanced geothermal project that has been linked to a destructive earthquake of M 5.5 (Lee et al. 2019) . The injected fluid can also migrate through existing networks of fractures connecting the well to the fault (Igonin et al. 2021) . Stresses can also be transferred statically through poro-elastic deformations; this mechanism can act in unison with dynamic fluid pressure transfer (Kettlety and Verdon 2021) . Another mechanism that has been identified for stress transfer is through aseismic fault slip resulting in increased stress on another fault (Bhattacharya and Viesca 2019) .",

            "text": "Regardless of the specific mechanism, the changes in pore pressure or stress due to the injections are generally small in comparison with existing stresses within the Earth's crust. Consequently, earthquakes will generally only occur on faults that are already critically stressed, meaning that they are already close to rupture as a result of tectonic stresses and the fact that the fault is favourably orientated with respect to the existing stress field. Viewed from this perspective, the timing of the earthquakes may be controlled by the anthropogenic activities, but it would not be correct to say that the earthquakes are caused by the injections since it is the existing state of stress on the fault that is ultimately responsible for producing an earthquake. Very small-magnitude events, which are usually referred to as micro-seisimicity and are only be detected by sensitive downhole seismic instruments (e.g., Maxwell et al. 2010) , may be properly referred to an induced seismicity, but the larger events-and particularly those that are felt, and which generate societal and regulatory concern-are more correctly described as triggered earthquakes. Dahm et al. (2013) defined triggered earthquakes as follows: \"Triggered earthquakes occur on favourably oriented faults in agreement with the existing regional or local background stress field and geological structure. Their magnitude is not controlled by human-induced stress changes, which only cause the event nucleation. However, the human-induced stress changes have the potential to advance failure on an active fault that is prone to natural failure in the future.\" However, it is common practice to refer to such earthquakes as induced seismicity, and this convention is also followed herein. One argument in favour of using the terminology of induced seismicity, as pointed out by Rubinstein and Babaie Mahani (2015), is that the term triggered earthquakes is already used in seismology to describe earthquakes that result from stress transfer caused by one fault rupture to another fault (e.g., Stein et al. 1997) .",

            "text": "In closing this discussion, a point to stress is that induced seismicity can be caused by a variety of anthropogenic processes. While fracking is one such process, on a global scale it is neither the primary cause of induced earthquakes nor the cause of the largest induced earthquakes, even though the media often portrays it as the main cause of induced seismicity. Schultz et al. (2020a, b) note that barely 1% of hydraulic fracturing wells around the world have caused induced seismicity. Hydraulic fracturing appears to be the primary cause of induced earthquakes in the WCSB, but elsewhere this is not the case. In the Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, for example, induced seismicity is mostly the result of saltwater injection-when crude oil is extracted from the ground it is generally accompanied by saltwater, sometimes in even larger quantities than the oil itself such as in the Rubiales and Quifa fields in Colombia (Molina et al. 2020) , which is separated and usually injected into disposal wells. Rubinstein and Babaie Mahani (2015) report that only 10% of the saltwater injected in Oklahoma is produced by hydraulic fracturing. However, the media still insists on making direct or insinuated connections to fracking even when it is not remotely involved. By way of illustration, following the 2018 Newdigate earthquakes in southern England-discussed further in Sect. 8.2-Richard Selley, Emeritus Professor of Petroleum Geology at Imperial College London and resident of the affected area-was interviewed on site for television news. Professor Selley's opening statement was to clarify that there were no hydraulic fracturing operations in the area and therefore no connection of the seismicity with fracking; the interview was broadcast in the evening news in its entirety, minus this opening statement.",

Firstly, for the science of understanding the processes by which earthquakes are induced and the factors that influence these processes to advance, the starting point must be the clear identification-to the extent possible, since ambiguity will exist in some cases-of earthquakes whose occurrence is related to an anthropogenic activity. Analyses that correlate tectonic earthquakes with industrial processes would only serve to create confusion. Secondly, reliable identification of induced earthquakes is fundamental to developing confidence in the management of the associated risk: classifying induced seismicity as natural will aggravate public mistrust if the classification is subsequently proven wrong, and incorrectly classifying earthquakes as induced will lead to unwarranted concern. Finally, if measures are to be taken to mitigate the risk due to induced seismicity through control of the hazard (see Sect. 10.1), the efforts are likely to be in vain if the earthquakes are, in fact, of tectonic origin. And the inevitable failure of the mitigation measures would thus undermine confidence in the possibility of controlling induced seismicity.",

Another very clear case is the observed seismicity in the Quifa and Rubiales oilfields in Colombia mentioned above, which are located in a region of very low natural seismicity and where there are very pronounced spatial and temporal correlations of the observed earthquakes with the massive saline water re-injections (G\u00f3mez Alba et al. 2020; Molina et al. 2020) . When the earthquakes occur in a region where tectonic seismicity is also observed, distinguishing induced events can become more challenging and it becomes necessary to identify clear correlations between the observed seismicity and parameters that characterise the injections and, in some cases, hydrological and/or geological factors (e.g., Oprsal and Eisner 2014; Goebel et al. 2015; McClure et al. 2017; Hincks et al. 2018; Grigoratos et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "Ultimately, the goal would be to determine whether the pore pressure and/or stress changes on the fault or faults that produced the earthquakes could have been caused by the fluid injections. Since pressure measurements on the faults are generally not available, the determinations usually require the use of hydrological and geomechanical models to represent the fluid pressure propagation and the response of the crustal rocks to the pressure changes. Dahm et al. (2015) developed an approach that is based on calculation of the geomechnical perturbation due to oil extraction in order to determine whether the location and mechanism of an induced earthquake is consistent with the pressure changes associated with hydrocarbon production. By comparing these stress changes with the long-term rate of stress increase due to tectonic processes, the approach of Dahm et al. (2015) allows the probability of the earthquake being induced to be calculated. The method was applied to three earthquakes that occurred close to hydrocarbon fields, the largest of which was the Emilia-Romagna earthquake of 20 May 2012. This M 6.1 earthquake was followed by several aftershocks, the largest of which occurred on 29 May 2012 with M 5.9, these two largest events resulting in extensive damage and 27 fatalities. The main aftershock and several of the smaller aftershocks occurred close to the Cavone oil field (Fig. 87) . Pezzo et al. (2013) concluded that the earthquake sequence was consistent with the long-term seismicity of the region and Caputo et al. (2012) (Albano et al. 2017a) 1 3 trenches following the earthquake, confirming that previous sequences of large earthquakes had occurred in the same area. The location of the 29 May event close to the Cavone oil field seems to have been the result of stress transfer due to the main shock on 20 May (Ganas et al. 2012; Pezzo et al. 2013) ; the main shock was located about 18 km away from the field. Although the western part of the aftershock distribution partially coincided with the Cavone field, none of the early papers on the source characteristics and rupture mechanism of the earthquakes even mentioned the oil field let alone a possible causative relationship of the earthquakes with hydrocarbon production. Nonetheless, in December 2012, the Italian Civil Protection Department formed, at the request of the President of the Emilia-Romagna region, an international panel of experts to investigate a possible connection between the oil fields and the seismic sequence. Given that the sequence began with a mainshock at an appreciable distance from the oil field and triggered a sequence of aftershocks that propagated towards the oil field, it may seem rather strange that the question was even asked. Dahm et al. (2015) , who considered only the depletion of the reservoir and not the re-injection of salt water, concluded that there was a less than 1% probability that the earthquakes were triggered by hydrocarbon production. In a separate study, Albano et al. (2017a, b) modelled the impact of wastewater injections in the Cavone field and concluded that these would have caused stress changes on the fault associated with the mainshock rupture that would have been less than 10% of the stress transfer from the M 4.5 earthquake that occurred on an adjacent fault about 10 months earlier (Fig. 87c) . Both Dahm et al. (2015) and Albano et al. (2017a) conclude, therefore, that the earthquake sequence was of tectonic origin and unrelated to the activities in the oil field.",

The panel (ICHESE, International Commission on Hydrocarbon Exploration and Seismicity in the Emilia Region), issued its report in February 2014, concluding that \"the seismic process that began before May 20 th , 2012 and continued with the sequence of earthquakes in May-June 2012 is statistically correlated with increases in production and injection in the Cavone oil field.\" The report states less emphatically that the mainshock of 20 May 2012 could have been triggered by fluid extraction and injection, and then makes several recommendations about the need for data to be provided by the operators and research that should be undertaken (and presumably funded). The report did lead to media reports that the earthquakes could have been caused by the operations in the oil field (e.g., https:// www. thelo cal. it/ 20140 415/ oildrill ing-may-have-trigg ered-deadly-italy-quakes/) and led the region of Emilia Romagna to impose a ban on all drilling. The subsequent scientific studies published by Dahm et al. (2015) and Albano et al. (2017a) have not vindicated the conclusions of ICHESE. Exactly how ICHESE came into being is not entirely clear but in a letter from the Italian Department of Energy (part of the Ministry of Economic Development) referring to the work of the Commission, it refers to the panel of experts by the name it was originally assigned: Commissione Internazionale sull'esplorazione di idrocarburo e l'aumento della sismicit\u00e0 in Emilia del 2012 (International Commission on Hydrocarbon Exploration and Seismicity Increase in Emilia), which would seem to imply that the conclusion of the panel's work was already foreseen in its initial title.",

            "text": "In April 2018, an earthquake sequence began close to the village of Newdigate in Surrey, UK, to the south of London, with several events reported by the British Geological Survey with M L > 2 and the largest reaching M L 3.2. The earthquake sequence, which continued into 2019, occurred a few kilometres away from two small oil fields, Brockham and Horse Hill. Concerns were raised by a small group of UK academics regarding a possible connection between the hydrocarbon fields and the seismicity. The forum selected by this group to share this view was a letter in The Times newspaper on 6 August 2018 arguing that a \"moratorium on drilling, re-injection and flow testing should be put in place immediately and remain in force until the records of fluid injection and local faulting activity have been comprehensively surveyed and interpreted, and the triggering mechanism for this quake cluster properly understood.\" By throwing this cat among the pigeons, the authors of the letter created a serious dilemma for the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) that regulates hydrocarbon production in the UK-as well as potentially threatening the livelihoods of employees of the small companies operating these oil fields. The OGA convened a workshop with 40 invited participants, including the authors of the letter (www. ogaut hority. co. uk/ news-publi catio ns/ news/ 2018/ oga-newdi gate-seism icity-works hop-3-octob er-2018/), the workshop report stating that, with one exception \"The workshop participants concluded that, based on the evidence presented, there was no causal link between the seismic events and oil and gas activity\" (the exception being the lead author of the letter). A study published subsequently in a mainstream seismological journal concluded that it was indeed unlikely that the earthquakes had been induced (Hicks et al. 2019) , although dissenting views have been expressed in a chapter of a slightly obscure book (Westaway 2020) and on a blog (www. geosi erra. com/ news. html); the prevailing scientific view remains that there was no causative link between the oil fields and the earthquake sequence. The case raises an interesting question of the weight that should be given to different sources when classifying earthquakes as induced. The Human-Induced Earthquake Database (HiQuake; https:// induc edear thqua kes. org/; Foulger et al. 2018) lists the Newdigate earthquakes as induced; while the database acknowledges the conclusion of the OGA workshop on 3 October 2018, it cites three references in support of the events being induced: the lead letter writer's presentation at that workshop and missives from the same individual, and colleagues, sent to the UK parliament and to Surrey County Council in 2019; the Hicks et al. (2019) paper is not cited. 1 To my mind, any catalogue of induced earthquakes needs to indicate the relative confidence with which the classification is made, which in cases of controversy should clearly reflect when this is a minority view-and especially if the view is not supported by peer-reviewed publication. I was very surprised to find the 2007 M L 4.3 Folkestone earthquake on the south coast of the UK (Sargeant et al. 2008 )-very likely a similar event to the 1580 Dover Straits earthquake that many believe Shakespeare alluded to in Romeo and Juliet-is also classified as induced, the cause being attributed to coastal engineering. The Internet facilitates the dissemination of unfounded claims of anthropogenic causes for seismicity, particularly by those who already oppose the industrial activity in question, and if these are then picked up by mainstream media, can rapidly gain traction. A case in point was a tectonic M 6.5 earthquake in Botswana in April 2017, which was attributed the extraction of gas from coal (e.g., www. thega zette. news/ latest-news/ ckgrgas-mining-linked-to-earth quakes/) although its natural origin has been clearly confirmed (Albano et al. 2017b) .",

            "text": "The purpose of the apparent detour in the previous paragraph is related to the simplified discrimination scheme of Davis and Frohlich (1993) . At the OGA workshop on the Newdigate earthquakes, the scheme was used by different speakers both to make the case for the earthquakes being induced and to demonstrate that they were most likely of natural origin. This prompted three participants at the workshop, including myself, to undertake a critical assessment of the Davis and Frohlich (1993) approach and to propose some modifications. The key shortcomings identified were as follows: (1) the scheme assigns zero whether there is no information to enable a response or whether the information available strongly suggests that the earthquakes are of natural origin; (2) the scheme gives equal weight to all questions even though some pieces of evidence may be much stronger indicators than others; (3) the final 'score' is not easily interpreted. In the proposed update of the scheme, Verdon et al. (2019) addressed issue (1) by assigning negative points for evidence supporting a conclusion of natural seismicity, issue (2) by allowing different maximum numbers of negative or positive points for the response of each question in accordance with how persuasive each item of evidence is perceived to be, and issue (3) by expressing the final outcome-the Induced Assessment Ratio (IAR)-as a percentage of the maximum possible score. To facilitate the interpretation of the IAR, Verdon et al. (2019) also defined a second index, the Evidence Strength Ratio (ESR), to reflect the information available for the assessment as a proportion of the information that would be ideally available. Applied to the Newdigate sequence with the information available in June 2018, the ESR scores for the Brockham and Horse Hill oil fields were 46% and 20% respectively, yielding IAR values of \u2212 8% and 15% for the two fields. By October 2018, the ESR for both fields had increased to 87% and the IAR values were \u2212 33% and \u2212 79%, supporting the conclusion that the earthquakes were of natural origin.",

The seismicity attributed to hydraulic fracturing in the Sichuan basin has included events of M L 5.7 (M 5.3) in December 2018 and M L 5.3 in January 2019 (Lei et al. 2019) , which are the largest events that have been linked to hydraulic fracturing globally (Schultz et al. 2020a, b) . On 17 June 2019 there was another earthquake, some 15 km to the north, with magnitude M 5.8. Jia et al. (2020) recognised the correlation between the overall intensity of the injections and the elevated seismicity in the region, but they conclude that this large event was likely due to water injections related to salt mining in the region, a conclusion also supported by Wang et al.

The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) imposed restrictions in Subsurface Order no. 6 (SSO6) on hydraulic fracturing around the Brazeau hydroelectric dam in Canada, which forbid any wells within 3 km of the dam and its appurtenant structures, and additionally prohibited wells in the deep Duvernay shale formation within 5 km (Fig. 88) . The specifications of SSO6 recognise the extensive induced seismicity that has been observed due to hydraulic fracturing in the Duvernay formation (e.g., Bao and Eaton 2016) and simultaneously the lower tendency for induced earthquakes in the shallower formations above the Duvernay. Applications for hydraulic fracturing wells targeting relatively shallow Cretaceous formations in the grey shaded area of Fig. 88 were opposed by the owner of the Brazeau dam, leading to regulatory hearings convened by the AER to determine whether the proposed wells would pose a seismic risk to the Brazeau dam facility. Ghofrani and Atkinson (2020) published a study that associated earthquakes in the WCSB with hydraulic fracturing wells in these Cretaceous formations, which then served as the starting point for the hazard and risk assessments to support the dam owner's position. The method of Ghofrani and Atkinson (2020) was to calculate weights specifying the temporal and spatial correlation of earthquakes in the regional catalogue to hydraulic fracturing (HF) operations, considering wells in the different formations separately. The weights are assigned as 1.0 for a separation distance of 3 km or less and for a time interval between HF operations and the earthquakes of 5 days or less; with increasing distance and time, the two weight functions decay, the final weight, W, being simply the arithmetic mean of the two. A value of 0.35 for W is described by Ghofrani and Atkinson (2020) \"as passing a reasonable threshold for association\"; this value could be obtained by an earthquake occurring at 20 km from a HF well within 10 days of stimulation or by an earthquake occurring at 4.5 km from a well within 90 days of stimulation. The application of the method results in a small number of M \u2265 3.0 events that are assigned to HF wells in the Cretaceous formations, although these events were not listed in the paper. Verdon and Bommer (2021b) applied the Ghofrani and Atkinson (2020) algorithm using the same earthquake catalogue and database of wells in the region, and then individually examined the cases found to score above the threshold value of W. All of the earthquakes were found to be much more clearly associated with HF wells in the deeper Duvernay or Montney formations or else with wastewater injections in deeper formations. In their reply, Ghofrani and Atkinson (2021) supplied a list of the identified events, in which they include a single earthquake of magnitude greater than 3 associated with the Mannville and Cardium formations that were the subject of the AER hearings, namely the M 3.8 Ferrier earthquake of 10 March 2019, which, as Ghofrani and Atkinson (2021) acknowledge, is most likely of natural origin, given its reliably determined focal depth of 14 km. The implications of the erroneous associations for hazard and risk estimation are discussed further in Sect. 9.",

In PSHA studies for natural seismicity, the earthquake rates are inferred from past observations of earthquakes as reflected in the instrumental and historical earthquake catalogues. The same approach can be applied to include induced seismicity in hazard assessments: for example, in the United States, one-year hazard forecasts have been formulated based on observed induced seismicity during the previous year (e.g., Petersen et al. 2017) . Such an approach requires the assumption that the seismicity will remain stationary-and implicitly, therefore, that the industrial operations will also not change-and only provides a short-term assessment. Whereas natural seismicity is characterised by observing the average numbers of earthquakes per year (resulting from continuous tectonic processes), the equivalent observational metric for induced seismicity should be related to the operations. The capacity to estimate the hazard for future operational scenarios is enhanced by relating the observations of induced earthquakes to a characteristic of the fluid injections, such as estimating the seismicity rates per well, for example, which can then be converted to rates per year on the basis of the foreseen number of wells per year. The seismogenic index, \u03a3 , proposed by Shapiro et al.

Although understanding of the geological and operational factors that influence induced seismicity is continually improving (e.g., Hincks et al. 2018; Keranen and Weingarten 2018; Ries et al. 2020) , we are still a long way from being able to predict a priori the seismic response to fluid injections. Hydrological modelling of fluid pressure migrations can estimate pore pressure increase on known faults, albeit that this will require assumptions regarding rock permeabilities. This information can be combined with evaluation of the slip tendency of faults-based on their orientation and the tectonic stress field (e.g., Morris et al. 1996) -to estimate the likelihood of the injections leading to activation of mapped faults. However, since only the larger faults are likely to be identified and since the uncertainties associated with such models will usually be considerable, such analyses cannot be relied on as a basis for estimating induced seismicity characteristics from future operations in the absence of any empirical data.",

Silva et al. (2021) performed a probabilistic risk analysis for possible future hydraulic fracturing in Manaus, Brazil, and captured the uncertainty in rates of induced seismicity through logictree nodes for \u03a3 (taking values between \u2212 0.5 and \u2212 2.5) and the Gutenberg-Richter b-value (taking values between 0.7 and 1.6). These logic-tree branches do reflect the epistemic uncertainty in these parameters, but for induced earthquakes of magnitude 5 and larger (Dinske and Shapiro 2013) the ratio of the highest to lowest recurrence rates is greater than 3 million. Moreover, their logic tree also includes a node to capture the possibility that the hydraulic fracturing injections do not cause any induced seismicity, assigned a weight of 0.997. As noted earlier, Schultz et al. (2020a) report that globally only about 1% of hydraulic fracturing wells have caused earthquakes, so unless there is a basis to adjust this probability, perhaps based on factors such as lithology or depth of the formation, the first node of the hazard logic-tree would always assign a probability of ~ 0.99 to there being no induced seismicity. From the perspective of risk management, however, hazard estimates covering such a wide range of possibilities may not be particularly informative. In such circumstances, I would argue that a scenario-based approach is preferable, considering earthquakes with a range of magnitudes (see Sect. 9.2 for a discussion of maximum magnitude) and estimating the impact that each of these would have on the exposed building stock in the region, were they to occur. Such analyses could provide insights into the risks that induced earthquakes could pose and also identify the magnitude thresholds at which these risks would be unacceptable, thereby informing the design of mitigation measures (see Sect. 10).",

For cases where seismicity cannot be associated with known geological faults, estimation of Mmax is more challenging and a variety of approaches have been proposed that include extreme value statistics applied to the earthquake catalogue (Kijko 2004 ) and regional analogues (e.g., Wheeler 2016).

For the case of wastewater injection-induced seismicity in Oklahoma and neighbouring states, where induced events have reached M 5.7 (e.g., Keranen et al. 2013) , this may be a reasonable assumption, but for many other applications it could be grossly conservative. In the Groningen gas field, for example, the largest earthquake that has occurred was of magnitude M L 3.6 (M 3.5), whereas regional seismic hazard assessments for natural earthquakes have assigned values of Mmax \u2265 6.5 (Woessner et al. 2015) . The distribution of Mmax estimates defined by a specialist panel engaged specifically to address this issue, includes a long tail to cover the range of possibilities in terms of triggered tectonic earthquakes-and also influenced by the possibly spurious analogue of the magnitude 7 Gazli, Uzbekistan, earthquakes of 1976 and 1984 that have been tentatively linked to gas production (Simpson and Leith 1985) but the lower end of the distribution was only fractionally above the largest observed event, and the highest weight assigned to a magnitude just one unit greater than the largest Fig. 90 Schematic illustration of contributions to the hazard of a PGA value of 0.1 g as a function of the total number of earthquakes of different magnitude (grey) and the probability of exceedance related to the number of standard deviations required to reach that level of acceleration (orange); the hazard contributions by magnitude (blue) are the product of the two (Minson et al. 2021) observed event (Fig. 91 ). If the approach of adopting the same Mmax distribution defined for tectonic seismicity had been followed, all the risk calculations would have included the impact of earthquakes of magnitudes from 4.5 up to 6.5, even though there is a very clear possibility that earthquakes of this size will never-and indeed, could not-occur in relation to the gas extraction. 2 In my view, consideration should always be given to a distribution of Mmax values with the lower bound close to the size of the largest earthquakes that have actually been observed, rather than to suggest that the lower bound estimate of Mmax is two or three magnitude units greater than the largest observed event.",

This hypothesis has been contested by van der Elst et al.

            "text": "There are at least two reasons why smaller Mmax values could be justified for induced seismic hazard and risk analysis than those used in PSHA for natural seismicity. Firstly, the operations-particularly in the case of hydraulic fracturing for shale gas recovery or enhanced geothermal systems-may be short lived, so the question should change from what is the largest earthquake that could occur during the present tectonic regime, to what is the largest event that could occur during these injections and the ensuing period of pressure equalisation? The response to such a question might be better provided by the concept of the maximum expected earthquake rather than the maximum possible earthquake (Holschneider et al. 2011) . Secondly, most injections occur at relatively shallow depths compared to the mid-crustal depths at which large tectonic earthquakes tend to initiate, with the fault rupture propagating mainly upwards (e.g., Mai and Thingbaijam 2014) . This is not to say that downward propagating fault ruptures do not exist: for example, several of the larger earthquakes that occur in the ancient crust of western Australia have very shallow focal depths (Leonard 2008) . The 1968 M 6.5 Meckering earthquake is believed to have been associated with a downward propagating fault rupture (Vogfj\u00f6rd and Langston 1987) and the M 6.0 2016 Petermann Ranges earthquake was associated with a rupture 20 km in length confined to the top 3 km of the crust . In California, Lomax (2020) calculated a focal depth of just 4 km for the M 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake, \"implying nucleation in a zone not conducive to spontaneous, large earthquake rupture nucleation and growth.\" However, Lomax (2020) argued that this shallow hypocentre resulted from stress transfer due to a deeper (12 km) foreshock of M 6.4, without which rupture initiation of a large event at such shallow depth would not have occurred. Such cases remain the exception rather than the rule: in the database of more than 50 finite rupture models for both strike-slip and dip-slip earthquakes of Mai et al. (2005) , in only six of the cases is the hypocentre located in the upper third of the rupture width and none in the top 15% of the rupture width. Therefore, in most settings it would seem that triggering large earthquakes by initiating faults ruptures at shallow depth would be rather unlikely.",

            "text": "Hazard and risk assessments often require the prediction of ground-motion amplitudes for earthquakes of very shallow focal depth and of smaller magnitude than might normally be considered when dealing with natural seismicity. For many years, GMMs were generally developed for application to earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 to 5.0 or greater, reflecting the widely used values of M min (see Sect. 3.2). Using the Euro-Mediterranean ground-motion database to derive GMMs for magnitudes 5.0-7.6 and then for magnitude 3.0-7.6, Bommer et al. (2007) demonstrated that extrapolation of the equations derived from regression on larger magnitude overestimate the ground motions not only for smaller magnitudes but also at the lower limit of the upper magnitude range (M ~ 5). Chiou et al. (2010) made a similar finding by extending the Chiou and Youngs (2008) NGA-West2 using recordings from smaller magnitude events in California, and also finding differences between northern and southern Californian data that did not persist at larger magnitudes. The overestimation is now understood in terms of non-linear magnitude scaling of ground motions, already shown in Fig. 21 , which also persists in the smaller magnitude range (Douglas and Jousset 2011; Baltay and Hanks 2014) . The NGA-West2 GMMs accommodated these lessons through extension to much lower magnitudes (3.0-3.5), making them more suitable for such applications. Douglas et al. (2013) developed GMMs for application to induced earthquakes associated with geothermal projects using a global database of recordings from such earthquakes as well as some induced earthquakes related to other processes. The highly heterogeneous database and poor characterisation of most of the recording sites resulted in models with very large sigma values. For the Groningen gas field, we identified the need for applicationspecific GMMs given that the recorded motions-probably due to specific features of the uppermost crustal structure-displayed systematic differences even with respect to induced earthquakes in other Dutch gas fields (Bommer et al. 2016 ). Ground-motion models for induced seismicity in other specific regions have been developed by several researchers, particularly for Oklahoma (Yenier et al. 2017; Novakovic et al. 2018; Zalachoris and Rathje 2019) or the Central and Eastern United States in general (Farajpour and Pezeshk 2021) . Atkinson (2015) developed an empirical GMM specifically for application to induced earthquakes but using recordings from tectonic earthquakes. The model was derived using recordings from the NGA-West2 database ) obtained at hypocentral distance of less than 40 km from earthquakes of magnitude M 3 to M 6. These data offered the advantage of consistent and reliable metadata, including recording site characterisations. However, the data were sparse at very short distances, and this lack of constraint on the epicentral motions results in large uncertainty regarding the median predictions of epicentral motions, which was reflected in two alternative models for the degree of near-source saturation (Fig. 92) . The difference between the two models at the epicentre of shallow-focus events is about a factor of 2. In a subsequent study, Atkinson et al. (2016b) performed analyses that indicated that the alt-h model was to be preferred and Atkinson and Assatourians (2017) explicitly recommended use of the model with the alternative saturation term.",

Several studies have found that it is correlated with depth, such that deeper crustal earthquakes have higher stress parameters (e.g., Hardebeck and Aron 2009; Trugman and Shearer 2017). Abercrombie et al. (2021) have recently concluded that these findings arise from not modelling the depth-dependence of wave attenuation, but for models that do include depth-dependent attenuation, the use of depth-dependent stress drop is a proxy for capturing this effect. From this perspective, the A15 model uses data from midcrustal tectonic earthquakes as the basis for prediction of motions from shallower induced earthquakes, without an adjustment for the reduced stress parameter. The application of the model to induced earthquakes in Central and Eastern United States has been justified on the basis of average stress drops in that region being higher than in California, from where the data were obtained (e.g., Allmann and Shearer 2009; Boyd et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2017 ). This rationale, however, does mean that the application of the Atkinson (2015) GMM to induced earthquakes in other regions, where median stress drops might be comparable to those in California, would be conservative.",

Hough (2015) analysed intensity data from natural and induced earthquakes in the Central and Eastern United States, from which she made two observations: (1) the motions from shallow, induced events are generally lower, and (2) that the motions are comparable in the epicentral region (Fig. 93) . This was interpreted as being the result of lower stress drops for the shallow-focus, induced earthquakes with this effect being offset by the shorter travel paths to the surface close to the epicentre. Atkinson et al. (2018) (2) the stress parameter scales with focal depth.\" Whether the effect is due to depth dependence of the stress parameter or has another physical explanation, the concept of ground motions being weaker for shallower events seems to be a common observation. Indeed, such an effect is captured in several of the NGA-West2 GMMs with terms that predict higher amplitudes of motion with increasing depth, through positive coefficients on either the depth-to-top-of-rupture, Z TOR Chiou and Youngs 2014) or on the hypocentral depth .",

But given what appears to be the current consensus that in any given region shallow induced earthquakes and deeper tectonic earthquakes of the same magnitude are expected to generate similar levels of ground shaking at the epicentre, the values of M min used in hazard and risk assessments should be controlled only by the fragility of the exposed infrastructure and buildings (and the damage levels of interest in the risk assessment), regardless of whether we are dealing with induced or natural seismicity.

I also acknowledged how an earnest effort to incorporate uncertainties and to communicate transparently their influence on the calculated risk can have the undesirable consequence of conveying the impression that very little is known or understood and that we are therefore dealing with unquantifiable dangers, which naturally provoke greater concern. Both of these aspects-demonstrating the inclusion of uncertainties in risk estimates and the possibility of this generating more concern rather than assuranceare very relevant when dealing with induced seismicity. Induced seismicity will generally be viewed as an imposed or involuntary peril rather than a natural hazard, leading to lower tolerance. There are numerous examples of how strongly risk perception can be influenced by whether a risk is voluntary or imposed, such as protests against mobile phone transmitter masts being installed close to schools by parents who are happy to allow their children to spend hours every day using mobile phone handsets, even though there is no evidence for the former posing a greater risk (e.g., Wood 2006) . Another example would be the news coverage given to major rail accidents in the UK while the death toll can be comparable to the number of fatalities on British roads every week. In dealing with induced seismicity, it is necessary to keep in mind that discussions surrounding induced seismicity are rarely likely to begin from an objective assessment-especially when the anthropogenic process generating the induced seismicity is already steeped in controversy.",

This should not include any decisions that are deliberately conservative since that is incompatible with the probabilistic approach to risk assessment to inform rational risk management. I would argue that the precautionary principle has no place in the management of induced seismicity. The precautionary principle essentially counsels that in the light of great uncertainty about the impacts of certain actions and the possibility of these impacts being farreaching and difficult to reverse, precaution should govern, and such actions should consequently be limited or avoided, at least until more knowledge can be acquired. When dealing with new technologies that could have far-reaching consequences for the environment and for public health, such an approach may often be justified (e.g., Read and O'Riordan 2017) . However, in the case of induced seismicity, the application of the precautionary principle would reflect an underestimation of our understanding of the phenomena and of the ability of earthquake engineering both to model and to modify seismic risk; it would be to abandon rational risk management.",

The logical starting point to assess the risk that these operations could pose is to evaluate the induced seismicity that has been generated by the ~ 10,000 hydraulic fracturing wells that have already been drilled and injected in these formations in the WCSB. Using loose spatial and temporal correlations that ignore more plausible causes, Ghofrani and Atkinson (2020) associated a small number of M \u2265 3.0 earthquakes with some of these Cretaceous wells. Our analysis, which looked at all potential causes for each of these events (Verdon and Bommer 2021b) , demonstrated that it was extremely unlikely that any earthquake of M \u2265 3 had been caused by hydraulic fracturing in Cretaceous formations; although it can be stated with less confidence because of catalogue completeness issues, it is likely that there have been no induced events of M \u2265 2 either (in other words, the formations would appear to have an extremely low seismogenic index). In their rebuttal of our comment, Ghofrani and Atkinson (2021) state their disagreement regarding how associations of seismicity and anthropogenic associations should be made-after we note that they ignored all of the approaches that have been proposed in the literature (see Sect. 8.2)-and then go on to state: \"A second point on which we disagree is an issue that was tangential to our paper: whether a regulator should consider the potential for induced seismicity from HF wells in shallow (Cretaceous) formations to be very low (as implied by GA20) or zero (as implied by VB21)\u2026. In the world of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), the difference between very low probability (i.e., 10 \u22124 p.a.) and zero is profound. Equally critical in PSHA is the amount of uncertainty in the assessment. VB21 imply that the likelihood of inducing significant seismic events from HF wells in Cretaceous formations is zero, and that there is essentially no uncertainty in this conclusion.\" Verdon and Bommer (2021b) only focused on the science presented in the study of Ghofrani and Atkinson (2020) , rather than entering into the hazard and risk implications, but these statements by Ghofrani and Atkinson (2021) are misleading since they extrapolate from our finding that no induced earthquakes have occurred due to hydraulic fracturing in the Cretaceous formations to an assertion that we did not make. The observations associated with ~ 10,000 previous wells in the region (of which several hundred are very close to the proposed operations around Brazeau Dam) is a remarkable database and far richer than the equivalent earthquake catalogues available for most PSHA studies of tectonic seismicity. However, rather than simply inferring a zero probability, the implied ranges of recurrence rates can be explored by performing a Monte-Carlo type analysis. For a given 'true' recurrence rate, R, one can generate a population of 10,000 wells and randomly assign induced events at the specified rate R. For each choice of the true rate, R, this iteration is performed 1,000,000 times, and then the resulting population evaluated: out of the 1,000,000 iterations, how likely is it that 10,000 wells would be stimulated without generating any plausible cases of induced seismicity? The results are shown in Fig. 95 . If, for example, the true recurrence rate was R = 10 -3 (1-in-1000), then the likelihood of having a population of 10,000 stimulated wells in the Mannville and Cardium with zero cases of induced seismicity of magnitude \u2265 3 is only 0.005%. Allowing for the possibility that there has been, somewhere in the WCSB, a single case of induced seismicity from stimulation of the Cretaceous formations that was missed (despite the close monitoring, regulatory vigilance and public interest), the likelihood of generating one or fewer cases of induced seismicity from 10,000 wells with a 10 -3 recurrence rate is still only 0.05%. In this way, a range of recurrence rates could be defined in a logic-tree formulation, with the central branches indicating very low-but non-zero-recurrence rates.",

Given the abundant data available regarding hydraulic fracturing, wastewater disposal and induced seismicity in the WCSB, and the clear possibility of quantifying the hazard and estimating the associated uncertainty, why should there be a need to make recourse to the precautionary principle rather than estimating induced seismic hazard and risk and evaluating these Fig. 95 Likelihood of observing no induced earthquakes after 10,000 hydraulic fracturing wells as a function of the unknown true rate of earthquakes (Courtesy of Dr James P Verdon) on the same basis as for tectonic earthquakes? As noted in Sect. 9.2, the assessment of Mmax for the potential induced seismicity should take account of the observed seismicity, which, following the same logic as applied in Groningen, would in this case lead to a distribution with a peak at quite low magnitudes. Indeed, depending on the M min determined (the smallest earthquakes known to have damaged dams are discussed in Sect. 11.2), it is possible that a good part of the Mmax distribution could be below this threshold, leading to null risk contributions.",

Considering the four elements of seismic risk illustrated in Fig. 6 (hazard, exposure, fragility and consequences), once a decision is taken to construct a building or facility at a given location, the exposure is determined, and the intended use of the structure determines the consequences of unsatisfactory performance during possible future earthquake. The seismic hazard due to tectonic earthquakes in the region can be quantified in order to determine the shaking levels to be resisted, and then earthquake engineering principles applied to control the remaining factor, the fragility.

Langenbruch and Zoback (2016) predicted that this would lead to significant decrease in seismicity-which has indeed been observed-although they noted that stabilisation would take some time due to the ongoing aftershock sequences following some of the larger induced earthquakes that have occurred in Oklahoma.

The basis for such systems is a dedicated network of sensitive seismographs, sometimes installed in boreholes to improve signal-to-noise ratios, to monitor seismic activity in the immediate vicinity of the injection wells. The system requires the recordings to be telemetered and analysed to provide locations and magnitudes in close to real time. Different thresholds are then defined based on a selected metric, such as the earthquake magnitude, to indicate whether the seismicity is increasing to levels that could become intolerable. These thresholds are assigned colours, with green indicating that seismicity is null or very low and operations may proceed without change, yellow indicating an increase in seismicity that requires remedial action (reduction in the pressure and/or flow rate of the injections), and red indicating that the seismicity has exceeded a pre-determined threshold and the operations need to be suspended; some systems will also define an orange level between yellow and red for a more graded response. The combination of the seismograph network, real-time locations and magnitude estimates, the definition of thresholds, and the defined response actions-which will often also include communications to regulatory and other agencies-is known as a Traffic Light Scheme (TLS) or Traffic Light Protocol (TLP).",

Firstly, it is assumed that induced seismicity will increase gradually during injections such that there are precursor events of smaller magnitude that occur before any event that would exceed the maximum tolerable threshold. Secondly, it is assumed that actions taken to reduce the injections will have the desired effect of preventing further increases in the number or size of induced earthquakes. The validity of both these assumptions will be discussed a little later. However, it has been concluded that TLS are only really suitable for short-term high-pressure injections, such as those associated with enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and hydraulic fracturing (HF) for unconventional hydrocarbon production (Baisch et al. 2019) . The application of TLS to wastewater injection has also been proposed (Zoback 2012) but most implementations to date have been for EGS and HF wells.

Regarding the metric, since it is the intensity of the shaking that determines the impact of an earthquake, it would seem logical to define the threshold in terms of a ground-motion parameter. The peak ground velocity (PGV) is the most widely used parameter, since it can serve as a useful indicator of both perceptibility of the motion to people and of the potential for damage to buildings. However, challenges arise with this parameter since the value of PGV will vary from one location to another, and therefore its use would require the installation of strong-motion instruments at several locations around the injection well, ideally including the locations of exposed buildings. Ader et al. (2019) , in designing a TLS for a deep geothermal project in Helsinki, identified two potential pitfalls in using PGV as the TLS metric: firstly, false positives could be triggered by vibrations from other anthropogenic sources close to one of the instruments; secondly, false negatives could be result from the largest PGV occurring at a location where there is no instrument. Ader et al. (2019) addressed these issues by specifying the amber threshold on the basis of either a certain PGV level associated with a minimum magnitude or a larger magnitude in isolation. Magnitude has the advantage of yielding a single value for an earthquake-notwithstanding that there are challenges in reliably determining the magnitudes of small events (e.g., Butcher et al. 2017; Kendall et al. 2019 )-and it can be determined very rapidly. Moreover, since the induced earthquakes can be expected to occur close to the well and at depths equal to or slightly greater than the injection depth, for induced seismicity the magnitude can be a reasonable proxy for the epicentral motions. In the TLS developed for the Berl\u00edn EGS in El Salvador , thresholds were defined in terms of PGV, as described below, but these thresholds were converted to equivalent magnitudes by assuming that these would correspond to median predictions at the epicentre for an earthquake at the depth of the injection well, using a GMM calibrated to recordings of local small-magnitude earthquakes. To additionally account for the rates of seismicity, the thresholds were displayed on a magnitude-frequency recurrence plot, with the limit of the green light corresponding to the observed background seismicity levels prior to the start of the injections (Fig. 96) .",

The red-light threshold should be fixed as the starting point, since this determines the level at which operations will be suspended because the situation is viewed as becoming dangerous. Some researchers have proposed that threshold should be set at the levels that cause nuisance or disturbance to people (e.g., Douglas and Aochi 2014; Schultz et al. 2021a ) but such an approach could lead to very low thresholds if these levels Fig. 96 Traffic light thresholds in terms of PGV-equivalent magnitude defined for the Berl\u00edn hot fractured rock (HFR) geothermal project in El Salvador; the triangles correspond to the observed background seismicity of motion determine the trigger for a red light. Motions that might be considered a nuisance could correspond to intensity as low as III, whereas the threshold for even light damage to normal buildings is intensity VI, with very considerable differences in the implied levels of motion between the two: using the empirical relationships of Caprio et al. (2015) , these would correspond to median PGV values of 2.77 cm/s and 9.81 cm/s, respectively. If the red light corresponds to such a low threshold, the yellow light is likely to be fixed at a level that leads to frequent interruptions of the operations; excessively low thresholds can be counterproductive, as discussed in Sect. 12.2. The red light, in my view, is better determined by considering the magnitude level that could correspond to the onset of damage; however, as explained below, the threshold for the red light should take into account possible 'jumps' in earthquake size. The earthquake magnitudes that might be appropriate thresholds for the onset of damage are discussed below in Sect. 10.3 and are also the entire focus of Sect. 11.",

As can be seen in Fig. 97 , the operations of the HFR involved three periods of hydraulic injections (the first to hydraulically stimulate the formation along the open-hole interval below the casing, the second period to better characterise the shallow reservoir formation accessed below the casing shoe, and the third to stimulate the deeper reservoir level). The TLS was not triggered during the operations but the largest earthquake, of M L 4.4, occurred on 16 September 2003, during the interval between the second and third injection phases. The event was located at about the same depth as the injection well and about 3 km to the south but is assumed to have been caused by the injections. The occurrence of this event two weeks after the shut-in of the second injection phase raised questions regarding the value of the TLS for this project. However, the occurrence of relatively large seismic events after shut-in of pumping, whether because operations are completed or because of a red traffic light, has been observed in many other geothermal projects (e.g., Majer et al. 2007 ) as well as in several HF injections (e.g., Baisch et al. 2019) . Indeed, such 'trailing' events, as they are known, are quite common, and their occurrence is entirely consistent with the propagation of increased fluid pressures to a critically stressed fault.",

However, I have since been persuaded that trailing events should not be viewed as invalidation of the concept of TLS but rather as a feature that should be built into the design of these systems. Verdon and Bommer (2021a) compiled data from 35 TLS operations for HF wells in Canada, China, the UK and the US, to study the statistics of the largest magnitude jumps in the induced seismicity sequences (Fig. 98 ) and the largest magnitude increases of trailing events above the largest events during injections (Fig. 99) . The largest observed magnitude jumps are on the order of 2.5 units, but such cases are rare, and may also correspond to cases relying on regional rather than dedicated local seismograph networks, hence there can be some doubt regarding the detection threshold for smaller events. For 60% of the observed cases, the maximum jump in magnitude was of 1 unit or smaller, and for 23% of the cases the jump was between 1 and 2 units (Fig. 98) . In terms of trailing events, in three quarters of the cases, there was no post shut-in increase of magnitude, and in a further 17% of the cases, the increase was of 1 unit of magnitude or Fig. 98 Observed magnitude jumps during induced seismicity sequences caused by hydraulic fracturing (Verdon and Bommer 2021a) smaller. The maximum post-injection increase in magnitude was 1.6 units, which occurred in a single case. An important point to note is that there were no cases for which there was both a large jump in magnitude during the injections and a further magnitude increase following shut-in. We concluded, therefore, that it should not be necessary to consider both of these effects in the design of a TLS.",

With this in mind, the observations can inform suitable gaps between the red-light magnitude and the magnitude limit that is to be avoided. The yellow-light threshold then needs to be set to provide a suitable margin for preventative measures to be implemented in the case of escalating seismicity, without setting this value so low that there are repeated interruptions of the injections that render the project untenable. Verdon and Bommer (2021a) also examined the time delays between shut-in and the occurrence of the largest trailing events. For three-quarters of the cases, the largest events occurred during the injections, and in less than 10% of the cases did the largest event occur more than one week after shut-in; these observations can help to determine for how long a TLS should operate.",

Therefore, while the opportunity to modify the hazard is an obvious and attractive option, there is no reason why the application of traditional earthquake engineering should not also be considered as a risk mitigation strategy, if this can be economically justified. Figure 100 illustrates the steps involved in the assessment of induced seismic risk (left-hand column) and the options that are available for mitigation of this risk. Structural strengthening can involve providing additional strength, ductility or both, for resistance of strong shaking; minor damage under lower levels of shaking can be mitigated through increased stiffness.

Possibly, rather than the regulator choosing between a goalsetting approach and a prescriptive approach, these could be offered as alternatives. To implement a risk-based approach would require a certain degree of technical expertise that operators may need to engage externally, and the assessment of risk-based strategies also places a similar onus on the regulatory authority.

They identified the distance between the injection wells and the exposed building stock to be a key factor influencing the losses, leading to the conclusion that one of the most effective options could be to relocate injection wells away from populated areas, even by a few kilometres.

            "text": "In exploring risk mitigation options for induced seismicity, Bommer et al. (2015a) differentiated potential schemes on the basis of the risk target, depending on whether the objective was to avoid disturbance to the exposed population, prevent minor (non-structural) damage, or only to protect life and limb against structural damage (although it goes without saying that the risk mitigation strategy could address more than one of these objectives). Mitigation options at the higher risk levels could include relocation of the project and/or the most exposed population, or else a programme of building strengthening. At the lower levels the measures could include engagement of the exposed population (likely to be more feasible for 'green' energy options such as geothermal than for hydraulic fracturing for hydrocarbons, although local employment opportunities could influence the attitude) and monetary compensation for minor damage (Fig. 102) . Although I am not aware of such a scheme ever being implemented in practice, financial incentives could also be used to manage nuisance risk: a threshold magnitude for which it would be expected that the shaking would be felt by many people in the local area (but without causing damage) could be defined, and every household in the exposed area would then receive a nominal, but not trivial, sum for each such occurrence. Such a scheme was proposed for the Groningen gas field by Bal et al. (2019) , which might sound somewhat outlandish to some but in practice could have been a much more rational and equitable approach than the damage claim and compensation scheme that has evolved in that situation (see Sect. 12.4) .",

For the TLS developed for the Berl\u00edn HFR project, for example, the GMM used to calibrate the model was obtained by adjusting a published equation for PGV to match recordings from small-magnitude volcanic swarm recordings obtained in the region; as the injections proceeded and recordings were obtained from the induced events, residual analyses were conducted in order to make adjustments to the initial GMM, which was found to overestimate the recorded amplitudes .",

            "text": "As discussed in the previous section, effective mitigation of induced seismic risk through TLS hinges on defining magnitude thresholds that could result in damage to buildings. From the perspective of earthquake-resistant design of new structures, the influence of events of magnitude smaller than 4.5 or 5.0 is usually disregarded through the lower bound magnitude, M min , imposed on PSHA calculations (see Sect. 3.2). However, it is acknowledged that for estimating risk to existing building stock, particularly in regions with low levels of natural seismicity, the magnitude thresholds for damaging events could be lower. For the rational management of induced seismicity, determining these magnitude thresholds is of fundamental importance. Even though the levels will depend on the characteristics of the exposed building stock, the local ground conditions, and the distance at which these buildings are situated from the potential locations of induced earthquakes, I believe it can be very useful to make general inferences from observations of small-magnitude earthquakes. To this end, in this section I briefly discuss observations of damage due to Fig. 102 Options for risk mitigation schemes to mitigate a felt shaking causing nuisance, b non-structural damage incurring repair costs, and c structural damage that could pose a threat to the building occupants (Bommer et al. 2015a ); the range of relative costs associated with each alternative are indicated ($: low; $$: medium: $$$: high), noting that abandoning a project that is operational is much higher than abandonment following a feasibility assessment small-magnitude natural earthquakes, which can serve as a proxy for induced earthquakes of the same magnitude if one accepts the premise that the two types of event produce comparable ground motions in the epicentral region (see Sect. 9 .3). I believe the body of evidence that observations from small-magnitude tectonic earthquakes present should not be ignored, especially since such events are vastly more abundant that their induced counterparts. Case histories of small-magnitude induced earthquakes reported to be damaging are discussed in Sect. 12; one of the purposes of the current section is to provide a point of reference and comparison for the induced case histories. For clarity, I do not believe that the potential for moderate-magnitude triggered events, such as the M 5.8 Pawnee earthquake in Oklahoma or the M 5.5 Pohang earthquake in Korea, to cause appreciable damage is open to debate; the question being addressed here is whether earthquakes smaller than, say M 4.5, can be expected to lead to damage in buildings and infrastructure.",

Figure 103 shows four accelerograms with exactly the same value of PGA but very different acceleration response spectra (which all have the same intercept at the PGA value of 0.18 g). These ground motions had very different impacts: the Peru earthquake was destructive to low-rise housing but had very little impact on high-rise structures, whereas the Michoac\u00e1n earthquake caused extensive damage to medium-and high-rise buildings in Mexico City, where the motions were amplified by thick deposits of lacustrine clays, but had limited effect on low-rise buildings in the city (e.g., Celebi et al. 1987) .",

While the influence of duration on geotechnical effects such as liquefaction is clearly recognised, its influence on structural damage is still very much a matter of debate (e.g., . The influence of duration is more apparent in structures that have degrading inelastic properties (i.e., stiffness and/or strength that reduces with increasing cycles of motion), such as unreinforced masonry. For example, Bommer et al. (2004a) found a clear influence of duration on damage to masonry when the damage was measured in terms of loss of strength and the primary characteristic of the motion was the average spectral acceleration over an interval from the initial 1 3 natural vibration period to a period about three times longer. However, it was also noted that the duration and the averaged spectral acceleration of the records were correlated, which could partially mask the influence of the duration. In order to isolate the influence Fig.103 Four horizontal accelerograms with identical PGA values (lower) and their 5%-damped pseudoacceleration response spectra (upper). Adapted from Bommer and Boore (2005) 1 3 of duration, Hancock and Bommer (2007) used a suite of records spectrally matched to the same response spectrum but with a wide range of durations, an approach which has subsequently been adopted by others (e.g., Chandramohan et al. 2016) . Spectral matching uses wavelets to adjust an accelerogram such that its response spectrum matches a defined spectral shape, with minimal changes to the acceleration time-histories , which can reduce significantly the number of dynamic analyses required to obtain stable estimates of non-linear structural response (Hancock et al. 2008) . Hancock and Bommer (2007) used the spectrally matched records to analyse the response of an 8-storey reinforced concrete building, finding that peak response metrics, such as maximum drift, were unaffected by duration, but that cumulative damage metrics were influenced by the duration of the motions.",

In other words, the fact that ground motion has a high PGA does not automatically mean that it is damaging.

The amplitude and duration of ground motions both scale with the earthquake magnitude but they have opposite trends with distance (Fig. 105) . If the target for analysis is the epicentral motions for an induced earthquake of M 4, say, then if records are selected from earthquakes of this size recorded at distances of up to ~ 10 km, an inconsistency can arise. When those motions are scaled up to match the epicentral PGA values, the significant duration will remain the same and the combination of amplitude and duration will actually correspond to a larger earthquake. This is exacerbated by the fact that the residuals in predictions of PGA and duration are negatively correlated (Bradley 2011) . This means that if the PGA corresponds to an 84-percentile value (i.e., one standard deviation above the mean prediction), then the associated duration would be expected to be appreciably lower than the mean prediction. This negative correlation simply reflects the finite energy content of the ground motion, which in the epicentral area is controlled mainly by the magnitude of the earthquake; to produce a motion with an exceptionally high amplitude, the signal needs to be compressed in terms of duration. Consequently, if accelerograms from earthquakes of M 4 recorded at distances of ~ 10 km are scaled to match predicted epicentral amplitudes at say the 2-sigma level for an induced earthquake of the same magnitude, the resulting ground motion will have a duration greatly in excess of what would be expected for such a scenario; the impact estimated from such high-energy scaled motions could therefore appreciably overestimate the impact of the scenario earthquake.",

An interesting case in point here is the M 5.0 earthquake-an event right on the boundary I have proposed for defining small earthquakes-that struck Mogul, a small suburb of Reno, Nevada, on 26 April 2008. The epicentre was located at the northeast limit of the town and the focal depth was calculated as just 3 km.

None of the houses experienced damage that prevented continued occupancy. To our knowledge, only two structures, both with living space over the garage, experienced minor (but costly) structural damage. In both cases, the sole plate of the wood frame in a corner of the garage was nailed to a mud sill that was bolted to the stem wall, and during the earthquake, the nails failed.\" In terms of the larger affected area, Anderson et al.

            "text": "A starkly contrasting case is the M 3.9 earthquake that occurred on the island of Ischia, offshore from Naples in southern Italy, in August 2017. This volcano-tectonic earthquake had a focal depth of just 1.7 km and occurred directly below the town of Ischia. Several old and heavy unreinforced masonry structures were damaged, leaving two dead and 42 injured (Briseghella et al., 2019) . Damage was limited to a small area of about 400 m radius, within which it is suspected that ground motions were possibly amplified by topographic effects since the damage mainly occurred on a hill in the epicentral area. Brisghella et al. (2019) attribute the main cause of damage to the very high building vulnerability, noting that no reinforced concrete structures were damaged and even the presence of iron tie rods in masonry buildings proved sufficient to prevent collapse (Fig. 107) . Reports have highlighted that there was little control of construction in the affected area and that Ischia had been identified as an area where illegal construction is rife (https:// www. thelo cal. it/ 20170 822/ shock ing-to-die-in-such-low-magni tude-earth quake-says-chief-geolo gist/).",

The amplitudes of the motion are not particularly high, but the motion does appear to be of unusually low frequency despite the classification of the IOCA station as Eurocode 8 site type B in the Eurocode 8 (V S30 360-800 m/s); this is also reflected in the broad plateaus of the horizontal response spectra (Fig. 109) . However, such low-frequency motions, which are quite distinct from those generated by tectonic earthquakes of similar size, have been identified as being typical of shallow volcano-tectonic earthquakes (e.g., Tusa and Langer 2016) . These characteristics of the ground motions may have played a role in the exceptional impact of the Ischia earthquake, which is an outlier in terms of such a small event causing so much damage and even casualties. However, the field reconnaissance report by Briseghella et al. (2019) clearly indicates that the pronounced fragility of the heavy masonry structures that experienced damage was a major contributing factor to the severe impact of this earthquake.",

            "text": "In compiling such a global database, it is inevitable that depth is sacrificed for breadth, with the result that for many of the earthquakes there is very little information available. This raises an important consideration because in empirical science it is common to assert that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. However, in the age of widespread ownership of smart phones and access to social media platforms, I believe that one could argue that the absence of evidence can, in many cases, be interpreted as evidence of absence. When people are posting images of the most banal occurrences in their lives, a report of 'damage' that is not accompanied by photographic evidence (unless it is in a very remote and/or underdeveloped region), could legitimately be treated with some suspicion (a theme that will be re-visited in Sect. 12). Moreover, the descriptors used to characterise the reported damage vary enormously and are rarely expressed in terms of established damage scales such as that defined for the EMS intensity scale (Sect. 2.2). In view of the ambiguity associated with reports of damage and even 'destruction' to buildings, the most reliable information in the database might be the reports of deaths caused by earthquakes. However, earthquake deaths attributed to heart attacks were excluded from the database since there are several studies that have demonstrated that rather than causing heart attacks to happen, earthquakes tend to cause heart attacks that were imminent to cluster in time (see Appendix 2 of Nievas et al. 2020a) . In terminology that is probably familiar to most following the Covid-19 pandemic, the heart attacks that occur during earthquakes do not contribute to excess mortality relative the background rate when averaged over a longer period of time. Figure 110 shows the numbers of reported deaths for each event with reported casualties (about 14% of the database) as a function of the earthquake magnitude. As can be seen from the annotations in the plot, most of the events of M \u2264 4.5 causing more than one death are associated with mine collapses or with landslides. The former are clearly a special case and in some of these cases it is possible that the mine collapse itself was recorded by seismographs and assigned a magnitude, hence the actual cause of the 'earthquake' rather than a response to the shaking. The same may hold for some of the landslides but even when the landslides are a consequence of an earthquake, this may reflect cases of very susceptible slopes, especially if the earthquake occurred during a rainy season (these collateral hazards are discussed further in Sect. 11.3). In a second study, Nievas et al. (2020b) sought to explore the proportion of earthquakes in this magnitude range that are reported to have caused damage. A global earthquake catalogue of earthquakes with magnitudes from 4.0 to 5.5 was compiled for the period from 2001 to 2015, which is the period during which the database of damaging events is considered to be the most complete. Of course, it is acknowledged that the database is not complete because of events that are not reported and also events reported in languages that we were unable to decipher, so in this sense the database of Nievas et al. (2020a) would define lower bounds on the proportion of small-to-moderate magnitude earthquakes that are damaging (although this may also be partially offset by the presence of 'false positives' in the database, corresponding to exaggerated and unsubstantiated reports of earthquake impacts). The global catalogue was then filtered to consist only of events that could potentially have impacted the built environment, eliminating deeper earthquakes, offshore events and those occurring in unpopulated or very sparsely populated regions. Figure 111 shows the distribution of the 39,000 events with respect to magnitude-which is consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter recurrence model-and also highlights the 740 events that are also included in the database of damaging events. Overall, the damaging events constitute just 1.9% of the total number of earthquakes, although if we focus only on 2013-2015, during which time the online Earthquake Impact Database (https:// earth quake-report. com) was operating, the proportion increases to 4.3%. However, it is important to bear in mind that this includes events larger than M 5; if we focus only on events of magnitude M \u2264 4.5, only about 1% of the potentially damaging earthquakes are reported to have caused damage, injury or Nievas et al. (2020a) , with the diamonds indicating the percentage of damaging events in each magnitude interval (Nievas et al. 2020b) economic losses. As just noted above, this is most likely to be a lower bound, but it still points to damage from such small earthquakes being very much the exception rather than the rule. Detailed reports are available for very few of the events in this magnitude range, but on the basis of the information that is available it would seem that they generally correspond to cases of extreme vulnerability of the exposed buildings.",

Hinks (2015) reports that the 6 m dam was constructed of earth and peat with a narrow core of silty clay and founded on peat.

The Sharredushk dam failure is discussed by Wieland (2019) and Wieland and Ahlehagh (2019) but communication with Dr Martin Wieland confirms that the information presented regarding the Sharredushk dam was provided by Jonathan Hinks (e.g., Hinks et al., 2012; Hinks, 2015) . Mr Hinks is a civil engineer specialised in dam safety, previously employed at Halcrow, who has kindly shared information regarding the case that provides very useful insight. Under a World Bank-funded programme, Mr Hinks was engaged in work to assess many dams throughout Albania on behalf of the Albanian government. His report on the Sharredushk dam was issued in February 2004-five years before the earthquake-in which he noted that the dam was experiencing extensive internal erosion, which was manifesting in sink holes in the downstream face. The upstream face was protected by concrete slabs, many of which were broken, and there was also evidence of extensive erosion at the right abutment. The engineering report recommended extensive strengthening works in the form of buttresses at the right abutment and along the downstream face of the 136 m-long dam. These remedial works were costed at $0.7 M and were never implemented, possibly because the risk was considered low in view of the area immediately downstream being largely unpopulated.",

            "text": "The work on behalf of the Albanian government for assessing the dams was subsequently taken up by Mr Tim Hill, a dam engineer employed at Mott MacDonald, who was able to provide me with additional information about the dam, including reports from colleagues who visited the dam following the failure. The dam was originally constructed in the 1960s to a height of 60 m, as a homogeneous clay structure (i.e., no separate core) and was subsequently raised by another 6 m (Fig. 114) . Mr Hill explained that the topsoil on the upstream slope was not removed prior to the raising of the dam and no benching was created, resulting in a plane of weakness along the interface between the original dam and the raised section. Another key problem with the design of the dam was identified as incompatible drainage material. The design for the raising works recognised the importance of keeping the phreatic surface as low as possible in the downstream shoulder to maintain structural stability. This objective is usually achieved through a blanket drain placed below the downstream shoulder, which is a horizontal sand layer, generally on the order of about 1 m in thickness. An essential feature of the drain is to have a fine-grained sand layer in contact with the fill material and then a coarse sand layer, which creates compatibility between the materials. In the case of the Sharredushk dam, the drain-which was made up of individual 'fingers' rather than a continuous blanket-was composed only of coarse sand. This meant that fine material from the shoulder fill was washed into the filter material and reduced its permeability to the extent that it effectively ceased to function as a drain. The sinkholes observed in the downstream face provided evidence of the washing out of fill material, which created a zone of weakness at the toe of the dam.",

With the toe weakened by internal erosion and the plane of weakness between the original and raised sections of the dam, the earthquake shaking was characterised by Mr Hill as simply \"the straw that broke the camel's back.\" The inferred failure mode is indicated in Fig. 115 . Fishermen reported small cracks that appeared in the crest the day after the earthquake, and the slip that resulted in 1.5-2 m vertical deformation happened six days after the earthquake. In conclusion, this case history corresponds to a case of extensive damage to dam associated with an earthquake of magnitude less than 5. However, it is also clearly a case of an extremely susceptible dam that professional engineers who inspected the site before and after the event concluded would have likely failed even without the seismic shaking.",

Indeed, magnitude M 6.5 (which is ~ 1,000 times more energetic) would generally be considered the minimum threshold for tsunamigenic earthquakes (https:// www. usgs. gov/ faqs/ what-it-about-earth quake-causes-tsuna mi).",

Therefore, slopes that are very susceptible to instability as a result of heavy rainfall, erosion, excavation for road construction or deforestation, may fail under very low levels of shaking. However, empirical relations between the distance to the farthest triggered landslides (or the area affected by landsliding) and magnitude, suggest that for magnitude M 4.5 landslides would only occur very close to the epicentre (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 1999) .

Prompted by claims that liquefaction hazard was an important threat associated with induced seismicity in the Groningen gas field (Sect. 12.4), Green and Bommer (2019) undertook a survey of reported cases of liquefaction, which was then supplemented by simple modelling of representative soil profiles that could be considered highly susceptible to liquefaction. Among the field observations reviewed, one that stands out particularly is the study by Quigley et al. (2013) conducted for the Christchurch earthquake sequence in New Zealand. Liquefaction occurred in the backyard of Dr Quigley's home in the Avonside suburb of eastern Christchurch, and he was able to make on-site inspections following each episode of felt shaking (Fig. 116) . The observations, summarised in the right-hand panel of Fig. 116 , showed that the smallest earthquake for which liquefaction triggering was observed was of magnitude M 5.0. This is consistent with the general conclusions of : the smallest earthquakes for which liquefaction triggering has been observed were of M 4.5 and there is no evidence for liquefaction occurring in smaller earthquakes. However, in all of the cases for which earthquakes of this size produced liquefaction, the phenomenon took place in extremely susceptible ground, such as marshy riverbanks or beach deposits. The smallest earthquakes to have caused liquefaction triggering in ground that could support any type of construction were of M 5, which therefore defines the threshold for consideration in risk analyses-as assumed many years earlier by Atkinson et al. (1984) .",

I have chosen these cases on the basis of all having been reported to have caused damage or otherwise generated notoriety; in all four cases, the induced seismicity resulted in the operations being cancelled. However, such far-reaching consequences arose from earthquakes of rather modest sizes: Fig. 117 shows the maximum magnitude of each seismic sequence and the approximate distance of that event from the closest exposed building. From the discussion in Sect. 11, one could conclude that damage due to earthquakes of magnitude less than 4.5 is very rare (and generally reflects extremely vulnerable buildings), and magnitude 4.0 Fig. 117 Maximum magnitudes in each of the four case histories discussed in Sect. 12, plotted against the hypocentral distance to the closest exposure might define the lower bound for natural tectonic earthquakes that have been reported to have caused damage. Even if earthquakes of magnitudes smaller than 4.5 have caused damage to precarious buildings, the evidence suggests that this would only have occurred very close to the epicentre. Among the case histories that are described in this section, the largest magnitudes in three of the four cases were appreciably smaller than 4; for the one case where the largest magnitude was above 4, the closest buildings were located some 20 km away. Therefore, at face value, these case histories would seem to imply, individually and collectively, that induced earthquakes are more destructive than their tectonic counterparts of the same magnitude-even though comparisons of the ground shaking levels that they produce do not suggest that this is the case (see Sect. 9 .3). In most of the cases, it should be recognised, the decision to suspend the operations was also linked not only to the earthquakes that had occurred but also to larger events that it was claimed could occur if the activity continued (emphasising why the estimation of Mmax for induced seismicity can be a critical issue, as discussed in Sect. 9.2).",

The first case (Basel) is a geothermal project, an energy source that most would agree is 'green'. The other three cases are all related to natural gas supply, covering conventional (Groningen) and non-conventional (Lancashire) reservoirs, and storage (Castor). The fact that these three case histories concern a fossil fuel will perhaps incline some readers to view the suspension of the operations as a positive move from an environmental perspective, which I will try to address is Sect. 13. At this point, before discussing these cases, I would like to provide a little context. At the time of writing (late autumn/ early winter 2021), gas prices globally have risen dramatically, leading to the collapse of energy supply firms and closure of factories in the UK, highlighting western European dependence on Russian gas. Readers will likely recall the dispute over gas prices between Russia and Ukraine that led to Russia cutting off gas supplies to Ukraine on 1st January 2009, during the middle of winter. On 7 January, the impact was extended when Russian gas supplies stopped flowing through Ukraine for 13 days, cutting off all supplies to several countries in southeastern Europe. In autumn 2021, Russia has threatened to cut gas supply to Moldova, new tensions have arisen regarding approval of the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline to convey gas from Russia into Germany, bypassing both Ukraine and Poland, and Russia has amassed armed forces on the border with Ukraine. How all this will play out remains to be seen, but the stakes are clearly very high when it comes to security of gas supply, and this is the backdrop against which three European countries have taken decisions, in response to these induced earthquakes, that directly impact their own supplies of natural gas.",

However, trailing events of M L 2.7 and M L 3.4 (M 3.2) occurred after the shut-in and the shaking was felt by many people. Shortly afterwards, the project manager, Markus H\u00e4ring, was escorted by the police to meet with the crisis management team of the City of Basel.",

Although often difficult to verify, a significant share of the reported instances of damage is presumed to be a direct consequence of the earthquake.\" Examples of the damage attributed to the effects of the earthquake shaking are shown in Fig. 120 . Although these are clearly very light levels of damageand similar to what many of us could find in our own homes after a few years-the claims paid out by insurance companies eventually summed to a total of more than $ 9 million (Giardini 2009 ). During a full week, the local radio station called for damages to be communicated to a specially installed reporting centre and at the same time Geopower Basel advised insurers not to undertake on-site investigations of claims in order to avoid legal disputes and political controversies. How much physical damage the earthquakes actually caused and what proportion of the total insurance payments corresponded to unverified claims of damage has not been clearly established. Nonetheless, the induced seismicity (H\u00e4ring et al. 2008) associated with the Basel DHM project is often referred to as having been damaging, but there is no evidence for any damage that exceeded the kind of hairline cracks shown in Fig. 120 .",

While causing landslides and floods are criminal offences under Swiss law, Markus was swiftly acquitted of these nonsensical charges (and the prosecutor who brought the case went into retirement). However, there was never any compensation to the wrongly accused, and it is also not clear why he became the scapegoat for a project effectively owned by the city of the Basel. I find it deeply troubling that somebody could face criminal charges for the consequences of efforts to develop a green energy source, despite putting a system (the TLS) in place to avoid escalation of induced seismicity and implementing the response protocol as specified. The charges brought against Markus H\u00e4ring are all the more surprising if one considers that it was not clearly established how much damage had actually been caused. Insight into that question was provided a few years later by another Swiss geothermal project, in St Gallen on the eastern side of Switzerland, southwest of Lake Constance. On 30 July 2013 the injections at St Gallen caused an earthquake that was slightly larger than the Basel earthquake (M L 3.5, M 3.4; Diehl et al. 2017 ) and located at a similar focal depth (4.3 km cf. 4.7 km for Basel). The ground motions recorded in the two earthquakes were of similar amplitude, as shown in Fig. 121 , although there may have been greater site amplification effects in Basel than in St Gallen. The notable fact is that there were no reports of damage due to the St Gallen earthquakes and no claims were made for damage due to this earthquake, which stands in very stark contrast to the enormous damage bill in Basel.",

At the same time, it may be useful for readers who are unfamiliar with the UK to note that while the UK is a region of low seismic activity on a global scale, both natural and anthropogenic earthquakes do occur, the latter having mainly been caused by mining (Fig. 123) . The two largest earthquakes unambiguously associated with mining were both of magnitude M L 3.1 . In recent decades, mining-induced seismicity has diminished because of the closure of most of the UK coal mines, but to my knowledge when these events did occur, they neither had any serious impact nor generated controversy.",

The report also recommended a TLS for control of induced seismicity in future operations, in which it was proposed that green correspond to events smaller than M L 0.0, and that the red-light threshold be set at M L 1.7. For intermediate magnitudes, the yellow-light response proposed by de Pater and Baisch (2011) was just to continue seismic monitoring after each stage for at least two days \"until the seismicity rate falls below one event per day\", but without any changes to injections during operations already underway. DECC commissioned a separate study to review the report by de Pater and Baisch (2011) and to make recommendations for future operational controls. The 1 3 report by Green et al. (2012) noted that had the recommended TLS been in place at Preese Hall, no remedial action would have been taken prior to the M L 2.3 event. However, rather than recommend a more effective yellow-light response, the proposal was to lower the redlight threshold from M L 1.7 to M L 0.5. This proposal-which I learned, during an animated debate that took place at a workshop on induced seismicity hosted by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in London, was claimed by the second author 3 of the Green et al. (2012) , report-was accepted and implemented by DECC. The decision to set the magnitude threshold so low-probably below the limit of event detection by the BGS seismograph network-surprised many because it is clearly excessively conservative, even when accounting for trailing events and magnitude jumps (Sect. 10.1), and probably unworkable as an operational protocol. Indeed, the third author of the Green et al. (2012) report has subsequently been quoted questioning the very low threshold: \"The existing regulations are really quite conservative, they are set at a level of earthquake that is really very unlikely to be felt. So something like 1.5 is a level of earthquake that is not going to be felt widely by people -I think it is something we ought to have a look at\" (Dr Brian Baptie, BGS, quoted on BBC News https:// www. bbc. co. uk/ news/ scien ce-envir onment-46962 472). The joint report on hydraulic fracturing for shale gas issued jointly by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering following the Preese Hall events noted the following: \"Given average background noise conditions in mainland UK, a realistic detection limit of BGS' network is magnitude 1.5 M L . For regions with more background noise, the detection limit may be closer to magnitude 2-2.5 M L . Vibrations from a seismic event of magnitude 2.5 M L are broadly equivalent to the general traffic, industrial and other noise experienced daily.\"",

At this stage, the operations were regulated by three UK government agencies-the Environment Agency, the Health and Safety Executive, and the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA)-although DECC remained involved in terms of setting policy; induced seismicity came under the auspices of OGA. At that time, I was engaged by OGA to advise on tolerable shaking levels from induced earthquakes, expressed in terms of PGV, which were then adopted as a secondary level of the TLS (the triggers were still based 1 3 on magnitude but recorded PGV levels would be a factor in determining the response). I argued energetically, as had others, for an increase of the red-light threshold magnitude, but while there seemed to be a general understanding that such a change would be appropriate, there was not the political will in government to be seen to be relaxing the rules. In the UK there would appear to be considerable opposition to fracking and there are several very active and very vocal groups that have campaigned against the application of this technology, and the media by and large portray hydraulic fracturing in a very unfavourable light.",

The interruptions resulted in frequent news reports of the hydraulic fracturing operations being suspended because of earthquakes, even though the events were too small to be felt (the largest was M L 1.1). When injections resumed in December 2018, two more red-light events occurred, the larger with M L 1.5. Apart from the M L 0.5 threshold making it practically impossible to advance the operations, it also resulted in public perception that something of concern was happening at PNR even though these were events of size that occur many hundreds of times across the UK every year. If the objective of the extremely conservative TLS was to make the public feel safe, it seems to have had the opposite effect.",

There were 2,266 responses submitted to the BGS 'Did You Feel It?' online questionnaire for macroseismic observations, on the basis of which a maximum intensity for the event was reported as VI on the EMS, which corresponds to the onset of light damage. However, such reports may be treated with a little caution since they do not reflect on-site assessments by suitably qualified professionals but rather self-reporting by people who have felt the shaking, and therefore will naturally tend to be biased towards the higher indicators rather than the modal observation Fig. 125 Timeline of hydraulic fracturing stages and induced seismicity for the PNR-2 well (Kettlety et al. 2021) ; the magnitude thresholds of the TLS have been transformed to moment magnitude using an empirical relationship derived from the data previously acquired at PNR that should be the basis for assigning an intensity. Moreover, there may be multiple reports of damage for the same structure and in view of the heightened emotions surrounding the operations and the technology, some reports may have been exaggerated. For instance, the reports include one instance of a \"collapsed wall\" and one of a \"collapsed house wall\" but these were not supported by the actual damage descriptions and no photographic evidence was provided for the collapses. In Sect. 11 I made the point that in the age of the smart phone, absence of evidence may well be evidence of absence. Photographs of damage attributed to the earthquake have been posted online but most of these could easily be related to settlement: https:// drill ordrop. com/ 2019/ 09/ 26/ cuadr illa-sent-office-staff-tocheck-prope rty-damage-from-uks-bigge st-frack ing-earth-tremor/.

Gas storage can also be important for ensuring pressure maintenance in the distribution system and also to provide insurance against unforeseen accidents. During the huge gas price rises of 2021, gas storage capacity has come into sharp focus in many European countries, including the UK, where the Rough facility, located off the Yorkshire coast, which used to account for 70% of the national storage capacity, was closed in 2017.

The dimensions, geometry and seismogenic capacity of the Amposta fault became critical questions in the Castor story. The Instituto Geol\u00f3gico y Minero de Espa\u00f1a (IGME), the Spanish geological survey, maintains a database of active Quaternary faults, QAFI (Quaternary Active Faults Database of Iberia, http:// info. igme. es/ qafi/), the compilation of which is explained by Garc\u00eda-Mayordomo et al. (2012) . The QAFI database is compiled from existing information that is incorporated at face value, thus facing the same tension between breadth and depth discussed in the context of the database of small-magnitude earthquakes reported to have caused damage (Sect. 11.2). The Amposta fault appeared in QAFI v. 2.0 with a total length of 51 km, a dip of 60\u00b0 and a depth of 15 km, characteristics obtained from the PhD thesis of Roca (1992) , which inferred the presence of the fault from a single seismic profile. In one map in that thesis, which was a study of the entire Valencian Trough, the fault identified from the seismic profile was erroneously linked with other faults (with inconsistent dips), resulting in the appearance of a structure 51 km in length. This map was subsequently used by Perea (2006) who inferred the seismogenic potential of the Amposta fault from this exaggerated length and a slip rate inferred from the same seismic profile that had been used by Roca (1992) . IGME estimated a maximum magnitude of M 7.1, assuming that the entire fault would rupture in a single earthquake. Extensive geophysical investigations were carried out as part of the Castor project, including the interpretation of a large number of seismic lines in the area. The conclusion of these studies was the Amposta fault Even with the updated length of the Amposta fault, the QAFI database still indicated an active fault with appreciable seismogenic potential, including a maximum magnitude of M 6.6, which would require rupture of the fault along its entire length (despite evidence for segmentation) and its entire width. As shown in the cross-section in Fig. 127 , the fault is actually a listric structure, becoming horizontal at a depth of a little more than 3 km. Such a structure is unlikely to generate a large earthquake and indeed it is possible that the Amposta is actually a growth fault, linked to salt tectonics, and not a seismogenic structure at all.",

The report, which has not been summarised in a peer-reviewed paper, identifies a NW-SE trending fault as the origin of the earthquake, concluding that this is consistent with the Amposta fault. Juanes et al. (2017) perform a moment tensor analysis, the results of which are compared with the fault plane solutions obtained in other studies (Fig. 130) . These are lower hemisphere projections, which means that the convex side of the fault plane indicates the direction of dip of the fault plane. Therefore, the favoured fault plane (each diagram indicates two possible, and perpendicular, fault planes) of Juanes et al.

(2017) study. The charges would have carried a maximum penalty of 7 years of imprisonment, which would have been a remarkable outcome for two individuals who were part of an imaginative venture to increase energy supply security for Spain and who followed all due diligence in the preparation and design of the project, which went ahead with full regulatory approval. During the writing of this paper, in November 2021, I was one of several expert witnesses who participated in the trial held in Castell\u00f3n, in which one of the most interesting developments was that the morning after Professor Juanes had appeared as witness (and before the witnesses for ESCAL had taken the stand), a local newspaper ran the headline \"Experts dismiss the Amposta fault as the cause of the Castor earthquakes\" (El Peri\u00f3dico Mediterr\u00e1neo, Tuesday 9 November 2021). I am very pleased to record here that on 1 st December the judges issued their verdict, absolving the accused of all charges. While any other outcome from the trial would have been outrageous and while this may seem like a victory for rationality, the fact remains that the Castor gas storage is now permanently closed, with all the injected gas now inaccessible. These consequences have been brought about by a series of small earthquakes that occur from time to time in this region offshore of eastern Spain, and which caused no damage whatsoever. The situation seems to have been created through a combination of the displeasure of some residents of the nearby coastal towns (although it is worth noting that the most distant claims came from locations to north, 90 km from the epicentre) and the self-contradictory and speculative report of Juanes et al. (2017) .",

Groningen could also have been a remarkable demonstration of the rational management of induced seismic risk; sadly, it has become instead a triumph of politics over science. The value in reviewing how this came to pass is not in proportioning blame-although this will be an inevitable by-product of any honest attempt to dissect any of these case histories-but rather to highlight the lessons that can be learnt from this spectacular failure of excellent scientific work to exert any influence on policy decisions with very far-reaching implications.",

The gas reservoir is contained within the Rotliegend-Slochteren formation, a sandstone unit 150-300 m thickness located about 3 km below the surface (Fig. 132) . The gas-bearing sandstone overlies the Carboniferous basement and is overlain by the Zechstein salt, which in turn is overlain by a chalk layer, above which is the North Sea group, consisting primarily of marine clays and sands. There are numerous faults, mostly trending NNE-SSW with some smaller faults trending E-W and N-S, throughout the field, which offset different portions of the gas reservoir by up to several tens of metres, as can be appreciated from the profile shown in Fig. 132 ; these faults are believed to have formed about 100 million years ago and, prior to the gas production, there was no evidence for geologically (Bourne et al. 2018) 1 3 recent movement on these structures. Gas is produced from clusters of wells throughout the field, which leads, logically, to a reduction in the reservoir pressure, which in turn results in compaction of the reservoir (Fig. 133) and manifests at the ground surface in the form of regional subsidence, which now has a maximum value of about 35 cm.",

Gas production in the field began in 1963, peaking in 1976 at 88 bcm. The first recorded earthquake, with magnitude M L 2.4, occurred in December 1991; it appears that a critical level of compaction was required for the onset of the seismicity (Fig. 135 ). In the following three decades, more than 50 earthquakes of the same magnitude or larger have occurred (Fig. 136) , and the seismic activity continues to this date, with an event of M L 3.2 occurring on 16 November 2021, which is significant for reasons discussed in Sect. 12.4.6.

The groundmotion recording network in the Groningen field was rather sparse at that time (the earthquake prompted an upgrade and expansion of the strong-motion network-see Sect. 12.4.4) but a record was obtained at just less than 2 km from the epicentre at the MID1 station: the stronger horizontal component had a PGA of 0.083 g and a PGV of 3.46 cm/s, and a duration (based on 5-75% accumulation of the Arias intensity) of 0.52 s (Fig. 137) . The earthquake was strongly felt in the northern part of the field; from online questionnaires, KNMI determined a maximum EMS intensity of VI-which is consistent with the median predictions from the empirical relationships of Caprio et al. (2015) -over an area of radius of ~ 3-3.5 km (Fig. 138) ; intensity VI is defined as follows: \"Felt by most indoors and many outdoors. A few persons lose their balance. Many people are frightened and run outdoors. Small objects of ordinary stability may fall and furniture may be shifted. In a few instances dishes and glassware may break. Farm animals (even outdoors) may be frightened. Damage of grade 1 (no structural damage, slight non-structural damage) is sustained by many buildings of vulnerability class A and B; a few of class A and B suffer damage of grade 2 (slight structural damage, moderate non-structural damage); a few of class C suffer damage of grade 1\" (Gr\u00fcnthal 1998) . Vulnerability class A refers to rubble or fieldstone masonry and adobe, which are not encountered in the Netherlands. Consequently, the damage would have been expected to be mostly grade 1 (hairline cracks, fall of small pieces of plaster) and possibly a few cases of grade 2 (cracks in many walls, fall of fairly large pieces of plaster).",

            "text": "The Huizinge earthquake is viewed as a turning point in the Groningen story and is often described as the game changer. The obvious explanation for the pivotal impact of the Huizinge event would be that it was larger than any previous earthquake in the Groningen field and caused damage-albeit generally minor-in a relatively large number of houses. In 2003, there had been two earthquakes of M L 3.0 (the Hoeksmeer event of 24 October and the Stedum event of 10 November 2003), which had modest impact: Roos et al. (2009) report that these two events prompted 14 and 82 damage claims, respectively, of 1 3 (2006) had noted that \"The expected damage from these quakes could be described\u2026.as ranging from none to, in the worst case, very little light structural damage. However, these quakes have caused significant social anxiety.\" At that time, earthquakes as large as M L 3.4 had occurred in the Roswinkel field at shallower depths of 2.4 km, above the Zechstein salt formation; the M L 3.4 earthquakes in 1997 prompted 235 damage claims, of which 204 were settled (Roos et al. 2009 ). An event of particular note in this discussion is the Westeremden earthquake of 8 August 2006, which had a magnitude of M L 3.5 and an epicentre less than 2 km to the ENE of the epicentre of the Huizinge event. Roos et al. (2009) report that the Westeremden earthquake led to 410 damage claims, of which 275 were settled.",

            "text": "Interestingly, recorded motions, especially their PGA values, were generally much stronger in the Roswinkel field (reaching 0.3 g), which was actually the motivation for developing a bespoke GMM for the Groningen field (see Sect. 12.4.5) . Figure 139 compares the recorded horizontal PGA and PGV values from the 2006 and 2012 earthquakes, which does show that the Huizinge motion amplitudes were appreciably higher in general (although still rather low compared to the levels of ground shaking usually associated with structural damage). Using the moment magnitudes calculated for these two earthquakes-M 3.38 and M 3.52 (Dost et al. 2018 )-the Huizinge earthquake would have released almost 70% more seismic energy than the Westeremden earthquake. The higher energy and higher ground-motion amplitudes of the Huizinge earthquake would certainly explain why it had a greater impact than previous earthquakes in the field, but the extent to which the Huizinge event changed the course of the Groningen story is nonetheless surprisingand perhaps far exceeds the increment of seismic energy and ground-motion amplitudes relative to the previous largest event. In a paper authored by staff members from the regulator of the Groningen field (see Sect. 12.4.7) , it was stated that prior to the Huizinge earthquake, models had suggested that the largest earthquake that could occur in the field would be on the order of M L 3.3 to 3.5 and that during such events \"structural damage to buildings and personal risks would not occur\u2026. Based on these outcomes induced seismicity was considered a nuisance, causing damage without posing a safety risk\" (de Waal Fig. 138 Left: Community Internet-based intensities for the 2012 Huizinge earthquake (epicentre marked by a star); communities are based on the Dutch zip code system and averaged over 1 km 2 areas and populated areas shown grey; right: KNMI isoseismal map for the Huizinge earthquake (adapted from Dost and Kraaijpoel 2013) ; note that the scale on the two frames is not the same et al. 2017). The same paper goes on to note that \"The magnitude 3.6 Huizinge event in August (2012) \u2026. led to an unprecedented number of damage claims, involving thousands of homes. It was followed by an independent investigation by the regulator which showed that significantly stronger earthquakes, potentially with magnitudes up to 5.0, could not be excluded and that seismic risk levels in Groningen could be considerable.\" This quote highlights two key issues, one of which is that the Huizinge earthquake raised the prospect of the possibility of even larger events, as highlighted in the study by the regulator, which is discussed in Sect. 12.4.7. The other issue is that the impact was reported not in terms of thousands of damaged homes but rather in terms of thousands of damage claims, an issue explored a little further in Sect. 12.4.3.",

There is a very pronounced increase in the number of claims submitted following the M L 3.4 Westerwijtwerd earthquake of 22 May 2019, starting with a jump much larger than that which followed Huizinge, and then continuing with what appears to be an exponential increase. Figure 141 is the same as Fig. 139 but with the near-source (< 10 km) recordings of the Westerwijtwerd earthquake added in, showing that there was nothing exceptional about the motions from this event (located about 2.3 km SSW of Huizinge)-and certainly no reason for it to cause greater damage than the Huizinge earthquake. The reason for the increased rate of damage claims in recent times is much more likely to be related to be the way that the claims are now handled.",

From 19 March 2018, a new damage protocol was thus introduced retroactively for all damage reports, and claims were handled by the TCMG. In the current arrangement, claims are settled by the state-appointed IMG (Instituut Mijnbouwschade Groningen), which, like its predecessor TCMG, then invoices NAM for the cost of settled claims. The claims do not have to correspond to recent earthquakes, and it is still possible for claims to be submitted now for damage attributed to the Huizinge earthquake. By the end of 2012 (ignoring all claims prior to Huizinge), the value of the claims paid summed to 37.2 MEuros. These values could be compared with the losses report by EM-DAT (https:// public. emdat. be/ data) for the 1983 magnitude 5.1 earthquake in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, and the 1992 magnitude 5.2 Roermond earthquake in the southern Netherlands, which, adjusted to 2020 values, are 130 and 184 million USD respectively; those earthquakes would have released approximately 200 times more energy than the Huizinge earthquake. However, although there has been no earthquake equal in size or larger than the Huizinge event since 2012 (Fig. 136) , the total that has now been paid for damage claims exceeds 660 MEuros.",

In the Groningen region, settlement effects could have been exacerbated by seasonal variations in ground water levels, especially during droughts that have occurred in recent years. Many of the more severe cases of damage reflect patterns that are indicative of differential settlement, but the lighter damage is often very difficult to assign to either shaking or settlement on the basis of its appearance. At the end of 2016, the Dutch government introduced a policy named 'evidence presumption', which essentially meant that unless NAM could demonstrate that observed damage could be unambiguously attributed to another cause, it would be assumed to be due to ground shaking resulting from induced earthquakes.",

The subsidence due to reservoir compactions occurs over such a wide area that the resulting rotation of any individual building would be far too small to be a cause of damage. The Groningen earthquakes have also not caused soil liquefaction (see Sect. 11 .3) and the shaking levels have been far too low to cause dynamic deformations of the foundations. Close to the epicentres of the larger earthquakes, there will inevitably be some ambiguity between damage due to shaking and damage due to differential settlement, and indeed interaction between the two (e.g., Bal et al. 2021) . With increasing distances from these small earthquakes, it becomes increasingly likely that any observed damage is the result of static settlements rather than earthquake shaking.",

For reasons of space, I only provide a condensed summary of some of the main research activities, but my hope is that this will convey to the reader the unprecedented scale of the efforts made to characterise all the elements from the risk model from the cause, gas production, through to reservoir compaction and the final effects of ground shaking on building response.",

NAM also funded the installation of additional 350 accelerographs, some in public buildings but most in private homes, for which the owners were able to request such an instrument . New processing procedures were developed to optimise the information retrieved from the recordings obtained of the small-magnitude Groningen earthquakes (Edwards and Ntinalexis 2021) . Additionally, very dense networks of surface geophones were deployed for limited periods at different locations of the field to monitor ambient noise levels in order to estimate V S of the shallowest layers (Spica et al. 2018a ); earthquake recordings from these dense arrays were also used to constrain models for the spatial correlation of ground motions . The dynamic characteristics of the B-network strong-motion stations were determined through in situ V S measurements using a variety of techniques (Noorlandt et al.2018) , from which seismic CPT (cone penetration test) was identified as a suitable method that was subsequently applied to nearly all the G-network stations. Analysis of horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios was also used to verify the site characterisations (Spica et al. 2018b) . To provide additional constraint on the ground motion modelling, including the effect of the high-velocity Zechstein salt layer overlying the reservoir on seismic wave propagation , numerical simulations were performed to determine the geometrical spreading characteristics ).",

The uppermost part of the profiles was based on the GeoTop geological model, applying empirical relationships to assign V S values to the different lithological layers at different depths (Kruiver et al. 2021a) . The deep part of the profiles was based on direct measurements made in the new deep wells. To bridge the gap between the geologybased shallow V S profiles and the deep well logs (from about 50 to 150 m), an inversion was performed of surface waves recorded (and considered noise at the time) during the deep seismic reflection profiling of the reservoir in the 1980s-in effect, MASW on a very large scale. Laboratory work was also undertaken to determine the dynamic properties of Holocene peats in Groningen (Zwanenburg et al. 2020) . A special study was also undertaken to determine the dynamic characteristics of the dwelling mounds (known in Groningen as wierden) on which a small proportion of the building stock is situated (Kruiver et al. 2021b ).

This work has included in situ testing on many masonry buildings and laboratory tests on both extracted and constructed building elements . The pinnacle of these investigations were dynamic shake table tests on full-scale buildings, which have served to calibrate the advanced structural analyses performed to derive the fragility functions (Graziotti et al. 2016 The tests, conducted in Pavia (Italy) and Lisbon (Portugal), involved the transportation of Groningen building material and builders to these locations to construct full-scale models (Fig. 142 ) that were then subjected to cyclic and fully dynamic testing.

The starting point for the risk modelling is a prediction of the reservoir compaction. The field operator already had a mature dynamic model for the reservoir pressure based on gas withdrawal, which had been matched to observational data over the long production history. The reservoir compaction could then be calculated from the pressure changes, and the predictions of compaction have also been checked against measurements of surface subsidence obtained from levelling and remote sensing measurements.",

            "text": "As can be appreciated from Fig. 144 , the risk estimates included epistemic uncertainty. Logic-tree nodes were developed for each element of the model with the intention of capturing the epistemic uncertainties. The reason that the range of uncertainty is quite large for the higher production rate scenarios, despite all of the data collection activities and analyses described in the previous section, is mainly the extrapolation to magnitudes far larger than the maximum of M L 3.6 for which data are available. This reinforces the view expressed in Sect. 9.2 that for induced seismicity, the estimation of Mmax is critically important. The history of Mmax estimates for the Groningen field is worth briefly summarising. The earliest estimate was made by a body called Begeleidingscommissie Onderzoek Aardbevingen (BOA, Advisory Committee on Earthquake Investigation), which in 1993 issued a report that estimated Mmax as being in the range 2.9 to 3.3 , although it should be noted that this was not specifically for the Groningen field but rather for earthquakes around Assen, south of the Groningen field. KNMI subsequently issued new estimates in 1995, for which two approaches were used: the first was based on the cumulative trend of released seismic energy, which yielded an Mmax of 3.3; the second was based on the dimensions of geological faults, which gave an Mmax of 3.5. These (de Crook et al., 1998) estimates were revised by KNMI in 1998 (de Crook et al. 1998 , the two approaches now yielding values of 3.7 and 3.5 respectively. A third approach was also implemented, which involved Monte-Carlo simulations for Bayesian updating of the cumulative magnitude-frequency relation using a bounded Gutenberg-Richter equation (Fig. 145) . This final method yielded the highest estimate, based on the median-plus-one-standard-deviation result, of M L 3.8 for Mmax. The same Bayesian approach was applied a few years later by van Eck et al. (2006) , leading a slightly modified 84-percentile estimate of 3.9 for Mmax. This value was not revised again prior to the 2012 Huizinge earthquake, so it may be concluded that the prevailing view on the expected largest magnitude of earthquake in the field in August 2012 was M L 3.9.",

Moreover, Mmax is an estimate of the largest earthquake that is considered feasible, but that does not mean that it is necessarily expected to occur.

As the influence of this parameter became apparent, it was clear that such a conservative approach could have far-reaching (and unintended) consequences. In order to estimate the distribution of Mmax, and in view of the potential controversy associated with this parameter, NAM commissioned an independent panel of experts to make the assessment, informed by presentations and discussions at a three-day workshop hosted in Amsterdam in March 2016 . The resulting distribution of Mmax values was shown in Fig. 91 , with a peak at magnitude 4.5 but a tail extending out to just above magnitude 7; the expert panel effectively defined events of magnitude greater than 5 as triggered events that would necessarily rupture outside of the reservoir. Even though the weights assigned to the highest magnitudes in the distribution are small, the uncertainties associated with the ground motions from such scenarios are obviously very large. Indeed, we do not even know what the fault ruptures of such earthquakes would look like: they would presumably initiate inside the reservoir and propagate downwards into the Carboniferous basement. As was noted in Sect. 9.2, the Groningen Mmax distribution will be re-visited in the near future. If the risk calculations were to be performed only for induced earthquakes (therefore not exceeding magnitude 5), the uncertainties would be very considerably smaller given the more modest extrapolation beyond the data and the unparalleled wealth of data available for the Groningen field.",

I am convinced that this would also have an ideal vehicle to structure discussions of the uncertainties and controversies surrounding the induced seismicity in Groningen in a transparent manner that could have been closely followed by the regulator and other stakeholders. However, for this to have been feasible, it would have been necessary to avoid a parallel review process and periodic updates of the risk estimate during the execution of the SSHAC study, and these conditions were deemed unacceptable to the regulator hence this option could not be pursued.",

The risk model can identify both the areas and the structural typologies contributing most to the risk estimates, which can in turn prioritise and guide field inspections to develop an inventory of buildings to be strengthened (e.g., Palmieri et al. 2020) . Modified fragility functions were then developed for structures that had undergone strengthening, in order to calculate the risk reduction achieved with these measures.

            "text": "In a paper published in The Leading Edge, staff from the field regulator (Muntendam-Bos et al. 2015) made the following statements: \"Risk management depends on the ability to apply control measures. For seismic risk resulting from gas production, there are Fig. 146 Upper: Logic tree for risk mitigation options based on reduced production (P) and structural upgrading (U); lower: impact of mitigation strategies relative to baseline case (solid line) for an early proofof-concept model (NAM 2015) preliminary indications that seismic activity can be reduced by reducing gas-production rates. In addition, the consequences of earthquakes can be mitigated to a certain extent by adopting a preventive strengthening program aimed at strengthening the most vulnerable buildings and infrastructure to an acceptable level.\" While this acknowledged that building strengthening could contribute to risk mitigation, the implication is that it is less reliable and less effective than changing the production. At that time, restrictions on the gas production levels had already been imposed, and the authors cite van Thienen-Visser and Breunese (2015) as showing that this was already leading to reductions in the earthquake activity. However, I would contend that house strengthening is the more robust approach to risk mitigation, since there is uncertainty related to the future seismicity levels and how they will respond to reductions in production-although an 'experiment' is now being conducted that will provide insight on this issue (see Sect. 12.4.8)-whereas the application of established earthquake engineering retrofitting techniques can yield enhanced seismic reduction, with a consequent reduction to the seismic risk, with high confidence. In a subsequent publication by staff from the regulator, no reference at all was made to the option of building strengthening, the article focusing exclusively on the observed reductions in seismicity as a result of production restrictions that had been imposed. The article concluded with a very interesting statement: \"Along with the decrease in seismic activity, the public commotion related to the seismic risk has also declined. Currently, public displeasure is focused mainly on the process of damage handling and compensation\" (Muntendam-Bos et al. 2017). These words almost seem to indicate that with the production limits that had been imposed, the problem was largely resolved, provided the payment of damage claims would be accelerated-which Fig. 140 suggests did indeed happen. However, the apparently optimistic outlook expressed in 2017 did not persist, possibly because earthquakes continued to occur, including the M L 3.4 2018 Zeerijp and 2019 Westerwijtwerd earthquakes, both mentioned previously, regardless of the reduced production levels. This interpretation would seem to be consistent with the following statements from a later paper co-authored by staff from the regulatory body: \"Risk assessment is only the first step toward risk management. Several production-reducing measures have been imposed on the Groningen gas field, with the aim of reducing seismic activity. This aim has been achieved, at least for the short term (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) . A recent earthquake (January 8th 2018, magnitude 3.4) may change this assessment. The attainability of managing seismic activity in the small gas fields (e.g. by a traffic light system) has yet to be demonstrated. Whether operational measures to limit the number and strength of induced events exist remains highly uncertain, especially for fields at the end of their lifecycle. This is currently being investigated.\" (van Thienen-Visser et al. 2018) . A focus on physical risk mitigation through the reduction of fragility in the buildings contributing most to the risk estimates rather than only on hazard control through production limitations would have provided a more robust approach-as had been proposed by Bommer et al. (2015a) . A house strengthening programme is underway in Groningen, responsibility for which, like the claims handling, has now been taken away from NAM, but limited progress has been made, and now the opportunity to implement a concerted programme of structural upgrades in order to manage the seismic risk has been lost.",

I also believe that much can be learnt from the regulation of nuclear facilities, for which there is a tremendous body of experience to draw upon. As well as engaging with nuclear regulators in several countries through work on seismic hazard studies for nuclear sites, I have worked directly for the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC), and I think that both these agencies provide exemplary models for how regulation may be conducted. Regulation can be prescriptive, where the licensee is provided with clear guidelines to follow regarding the quantification of risk (which is the USNRC approach) or non-prescriptive, where the regulator establishes the goals to be met but leaves it to the licensee to determine how compliance with these goals is demonstrated (which is the approach used by ONR). In practice, the distinction can be exaggerated because USNRC does allow licensees to adopt alternative procedures (but counsels that this is likely to delay the assessment of license applications) and because the guidelines produced by ONR for its own inspectors are generally viewed as requirements by licensees. In either case, however, a basic principle is that the licensee is expected to undertake the seismic characterisation of the site and calculate the consequent risk to the plant, and the regulator interrogates and challenges the technical bases for these assessments to inform their judgement as to whether the assessments are reliable. In other words, it is essentially the role of peer reviewer, which is not to specify what the results of the study should be but to determine whether the study has been conducted correctly. I have never seen a nuclear regulator issue its own technical assessments, produced without peer review, and put these in front of a licensee, in effect asking them to accept or disprove the regulator's own scientific conclusions.",

            "text": "However, this is exactly what happened in Groningen. In January 2013, a few months after the Huizinge earthquake, SodM issued a remarkable report (Muntendam-Bos and de Waal 2013). The report presented an analysis of the induced seismicity in Groningen 1 3 and its correlation with the gas production from the field. One of the report conclusions was that analysis of the seismicity catalogue alone could not constrain the value of Mmax, which could clearly be greater than M L 3.6 and could also be larger than the previous estimate of M L 3.9. This conclusion was uncontroversial and was widely accepted. The report also concluded that the seismicity is driven by both the total volume of gas produced and the production rate, using a model that has been developed by one of the authors of the report (de Waal 1986; de Waal and Smits 1988) . On the basis of this model, the report proposed that it would be necessary to reduce the annual production rate to 12 bcm in order to ensure that there would be no earthquakes of M L \u2265 1.5. This gave rise to the slightly bizarre situation in which the field operator, NAM, argued for a lower production rate than the regulator: given that NAM's own analyses did not support the rate-dependent model, its position was that if the risk control objective was to eliminate all seismicity of magnitude M L \u2265 1.5, the only option would be to end gas production. It is interesting to note that the rate-dependent model has not found much support: KNMI, which was consulted extensively by SodM during their analyses, insisted on including a disclaimer in Muntendam-Bos and de Waal (2013) report to state that the official Dutch seismological service could not support the conclusions based on the model that made the seismicity dependent on the rate of gas production. More recently, de Pater and Berenten (2021), analysing induced seismicity at several gas fields, in and without the Netherlands, concluded that \"compaction dominates seismicity and rate effects are negligible. As yet, no evidence exists for the proposed seismicity-free production rate\". There is now also strong empirical evidence that the rate-dependent model and the proposed production threshold of 12 bcm are fundamentally flawed. The production rates have been cut drastically as the field moves towards closure (see Sect. 12.4.8) , and during the gas production year from 1 st October 2020 to 30 September 2021, the rate fell below 12 bcm for the first time (Fig. 147 ), yet the seismicity continues. Moving into the current gas year, production rates have dropped even lower, and yet just after a full year with production rates 25% lower than the threshold that was proposed to end all earthquakes, an earthquake of M L 2.5 occurred at Zeerijp on 4 October 2021, and a few weeks later, on 16 November 2021, an M L 3.2 earthquake occurred at Garrelsweer.",

If the multi-million Euro, multi-year investment in data collection for Groningen (Sect. 12.4.4), supported by analyses conducted and reviewed by international teams of highly qualified and experienced professionals (Sect. 12.4.5), only results in a 'weak' state of knowledge, there is little hope for ever being able to rationally manage the risk from induced seismicity. If peer review by international panels of experts leaves major-but unrecognised and unknown(!)-uncertainties aside, the entire discipline of seismic risk analysis would seem to be in early infancy rather than the mature state I believe to be the case. The fluctuations in the calculated risk alluded to in the quote have mainly been the consequence of the insistence of SodM and the Ministry EZK for full hazard and risk assessments at frequent intervals, which have never allowed the internal iteration of the models prior to implementation (as would have happened had the risk study been conducted as a SSHAC process, as proposed by NAM in 2016). This quote and those in the previous section all allude to the view of the regulator-despite their own bombastic and now disproven declaration in 2013-that the risk could not be reliably modelled or controlled, a view arising from focusing on control of the seismicity as the primary tool for risk mitigation and a lack of appreciation for how earthquake engineering could very effectively diminish the risk. In effect, the regulator's position has tended towards the precautionary principle, with the inevitable outcome from such an approach to risk management, as discussed below in Sect. 12.4.8. In closing this discussion, my hypothesis is that while the Huizinge earthquake was the largest to have occurred in the Groningen field, it does not explain the events that have unfolded since either in terms of the uncontrolled payment of damage claims that far exceed the possible consequences of the seismicity or in terms of the decision to the close the gas field (see next section). The turning point in this story, in my opinion, was the SodM report of 2013. In much the same way that the Juanes et al. (2017) report transformed the Castor situation into a crisis (Sect. 12.3), the report by Muntendam-Bos and de Waal (2013) was the first step in the manufacture of a crisis in Groningen.",

The Groningen gas field is a very major resource: it was the 7 th largest gas field in the world when it was discovered in 1959 and about a quarter of the total gas remains today-it is still within the top 15 global reserves. While the field was a lucrative asset for NAM, the main economic beneficiary has been the Dutch government, which through a variety of levies and taxes, is the main recipient (more than 90%) of income from the field (it is estimated that over the life of the field, the income to the Dutch state from Groningen has been on order of 1 trillion Euros).",

An additional complication arises from the fact that the Groningen field produces low-calorific gas by virtue of containing ~ 14% nitrogen. Since all facilities that currently rely on Groningen gas are calibrated to burn this lowcalorific gas, GTS (Gasunie Transport Services BV, the company responsible for the gas transmission network in the Netherlands) is constructing, at a cost of around 200 million Euros, a plant that will add nitrogen to the high-quality imported gas before passing it on as low-calorific gas to consumers. The construction of this plant is behind schedule at the time of writing, which will apparently lead to the final production levels in the current gas year being on the order of 7-9 bcm.",

Muntendam-Bos et al.

However, the Groningen experience suggests that data collection and monitoring, at any scale, will be no match for politicised decision-making. Moreover, responding to public and political pressures, the Dutch government decided in 2018 that NAM would not provide further risk assessments (the last risk assessment by NAM was prepared in March 2020) and the scientific program led and funded by NAM will be closed out. No new study initiatives have been started since 2019. Currently, the last studies are being completed.",

I have also tried to show that there are multiple options for mitigating the risk due to induced earthquakes, including both measures to control the hazard and the application of classical earthquake engineering to reduce risk through reduction of fragility (Sect. 10). In addition, I have argued that the global databases of small-to-moderate magnitude earthquakes can provide a framework for understanding the threshold sizes of earthquakes that can pose a threat to people and to the built environment, and also demonstrated how these thresholds are controlled primarily by the fragility of the exposed elements (Sect. 11). However, in spite of all of these advances, Sect. 12 has painted a rather discouraging outlook, with four major projects related to energy supply being shut down as the result of induced earthquakes, all of which correspond to magnitude-distance scenarios that would generally not be considered a serious threat (Fig. 117) . In this section I briefly discuss some of the factors that I believe have contributed to these situations and offer some thoughts on how these might be addressed. I am conscious that there is an extensive literature on risk perception and decision making that I am not drawing upon in these discussions (apart from a few papers specifically related to induced seismicity)-these are simply my own insights from my experience of working on these projects.",

In terms of being poorly informed, there would appear to be a widespread misunderstanding of fundamental concepts. This was brought home to me through teaching at Imperial College London, when I introduced a new module for firstyear undergraduates on Energy Supply and Infrastructure. The module began with an open debate on ideas for sustainable energy provision for the future to meet demand and address climate change, in which it became apparent that many students believed, for example, that electricity can be both efficiently stored and efficiently transported over large distances (these are very bright students who had finished their schooling without being taught the fundamentals of energy supply). Ten weeks later, after a couple of lectures on energy supply in general and several specific energy sources, a much more informed and constructive debate took place. Whitmarsh et al. (2015) present an interesting survey of attitudes to different energy technologies in the UK, noting in the first instance how views were largely influenced by factors such as demographics, political leanings, and environmental attitudes. Whitmarsh et al. (2015) also found that attitudes were changed when people were provided with more information, which enabled a more balanced cost-benefit assessment. Understanding the benefits and risk of all energy technologies and sources, and all the implications of both their use and their abandonment, would clearly help.",

After two lectures covering fundamentals of energy supply and economics, each of the successive weeks consisted of an invited lecture on a particular energy technology, and we were very fortunate to have excellent speakers give up their time to make presentations on several energy sources (including wind, solar, nuclear, geothermal, biofuels, hydrogen, energy from waste, and oil and gas). While the lectures were very interesting and informative, it was also apparent how many speakers were proponents for a particular technology rather than proponents for a balanced energy mix that included that technology. I think that there are two factors that seemed to contribute to this attitude, one being a perceived need to vilify other energy technologies in order to promote an alternative, and the clear sense that each technology is competing for limited government support in terms of subsidies and tax relief-which in turn would partly explain the tendency to criticise other energy sources.",

The human condition seems to set us to argue to prove that we are right rather than discuss so that together we find the right answer, but the stakes in the energy debate are very high and such dualist outlooks will not solve the challenges.

Regardless of the source of the energy we use, our long-term survival as a species and as a planet will require us to use less energy, which is more likely to be achieved by radical changes to our lifestyles-particularly in the more affluent countries-rather than by more efficient technologies. There is, I believe, an inherent inconsistency in people expressing the view that it is exclusively the responsibility of governments to solve climate change: if governments were to impose the restrictions on travel and consumption necessary to immediately address increasing global temperatures and the ravaging of nature, it would be met with outrage. Governments, of course, have a critical role to play in determining energy policies and legislating to protect the environment, but the expectation that this can be done to only impact on large corporations without affecting our patterns of consumption is highly unrealistic. An often-stated claim is that we, as a society, are addicted to fossil fuels-I would argue that we are also addicted to very high energy consumption levels. If this is so, then perhaps a holistic solution to the energy issue will also require us to learn from those who have conquered addiction to other substances, in which a key step is a shift from blaming external factors to self-examination.

What does seem to be clear is that a smooth and well-planned transition will be greatly preferable to one for which we are not prepared. An important concept in this respect is peak oil, a term first coined by Marion King Hubbert (Hubbert 1956) , which corresponds to the moment in time when production rates of oil start to decline. Since the demand for oil continues to rise inexorably (apart from a brief period at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic), driven by growing population, industrialisation, and hypermobility, once peak oil is reached, a rapidly increasing gap would be created between demand and supply. In fact, if demand continues to rise then even a plateau in production rates would suffice to create the gap, which many have predicted would have very ugly economic and social consequences. Predicted dates for when peak oil would be reached have been superseded several times, due to factors including the discovery of new reserves and more effective retrieval technologies. The failure of predictions for when peak oil will happen has probably contributed to complacency regarding this issue, which sooner or later is inevitable. Bardi (2009) discusses the resistance to acceptance of the concept of peak oil, while Chapman (2014) proposes that it remains very relevant. Kerr (2011) argued that a decade ago oil production had already levelled off outside of the OPEC nations. Whether or not peak oil would have happened in the last decade is open to debate, but whether peak oil was averted or whether its due date was simply pushed out even further into the future, it is clear that the expansion of unconventional oil production-including hydraulic fracturing-has been instrumental in changing the panorama. Some readers, who favour a rapid end to the use of fossil fuels, may have been gratified by the fact that induced seismicity shut down the three projects related to natural gas supply that were related in Sect. 12. Such a view would be, in my opinion, very na\u00efve, since in none of these cases has the response been to replace the use of the natural gas with renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power-for the cases of UK shale gas and the Groningen gas field, it has simply meant a shift to imported natural gas from Russia and other providers. Other consequences have included potential shortages and huge increases of natural gas prices, which in many cases has resulted in increased use of coal and oil to generate electricity (Holliday 2021) . For the case of Groningen, a study by Vergeer et al. (2015) forecast a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions if the gas field were closed and replaced by imported gas from Russia.",

Most journals publish comments and responses on articles, which provides a forum for intense scientific debate, and publication therefore demonstrates willingness to subject one's hypotheses and analyses to scrutiny and challenge.

The short film presents a short history of the Castor project and seismicity that is full of inaccuracies, including statements that the caprock of the reservoir was broken and that the \"massive earthquake\"-also qualifying the seismic sequence incorrectly as \"the first quakes of this magnitude to ever hit the region\"-was caused by the Amposta fault (https:// www. youtu be. com/ watch?v= cRXyU clQpjw). The shocking feature of the documentary for me, however, was that the talking heads speaking to these 'facts' and criticising the project operators for not foreseeing the outcomes of the gas injections, included an infrastructure expert, a space physicist and a bioengineer! The more critical viewer might ask how these individuals are qualified to speak to induced seismicity caused by gas storage, but for many observers they would simply come across as technical experts and their pronouncements would have carried authority. For the producers of the documentary, it would not have been difficult to track down the authors of some of the many journal papers published on the Castor seismicity, but their views would probably not have fitted well into the compelling and sensational (albeit largely fictional) narrative.",

To transform estimates of hazard into estimates of seismic risk requires the contribution of earthquake engineers. To date, however, it would appear that scientists (seismologists, geophysicists and geomechanics experts) have responded far more energetically to the challenges of induced seismicity than have earthquake engineers. I was impressed, for example, how the participants in the 3 rd Schatzalp Workshop on Induced Seismicity (see introduction to Sect. 8) were overwhelmingly scientists and there were no presentations that approached induced seismicity from the perspective of earthquake engineering. Consequently, there is a vast body of research on induced seismicity, of which a large part is motivated by scientific curiosity and by what induced seismicity can teach us about faulting, crustal stresses, and triggering of earthquakes. Such research is clearly worthwhile and enlightening, but its value could be further extended if combined with an engineering focus to seek solutions to the management of induced seismic risk. 6 To be fair, some earthquake engineering researchers have engaged with the subject of induced seismicity, notably the research groups led by Professor Abbie Liel at the University of Colorado and Professor Jack Baker at Stanford University, and the European earthquake engineers who have been engaged in the risk modelling and house strengthening programmes for Groningen (Sect. 12.4).",

Currently, it is not at all uncommon for discussions of how to handle induced seismicity to entirely ignore the option of applying earthquake engineering to reduce structural fragility. A typical example is the following text from the paper by de Pater and Berensten (2021), cited in Sect. 12.4, on the factors controlling induced earthquakes in Groningen: \"Since seismicity only depends on compaction, there is little scope for management of seismicity: only pressure maintenance appears to be a viable solution. This can be accomplished by injection to preserve the mass balance or by shutting in gas fields.\" Knoblauch et al. (2019) discuss public preferences regarding the location of enhanced geothermal systems, balancing the benefit of district heating and green electricity with the possibility of induced seismicity; the study provides interesting insights, but the only risk mitigation option put to the participants in the surveys was reduction of the hazard through increased separation of the operations from the exposure.

I regret that I do not have an answer to this question, but I can see many challenges. As I noted in Sect. 9.6, candid presentation of the risk assessment 1 3 should include disclosure of the uncertainties, but these may easily be interpreted as indicating that the problem is poorly understood and therefore it could undermine rather than bolster assurance. For a public that is well informed regarding energy supply and the relative benefits (in terms of security of supply, cost, sustainability, and environmental impact) of different energy sources and technologies, there may be scope for objective communication of the seismic risks associated with some technologies. In a polarised situation, where 'debate' has been reduced to little more than the mutual vilification of antagonistic groups formed around entrenched ideological positions (who support or oppose issues as part of the 'package' that comes with the general political outlook rather than on the basis of any informed assessment), it may be pointless to even try.",

However, this authority and autonomy must be balanced by a system of checks and balances, so that complaints regarding any inappropriate conduct by the regulator can be referred to a higher authority, to which the regulator is accountable. \u2022 The regulator should also have the ability, within the national framework for health, safety, and environmental legislation, to determine policy with regard to control of induced seismicity and mitigation of induced seismic risk. The final decisions, however, regarding implementation of energy technologies, will reside elsewhere since several other factors, including security of energy supply, also need to be taken into account. \u2022 The regulator should publish (and update as required) clear guidelines for operators with regard to the expectations in terms of management of induced seismicity; as noted in Sect. 12.4, such guidelines may prescribe a series of steps to be followed or else define goals to be met, in the latter case encouraging licensees to follow relevant good practice to meet those goals. \u2022 The regulatory guidelines or requirements should address the quantification and inclusion of all sources of uncertainty, and define performance targets that incorpo-rate and accommodate the uncertainty; every effort should be made to avoid invoking the precautionary principle. \u2022 The regulator requires the technical and scientific expertise to evaluate the induced seismic hazard and risk assessments. Given the highly specialist nature of this field, it is most likely that the regulator will need to contract external support in this regard, either on the project-specific basis or by appointing expert panels such as those which support the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation in the field of seismic hazard and climate change (https:// www. onr. org. uk/ exter nal-panels/ natur al-hazar dspanel. htm); the experts engaged should be well regarded within their scientific communities and preferably without any engagements by the industry being regulated. The regulator should also be able to rely on technical support from relevant national scientific bodies such as geological surveys and seismological services. \u2022 Another option for engaging technical expertise for the evaluations is for the regulator to encourage licensees to adopt the SSHAC process and then to rely on the PPRP as the primary technical reviewer, to be supplemented by the regulator's own assessment; it would not be inappropriate for the regulator to engage with the operator regarding the composition of the PPRP in such cases. \u2022 The regulator should avoid issuing its own scientific positions regarding specific hazard and risk models, especially if these reflect the research of individual staff members, since this creates an unbalanced situation in which the licensee would then be required to adopt or disprove the model; moreover, if such a model is found to be flawed, then the credibility of the regulator is undermined. However, it could be appropriate for a regulatory body to jointly sponsor and endorse industry-wide studies that establish consensus models for elements of the hazard and risk assessments, as the USNRC has done for the development of regional SSC and GMC models to be used in PSHA at NPP sites in the central and eastern United States. \u2022 The regulator's engagement with licensees should be constructive (regulators and operators should have the common objective of safe operations) but also formal; when the regulator is present in meetings with the licensee or as an observer at workshops, non-binding verbal comments may be made, but all specifications of requirements should be communicated by letter, copied to relevant parties, and forming part of the official record of the assessment. Instructions to licensees should not be issued in telephone conversations, texts, or informal emails. Resolution of disputes between regulators and licensees should not require Freedom of Information requests to recover the paper trail. \u2022 In general, the regulatory staff should adhere to strict codes of professional conduct, which then allows them to demand the same of the licensees. The regulator should have the willingness and authority to challenge any dishonesty or concealment on the part of licensees (and impose sanctions when necessary), but the default starting position should be one of mutual professional respect; experts engaged by the licensees to assist with hazard and risk assessments should be viewed as professionals of integrity rather than hired guns. \u2022 The regulatory agency will inevitably be an instrument of government, but it should be autonomous to the extent that is possible. Equally important is for the regulator to be demonstrably independent from licensees. The regulator needs to be an honest broker, neither sacrificing safety considerations to meet government energy strategies nor allowing operators to fall short of the safety requirements. \u2022 A key question is how regulatory bodies should be funded, which often is in large part from levies imposed on the licensees. Whether funded by industry or government, the arrangements should be designed to avoid the financial support in any way compromising the regulator's autonomy. I would also argue that the funding should be sufficient to allow staff salaries and consultant fees to be paid at levels comparable to those in the industries being regulated, in order to create a level playing field. \u2022 Finally, the regulator should be prepared to communicate to the public their policy and their decisions, and defend these, when necessary, against attacks from protest groups; pandering to the most vocal sections of civil society is not a basis for effective regulation.",

The capture of epistemic uncertainties in seismic hazard analysis is reaching a stage of maturity that may allow us to focus more on reducing the uncertainty intervals rather than ensuring that sufficient uncertainty has been captured. When we re-visit some seismic hazard studies conducted for NPP sites 30 or more years ago, we are often struck by the remarkably optimistic view of the state of knowledge at the time. However, more recent PSHA studies tend to capture epistemic uncertainty as a matter of course and the task before us now is to demonstrate how uncertainty can be reduced through the acquisition of new data and the conduct of new analyses.",

All of the advances that have been made in seismic hazard and risk analysis can be brought to bear-with appropriate adaptations-on the challenges posed by induced seismicity.

Exaggeration of the impact, generally in form of damage claims that far exceeded the actual damage, is a common feature of all the case histories. Another common feature seems to be the prospect of larger earthquakes occurring if the industrial activity were to continue, even though in some cases these larger events are very unlikely-and in at least one of the cases, probably physically impossible. This highlights that the estimation of the maximum magnitude of earthquake that can be generated by any specific application of an energy technology is an extremely important topic. I would recommend this as a priority area for research, and that the research include the effects of controls such as traffic light protocols to limit the size of the largest induced earthquake. For as long as claims can be made regarding our inability to preclude large-magnitude earthquakes occurring, stakeholders will seek to invoke the precautionary principle as the basis for shutting down the energy-related activities.

Although my career began in a very different time (before mobile phones, email, and the Internet), some younger readers, setting out on their own career paths, may be interested in how I came to be involved in these wonderfully interesting enterprises. Let me state at the very outset that it was not the result of executing a carefully conceived career plan. Rather I would say that my good fortune was a combination of creating opportunities for serendipity and then fully engaging with the opportunities that consequently opened up for me. To create opportunities, I travelled a great deal (and learning other languages enhanced both the enjoyment and the benefits of these voyages) and I accepted invitations to participate in interesting ventures without giving too much attention to the terms and conditions being offered. And I did participate rather than being a passive observer: Mark Twain is famously quoted as saying \"It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt\", but you will not be noticed if you do not contribute to discussions. The caveat is needing to be ready to acknowledge being wrong, which I have had to do many times, but by engaging in exchanges and occasionally making a useful contribution to the discussion, new invitations and opportunities arose. An outstanding example of this for me was my appointment to the Seismic Advisory Board (SAB) for the Panama Canal Authority during the early phase of the canal expansion programme, one of the most exciting appointments of my career. In the meetings, in which I was active in the discussions, I developed an excellent rapport with SAB member Dr Lloyd Cluff, head of the geosciences department at the Pacific Gas & Electricity company. On the basis of those interactions, Lloyd subsequently appointed me to the SAB for the Diablo Canyon NPP in central California, which was another amazing opportunity to learn from some of the leading figures in the field. And new opportunities subsequently arose from interactions in the Diablo Canyon SAB meetings.",

            "text": "Professor Nick Ambraseys said in the first ever Mallet-Milne lecture that \"There is little room in Engineering Seismology for 'armchair' seismologists and engineers\" (Ambraseys 1988) , and I took this admonition to heart, undertaking several field reconnaissance studies of damaging earthquakes in Algeria, Armenia, California, Colombia, Italy, Japan, Peru and Turkey, among others noted below. The first earthquake I visited was the destructive M 5.7 San Salvador, El Salvador, earthquake of October 1986. During the visit, made as part of a small EEFIT team (Bommer and Ledbetter 1987) , I met Dr Jon Cortina SJ, a Jesuit priest, structural engineer and professor at the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), with whom I stayed in touch afterwards. In 1993, after completing my PhD, I went to work at the UCA for two years, in what was a fantastically enjoyable and rewarding experience, even if El Salvador would not have automatically been on most people's recommended list of destinations to advance an academic career. I stayed engaged with my colleagues at the UCA and other institutions in El Salvador after I returned to London to take up a lecturing position at Imperial, securing EU funding for a digital accelerograph network (Bommer et al. 1997) and continuing research on historical earthquakes (Ambraseys et al. 2001 ). In 1998 I wrote an article for the SECED Newsletter entitled \"A 12-year field mission\" explaining all the activities and collaborations that arose from the original visit (Bommer 1998) . In the end, my involvement with projects in El Salvador lasted much more than a dozen years, but more about that later.",

            "text": "Despite the ever-increasing possibilities to study earthquakes remotely, I still believe that there is enormous value in going to the field: every earthquake is a full-scale laboratory and the connections that are made can have enduring consequences, as was the case with my study of the San Salvador earthquake. Field reconnaissance missions are frequently organised by EEFIT, EERI and GEER following major earthquakes around the world, and there is great value in joining teams led by experienced individuals and participating in the collective reporting and interpretation of field data that follows. However, there are occasions where a more informal approach can also be appropriate. In May 1995 I was in Athens having dinner with our Geotechnical Engineering MSc students on the last evening of a week-long field trip visiting landslides and tunnels under construction, when the news came in of a large earthquake in the north of the country. Very early the next morning, with two Greek MSc students, we rented a car and drove to the affected area, where we spent a week studying the effects of the earthquake (Bommer et al. 1995) . Just over a decade later, I recall receiving an automated email from the USGS with notification of a magnitude M 7 earthquake in Mozambique and meeting my colleague Dr Clark Fenton in the corridor as we headed to each other's offices to propose a field reconnaissance. Less than a week later, we were in the field studying the fault rupture (Fig. 8) and just over four months after the earthquake occurred, we published a paper from our findings . Our adventures in the field and how we found our way to fault rupture-located in a remote region littered with minefields-are recounted in an article in the SECED Newsletter .",

            "text": "As well as being willing to travel and to engage with opportunities that arise, I would also say that turning down small opportunities that do not appear particularly attractive at face value may sometimes mean losing wonderful opportunities-or rather, the possibility of creating such opportunities. In 2006, I was approached-on the basis of a colleague's recommendation-by the Council for Geoscience in South Africa to review the chapters related to seismic hazard assessment of the manual being developed for nuclear site characterisation. Although not a particularly exciting engagement, I accepted and produced a lengthy, and rather critical, report summarising my review. Several months later, I was approached for a follow-up review of all the seismic studies that CGS had conducted on behalf of the energy utility Eskom for potential new-build nuclear sites. The work involved reviewing a large number of reports, and once again I wrote a lengthy review, effectively a gap analysis of the studies conducted. Among my recommendations was that the site-specific hazard assessments should be conducted as SSHAC Level 3 studies. This prompted an invitation to visit South Africa for meetings with CGS and Eskom, the outcome of which-to cut a long story short-was the first ever application of the SSHAC Level 3 process outside of North America (Bommer et al. 2015b) . As a direct result of that project, I became involved with drafting the updated SSHAC implementation guidelines in NUREG-2117 and NUREG-2213. My contracts for the work on those USNRC documents essentially covered my travel expenses and a fraction of the time spent on the projects, but this was a perfect example of when it makes sense to be involved in an enterprise regardless of the remuneration.",

            "text": "A very interesting part of my work has been related to induced seismicity, and I will finish with the story of how I came to work in this field, which perfectly illustrates the idea of creating opportunities for serendipity and engaging with the opportunities that arise. In January 2001, a major subduction earthquake occurred offshore El Salvador, and 15 years after the 1986 earthquake that first took me that beautiful country, I headed back as part of a field reconnaissance team. During the visit I went to the offices of the geothermal energy company GESAL (now LaGeo) since I knew that they operated strong-motion accelerographs from which I was interested in obtaining copies of the recordings, to supplement those from the network we had installed 5 years earlier in conjunction with the UCA. The secretary of my contact at GESAL told me that he was in a meeting all day and could not be disturbed, but I pleaded with her to let him know that I was visiting from London and that day was my only possibility to come to his office. This worked and I was actually invited to join the meeting he was in, which was with engineers from Shell to discuss a possible enhanced geothermal project using an abandoned well at the Berl\u00edn geothermal field in the eastern province of Usulut\u00e1n. One of the main topics of discussion that day was the control of induced seismicity, and I ended up with a contract to work with Shell geophysicist Dr Steve Oates and others on the design of the traffic light scheme that was deployed on the project . As recounted in Sect. 12.1 of the paper, this then led to my engagement on the Basel Deep Heat Mining project, and a few years later, following the Huizinge earthquake (Sect. 12.4.2), Dr Oates recommended me to NAM to participate in the development of the hazard and risk model for the Groningen field.",

Working in great teams has been the greatest source of learning for me as well as a lot of fun. And when teams work really well-the key seems to be having everyone fully engaged and nobody needing to be the smartest person in the room-the outputs can be remarkable. Watching ideas develop as a problem is raised and possible solutions thrown out, challenged, defended, modified, and then elaborated and fine-tuned, is a uniquely satisfying and rewarding experience 8 -and one for me that would qualify as flow (Csikszentmihalyi 1990) . I am also utterly convinced that such interactions-particularly when the participants have individually considered the issues and worked on potential solutions beforehand-produce results that far exceed what any individual, however bright, could achieve working alone. Within your collaborations, do not be afraid to contribute to the process-even seemingly 'dumb' questions can often nudge the process in very helpful directions. And never compare your abilities and your contributions with those of others-learn all you can from your collaborators but enjoy bringing your own flavours to the kitchen: the dish will be much richer than if everybody brings the same ingredients.",

            "text": "in that time. A significant part of my early education during those years of my PhD studies and the beginning of my academic career was provided by Dr Sarada K Sarma, who displayed tremendous patience and generosity in explaining things to me during long afternoons in his office and to whom I will always be very grateful. Although our interactions were fewer in number, another person with whom I enjoyed enlightening conversations during those early days was Dr Robin Adams of the International Seismological Centre. The next stage of my formation began when I began to travel and interact with some of the leading figures in the field of engineering seismology. I was privileged to spend time at the USGS in Menlo Park, California, after completing my PhD, working with Dave Boore and the late Bill Joyner-I think the time spent with these two great mentors was probably the single most intense period of learning in my whole career, as well as being a lot of fun. Dave has remained a valued colleague and a good friend ever since. Two other individuals who I met in the early days of my career and from whom I learnt a great deal were Norm Abrahamson and Frank Scherbaum. I feel very fortunate to have spent time with both of these outstanding seismologists and to benefit from long discussions and lively discussions that were always enlightening. A special mention is also due to the late Dimitri Papastamatiou, the first person with whom I ever undertook consultancy work and who introduced me to the world of applied engineering seismology. As noted in the epilogue of the paper, the late Lloyd S Cluff was another person who inspired me and who was instrumental in opening up many fantastic opportunities for me. I have since both enjoyed and benefitted from collaborations on consulting projects with a long list of outstanding engineers, geologists and seismologists, including all of the following: Norm Abrahamson And my humble apologies to those who I have forgotten to include. Three names have been deliberately omitted from the list above because they deserve special mention. I have worked with Helen Crowley and Rui Pinho on many projects, and it has always been a hugely enjoyable experience. Their combined knowledge of earthquake engineering, fragility functions, and risk analysis is encyclopaedic, and their commitment to excellence in their work make it a pleasure and a privilege to work with them. The other name missing from the list above is Peter J Stafford, who came to Imperial from New Zealand to work with me as a post-doc in 2006 and rapidly became my teacher, as I would frequently drop into his office to pick his brains on technical topics. Working with Peter, on research and consultancy, has been tremendous-he has one of the sharpest minds (also reflected in his dry sense of humour) I have ever come across. When I left my full-time academic position at Imperial College London in 2011, Peter had already been appointed to the academic staff and it felt very right and fitting to leave the teaching of Engineering Seismology in far more capable hands than my own. During my full-time academic career at Imperial College London, I was fortunate to supervise many very capable and enthusiastic PhD students including John Edwin Alarc\u00f3n, Guillermo Aldama-Bustos, Juliet Bird (now Mian), Jon Hancock, Alejandro Mart\u00ednez-Pereira, Myrto Papaspiliou and Iain Tromans. My years at Imperial were also marked with important interactions with many distinguished Civil Engineers, including Amr S Elnashai, head of the Earthquake Engineering Section to which I originally belonged, and with whom I undertook several field reconnaissance missions to damaging earthquakes. During my 17 years as a full-time academic and subsequently as a Senior Research Investigator, I have served under many heads of department, each of whom provided me with support and encouragement for which I am very grateful: Patrick Dowling, Roger Hobbs, Tony Ridley, David Nethercott, Nick Buenfeld and now Washington Ochieng. During my years on campus in South Kensington, my lunches with Washington and my good friend and colleague, Ahmed Elghazouli (with whom I have made many earthquake field investigations including an entertaining day looking for damage due to the Bishop's Castle earthquake in 1990), are among the happy memories of my academic life. And I cannot speak of my academic career without acknowledging John Burland, a true scholar and gentleman whose sympathetic ear and wise words were a gift for which I will always be thankful. My career has involved almost two decades in academia and now well over a decade working primarily as an independent consultant. With regards to the latter, I wish to acknowledge all the clients, including government agencies, who have placed their trust in me and valued my work. I have also learned a great deal from the interactions with engineers, geophysicists, and project managers within the organisations by which I have been engaged, who are too many to mention by name here. A particularly special mention is due to the many clients who have had the wisdom to allow publication of seismic hazard and risk studies undertaken for their facilities, notably Eskom in South Africa, Eletronuclear in Brazil and the Oil & Gas Authority in the UK, among others. In this regard, Jan van Elk of NAM has been exemplary, not only in allowing work to be published openly but actively encouraging publication.",

A very special mention is also due to the companies who have so generously supported this Mallet-Milne as sponsors: Atkins, Rendel, and Jacobs.I am indebted to so many people for their contributions to the success I have enjoyed in my career that I doubt I can find a way to acknowledge all of their contributions, but I will make my best effort to put on record my gratitude to those who have been part of my story. My journey in the field of engineering seismology began when I was a final-year Civil Engineering undergraduate, with lectures by Professor Nicholas Ambraseys, which completely captured my imagination and lit a fire of enthusiasm in me. I ended up studying for my PhD under Professor Ambraseys's supervision and am forever grateful for all that I learnt",
