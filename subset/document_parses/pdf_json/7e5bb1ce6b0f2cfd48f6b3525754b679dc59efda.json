Prior studies have revealed the adverse effects (AEs) of PPE on healthcare workers (HCWs); however, no review has focused on the AEs of PPE on HCWs in intensive care units (ICUs). This review aimed to identify the AEs of PPE on HCWs working in ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A scoping review was conducted. MEDLINE, CINAHL, the World Health Organization (WHO) global literature on COVID-19, and Igaku-chuo-zasshi (a Japanese medical database), Google Scholar, medRxiv, and Health Research Board (HRB) open research were searched from January 25-28, 2021. The extracted data included author(s) name, year of publication, country, language, article title, journal name, publication type, study methodology, population, outcome, and key findings. Results: The initial search identified 691 articles and abstracts. Twenty-five articles were included in the analysis. The analysis comprised four key topics: studies focusing on PPE-related headache, voice disorders, skin manifestations, and miscellaneous AEs of PPE. The majority of AEs for HCWs in ICUs were induced by prolonged use of masks. Conclusion: The AEs of PPE among HCWs in ICUs included heat, headaches, skin injuries, chest discomfort, and dyspnea. Studies with a focus on specific diseases were on skin injuries. Moreover, many AEs were induced by prolonged use of masks.",

Additionally, PPE-related AEs may lead to inadequate use of PPE as well as increased chance of infection (Calo`et al., 2020) .

We excluded psychological effects and infections in healthcare professionals. We included studies on healthcare professionals working in the ICU; however, we also included studies with hospital and ICU staff data.

They reported prevalence with or without risk factors for extreme exhaustion, headaches, thirst, heat, pressure areas, retroauricular pain, chest discomfort, and dyspnea. Five articles investigated specific symptoms, such as PPE-related headaches Goh et al., 2020; Hajjij et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2020) and voice disorders (Heider et al., 2021) . Nine studies reported PPE-related skin injuries and manifestations (Abiakam et al., 2021; Chiriac et al., 2020; Dell'Era et al., 2020; Downie, 2020; Gefen & Ousey, 2020; Jiang, Liu, et al., 2020; Jiang, Song, et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Wiwanitkit, 2020) . After conceptual classification, we concluded that the studies covered four key topics: PPE-related headaches, voice disorders, and skin injuries and/or manifestations, and miscellaneous AEs of PPE. The prevalence of each adverse effect in the ICU is summarized in Table 2 .",

One international study (PPE-SAFE study) showed that 80% of HCWs working in the ICU reported significant AEs, including heat (51%), thirst (47%), pressure areas (44%), and headaches (28%) . Another study conducted using the same methodology in a Japanese ICU revealed that heat was the most common adverse effect (75.2%), followed by pressure areas (56.1%), thus indicating that the nurse's position was an independent risk factor for significant heat symptoms (Unoki et al., 2020) . Similarly, the same methodology of the PPE-SAFE study's methodology was applied to Australian ICU settings . The study found that 49% HCWs that experienced PPE-related AEs reported that the prevalence of pressure areas and headaches was 17% and 10%, respectively.",

All the studies and opinions focused on the use of masks. In particular, a study by Lam et al. (2020) , which was based on a case-series study, emphasized that the N95 mask was associated with pressure ulcers at the bridge of the nose. Jiang, Song et al. (2020) conducted a web-based crosssectional survey using a convenience sample of 4308 respondents, comprising nurses and physicians, including ICU staff found that the prevalence of PPE-related skin injuries was 42.8% (95%CI: 41.30-44.30). Skin injuries were divided into three categories: devicerelated pressure injury (DRSI), moisture-associated skin damage (MASD), and skin tears (ST). The study revealed that skin injuries were most common in 42.8% HCWs in departments or wards, including the ICU. Additionally, the prevalence of DRSI, MASD, and ST was 30.0% (95%CI 28.69-31.41), 10.8% (95%CI 9.91-11.82), and 10.8% (95%CI 1.62-2.40) of those with skin injuries, respectively. Injuries were frequently observed at the bridge of the nose, cheeks, and ears (Jiang, Song et al., 2020) . A one point prevalence study conducted with 108 HCWs working in an ICU and a high dependency unit revealed that the skin around the bridge of the nose (69%), ears (30%), cheeks (23%), and chin (20%) was affected, resulting in redness blanching, pressure damage, and itching (Abiakam et al., 2021) . Lam et al. (2020) reported five HCWs working in ICUs with pressure ulcers at the bridge of the nose within two-week periods.",

The PPE-SAFE study was the largest international cross-sectional study; however, more than half of the respondents were from Europe. PPE-related adverse events were measured using web-based surveys worldwide and in some countries the same inventory was used Tabah et al., 2020; Unoki et al., 2020) . These surveys helped HCWs establish preventive strategies against the AEs of PPE. However, the factors influencing the frequency and characteristics of AEs include the pandemic situation, critical unit structure (i.e., presence of a COVID-19 dedicated ICU), ethnicity (i.e., shape of the nose) (Abiakam et al., 2021; Verberne et al., 2020) , and the supply of PPE. In particular, the critical unit structure could be associated with the duration PPE use and the frequency of donning and doffing. For example, in a previous study (Unoki et al., 2020) conducted outside of Japan, COVID-19-dedicated ICUs were dominant (75%); however, they represented only 20% of such ICUs in Japan. Japanese respondents who reported significant thirst were 32.2%, while 47.4% of worldwide respondents reported this issue. Additionally, a recently published secondary analysis of the PPE-SAFE study in Italy (Ippolito et al., 2021) reported that the median time of wearing PPE continuously was 5 h (Interquartile range: 4-6 h). This finding was statistically significantly higher than other countries. This could be because Italy was the first Western country to be severely impacted by COVID-19 and was therefore not prepared for a pandemic. Owing to these factors, the prevalence of PPErelated AEs differs among countries. Additionally, the prevalence of AEs differed among professions. A previous study indicated that being a nurse was a risk factor for feeling significant heat while wearing PPE (Unoki et al., 2020) . The authors speculated that as nurses had a higher level of activity than other professionals, they tended to feel significantly more heat due to PPE.",

This is an important issue because headaches may reduce concentration and decrease professional performance (Hajjij et al., 2020) . N95 masks, rather than eye protection, seem to be associated with a de novo headache . N95 masks alter cerebral perfusion, which leads to headaches . Moreover, long-term use of N95 mask was consistently an independent factor in the development or exacerbation of headache. We recommend that HCWs with headaches must avoid long shifts and be given opportunities to take off the N95 mask. This will help them maintain sufficient professional performance. Additionally, administrators and HCWs should be aware of the effect of headaches on professional performance as well as of the importance of taking off N95 masks. Further, a powered airpurifying respirator can be used to reduce headache symptoms . A previous crosssectional study indicated that headaches are associated with psychiatric distress (Chew et al., 2020) . However, it was not able to show causal relationships for psychiatric distress because of its design. A prospective study is warranted to confirm causal relationships as detecting risk factors will facilitate risk reduction.",

A prior study demonstrated that the FFP2 mask combined with a face shield was responsible for up to 60.5% loss of speech intelligibility in noisy environments (Muzzi et al., 2021) . Wearing masks makes it difficult for patients or colleagues to hear HCWs speaking; thus, they are required to speak louder than usual (Bandaru et al., 2020) . This is also true for the elderly, who have various degrees of hearing loss and need to speak louder. A study in Chile suggested that about 30% HCWs including ICU staff noticed issues with their voice (Heider et al., 2021) .

Therefore, PPE-related skin injuries are an important concern for HCWs who treat COVID-19 patients. Lam et al.

However, many studies have investigated skin injuries caused by the overall PPE and not on a device-by-device basis (Jiang, Song et al., 2020; Jiang, Liu et al., 2020) . In these studies, being male, level 3 PPE, higher average daily time of PPE use (especially >4 hours), frequency of PPE relief, and heavy sweating were reported to be independent factors for PPE-related skin injuries (Abiakam et al., 2021; Jiang, Song et al., 2020; Jiang, Liu et al., 2020) . However, there have been few studies on the prevalence of PPE-related skin injuries in HCWs working in ICUs. Further research is needed to clarify skin injury factors for each device because a combination of pressure, moisture, and shear can cause or prevent PPE-related skin injuries, especially in the area of intensive care.",
