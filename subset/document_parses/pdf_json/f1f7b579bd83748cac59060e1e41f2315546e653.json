Though endothelial infection and subsequent endothelial damage have been described in patients with fatal COVID-19, the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive, particularly given that, under na\u00efve conditions, pulmonary endothelial cells demonstrate minimal cell surface expression of the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2. Herein we describe SARS-CoV-2 infection of the pulmonary endothelium in postmortem lung samples from individuals who died of COVID-19, demonstrating both heterogeneous ACE2 expression and endothelial damage. In primary endothelial cell cultures, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the induction of ACE2 protein expression and that this process is facilitated by type 1 interferon-alpha (IFN\u03b1) or -beta(\u03b2)-two of the main anti-viral cytokines induced in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection-but not significantly by other cytokines (including interleukin 6 and interferon \u03b3/\u03bb). Our findings suggest that the stereotypical anti-viral interferon response may paradoxically facilitate the propagation of COVID-19 from the respiratory epithelium to the vasculature, raising concerns regarding the use of exogenous IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.",

Though diffuse alveolar damage is a nearly ubiquitous finding in these cases, physiologic evidence of pulmonary vascular dysfunction is frequently observed, and a subset of patients (particularly those with hypertension, diabetes or obesity) develop extrapulmonary vascular complication-thrombosis, thromboembolism, coagulopathy-with a five to tenfold higher mortality rate [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Autopsy studies have reported widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy and alveolar capillary microthrombi throughout the pulmonary vasculature [7] . In addition, the frequent observations in severe COVID-19 of marked elevations of plasma von Willebrand Factor (vWF), P-selectin, D-dimers and other coagulation activating factors provide indirect evidence that endothelial damage and the development of vasculopathy as a pivotal determinant of clinical outcome in many patients.",

Moreover, the vascular distribution of endothelial viral infection (positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 N staining) and disrupted endothelial structure were observed mostly in larger muscularized arteries and veins (diameter > 100 \u00b5m) in four out of six samples. Importantly, we also demonstrated that pro-inflammatory IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 induced ACE2 on primary human pulmonary endothelial cell cultures and showed for the first time that primary endothelial cells were successfully infected with wild type SARS-CoV-2 or transduced by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped HIV viruses. In addition, our study suggested that IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 induced functional ACE2, rather than the proposed non-functional delta (d) ACE2. Our work proposed the critical role of ACE2 upregulation on pulmonary endothelial cells by IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 contributed to the understanding of COVID-19 associated vasculopathy, aiding future research on characterizing SARS-CoV-2 infection in cardiovascular biology. Translationally, our findings also raised concerns about using exogenous IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 treaments in patients with severe COVID-19.",

            "text": "To evaluate the role of the pulmonary endothelium in this process, we applied super high-resolution microscopy and immunofluorescence (IF) staining to post-mortem lung samples from six adults (patient #1-#6) who died of complications of COVID-19. Consistent with the epidemiology of severe COVID-19, these individuals were older (ages 53-76), and all but one (patient #3) were hypertensive and/ or diabetic and had histories of significant comorbidities (Table 1) . Acute respiratory failure was a proximate cause of death in all six cases, and five of six cases had histopathologic evidence of diffuse alveolar damage at autopsy (Fig. 1 , patient #3 as a representative). We assessed the vascular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection by IF staining of paraffin embedded lung samples with antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (anti-SARS-CoV-2 N) and the endothelial surface marker CD31 (anti-CD31) (Fig. 1) . Though SARS-CoV-2 N staining was most predominantly distributed in Type I/II pneumocytes lining alveolar sacs and sloughed cellular debris in the airspaces ( The vascular distribution of endothelial viral infection was not uniform, observed mostly in larger (diameter > 100 \u00b5m) muscularized arteries (Fig. 2 , 2nd and 3rd rows) and veins (Suppl Fig. 2 , 3rd row) but absent in arterioles and vessels smaller than 50 \u00b5m in diameter ( Fig. 2 ; Suppl Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, all 1st rows), including those in proximity to infection in adjacent pneumocytes. In these larger vessels, the presence of viral infection was consistently accompanied by signs of endothelial damage and vasculopathy, including disruption of the endothelial lining, sloughing of endothelial cells (ECs) into the vascular lumen, and apoptotic ECs with distorted nuclear shape ( Fig. 2 ; Suppl Figs. 1, 2, 3, arrowheads). In the inner layer of blood vessels, we found the alignment of CD31 positive cells were discontinuous and most of them were sloughing off, thus the integrity of endothelial layers seen in patients #1-#4 was severely disrupted, whereas patients #5 and #6 demonstrated well preserved endothelial integrity and no obvious disruption. Additionally, no obvious vasculopathy was found in these two patients without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 endothelial infection (Suppl Figs. 4, 5) , nor in the smaller vessels in patients (#1-4) with large-vessel endotheliitis, suggesting direct viral cytopathic effects as an inciting cause of damage. Though there were no obvious clinical differences between those with and without endotheliitis, histologic evidence of microvascular thrombosis was limited to those with endothelial damage in 3 of 4 subjects (Patient #1, 2, 3), including one subject (#3, Fig. 2 ) who was also found on post-mortem gross inspection to have a subsegmental pulmonary embolism. No evidence of thrombosis was observed in the two subjects (Patient #5, #6) who did not have SARS-CoV-2 vascular infection. Together, these findings suggested direct pulmonary endothelial infection with resultant endothelial damage as proximal events in the promotion of vascular thrombosis in COVID-19. ",

After intranasal infection with 3.81 \u00d7 10 3 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 at 4 dpi, SARS-CoV-2 N staining was dominantly distributed in alveolar pneumocytes/air sacs but not present in any sizes of vessels (Fig. 3B) . Thus, human ACE2 protein expression in the endothelia is a requirement for SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced vasculopathy.",

SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry was dependent on the binding of its spike protein to ACE2 cell surface receptor, which facilitated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) mediated spike protein cleavage and the induction viral-cellular membrane fusion. Though abundant on epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract [9] , [10, 11] . Indeed, though staining with anti-ACE2 antibodies demonstrated widespread ACE2-positivity in pneumocytes in all of our post-mortem samples and in lung tissue samples from healthy controls, endothelium ACE2-positivity was more heterogeneous, and its mean fluorescence intensity was upregulated threefold in the SARS-CoV-2 infected samples ( Fig. 2 , Suppl Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 5), but low/only rarely in the endothelium from non-COVID-19 samples (Fig. 1A) . The observed low ACE2 expression in the endothelium of uninfected individuals was confirmed by publicly available single cell RNA-seq data, showing that ACE2 mRNA was not detectable in the endothelium of most tissues studied, particularly the pulmonary endothelium, where no ACE2 positive cells were identified among 7438 endothelial cells sampled (Suppl Tables 1, 2, 3) . Similarly, screening for ACE2 mRNA expression in primary ECs sampled from multiple tissues confirmed that under unstress conditions, though ECs sampled from systemic tissues showed a broad range of ACE2 expression, ACE2 expression was extremely low in either pulmonary arterial or pulmonary microvascular ECs (PAECs and PMVECs, respectively) but significantly higher in the primary brain and bone ECs (Fig. 4A ).",

            "text": "It was worth noticing that viral burden positively correlated with proportions of venular endothelial cells and capillary aerocyte endothelial cells in single-cell atlases of post-mortem autopsy COVID-19 lungs [12] . Observing that ACE2 expression in the pulmonary vasculature was abundant in tissues from patients with fatal COVID-19 but none or moderately expressed in non-COVID-19 samples, we speculated that endothelial ACE2 expression was augmented in severe COVID-19 as a consequence of the host's response to infection. Severe COVID-19 was frequently complicated by an uncontrolled inflammatory response-the socalled \"cytokine storm\"-including the excessive release of endotheliitis-associated chemokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL6), interferon alpha and gamma (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 10 (CXCL10), and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). High cytokine levels correlated with poor prognosis and high mortality in patients with COVID-19 [13, 14] . Given that the ACE2 gene locus included multiple interferon response element sequences and IFN\u03b1 can induce airway epithelial ACE2 expression [15] , we sought to evaluate whether one or more of these cytokines was responsible for upregulating ACE2 expression in severe COVID-19. Evaluating a range of conditions, we optimized our EC model system to ensure both PMVEC and PAEC cultures retained their fundamental physiological characteristics as a barrier and homeostasis gatekeeper, finding that 100% confluency was required for primary ECs to maintain their cubical cell shape and alignment, and form a tight junction monolayer (Suppl Fig. 7A , right panel). The addition of matrix-coating proteins, including fibronectin, rat tail or bovine collagen, and gelatin, did not enhance ACE2 expression in these endothelial monolayers at the complete confluence when compared to plastic plates (Suppl Fig. 7B ). Intriguingly, following the addition of a cytokine cocktail containing IL6, IFN (\u03b1 or \u03b3), CXCL10 and TNF\u03b1 for 6 h, we observed sustained induction of endothelial ACE2 mRNA expression (Fig. 4B ). Systematic permutation of the cytokine cocktail composition revealed that cocktails containing IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b1 alone significantly increased mRNA level of ACE2 ( Fig. 4B ; Suppl Figs. 8, 9) . Similar patterns were observed in both PMVECs and PAECs, confirming IFN\u03b1 as both necessary and sufficient to induce endothelial ACE2 mRNA expression. Dilution (Fig. 4C ) and time-course ( Fig. 4D ) studies confirmed that IFN\u03b1 was a potent, dosedependent inducer of ACE2 endothelial expression, with peak expression (45-fold increase from baseline) observed at 6 h, producing a sustained response which was observed at least 18 h after removal of the stimulus (by substituting for cytokine-free media at 6 h, noted as 6-24 h, Fig. 4B ). By both IF staining of PAECs (Fig. 4E) and Western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates (Fig. 5A, B) , we confirmed that endothelial ACE2 induction by IFN\u03b1 resulted in ACE2 protein synthesis, with the greatest localization to the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 4E , 24 h and 6-24 h). Consistent with prior IF staining (Fig. 4E) , there was no evidence of IFN\u03b1 influencing the expression of TMPRSS2, the spike protein cleaving enzyme (Fig. 5A ). Next, we decided to measure the biological function of endothelial cells upon IFN\u03b1 stimulation. Compared with control, IFN\u03b1 -stimulated PAECs demonstrated significantly increased leakage over 6 h. Finally, PAECs with IFN\u03b1 resulted in shorter tube length, reduced branching points and less-organized tube networks compared with controls in Matrigel in 6 h (Suppl Fig. 10 ). Thus, IFN\u03b1 adversely impacted on EC vessel formation, homeostasis, and barrier function.",

We found that the spike protein pseudotyped viral constructs can be successfully transduced into ECs following 24 h stimulation with IFN\u03b1, and with more than 50% cells expressing GFP in each experiment ( Fig. 5; Suppl Fig. 11 ). Importantly, our results were consistent with a previous report on between-strain differences in transduction efficiency [16] : viral constructs with the d19/R682Q modifications of the spike protein known to promote the most efficient viral entry demonstrated the greatest abundance GFP-expressing ECs in our studies (Fig. 5C, D) . We next confirmed the ACE2 dependent viral infection in EC cultures with infectious SARS-CoV-2. Using IFN\u03b1-treated and untreated cells, EC cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 5. By IF analysis using an antibody recognizing SARS-CoV-2 N, we found that whereas EC cells were not permissive to infection under basal conditions, ECs preconditioned with IFN\u03b1 demonstrated a significant increase of N-positive cells by 2% (Fig. 5E, F) , confirming that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the endothelial was dependent on induced ACE2 expression upon IFN\u03b1 stimulation.",

Given that our initial experiments ( Fig. 4A -D, Supple Figs. 7, 8 9) employed primers that do not differentiate ACE2 isoforms, we repeated our measurements using two distally-positioned primer sets that distinguish between truncated dACE2(probe 2) and full length ACE2(probe 3) ( Fig. 6A ; Table 2 ). Ct values using for full length ACE2 (probe 3) were almost consistent to those obtained using the original assay from probe 1(total ACE2). In addition, the previously published probe 2 [17] did not detect any dACE2 mRNA expression (showed an undetermined Ct value). This demonstrates that IFN\u0251 induces transcription of full length ACE2. We further measured ACE2 using different types of IFNs. IFN\u03b2, one of the Type I IFN family, upregulated mRNA of ACE2 up to 24-fold (0.075 \u00b5g/ mL) or 39-fold (0.375 \u00b5g/mL) after 6 h simulation. Compared to other types of IFNs, only IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 induced expression of total ACE2 or full-length ACE2 (Fig. 6B) whereas the no expression of dACE was observed (data not shown). The protein expression of ACE2 was also upregulated after 24 h IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 stimulation by WB (Fig. 6C) . Based on the prior condition (Fig. 5E ), EC cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 5 with or without IFN\u03b2-treatment to determine the effect of IFN\u00df treatment on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. By IF analysis using an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 N, we found that whereas EC cells were not permissive to infection under basal conditions, ECs preconditioned with IFN\u03b2 demonstrated a significant increase of N-positive cells (Fig. 6D) . These results were further confirmed using recombinant SARS-CoV-2-mNeonGreen. After 48 h infection, ECs preconditioned with IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 had increased of N-positive cells as shown by IF using an anti-N antibody (Fig. 6E ). All these results implied that (at least in primary pulmonary ECs) IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2 but not other IFNs, induced the expression of functional ACE2 capable of the binding spike protein, proviral activity of IFNs. However, in contrast to highly susceptible cells in which SARS-CoV-2 N was expressed at high amounts and was homogenously distributed at late stages of infection [20] , we observed a puncate distribution pattern of N in the IFN-treated ECs, suggesting that viral replication in theses cells was slightly impaired. A possible explanation for this could be a balance of pro-and antiviral activity of IFN in the infected ECs.",

EBOV is a member of the Filoviridae family and causes a severe hemorrhagic disease in humans with high fatality rates [21] . Entry of EBOV is mediated by several cell surface attachement factors and the intracellular receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) with no dependence on ACE2 [22] . Treatment of cells with Type I IFNs renders cells resistant against EBOV infection [23] and has been shown to be beneficial for extended survival in infected nonhuman primates and Ebola virus disease patients [24, 25] . EC cultures were left untreated or treated with IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 for the indicated times and infected with EBOV at an MOI of 5. By IF analysis using an anti-EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) antibody, we found that ECs preconditioned with IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 for 24 h demonstrated a highly significant reduction of NP-positive cells at 24 and 48 h p.i. (Fig. 6F, G) . Moreover, the EBOV infection rate in IFN\u03b2-treated cells was fourfold decreased compared to IFN\u03b1-treated cells at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 6G) . When cells were pretreated with IFN for 24 h prior to infection and and treated again at 24 h post infection, the reduction in EBOV infection rates was even more pronounced. As observed before, IFN\u03b2 treatment reduced the EBOV infection rate by fivefold compared to IFN\u03b1 treatment (Suppl Fig. 12) . These data show that IFN\u0251 and \u03b2 retain their antiviral potential in our cell system independent of ACE2 regulation.",

We first examined the ACE2 expression and viral infection of endothelium from six postmortem COVID-19 patient lungs using advanced microscopy. Compared with non-COVID-19 lungs, endothelial ACE2 expression was augmented in more severe COVID-19 infection as a consequence of the host's response to infection. These stainings also showed, for the first time, that the vascular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 N protein was not uniform, observed mostly in larger (diameter > 100 \u00b5m) muscularized arteries and veins but absent in arterioles and vessels smaller than 50 \u00b5m in diameter. In these N-positive endothelia, endothelial damage and vasculopathy were consistently present, including disruption of the endothelial lining, sloughing of ECs into the vascular lumen, and apoptotic ECs with distorted nuclear shape (Fig. 2) . Single cell RNA-seq data suggested that primary pulmonary endothelial cells were resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to the lack of ACE2 expression on the cell surface [26, 27] . Our results strongly support these prior findings and provide the first evidence that primary endothelial cells become only susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 after IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 induced expression of functional ACE2 (not truncated form dACE2) (Figs. 5, 6 ). Our data also suggested that there was a balance between pro-and antiviral activities in the IFN-treated EC cultures. On one hand, IFNs facilitated ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2 entry, but on the other hand they restricted viral replication in the infected cells.",

For instance, classic monocytes from severe COVID-19 exhibit .

Type III IFN induces epithelial barrier damage, causing susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections [37] . In a multicenter cohort study, clinical administration of Type I IFN induces favorable clinical responses during the early stage of COVID-19, while later administration is associated with increased mortality [38] . A recent in-depth analyzed study highlighted the dynamic production of IFNs in the upper or lower respiratory tract of patients during COVID-19 disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 drove the production of Type III IFN in the upper airways as an IFN protection mechanism in younger and/or patients with mild disease. Moreover, critically ill patients expressed high levels of Type I IFN in the lower airways, but reduced induction of protective ISGs [39] . Furthermore, a NIH NIAID clinical trial had found that treatment of IFN\u03b2 did not improve outcomes for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and some patients were even associated with more adverse events and worse outcomes. These findings provided us with novel insights on the opposing roles of IFNs and reconciled some contradictory findings on IFNs. We also speculated a preexisting vascular disease or genetic predisposition may also lead to these conflicting results. In our in vitro stimulation assay, the mRNA level of ACE2 was upregulated 15-fold by IFN\u03b1 or 24-fold by IFN\u03b2 stimulation as short as 6 h. Intriguingly, after 6 h stimulation, IFN\u03b1 was removed and replaced with regular culture media. The upregulated level of ACE2 mRNA was persistently upregulated for 23-fold for 24 h and 7-fold for 48 h. These observations had clinical implications, as endothelial ACE2 could be induced by Type I IFN in an immediate and persistent manner. More extensive and temporal studies should be carried out to further evaluate the molecular mechanisms on IFN inducible ACE2 signaling axis, including existing evidence on activated downstream pathways of PD-1, NF\u03bab [40] , 40].",

First, while endothelial cell infection and damage with SARS-CoV-2 was seen in the majority of patients analyzed, only six patients were included in our analysis and larger cohorts are needed, as findings may be contributed to other factors such as preexisting endothelial damage from comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, a predisposed genetic susceptibility to vasculopathy. Second, IFN levels in the six patients included were not obtained. As mentioned previously, longitudinal, prospective studies are therefore needed to characterize the temporal relationship between IFN levels, viral load, and endothelial ACE2 expression in COVID-19 infected patients. Third, while our study exclusively investigated the pulmonary vasculature after infection, additional experiments in other organ systems suffering from similar complications would provide more information on the complex relationship between COVID-19 infection of the endothelium.",

While the targeting of vascular IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent disease progression in patients with severe COVID-19 will require additional study, our findings raise a more pressing concern and reveal the mechanism regarding current treatment guidelines that propose the use of exogenous recombinant IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 for the treatment of severe infection.
