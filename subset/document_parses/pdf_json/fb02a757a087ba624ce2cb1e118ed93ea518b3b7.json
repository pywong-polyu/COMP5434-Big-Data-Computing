Dyslipidemia is a metabolic alteration characterized by elevated fasting blood levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Dyslipidemia is known to be a risk factor for developing insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and, most of all, cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1] . Furthermore, dyslipidemia is a proven independent risk factor for vascular pathology because even when other risk factors are absent, atherosclerosis progresses. The latter is considered to be the cause of more than half of the cases of ischemic heart disease in the world [2] . HDL-C is one of the key factors determining cardiovascular risk. The protective role of HDL-C was determined for the first time in an epidemiologic study in 1970, when Framingham convincingly proved that HDL-C is the strongest predictor of developing ischemic heart disease in men and women over 49 years of age. Recent evidence has proven that a very small change in HDL-C-around 0.26 mmol/L-leads to a reduction in risk by 2% in men and 3% in women [3, 4] .",

It has been found that lifestyle changes increase HDL-C, and many of the mechanisms underlying its occurrence have been revealed. The latter include physical activity-5-10% (increased lipoprotein lipase, pre-\u03b2-HDL, activated reverse cholesterol transport); cessation of smoking-5-10% (raised lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, activated reverse cholesterol transport, inhibited cholesterol ester transfer protein); weight loss-5-20% (increased lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and lipoprotein lipase, activated reverse cholesterol transport); moderate alcohol consumption-5-15% (increased member 1 of human transporter sub-family ABCA, apolipoprotein A-1, paraoxonase, reduced cholesterol ester transfer protein); Mediterranean diet/unsaturated fatty acids-0-5% (increased atheroprotective lipoproteins). The only group of drugs that modulate HDL-C levels with a proven clinical benefit in lowering cardiovascular incidents is HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Among all statins, only two are of practical significance-Rosuvastatin (increases HDL-C up to 10%) and Pitavastatin (increases HDL-C up to 29%). Increasing HDL-C independently with the use of four new drugs has been shown to increase cardiovascular and total mortality. Statin intolerance is a major clinical problem, including myalgia, myositis, hepatotoxicity, statindependent diabetes mellitus and rhabdomyolysis. Many of the mechanisms underlying its occurrence have been studied. It is the Achilles' heel of statin therapy, frequently resulting in the discontinuation of statins. According to the latest evidence, the established statin intolerance is close to 3-5% [5] .",

            "text": "Plant-based foods rich in phenolic phytochemicals are among the promising strategies counteracting age-related changes in lipid profile [6] [7] [8] . Polyphenolic compounds are found in all plants and are quantitatively a substantial type of antioxidants consumed with food. Research interest in these compounds is immense due to the numerous therapeutic effects they exert, mainly in conditions related to oxidative stress [9] . The fruits of black chokeberry, Aronia melanocarpa (AM), are among the richest sources of polyphenols in the plant kingdom. Polyphenols, especially antocyanins and proanthocyanidins, are the main group of biologically active components in AM berries [9, 10] . They are the main contributors to the antioxidative properties of the plant. Apart from polyphenols, black chokeberry is a source of glucose, fructose, sucrose, sorbitol and pectin. Analyses have shown that AM fruit contains relatively large amounts of K and Zn, along with certain amounts of Na, Ca, Mg and Fe. Apart from minerals, other substances have been found, such as B1, B2, B6, and C vitamins, niacin, pantothenic acid, folic acid, alpha and beta tocopherol and carotenoids. Beta-sitosterol and campesterol have been identified among the triterpenes. The organic acids contained in the fruit include citric, malic, shikimic and ascorbic acid [9, 11] . The antioxidative potential of AM has been confirmed by numerous in vitro studies and in vivo models, where it has been frequently associated with other medicinal properties. Other proven effects are the antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects of black chokeberry [12] [13] [14] . In the literature, no adverse or toxic effects of AM juice, fruit and extracts have been reported [9] .",

In a previous study of ours, the supplementation of aging rats with pure black chokeberry juice ad libitum, at a dose of 64 mL/kg per day, improved their lipid profile by lowering TC and LDL, as compared to the adult controls. However, high content of fructose, glucose and sorbitol in the juice resulted in a significant increase in the body weight of the animals under study. In order to avoid such an effect and look for the possibility of applying AM products in functional nutrition, we decided to conduct a new experiment with a modified fixed dose of 10 mL/kg, and variants including enrichment with pectin and herbal extracts [15] .",

Pectin normalized body weight in rats following a lipid-rich diet, along with dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, metabolic endotoxemia and systemic inflammation [16] . Aside from this, various herbs used in traditional medicine have been found to exert a beneficial effect on lipid levels [17] [18] [19] . Elderflowers (Sambucus nigra) and rose hips (Rosa canina) are known to be rich in polyphenolic compounds belonging to different classes and exhibit a biological activity associated with lipid metabolism [20, 21] . At present, we are tempted to apply substances other than drugs in controlling HDL-C, but evidence in the literature is insufficient and controversial [22, 23] . Regulating dyslipidemia with functional beverages rich in phenolic phytochemicals is among the promising management strategies of age-related dyslipidemia [24] . Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of three AM-based functional beverages on the anthropometric parameters and lipid profile of healthy adult rats.",

Taking into account the hormonal influences in females, we used only male rats. The animals were divided into 5 groups (n = 8). Eight two-month-old rats and eight 13-month-old rats were designated as young controls (YC) and adult controls (AC), respectively. Three groups were given orally polyphenol-rich drinks diluted with drinking water in the course of 3 months, the supplemented animals being the same age as the adult controls. The groups were as follows: (A) 100% AM extract in a dose of 10 mL/kg; (A + P)-AM extract enriched with 1% pectin in a dose of 10 mL/kg; (A + H)-AM extract enriched with a herbal mixture (rosehip fruit and elderflowers) in a dose of 10 mL/kg. The rats were kept in compliance with all the experimental procedures recommended by the European Commission for protection and welfare of laboratory animals. The experimental protocol was approved by the Committee on Ethical Treatment of Animals of the Bulgarian Agency for Food Safety (No. 193/2018). All animals received humane care in compliance with the \"Principles of laboratory animal care\" formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the \"Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals\" prepared by the National Institute of Health (NIH publication No. 86-23, revised 1996).",

It is also clear that AM supplementation in a dose of 10 mL\u00b7kg \u22121 does not lead to significant body weight alterations. These results showed that supplementation with functional beverages did not have an effect on the body mass index-the criterion for normal body structure. The significant differences between the weight index of the internal organs of the animals from the young and adult groups (supplemented and not supplemented) are an indication of the age-related atrophy of these organs. The absence of significant differences between the weight indices of the supplemented animals and the adult controls suggests that the weight of an organ changes in correlation to the overall body weight as a result of supplementation, which has been described by other authors [28] . Furthermore, the supplementation did not significantly affect the somatometric parameters; thus, they cannot be associated with changes in the lipid profile.",

Valcheva-Kuzmanova et al. have reported that AM juice lowers diet-induced increase in serum TC, LDL-C and TG, an effect resulting from the large amount of polyphenols contained in the juice [29] [30] [31] . The possible underlying mechanisms of the lipid-lowering properties of flavonoids are as follows: cholesterol uptake suppression (by silymarin and tea catechins); improved lipoprotein catabolism (by cyanides); increased bile efflux, elimination of bile cholesterol and bile acids (proven for narginin) [30] . Quercetin, a flavonoid contained in black chokeberry, has an inhibiting effect on the enzymes that take part in the process of cholesterol synthesis and esterification [31] .",

Such an effect on HDL-C is in the focus of attention of present-day research. In epidemiological studies, HDL-C is considered to be a risk marker for cardiovascular disease, so inducing elevation of HDL-C levels is a controversial issue. Since many of the drugs influencing HDL-C levels either exhibit serious side effects, or do not lower the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, there is an active search for alternative means other than medications [35] . An experiment involving administration of a cyanidin-3-O-\u03b2-glucoside to mice by an oral gavage (50 mg/kg body weight) has found that the substance markedly increased serum HDL-C and apo A-1 level, as well as reduced atherosclerosis [36] . On the other hand, a diet-induced obesity model in rats has proven that supplementation with two polyphenols-resveratrol and quercetin-leads to a significant lowering of TC, TG and LDL-C levels, without affecting HDL-C [37] . In an experiment involving a hyperlipidemic model of rats, the supplementation of Fragaria nilgerrensis Schlecht. and Centella asiatica (L.) Urban in combination significantly decreased the levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, apolipoprotein B and hepatic malondialdehyde, but increased serum HDL-C, apolipoprotein A1 and hepatic superoxide dismutase [18] . A compound (polydatin) isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb., a widely used herb in traditional Chinese medicine, has been found to influence the lipid and glucose metabolism in mice, significantly lowering serum TG and LDL-C levels, simultaneously increasing HDL-C levels, as compared to the control mice [17] . In our study, pectin-enriched AM juice exerted a potentiated effect on the lipid profile. This is the first time when such a combination was used in the natural process of aging of rats. Various studies have proven the lipid-lowering properties of pectin. An experiment involving a 4-week administration of pectin from various sources to people with moderate hypercholesterolemia revealed its lipid-lowering effect. The levels of homocysteine and C-reactive protein were not affected [38] . Studying the effects of pectin on apoE \u2212/\u2212 mice kept on a high lipid diet has shown a decrease in the total and LDL cholesterol levels, along with a reduction in atherosclerotic lesions [39] . A 90-day experiment with pectin supplementation in mice has proven lowering of TC, LDL-C and TG serum levels, liver malondialdehyde levels and inflammation, as well as a reduction in body weight in hypercholesterolemic animals. The lipid-lowering effects of pectin are associated with its role in the excretion of bile acids and the reduction in their intestinal reabsorption, increase in the viscosity of the intestinal content, decrease in fatty acid absorption and a possible alteration in the activity of digestive enzymes [40] .",

This is likely to be due to the rich polyphenolic content and the synergism with the other biologically active substances. The elderflowers have a high polyphenolic content, of which phenolic acids, quercetin, kaempferol, catechin, epicatechin and narginin constitute a major part. They can affect disease processes by counteracting oxidative stress, leading to a positive effect on blood pressure and blood sugar levels, stimulating the immune system, increasing plasma enzymatic antioxidant activity and lowering uric acid [20] . Rose hip has rich polyphenolic content and an abundance of vitamins C, E, and B and carotenoids, which exhibit a synergistic antioxidative effect. In recent years, research has revealed the potential of its medicinal properties in a number of conditions, such as hyperlipidemia, hepatotoxicity, inflammatory processes, renal impairment, arthritis, obesity and cancer [21] . A potential mechanism underlying the positive effect on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism is the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatic cells [41] . Millar et al. have revealed the mechanisms underlying the effect of flavonoids on HDL-C levels, emphasizing their role in reverse cholesterol transport, high-density lipoprotein metabolism and function. Having in mind that inflammation participates in inducing HDL-C particle dysfunction, flavonoids can improve HDL-C function through a reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation [42] .",

            "text": "The optimal balance between \"bad\" (LDL-C) and \"good\" (HDL-C) in the atherogenic process is part of the history of medicine. Numerous epidemiologic findings have confirmed the fact that low HDL-C levels are associated with high cardiovascular mortality [3, 4, 43] . On the other hand, the antiatherogenic effects of HDL-C have been proven-it participates in reverse cholesterol transport, exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombogenic effects, and increases NO levels [44] [45] [46] . Modulation of HDL-C has proved to be quite a challenge and, at present, it remains an unresolved therapeutic problem [22, 23, 47] . Research in the field of HDL-C physiology and pathophysiology is of great interest and focuses on establishing new treatment strategies. An individual increase in HDL-C by medications is not accepted at present, except for statins, which elevate it up to 10-15% (Rosuvastatin, Pitavastatin). Increasing HDL-C levels by means other than drugs is of significant clinical importance for medical practice. Body weight reduction, diet, continuous aerobic training and cessation of smoking are important but insufficient to optimize HDL-C levels. The results of the present study convincingly demonstrated that Aronia melanocarpa in combination with pectin or a herbal mixture has the potential to be used not only for prophylaxis, but also as an adjunct functional food in the diet for the purposes of managing dyslipidemia.",
