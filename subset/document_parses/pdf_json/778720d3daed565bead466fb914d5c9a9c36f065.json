Uncertainties and changes in health practices may cause anxiety, depression, and concerns on vulnerable populations such as pregnant. This study aims to survey the pregnant women to capture the psychological impact and perceptions during the pandemic. Methods A total of 297 pregnant women aged \u2265 18 years were enrolled in May 2020. We evaluated the hard-copy survey included questions about demographic and clinical information of patients, 95% confidence intervals of a COVID-19-related questionnaire in a Likert scale and 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results A total of 297 pregnant women were included in this study with a mean age of 27.64. Most patients (82.5%) had concerns about infecting their babies during delivery. The fear of infection of the fetus during delivery revealed elderly age and having anxiety as the unique significant risk factors. Mean HADS-A and HADS-D scores were 7.94 (\u00b1 4.03) and 7.23 (\u00b1 3.84), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed having anxiety was associated with a high HADS-D score and concern about the inability to reach obstetrician, and being in advanced age, having a high HADS-A score, and concern about the inability to reach obstetrician demonstrated significant effects on HADS-D score. Conclusion We conclude that in future pandemics, communications and reassurance of the patients should be prioritized upon their routine ante-natal care to avoid increased levels of anxiety and even depression.",

Though the increased risk of psychiatric disorders is not directly associated with pregnancy; health problems in pregnants, unfavorable prenatal care, stressful life events, and complicated pregnancies were associated with the increased risk of mental disorders during pregnancy [6] . Currently, there are many observational studies on the psychiatric effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in the general population, healthcare workers, and vulnerable populations [7] [8] [9] . Few studies evaluating the psychiatric effects of SARS pandemic and COVID-19 on pregnant women have shown that this vulnerable population will face psychiatric challenges due to uncertainties, social isolation, severity of the disease, disinformation and increased risk of possible pregnancy complications [10, 11] . Concern and stress in pregnancy are associated with side effects such as preeclampsia, depression, increased nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, preterm labor, low birth weight, and low APGAR score [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Pregnant women participating in present study stated that the risk of COVID transmission in pregnant women may be higher than the general population. When we generalize pregnancy as an immunosuppressive condition, and according to current data, the susceptibility of pregnant women to respiratory pathogens and the development of severe pneumonia makes pregnant women more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population [17] . Beside these justified concern, another thought of many participants is that the infants had higher risks than pregnant women [18] . According to a review including 538 pregnant COVID-19 patients shows the vertical transmission of the novel coronovirus has not yet been proven, but the rate of preterm births and cesarian sections were increased [19] . Additionally, pregnant women are not reported to be under higher risk for mortality secondary to COVID-19 infection. Because of the conflict between literature knowledge and pregnant women's concerns, we may hypothesize that proper education of the patients by physicians may relief that anxiety in these aspects. However, there is evidence for higher depression scores among pregnant women with longer years of education which creates a dilemma [20] .",

Despite the fact that no pregnant woman's appointment was postponed and uninterrupted healthcare was provided during the outbreak in our department, more than half of the participants have concerns about delaying their appointment and not being able to reach their own specialists. We anticipated that the reason for these unnecessary concerns may be due to the possibility of a collapse in the healthcare system and all kinds of information pollution including media related to the outbreak. The major concerns of the participants were hospitalacquired COVID-19 transmissions during follow-up and childbirth. The thought that is at the center of the concerns and disturbs almost all of the participants was 'I am afraid of infecting my baby during childbirth'. A study predicted that approximately 20% of infections in patients, and almost 90% of infections in medical staffs were due to hospital-acquired transmissions [21] . Although this concern has a scientific basis, our study showed that advanced maternal age and high anxiety score were the trigger for this condition. It is well known that advanced maternal age is strictly related with many of the obstetric complications, and this may be the rationale behind the higher anxiety for the patients with advanced maternal age.",

This thought is one of the major elevated anxiety and depression causes in the present study. In contrast to some previous studies, we realized that patients are more concerned due to the inability to visit their doctors, rather than having being infected by COVID at the hospital visits [22] . In the pandemic process, where both being in the hospital and not being able to come to the hospital cause concerns, we found strong correlations between depression and anxiety. According to psychodynamics, depression is a general inhibition state and undermine actions, however anxiety is a general state of alertness and motivates people toward to actions. The presence of a factor that affects the whole world, such as COVID pandemic, can explain the positive correlation between these two different and almost opposite feelings.",

Our finding is consistent with those of prior studies. The increase of this risk has been attributed to several factors such as increased risk of obstetric complications [25] , challenges in adapting to motherhood [23] , and decreasing support from the social environment with advancing age [26] . The experience of childbearing at advanced maternal age did not appear to be the only cause of higher depression rates. In addition, the possibility of participants with advanced maternal age to report depression symptoms more effectively should not be forgotten, and there is a perception that young people are less affected by COVID infection in almost all of the society. However, some studies reported vice versa and concluded that younger pregnant women were more prone to depression during the COVID pandemic [22] . Altough many studies have revealed that patients having comorbidities during COVID infection are associated with worse clinical outcomes [27, 28] . Interestingly, in our study, it was observed that anxiety and depression scores of pregnant women with additional diseases were not high. The fact that there is heterogeneity in the comorbidity setup in our study and that subgroup analysis was not performed according to the severity of these comorbidities may be related to this result.",
