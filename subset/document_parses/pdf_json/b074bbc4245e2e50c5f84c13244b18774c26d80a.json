This study aims to explore a potential regulatory network of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)/microRNA (miRNA)/ mRNA associated with the function of Sev in glioma progression. LncRNA HMMR antisense RNA 1 (HMMR-AS1), miR-7 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) abundances were examined via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot. Cell viability, invasion, and colony formation ability were analyzed via cell counting kit-8, transwell analysis, and colony formation. The target association was analyzed via dual-luciferase reporter analysis and RNA pull-down. The in vivo function of Sev was investigated by xenograft model. HMMR-AS1 abundance was increased in glioma tissues and cells, and reduced via Sev. Sev constrained cell viability, invasion, and colony formation ability via decreasing HMMR-AS1 in glioma cells. miR-7 expression was decreased in glioma, and was targeted via HMMR-AS1. HMMR-AS1 silence restrained cell viability, invasion, and colony formation ability by up-regulating miR-7 in glioma cells. Sev increases miR-7 abundance via decreasing HMMR-AS1. CDK4 was targeted via miR-7, and highly expressed in glioma. miR-7 overexpression inhibited cell viability, invasion, and colony formation ability via reducing CDK4 in glioma cells. CDK4 expression was reduced by Sev via HMMR-AS1/miR-7 axis. Sev suppressed cell growth in glioma by regulating HMMR-AS1. Sev represses glioma cell progression by regulating HMMR-AS1/miR-7/CDK4 axis.",

It was hypothesized that Sev could target the HMMR-AS1/miR-7/CDK4 axis to inhibit glioma progression. To explore whether HMMR-AS1 was related to glioma progression, HMMR-AS1 expression change was examined in glioma. HMMR-AS1 abundance was significantly higher in glioma tissues and serum samples (n = 37) than in normal samples (n = 10) (Figure 1a, supplementary  Figure S1 ). And HMMR-AS1 level was increased in patients at advanced stage (WHO grade III; n = 17) compared with those at early stage (WHO grades I and II; n = 20) (Figure 1b) . Furthermore, patients were divided into low (n = 18) and high (n = 19) HMMR-AS1 level group according to the median value of HMMR-AS1 level in glioma patients. Patients with high HMMR-AS1 level had lower overall survival (P = 0.031) (Figure 1c) . Moreover, HMMR-AS1 abundance was measured in glioma cell lines (LN229, T98 and A172) and control NHA cells. Results showed that HMMR-AS1 abundance was increased more than 2.8-fold in glioma cells (Figure 1d ). Taken together, increased HMMR-AS1 might be associated with glioma progression.

Additionally, cell viability was markedly decreased by HMMR-AS1 silence, and transfection with in-miR-7 mitigated this effect (Figure 4(e,F) ). Furthermore, HMMR-AS1 silence significantly constrained invasion of LN229 and T98 cells, which was mitigated via miR-7 knockdown (Figure 4(g,H) ).

Here we confirmed miR-7 was targeted by HMMR-AS1 and lowly expressed in glioma. Li et al. reported that miR-7 could repress proliferation, migration and invasion and trigger apoptosis of glioma cells through regulating neuro-oncological ventral antigen 2 [42] . Bhere et al. showed that miR-7 could enhance glioma cell apoptosis [43] . Moreover, miR-7 suppressed tumor angiogenesis and growth of glioma in a murine xenograft model [44] . Additionally, miR-7 is reported to inhibit growth of glioma cells and xenograft models by blocking the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (ATK) and Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways [45] . These reports suggested the antitumor function of miR-7 in glioma. In agreement with these reports, we also validated miR-7 inhibited glioma progression. Moreover, we found that Sev could regulate miR-7 via HMMR-AS1 to participate in glioma development.",

More importantly, CDK4 was reported to be regulated via Sev in glioma [5] . Similarly, we also found the oncogenic role of CDK4 in glioma by promoting colony formation. Moreover, multiple reports indicated that CDK4 could promote cell invasion in human tumors, such as non-small-cell lung cancer, gastric cancer and colon cancer [47] [48] [49] . However, there is no report in support of the role of CDK4 in glioma cell invasion. This study found that CDK4 might promote glioma cell invasion. Furthermore, we found that Sev could reduce CDK4 expression via regulating HMMR-AS1/miR-7 axis. In this way, Sev attenuated glioma progression in vitro. Additionally, we established the xenograft model, and further confirmed the anti-tumor role of Sev.",

Here we also found HMMR-AS1 expression was increased in serum of glioma patients, indicating the potential of HMMR-AS1 in diagnosis and prognosis of glioma patients. Hence, the clinical role of HMMR-AS1 would be explored in future. Moreover, only 37 patients were obtained in the current study. Hence, we need more samples to better investigate the clinical value of HMMR-AS1 to obtain more reliable conclusions.
