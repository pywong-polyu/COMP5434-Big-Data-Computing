This observation in both preclinical and clinical trials has led to exclusion of NAb-positive patients from receiving AAV gene therapy. AAV drug development includes selection of capsids with lower NAb seroprevalence that also possess other favorable traits. Often a limited number of healthy volunteers are screened to gauge NAb seroprevalence. However, limited data sets can be biased leading to inaccurate estimates of NAb incidence. In this study, we evaluated AAV NAbs against a panel of vectors among healthy donors within the United States. While the overall seroprevalence against most AAVs was lower, we did observe increased NAb incidence among black and Hispanic donors. These findings of increased NAb seroprevalence among the minority races were confirmed in a second set of donors who also demonstrated higher seroprevalence among these races. Interracial-and intraracial differences within genders were also observed among donors. The increased incidence of AAV NAb among racial minorities was unexpected. Our findings underscore the need for removing bias in sample data sets and evaluating seroprevalence within the patient population while selecting capsids.",

In general, the BAbs seroprevalence was less skewed toward minority donors compared to NAbs (Fig.  4B) .

Higher seroprevalence results in deselection of a capsid that would otherwise have all desired traits. As part of a pilot screening process, we noted considerable variability in AAV seroprevalence among donors (data not shown). To better understand the source of these variations, we undertook the present study evaluating NAb seroprevalence among donors based on race, gender, and age against a panel of AAV capsids. The selection of capsids was sufficiently diverse and comprised vectors belonging to multiple clades with a propensity for targeting liver following systemic administration. 11 Of these, AAV1 and AAVrh74 were isolated from primates while AAV3B, AAV5, and AAV9 were naturally occurring isolates from humans. [11] [12] [13] [14] Among other vectors we investigated, Spark100 was a bioengineered vector and AAVDJ was a novel variant isolated from a capsid library following DNA shuffling and expected to be less neutralized by antibodies. 15, 16 The diversity of capsids allowed us to interrogate seroprevalence differences against both natural isolates and engineered capsids.",

The overall adjusted seroprevalences were consistent with previous published reports with these capsids with some differences. 8, 17, 18 The greatest variability was observed in AAV5 seroprevalence. It is likely that the assays to interrogate the presence of AAV5 NAbs require optimization before observing alignment between studies. As a note, a clinical trial for AAV5.hFIX recruited and dosed five NAb-negative patients with hemophilia B. 19 Development of a more sensitive assay later found that three out of the five patients had preexisting NAbs. AAV5 is known to be structurally and antigenically quite distinct from other AAVs, and this may contribute to the observed discrepancy between studies evaluating its seroprevalence. 20 AAV antibody seroprevalence can be evaluated using either the NAb or BAb assay. 21 The NAb assay is a functional assay measuring transduction inhibition as a surrogate for presence of anti-AAV NAbs. In contrast, the ELISAbased BAb assay measures total IgG that bind vector. In our studies, more subjects were BAb positive than NAb positive. As an example, twice as many donors had AAV5 BAbs compared to NAbs (60% vs. 30%, respectively). Higher incidence of BAb among NAb-negative subjects has previously been reported in a screen of anti-AAV antibodies. 18 It is conceivable that NAbs represent high-affinity antibodies generated after one or more AAV exposures, while BAbs include both high-and low-affinity antibodies. Our studies demonstrate cross-reactivity against AAVs belonging to distinct clades and donors with high-titer antibodies mostly cross-neutralized multiple AAVs. Presence of high-titer cross-reactive antibodies may allude to donors being infected with multiple AAVs, or generation of high-affinity broadly NAbs against shared epitopes.",
