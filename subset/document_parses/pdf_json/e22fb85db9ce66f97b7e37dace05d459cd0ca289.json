            "text": "Little is known about the effect of wearing a facemask on the physiological and perceptual responses to exercise in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We performed a single-center retrospective study to evaluate whether facemask wearing impacted distanced covered, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) during a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in PAH patients. Forty-five patients being treated for group 1 PAH and who performed a 6MWT before and after implementation of a facemask mandate were included in the analysis. Each included patient performed a 6MWT without (test 1) and with (test 2) a facemask between October 1, 2019, and October 31, 2020. At both time points, all patients also underwent a submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise test, echocardiogram, and blood laboratory tests, with a Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management Lite 2.0 score calculated. The two 6MWTs were performed 81AE51 days apart, and all patients were clinically stable at both testing timepoints. Six-minute walk test distance was not different between test 1 and test 2 (405AE108 m vs 400AE103 m, P\u00bc.81). Similarly, both end-test RPE and lowest SpO 2 during the 6MWT were not different in test 1 and test 2 (RPE: 2.5AE1.7 vs 2.5AE2.1, P\u00bc.91; SpO 2 nadir: 92.8AE3.4% vs 93.3AE3.3%, P\u00bc.55). Our findings show that wearing a facemask has no discernable impact on the arterial oxygen saturation and perceptual responses to exercise or exercise capacity in patients with moderate-to-severe PAH. This study reinforces the evidence that wearing a facemask is safe in PAH patients, even during exercise. \u00aa 2021 THE AUTHORS.

Despite evidence that facemasks provide enhanced protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, achievement of widespread face mask use in the general public has proven challenging.

            "text": "The main finding of the present study was that in clinically stable PAH patients with moderate-to-severe disease, wearing a facemask had no effect on distance covered, rating of perceived exertion, or oxygen saturation during a 6MWT. This is important because 6MWTd and SpO 2 during the test provides adjunctive clinical information regarding functional status, disease severity and/or progression, and efficacy of therapeutic intervention. Facemask function is, in part, determined by the resistance to airflow provided. Effective facemasks likely lower the risk of virus transmission between people in close proximity to each other secondary to a reduction in forward particle velocity in exhaled breath. 13 This functionality has, however, led to concerns regarding facemask use during physical activity. It has been considered possible that such resistance to airflow could negatively impact pulmonary gas exchange and heighten breathlessness and breathing discomfort, especially during exercise; such reasoning is often cited when justifying facemask noncompliance. 4, 5 Despite these concerns, there is growing evidence that any negative effects of wearing a facemask during physical activity are negligible, and unlikely impact the thermal, cardiopulmonary (including heart rate, respiratory frequency, and pulmonary gas exchange), and perceptual responses to exercise. [6] [7] [8] 14 Importantly, our data suggest that the distance covered (ie, exercise capacity), the perceptual response, and SpO 2 during a 6MWT are not negatively affected by the wearing of a facemask in clinically stable PAH patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Ventilatory inefficiency coupled with impaired pulmonary gas exchange and breathlessness during exercise is a hallmark of PAH. A number of signature breathing and gas exchange derangements, including a greater ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide, a blunted increase or even a decrease in the partial pressure of end-tidal CO 2 early in exercise, and exercise-related arterial hypoxemia become apparent during exercise in PAH patients. 10, 11 The etiology of these derangements in PAH is complex, but is likely related to ventilationperfusion imbalances, physiological shunts, and an exaggerated ventilatory drive secondary to greater sensitivity of muscle ergoreceptors and/or central and peripheral chemoreceptors. 10, 15 As such, the present findings suggest that wearing a facemask is safe and has no deleterious impact on exercise capacity, even in a high-risk population who are predisposed to impaired exercise pulmonary gas exchange, heightened breathlessness, and exertional intolerance.",

First, achieving a 6MWTd of w400 m is approximately equivalent to 3.0 metabolic equivalents. 16 That is, although patients are instructed to \"walk as far as possible for 6 minutes,\" the exercise intensity associated with a 6MWTd of w400 m is possibly only moderate. Higher intensity exercise naturally requires higher minute ventilations. Whether the resistance to airflow provided by facemasks at such higher ventilatory rates negatively impacts exercise capacity requires further investigation. Second, N95 respirators provide greater airflow resistance compared to surgical and/or cloth facemasks. However, even at a relatively high minute ventilation (100 L$min \u00c01 ), it has been shown that the airflow resistance provided by N95s is modest, and similar to the facemask and tubing used during standard cardiopulmonary exercise tests. Thus, it is perhaps unlikely that the physiological and perceptual responses to exercise with versus without a facemask are substantially altered by the type of facemask worn.",
