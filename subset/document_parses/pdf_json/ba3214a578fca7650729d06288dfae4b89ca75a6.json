            "text": "Federated learning, which shares the weights of the neural network across clients, is gaining attention in the healthcare sector as it enables training on a large corpus of decentralized data while maintaining data privacy. For example, this enables neural network training for COVID-19 diagnosis on chest X-ray (CXR) images without collecting patient CXR data across multiple hospitals. Unfortunately, the exchange of the weights quickly consumes the network bandwidth if highly expressive network architecture is employed. So-called split learning partially solves this problem by dividing a neural network into a client and a server part, so that the client part of the network takes up less extensive computation resources and bandwidth. However, it is not clear how to find the optimal split without sacrificing the overall network performance. To amalgamate these methods and thereby maximize their distinct strengths, here we show that the Vision Transformer, a recently developed deep learning architecture with straightforward decomposable configuration, is ideally suitable for split learning without sacrificing performance. Even under the non-independent and identically distributed data distribution which emulates a real collaboration between hospitals using CXR datasets from multiple sources, the proposed framework was able to attain performance comparable to data-centralized training. In addition, the proposed framework along with heterogeneous multi-task clients also improves individual task performances including the diagnosis of COVID-19, eliminating the need for sharing large weights with innumerable parameters. Our results affirm the suitability of Transformer for collaborative learning in medical imaging and pave the way forward for future real-world implementations.",

In contrast to FL, another distributed machine learning method, split learning (SL) offers better privacy and requires lower computational resources of clients by splitting the network between clients and the server [27, 61] , but still possess problems that it shows significant slower convergence than FL and can not learn under non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data [25] .",

One of the important contributions in this paper is the observation that this configuration is optimal for SL where a network should be split into the parts for clients and servers.

It eliminates the need to aggregate the raw data in a centralized way by enabling the model to be updated on the edge devices (e.g. mobile phones, computers in hospitals). Specifically, during the training, the server initializes a global model and sends it to each client. The clients then train the model with their local data in parallel and return the updated model to the server. Then, the server aggregates and distributes those models by a method such as federated averaging (FedAvg) [40] to update the global model. This process (called round) continues repeatedly until the model converges. Though FL enables decentralized training in a privacy-preserving manner, it still holds limitations as it largely depends on the computation resources of clients and is vulnerable to model inversion attacks [65] .",

In detail, the first sub-network is trained on the client-side with local data and then passes the feature to the second sub-network located in the server. The server can access the only feature from the first sub-network, and train the second sub-network to send the subsequent feature to the third sub-network on the client. Finally, the third sub-network is able to provide the output of the overall network. By inserting black-box sub-networks in both client and server sides, it is possible to offer better privacy than FL. Besides the privacy benefit, SL uses less computational resources than FL at the client-side. Nevertheless, since the one cycle of forward and backward passes is finished after data and gradients move back and forth across the sub-networks distributed on multiple sides, the convergence of SL is considerably slower than FL. In addition, it was reported that the convergence is not reached at all under the non-IID setting [25] .",

Transformer [60] , which was originally developed for NLP, is a deep neural network based on an attention mechanism that utilizes an appreciably large receptive field. After achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in NLP, it has also inspired the vision community to explore its application on vision tasks to utilize its ability to model long-range dependency within an image [31] . The ViT was one of the successful attempts to apply Transformer directly to images, achieving excellent results compared to the SOTA convolutional neural networks in image classification tasks [19] . Furthermore, in addition to the superb performance, the straightforward modular design of ViT facilitates broad applications in many tasks only with minimal change. Chen et al. [13] proposed image processing transformer, which is one of the successful multi-task model for various computer vision tasks, by splitting ViT into shared body and task-specific heads and tails, suggesting that Transformer body with sufficient capacity can be shared across relevant tasks.

From pre-training on the CheXpert dataset, we excluded 32,387 lateral view images, and 29,420 posterior-anterior (PA) and 161,427 anterior-posterior (AP) view data were finally used. Table 1 summarizes dataset resources and partitioning for the classification task. We used both public datasets containing labels of infectious disease (Valencian Region Medical Image Bank [BIMCV] [17] , Brixia [53, 7] , National Institutes of Health [NIH] [64] ), and CXR data deliberately collected from four hospitals labeled by board-certified radiologists. We put one hospital data aside as an external test dataset to evaluate the classification performance for real-world applications. Overall, 17,183 PA view CXR images were used for training/validation and 365 PA view CXR images for the test. In addition, we performed the experiments in the view-agnostic setting by adding AP view CXRs, to further extend real-world applicability as provided in Appendix C.1. By adding AP view data, the total amounts of CXRs were increased from 17,183 to 24,180 for training/validation and 365 to 556 for external test datasets. Notably, the number of COVID-19 cases was increased from six to 81 in the external test dataset. We modeled data from different sources as individual clients, emulating the real-world collaboration between hospitals. This setting is important to validate our method in non-IID data distribution.

Similarly, the 2nd place solution in the RSNA pneumonia detection challenge, which is a modified version of RetinaNet for object detection, was utilized. After splitting these models into head and tail, the feature maps between head and tail were mapped to the feature maps with the same dimension of 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 768, and used as input of Transformer body. The Transformer body, equipped with 12 layers of standard Transformer encoder with 12 attention heads, transforms the feature maps to embed better representation.

Finally, for the detection task, we minimized the sum of box classification, box regression, and image classification losses as suggested by Gabruseva et al. [23] . For all tasks, the batch size was 2 per client, and the warm-up step was 500. We set the number of total rounds to 12,000, and the weights of each clients' head and tail underwent FedAvg per 100 rounds by the server. To simulate single-task learning (STL) in Fig. 2 (b), we considered each six data sources as different clients for the classification task. On the other hand, for MTL shown in Fig. 2 (c), 10 clients were simultaneously used, with six clients for classification and two clients for segmentation and detection tasks, respectively. For the segmentation and detection tasks, the training data set was randomly split into two subsets, whereas non-IID distribution was used for the classification task. To adjust the loss scale, the customized weights of 1:2:2 were applied for classification, segmentation, and detection tasks to update the common body weights. We divided the MTL into two steps, jointly training the task-specific heads, tails, and the task-agnostic body (6,000 rounds), and fine-tuning only the task-specific heads, tails with the body weights fixed (6,000 rounds). By fixing the parameters of the shared Transformer body during the second step, the best models can be selected for different tasks according to the performance evaluation metrics of each task, even at the different rounds. Performance metrics. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate the diagnostic performance in the classification task. To evaluate the accuracy of segmentation, the Dice coefficient was used to quantitatively measure the overlap between the segmentation results by model and the ground truths. The detection results were evaluated by calculating the mean average precision (mAP) at the different intersection over union, with a threshold range from 0.4 to 0.75 with a step size of 0.05 as suggested in RSNA [49] . All experiments have been run and evaluated with three different random seeds for the weight initialization to prevent the chance of confusing the results.",

Similar to the previously distributed learning methods, a potential risk arises from these limitations that our algorithm may not be free from privacy issues via model inversion attack against the server, since the server retains the parameters of the entire network in process of FedAvg of the heads and tails despite the split design of the sub-networks upon both client and server-sides. Although the risk could be mitigated to some degree with the specific settings (e.g. small gradient due to pre-trained backbone, deeper network, more pooling layer, a mixture of multiple tasks), the privacy problem should not be ignored since we aim to use this method in collaboration with hospitals where the patient privacy is a matter of the highest priority. Therefore, the methods to enhance the security such as differential privacy [41] , secure multi-party computation [6] , data compression [73] and authenticated encryption [47] as well as the recent method to prevent gradient inversion attack without sacrificing FL performance [57] should be utilized along with the proposed method to further reduce the risk of privacy leakage in a real-world application.",

For the classification task, we used an SGD optimizer with a warm-up cosine learning rate scheduler with a max learning rate of 0.0005. For the segmentation task, we minimized the binary cross-entropy loss combined with dice and focal loss using Adam [32] with a learning rate of 0.0001 and cosine annealing scheduler with the maximum rounds of 2,000 for single-task and 1,000 for multi-task learning. Finally, the Adam optimizer along with the warm-up constant scheduler was used with the max learning rate of 0.00002. Gradient clipping was implemented, where the max gradient norm of 1.0 was chosen to enhance the rate of convergence, and the batch sizes per client were 2 for all tasks. We experimentally determined the optimal hyperparameters for each task. Table 6 and Table 7 provide the detailed hyperparameters used for each task during single-task learning and multi-task learning. The output from the Transformer body corresponding to this CLS token embed the comprehensive feature of the entire CXR image so that it can be used to make the final prediction ( Fig. 3(a) ). On the other hand, for the segmentation task, the features at the deepest level of TransUNet of the dimension 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 1024 is used as the input of the Transformer after mapping into the dimension of 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 768 and flattened to dimension of 256 \u00d7 768, and the CLS token is not utilized at all though it is prepended as the same way in the classification task to make the same feature size 257 \u00d7 768. The resulting transformed features from the body are mapped into original shape and utilized as the same in standard TransUNet architecture (Fig. 3(b) ). Similarly, the model for the detection task doesn't use the CLS token, and it rather uses a similar approach to that of the segmentation task. The deepest level of the feature pyramid, which has features of the dimension 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 1024, is first mapped into dimension of 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 768, and is used as the input for the Transformer body after flattening and prepending CLS token to make the same dimension of 257 \u00d7 768 to other tasks. Then, the transformed feature from the body reverts to the original shape and position for the feature pyramid to be combined to yield the final output (Fig.  3(c) ).",

            "text": "From the implementation perspective of this consequential process, the major hurdle for federated learning (FL) research is the paucity of open source frameworks that support scalable FL on multiple edge devices. Several studies performing FL on millions of edge devices have been published [28] , but they are based on a closed industrial system developed by a private corporation and are not publicly available. Meanwhile, even though several open-source frameworks including Tensorflow federated [2], PySyft [1] and LEAF [8] enabled the experiments on FL simulation, they do not support heterogeneous clients, server-side orchestration and are neither scalable between multiple machines, nor language agnostic. Recently, an open-source framework, Flower has been developed to address this problem which supports the heterogeneous environment and scaling to multiple distributed clients. It offers stable, language-and deep learning framework-agnostic implementation. Moreover, it allows rapid adoption of the existing deep learning algorithm to evaluate their learning dynamics and performances in a federated setting. Therefore, we implemented our framework upon this Flower protocol. Fig. 4 illustrates the core components of our framework based on Flower. Since the FL can be considered as an interplay between global (server) and local (client) computations, we implemented the server and client-side components of our framework on top of the Flower server and clients. In Flower clients, task-specific loops of the heads and tails are performed with local data of each client, and the resulting features, gradients, and local parameters are passed toward the RPC client for communication. Then, the remote procedure call (RPC) client communicates with the RPC server in a language-agnostic manner using the bi-directional gRPC stream communication protocol [3] , which offers an efficient binary serialization format. On the server-side, a task-agnostic body loop is performed using the features and gradients received. In addition, the aggregation, distribution of local parameters through a strategy such as federated averaging (FedAvg) are performed per averaging rounds. Finally, the features, gradients, and aggregated global parameters from the server revert to each client.",

First, we compared the proposed MTL model with single task experts, defined as following for each task. As provided in Table 12 , the proposed MTL model outperformed the task-specific experts for each specific task. Of note, when the shared Transformer body was substituted with the shared convolutional neural network (CNN) layer for MTL, the performance was substantially dropped in the detection task. Combined together, the results demonstrated the value of the Transformer architecture leveraging global attention as well as local attention, which is suitable for MTL and cannot be substituted by other architecture like shared CNN layers.

As suggested in Table 16 , the model equipped with a smaller body showed lower performance than that of a standard Transformer body equipped with 12 heads and 12 layers, suggesting the possibility of further improvement in performance with a Transformer with higher capacity.",

Thus, we experimented with various training schemes to evaluate their effect on the performance in multi-task settings. For the one-step learning approach, we trained the model after having all sub-networks, namely head, body, and tail, learnable for the entire training round. For the alternating approach, we alternately fixed and unfixed the parameters of the body and head/tail per 100 rounds. As shown in Table 16 , both of these approaches show lower performance than the proposed two-step learning approach. This suggests that the simultaneous or alternating approach to train these subnetwork components makes training unstable. Fixing the body for multi-task processing after certain rounds and fine-tuning the task-specific components may help to reach the better local minimum for the head and tail for each task, resulting in better generalization performance.
