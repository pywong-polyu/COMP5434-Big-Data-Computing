We do this based on two dimensions inspired by the CM literature, that is, the degree of the perceived time pressure and the precrisis legal institutional framework. The plausibility of the analytical framework is assessed on the basis of three cases: the WHO's dealing with the SARS crisis; the European Commission's dealing with the Mad Cow Disease crisis; and the UN's handling of the humanitarian crisis in the Great Lakes region. The results show that the perceived time pressure affected IO autonomy in so far as higher time pressure that rendered IO autonomy stronger, whereas with regard to the institutional framework no stringent pattern could be seen. Moreover, based on our findings, we propose that IO autonomy in crisis situations also depends on the framing of an issue in terms on impartiality, on the extent to which the IO in question is subject to politicisation, as well as on the degree to which it possesses specific technical expertise.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In today's interconnected world, both state and nonstate actors increasingly look to international organisations (IOs) to address transborder problems: the World Health Organization (WHO) was expected to handle the Ebola outbreak, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the financial crisis and the United Nations (UN) the violent conflict in Syria. Nevertheless, IO scholars have paid little attention to the implications that a crisis may have for the specific roles of IOs in such circumstances, and even less so from the organisation's point of view. This gap can be partly explained by a lack of interaction between the IO and crisis management (CM) literature.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this article, we argue that the CM literature, particularly through its focus on the importance of centralisation of decision-making during crises, suggests a neglected factor that may account for an IO's relative autonomy.

We thus start from the premise that all IOs, irrespective of their relative policy autonomy, are kept on a short leash by their owners (member states), which makes member states likely to centralise decision-making within an IO when events on the ground seem to threaten the basic arrangement between member states and the IO. However, we learn from the CM literature that there are good reasons to expect crisis management to deviate from everyday organisational life because of uncertainty, urgency and threats to core values, which require the ability to engage in swift -but decentralised -decision-making. Moreover, crises are valuable objects of study from an organisational and institutional perspective due to their ability to alter organisational processes and power structures (Boin et al. 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1051, "end": 1069, "text": "(Boin et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this article, we propose that CM theories can help us understand the relational dynamics between IO secretariats and their member states (Olsson and Verbeek 2013) , in particular, how crises affect IO autonomy.

These issues are explored by focusing on three crisis incidents, which all displayed significant transborder characteristics and, to varying degrees, international crisis management roles were played by IOs: the European Union (EU) during the 1990s BSE scandal, the WHO during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemics, and the UN during the protracted crisis between 1993 and 1996 in Africa's Great Lakes region. This article is structured as follows: after examining key conceptual issues, we discuss the lack of mutual interest in the IO and CM literatures by defining and comparing key concepts in each area. Subsequently, we theorise about the conditions under which centralisation of decision-making occurs in the context of an IO's involvement in a transborder crisis and how this centralisation affects the IO's position.

There is a longstanding tradition among IO scholars of assessing the role that IOs play in managing conflicts between states. However, IO scholars remain largely ignorant of the growing body of expertise in crisis management, although they often employ the term international crisis (without always addressing the concept of a crisis). Similarly, IOs have been of limited interest to CM researchers, who have so far focused on managing single crises within one nation, policy sector or organisation (Weick and Sutcliffe 2007) . A discrete interest in the transboundary nature of crises and crisis management has been developed recently (Rhinard et al. 2006; Boin 2009; Boin et al. 2013; Galaz et al. 2011) without the influence of the IO literature.

First, its conceptualisation differs in the IO and CM literatures: whereas the CM literature adopts predominantly a subjectivist notion of crisis, the IO literature uses mostly objectivist definitions. In the latter, the researcher seeks to determine the extent to which a social system is on the verge of collapse (cf. Brecher and Wilkenfeld 2000: 4-5) . In contrast, when applying a subjectivist notion, the researcher uses actors' crisis perceptions as the point of departure (Hermann 1969) . Classical CM definitions describe crises as events that are perceived to threaten actors' highpriority goals, to restrict the amount of time available, and to surprise members of the decision unit (ibid.: 413). Similar criteria tend to characterise later definitions in which surprise is often exchanged for substantial uncertainty (Rosenthal et al. 1989) . In contrast, it seems that IO scholars use mostly an objectivist notion of crisis linking important international events with potential threats that they pose to local, regional or global stability. Both conceptualisations contribute to crisis studies in different ways; the subjectivist notion of crisis, however, is better suited to studying bureaucratic dynamics within IOs. It allows for the possibility that an IO perceives a situation not only as a threat to its global stakeholders but also as a potential threat to, or opportunity for, the IO itself.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 400, "end": 433, "text": "Brecher and Wilkenfeld 2000: 4-5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 559, "end": 573, "text": "(Hermann 1969)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 908, "end": 931, "text": "(Rosenthal et al. 1989)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "International organisations and crisis management"}, {"text": "Second, what constitutes a crisis varies by actor: the financial crisis posed different problems for the EU as a whole than it did for the daily lives of Greek citizens or the Greek political system.

Moreover, some actors perceive a crisis as an opportunity to further their interests rather than as a threat. It is thus essential to understand how crises are framed and to be alert to who benefits from these various frames.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "International organisations and crisis management"}, {"text": "Third, several terms are often used interchangeably, particularly crisis, emergency and disaster. Disaster often refers to crises whose origins are natural causes, such as earthquakes and typhoons. Emergency in the CM literature most often refers to routine incidents predominantly taking place in the blue light emergency sector. For the purposes of this article, all situations are relevant to the extent that various actors define them as crises. At the same time, emergencies and disasters pose different challenges to IOs than do, for example, inter-and intrastate violent conflicts, and may thus have a different effect on an IO's autonomy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "International organisations and crisis management"}, {"text": "Fourth, the conceptualisation of time differs in the CM and IO literatures. Within the CM literature, time perspectives are usually determined by (perceptions of) the crisis event and, thus, they relate to well-defined and narrow points in time. Crisis managers are portrayed as following clearly structured sequential processes based on problem detection, management and aftermath reform (Boin et al. 2005) . This CM focus on the management of acute situations is mirrored by the neglect of longterm and structural effects. As a result, there is little interest in complex and longterm crisis events that involve many actors and move through different phases. This sequential time perspective is poorly suited to long-term issues such as the involvement of the UN in various conflicts, which have been the focus of IO research. Given the increased involvement of IOs in crisis management today, it is vital that both intellectual traditions open up to one another. In this article, we take up one potential bridge between these literatures: the centralisation of decisionmaking and its effect on IO autonomy. In exploring the notion of centralisation from the CM literature, which largely builds on public administration and organisational theories, this paper is part of the so-called 'administrative turn' in IO studies in which IOs are understood as compounded organisations in which both formal and informal processes and practices impact the actions undertaken (Ness and Brechin 1988; Trondal et al. 2010 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 389, "end": 407, "text": "(Boin et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1490, "text": "(Ness and Brechin 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1510, "text": "Trondal et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "International organisations and crisis management"}, {"text": "The CM literature has a rich tradition of addressing a multitude of organisational and societal crisis-related issues, such as sense making, decision-making, leadership and coordination. A classic debate amongst CM scholars concerns the trade-offs between centralised and decentralised responses to crises (cf. Pollitt 2009). At heart, crises are political events dominated by power struggles and politicisation (Boin et al. 2005) . How these battles play out depends on organisational and leadership dynamics. The commonly held position, especially in the field of security studies, has been that crises tend to centralise leadership at the highest organisational level (Hermann 1963) . Centralisation is most often explained by the logic that the greater the threat, in terms of uncertainty and perceived political prizes, the stronger the incentives for political control (Rosenthal et al. 1991) . From an accountability perspective, citizens tend to demand that their leaders step up in critical situations (Boin and 't Hart 2003) . Centralisation usually takes place through the establishment of small groups, consisting of top-level politicians, advisers or managers, which shortens the lines of authority and information to ensure a swift response (Holsti 1972; Paige 1968; Lagadec 1990; Hermann 1963) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 412, "end": 430, "text": "(Boin et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 671, "end": 685, "text": "(Hermann 1963)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 875, "end": 898, "text": "(Rosenthal et al. 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1034, "text": "(Boin and 't Hart 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1268, "text": "(Holsti 1972;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1280, "text": "Paige 1968;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1294, "text": "Lagadec 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1308, "text": "Hermann 1963)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The centralisation thesis"}, {"text": "Other scholars argue that a centralised response is not always the best option. This is so because centralisation risks creating information and decision-making bottlenecks based on cognitive and time limitations within the top managerial groups ('t Hart et al. 1993) . According to Weick (1988) , a centralised crisis management system runs the risk of neglecting individuals and agencies with relevant expertise and of diminishing problem-solving capacities. To overcome the structural weaknesses inherent in centralised responses and to ensure speed and flexibility, decentralisation tends to take place at the operational level (Dinan et al. 2006) . Decentralised responses also provide decision-makers with advantages from a political strategic perspective because they provide governments with the best of both worlds: if the response is successful, the government can claim credit, but if not, it can distance itself from the response (ibid.). As previously noted, there is a lack of research exploring the notion of centralisation in an IO context. Based on a theoretical analysis of the European Union, Boin et al. (2014) argue that there is no best model for handling transboundary crises; rather, a certain degree of decentralisation ought to be combined with elements of centralisation to lead agencies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 267, "text": "('t Hart et al. 1993)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 283, "end": 295, "text": "Weick (1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 632, "end": 651, "text": "(Dinan et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1130, "text": "Boin et al.

According to 't Hart et al. (1993) , crisis decision-making patterns can be understood through the effects of three variables: the degree of the perceived time pressure, the operational versus strategic levels of decision-making, and the precrisis organisational structure. Time pressure is expected to have an impact: when decision-makers perceive high time pressure, this leads to the adaption of organisational structures into ad hoc centralised responses. However, low time pressure allows for more formal and pre-planned responses. Time pressure is also felt differently at the operational and strategic levels. At the operational level, time pressure is felt more directly, requiring instant responses, whereas at the strategic level, decision-makers tend to be more concerned with the long-term effects of events. Finally, the precrisis structure impacts centralisation and decentralisation: mechanistic pre-existing structures characterised by routine-oriented bureaucratic hierarchy and formal chains of command and communication tend to centralise responses, whereas pragmatic pre-existing structures, such as matrix or project organisations, tend to be characterised by informal decentralisation or strategic evasion.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 121, "text": "Hart et al.

Examining centralisation and decentralisation in an IO context, we base our analysis on the notions of time pressure and the pre-existing organisational structures, as described above. It should thus be noted that a crisis in an IO context differs from a national crisis. Translating discussions from the CM literature into an IO context is thus not unproblematic. First, in an IO context, it is not immediately clear what centralisation entails: as observed above, CM scholars study crises within the context of a sovereign state. One important difference is that, in a national context, the central government presumably has the authority and capacity to overrule operational units during a crisis. Centralisation thus usually indicates the concentration of authority in the hands of the political and administrative elite. In an IO context, no clear authority exists. Thus, in an IO context, centralisation may involve the concentration of authority in the hands of the highest administrative level (usually the secretary general) of the organisation or in member states. In this article, we conceptualise decentralisation as providing IOs with more autonomy, while centralisation involves member states dominating decision-making. We will explain IO autonomy in detail below.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The centralisation thesis"}, {"text": "Talking to both the IR and CM communities requires us to clarify the concepts of autonomy and agency. In the CM literature, agency is often used for depicting organisational units in the public sphere that are responsible for specific tasks, like the EU agencies such as Europol (cf. Groenleer 2009) . This is how we use the term agent in this contribution. In the IR literature, however, agency refers to the debate whether specific actors in world politics actually matter, in the sense that their behaviour is purposeful and has a causal effect in international relations. In this context, agency presumes that actors are able to formulate preferences and enjoy the capabilities to act freely, although within constraints (Wendt 1987) . This notion dovetails with CM's notion of autonomy, which refers to the capacity to manage one's own affairs. An autonomous agent, however, is not fully independent and is still constrained, legally or politically. Autonomy may refer to an agent's decisionmaking competencies and to the degree to which it is exempt from constraints to use these competencies (Busuioc et al. 2011: 850-851; Groenleer 2009: 29-39; Verhoest et al. 2004: 107-108) .

In short, an IO consists of member states, which regularly meet in an assembly, and a secretariat (cf. Cox and Jacobson 1973) . Two approaches exist to defining an IO. In the first approach, IOs contain both member states and an international secretariat. The UN Security Council (UNSC) is powerful when at least nine members endorse a resolution and the five permanent member states (China, France, Russia, the UK and the USA) abstain or vote in favour. Although we may investigate the role of the UN Secretary General, nothing is accomplished without the consent of the most powerful member states. From this perspective, a powerful European Union (EU) suggests that strong EU policies require the consent of its most powerful member states, particularly France and Germany. During the early years of the financial crisis, all European eyes were directed at the so-called 'Merkozy tandem' of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, without whom progress was not expected.

Reinalda and Verbeek 1998: 3-4; Suvarierol et al. 2013) . From this perspective, member states, although legal constituents of any IO, are part of the environment in which the secretariat must operate. This environment also includes the formal and informal norms guiding the policy area of which the IO is part. As we shall see below, these norms may strengthen or hinder an IO's autonomy.

Although nation-states have always sought to influence IOs through nationals who work for the international secretariat (cf. Weiss 1982) , the loyalty of international civil servants to the IO has become an accepted international norm. Similar rules apply to European civil servants, although that picture is effectively more complicated: although they enjoy the same status, some European bureaucrats serve the Council (and thus, member states) whereas others serve supranational institutions, such as the European Commission, the European Court of Justice or the European Central Bank. In principle, IO secretariats possess autonomy. Under certain conditions, IOs may convince member states to accept policies that conflict with their narrow interests.

From this perspective, IO autonomy refers to the capacity for autonomy from member states and to the formulation of interests that are neutral or impartial as regards member states (Barnett and Finnemore 2004) . From a principal agent perspective, IOs have the best opportunities to exhibit autonomy when they possess an information advantage over member states, when they act in an environment wherein member states can be played against one another, and when they are favoured by decision-making procedures (Reinalda and Verbeek 2004: 23) . According to Barnett and Finnemore (1999, 2004) , IOs can have four types of authority, i.e. delegated, legal, expert and moral. Legal authority underscores the weight of procedures and rules, which helps IOs appear independent, technocratic and value neutral. Taken together, these aspects provide an image of decisionmaking as impersonal and free of ideological and political considerations. Furthermore, IOs derive authority from the fact that they are established with certain mandates and expectations by their member states. This fact feeds into their moral authority, which is derived from the fact that IOs are typically created to protect and act in the interest of the common good and thus stand above politics.

For most IOs, impartiality (or neutrality) and integrity are fundamental norms (cf. Terry 2002) . These norms are nested in the general international regime governing the UN, which centred on the sovereignty of states and noninterference in domestic affairs during the Cold War. These norms are a double-edged sword. If handled well, norms can serve as an IO leader's weapon to find his or her way through the minefield of major member states' interests. Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld initially succeeded in making his mark by framing the UN neutrality as connected to promoting international peace. During the 1956 Suez crisis, this framing enabled him to create the neutral United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), contributing to de-escalation of the conflict (Lyon 2007: 128-130) . However, if major proponents of IOs operate in such a way that they can be accused of taking sides or engaging in corruption, they will damage the IOs' reputations and effectiveness (Kille 2007: 12-13) . Changes in the overall regime have granted top UN officials more leeway to navigate the minefield of neutrality and impartiality. The end of the Cold War ended the tendency of the major powers to judge the UN's behaviour primarily in terms of East-West competition. Additionally, partly in response to the mass killings in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s, it has become acceptable for the international community to interfere in domestic affairs in cases of extreme atrocities (Bellamy 2010) .

The SARS crisis thus counts as the case with the highest time pressure, as SARS was a lethal, previously unknown virus, which spread from Hong Kong to 37 different countries in a matter of weeks. The Mad Cow Disease crisis is a case with a medium level of the perceived time pressure, as the disease was known and there were few human cases despite its infectiousness.

Hence, our analysis suggests that although the legal institutional framework provides important cues for the decision-making dynamics, additional information is needed to understand IO autonomy during times of crisis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Next, we surmised that the greater the time pressure, the more likely the crisis response was to be centralisation. These expectations were not met because the case with the greatest time pressure -the WHO during the SARS crisis -illustrated the highest levels of IO autonomy. This reverse effect can be explained by the fact that situations characterised by high levels of time pressure and uncertainty create opportunities for IOs to play roles when member states lack adequate knowledge and solutions to the problems at hand, as discussed in more detail below. Moreover, the case with the least time pressure -the first phase of the Rwandan case -illustrates the highest level of member state influence. That case shows how actors in New York chose not to interpret the UN reports of increased violence on the ground as an impending genocide, which would have prompted an acute response. Rather, member states (joined by the UN Secretariat) actively sought to avoid involvement in Rwanda based on the events in Somalia the year before. The case that came closest to matching our expectations was the BSE crisis when member states sidestepped the Commission due to its slow response to what member states perceived as an acute problem. Interestingly, time pressure seems to impact IO autonomy, although in the opposite direction than expected, that is, higher time pressure increases the room available for IO autonomy. As seen from the discussion above, differences in outcomes could not be fully explained by the extent of time pressure or the institutional legal framework. In the following, based on our empirical findings, we present two additional propositions regarding the relation between IOs and their member states during times of crisis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Based on our finding that the UN possesses the least autonomy and the WHO the greatest, we conclude that IOs that address politically sensitive issues, the so-called political IOs, are more likely to be closely watched and controlled than are the socalled technical, expertise-oriented IOs (such as the World Meteorological Organisation, the World Maritime Organisation, and the World Health Organisation). Although a technical issue may conceal important state and other interests, technical IOs are more likely to avoid open political conflict. This does not mean that these organisations are immune from member state criticism or interference. For example, the WHO was heavily criticised for its management of the 2009 swine flu outbreak. Its description of the influenza as a pandemic despite its relatively mild symptoms led to accusations of hidden political motives. However, their crucial positions within a web of technical expertise most often provide technical IOs with a source of influence vis-\u00e0-vis their member states (Barnett and Finnemore 1999, 2004; Skjaerseth and Wettestad 2010) . This, we argue, is especially true during times of crisis when urgent measures are requested in a previously unknown area requiring a specific type of expertise. This ad hoc delegation of power to expert-driven IOs is enhanced by the increased levels of uncertainty inherent in a crisis, which relates both to the nature of the problem and to the policy options available. Uncertainty provides technical and expert-oriented IOs with more space to define the problem and identify potential solutions. This occurred when the Commission took the lead on the issue of gelatine due to the lack of consensus amongst member states. Similarly, the WHO's newly developed assessment capacity, built upon its nongovernmental resources and its extensive network of expertise, were effectively applied during the outbreak and further strengthened the WHO's independence from member states. Interestingly, China's initial noncompliance served to underline the risks inherent in relying upon member states' goodwill. The SARS case suggests that the WHO managed not only to maintain its mandate but also expand it in the midst of the crisis, taking on the role of government critic and assessor. Thus, decentralisation with regard to the WHO can largely be explained by its status as an independent expert autonomy working for the common good in fighting the outbreak (cf. Terry 2002; Kille 2007) . At the same time, such a status would most probably not have been granted to the organisation without the time pressure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1033, "end": 1045, "text": "(Barnett and", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1067, "text": "Finnemore 1999, 2004;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1098, "text": "Skjaerseth and Wettestad 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2458, "end": 2469, "text": "Terry 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2481, "text": "Kille 2007)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions: Crises and IOs"}, {"text": "Other IOs are of a more political nature, hence, the problems are cast in terms of different state interests, and solutions that satisfy all parties involved are more difficult to adopt. Moreover, political crises tend to require expertise that is within the sphere of member states' competencies. The UNGA and UNSC are prime examples of such political IOs. For example, during the first phase of the Rwandan case, UNAMIR interpreted evolving events as technical and downplayed genocide. Headquarters, however, feared a member state backlash against the UN as a whole and chose not to consider the available local expertise. Based on the discussion above and the results of the empirical study, the assumption here is that IOs' influence increases in times when addressing the crisis situation requires specific technical expertise that is possessed by or can be accessed by the IOs. That IOs with technical expertise can create more autonomy during times of crisis is foremost demonstrated by the SARS case, wherein the WHO not only had a strong influence in managing the crisis but also succeeded in strengthening its mandate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions: Crises and IOs"}, {"text": "Finally, the nature of the problem and the tasks required to solve it are important, as are the manner in which the situation is framed. The empirical analysis shows that the better IOs are at framing the situation in accordance with neutrality and impartiality, the more the response is to be decentralised in their favour. For example, in the Rwandan case, the UNPK had internalised a specific definition of violent conflict in Africa based on stereotypical views and a basic notion of peacekeeping (rather than peace enforcement), which ensured that it would act as a neutral party between warring groups rather than as an organisation open to the possibility of mass killings. In the Great Lakes case, the UN framed the situation as a humanitarian crisis, which allowed the UNHCR to classify all Rwandans as refugees and provide them with legal and physical protection, thus allowing the Rwandan army to reorganise within the refugee camps and effectively establish control over the refugees, provoking a Rwandan invasion of Zaire. Interestingly, the dominant UN frame (a product of centralisation and routine) then granted autonomy to the UN organisations on the ground that maintained the routines that effectively helped continue the conflict. Impartiality was also an important ingredient in the WHO's framing of the SARS situation, albeit cast in a technical light, as the IO was perceived as the actor possessing the most cutting-edge knowledge on how to cope with the situation and benefit all member states.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions: Crises and IOs"}, {"text": "If member states (at least the most powerful ones) perceive an IO's handling of a situation as lacking in neutrality or endangering vital member state interests, then centralisation is more likely to occur. In connection with the ban on British beef, the Commission tried to frame its preferred position, which was to wait for an expert investigation, in accordance with the values and obligations stated in the EU treaty.
