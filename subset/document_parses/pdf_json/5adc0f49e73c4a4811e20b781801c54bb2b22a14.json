METHOD: The interpretative phenomenological approach was used, and the data were gathered between June and July, 2020 in Rize using face-toface interviews. The sample consisted of 10 nurses and 5 physicians. The thematic analysis was utilized to analyze the data. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) were followed in the study. RESULTS: The experiences of nurses and physicians were categorized under three themes and subcategories. The theme of \"Going Through Psychosocial Changes\" was divided into decreased emotional well-being and experiencing social changes, the theme of \"Work-Related Challenges\" was divided into losing the routines and economic concerns, and the theme of \"Felt Gains\" was divided into realizing one's worth and increased motivation.",

Various studies report that healthcare workers in China and Canada struggling with SARS have a high fear and anxiety of transmitting viruses to their family members (Bai et al., 2004; Robertson et al., 2004) . Therefore, healthcare professionals preferred to stay away from their homes and family members for long periods, and that they continued to communicate with their spouses and children without physical contact and generally by phone. Undoubtedly, this period is thought to lead to a significant decrease in emotional and social support provided by the family.",
