In a subset of PSM pairs that excluded patients < 50 years of age that included 3,476 patients the cumulative probability of survival remained significantly lower in males than in females (62% vs. 78%, P<.001)(Figure 3). In another subset of PSM pairs that excluded patients on ACEI/ARB that included 4,920 patients the cumulative probability of survival remained lower in males (79% vs. 89%, P<.001).
