It was also proposed that spatial features of the visual environment, like the \"greenness of the residential area\" 10 or changes in the spatial frequency spectra can affect emmetropization. 11 It was also proposed that printed text represents an imbalance in ON/OFF pathway activation which was found to change choroidal thickness and may therefore affect emmetropization. 12 (2) In favor of the second assumption is the observation that none of the known interventions to control myopia could fully stop its progression and that imposed positive defocus no longer elicits axial eye shortening in myopic subjects. 13 There may be functional changes in the myopic retina that cannot be recovered by optimizing visual input or by pharmacological means. It is clear, however, that optically corrected myopes have otherwise normal visual function, at least when their myopia is moderate. 14 The nature and mechanism of the presumed changes in the retina remain therefore obscure.",

[15] [16] [17] [18] [19] A basic assumption, made by several authors, is that these short-term changes have predictive power for future myopia development. 15, 18, 20 It remains unknown how long the effects of visual stimulation persist and whether they remain stable over time. The hypothesis can probably be best supported by long-term studies in children, 21, 22 although it may be difficult to finally determine what is cause or consequence. 13, [23] [24] [25] To learn more about what might have changed in the myopic retina, we asked young adult subjects to read text with standard contrast (dark text on bright background) or with inverted contrast (bright text on dark background) with matched luminance. The procedure was previously shown to trigger bidirectional changes in choroidal thickness, 12 which show up as small changes in measured axial length. Two questions were studied: (1) Knowing that the choroid in our myopic cohort was not responsive to imposed positive defocus in our previous study, 13 can reading with inverted text contrast elicit axial eye shortening in myopic subjects? (2) Are the effects dependent on letter size?",

As in the experiments above, to determine the baseline axial length, subjects were asked to look at an empty gray screen with matched luminance for 10 minutes before each reading task. Presentation sequences of different text sizes and contrast polarities were randomized (Fig. 1) . Two text sizes were presented (1) small text with a capital letter height of 8 mm on the screen, subtending 0.23\u00b0(13.75 arcmin) in the visual field and (2) large text with capital letter height of 20 mm high, subtending 0.57\u00b0(34.39 arcmin) (Fig. 2) . 26 Screen luminance was carefully matched for the four types of texts (86 \u00b1 7 cd/m 2 ) by digitally adjusting the pixel brightness of the text displays (140.5 \u00b1 4.8 px) and by matching the number of dark and bright pixels for the two text sizes with the same type of contrast (standard contrast, ratio dark to bright pixels 1:5-1:6; inverted contrast, ratio dark to bright pixels 5:1-6:1). The relative strength of the ON or OFF stimulation for the different text types was analyzed with the software that was published by Aleman et al. 12 and confirmed that both small and large standard contrast texts overstimulated OFF-center receptive fields, whereas both small and large inverted contrast texts overstimulated ON-center receptive fields. 12",

However, large text with inverted contrast generated consistent effects across the subjects and causes shorter axial lengths (12 of 14 subjects). Only six subjects developed longer eyes when they read large text with standard contrast (Fig. 4B) . In average, the differences in axial lengths were significant between the two contrast polarities (standard contrast: +1.7 \u00b1 9.0 \u03bcm vs. inverted contrast: -9.7 \u00b1 8.9 \u03bcm; n = 14; P = 0.0017), in line with previous findings by Aleman et al. 12 Analyz-ing significances in individual subjects, 12 of the 14 showed decreased axial lengths after reading inverted contrast large text. Moreover, in 8 of the 14 subjects, the difference in axial length change between both text contrast polarities was found to be significant (Fig. 4B) . Subjects who did respond to the contrast polarity of the text did not differ in age, refractive error, or gender from nonresponding subjects. It remains unexplained why some subjects responded more to the small text and others to the large text. Figure 5 shows that the effects of reading with inverted text contrast on axial length did not depend on refractive error. All subjects responded similarly, no matter whether they were hyperopic, emmetropic or myopic. Figure 5 also shows that eye shortening could only be elicited by large text with inverted contrast (Fig. 5D ).",

In contrast, when positive lenses were applied, the myopic retina triggered axial eye elongation and the emmetropic retina induced axial eye shortening, which confirmed results from the previous study. 13 There seems to be a difference in retinal responses in myopes when positive defocus is imposed. It is, however, difficult to determine what it might be, without further experiments. The problem is that the retinal tricks to detect the sign of defocus have still to be uncovered. At present we only know that a similar trick may also be used to guide accommodation. Del Aguila-Carrasco et al. 29 have carefully studied visual cues controlling accommodation and concluded that \"accommodation responds to optical vergence and not defocus blur alone.\"",

Two laboratories placed chickens individ-ually in the center of a large drum, covered inside with pictures, so that only one viewing distance was possible for the chickens. 1, 30 Lenses were placed in front of the eyes so that similar amounts of defocus were presented to the retina, although with a different sign. In the experiment by Diether and Schaeffel, 30 chickens were cyclopleged in addition so that they could not refocus their retinal images. Even under these conditions, eyes started to compensate appropriately for the imposed positive and negative defocus by changing their axial lengths in different directions. Apparently, growth-inhibiting signals were generated, even in severely low-pass filtered retinal images that would normally induce deprivation myopia, except for the case when low-pass filtering resulted from positive defocus. Similarly, the human retina can generate a growth-inhibiting signal with continuously low-pass filtered retinal images, combined with a positive defocus. 13 Emmetropic subjects developed shorter eyes when they watched movies with continuous positive defocus but myopes did not. We speculate that lack of the (yet undefined) inhibitory signal in the myopic retina is responsible for myopia development in general and not the low-pass filtering itself. Interestingly, hyperopia induced by positive lenses in animal models is based on a different biochemical signaling cascade, because it cannot be blocked by atropine ( 31 and our own unpublished observations), has different time kinetics, 32 and activates a different set of genes in marmosets. 33 Furthermore, the genetic networks responsible for a visual acuity do not match the ones controlling emmetropization in mice, 34 in line with our conclusion that high spatial frequencies and high visual acuity are not required for emmetropization. To interfere with myopia development, we believe that this inhibitory signal requires more studies since it may be the key element responsible for myopia development. This cannot be done by studying the signaling cascade for deprivation myopia or myopia-induced by negative lenses.",

Interestingly, the large text was in the range of best readability as described by Legge and Bigelow, 35 and the small text was in a range where reading speed starts to decline. That large text is more effective is in line with the view that not foveal, but parafoveal, receptive ON /OFF fields are involved. It has recently been shown by Panorgias et al. 36 that the retinal area between 6\u00b0and 12\u00b0eccentricity were most responsive to blur in electroretinogram recordings with the phase-reversing dead leave paradigm. Assuming that line thickness is one-fifth of the letter height (as in a Snellen chart), receptive field sizes of the assumed underlying ON and OFF cells should be in the range of 0.1\u00b0to 0.2\u00b0, resulting in spatial frequencies around 5 cyc/deg. Also, Charman 37 concluded that text sizes in regular textbooks require a resolution of 5 cyc/deg to be read. Furthermore, it has been shown by Sanz Diez et al. 38 that accommodation is driven by information in the low spatial frequency range approximately 5 cyc/deg. Swiatczak and Schaeffel 13 had found that emmetropization uses visual cues in the low spatial frequency range between 1 and 10 cyc/deg. The question arises as to why emmetropization should use low spatial frequencies for a highly precise task like controlling the growth of the eye. A possible reason is that the depth of focus decreases with increasing spatial frequencies. If only high spatial frequencies were to be analyzed, contrast at these spatial frequencies would decrease sharply already with small amounts of defocus and the dioptric range of possible regulation would become narrow. In contrast, with low spatial frequencies, contrast declines continuously over a wide range of defocus, providing a continuous signal for emmetropization. 39 Perhaps for this reason also accommodation is controlled by low spatial frequency information at less than 10 cyc/deg.",

            "text": "Evidence for axial eye shortening in response to a reading text with inverted contrast polarity was previously found by Aleman et al., 12 although, in their study choroidal thickness was measured rather than axial length. However, because thicker choroids cause a shorter axial length, both measures should at least partially reflect the same intraocular changes. A difference to the work by Aleman et al. 12 was that bidirectional changes in choroidal thickness were found after 60 minutes of reading, whereas in the current study only contrast-inverted text elicited significant changes in axial length after 30 minutes. Possible explanations include (1) choroidal thinning was too small to be reliably detected by low coherence interferometry, (2) reading tasks lasted too short time or, that, (3) in the current study, screen luminance was higher (82 cd/m 2 ) than in the previous experiments (35 cd/m 2 ). Different luminance may partially explain the different outcomes, although it was shown that looking at an empty screen at three different screen luminance (35, 48 , and 62 cd/m 2 ) did not influence on axial length change. 12 In line with the previous study is that \"choroidal thickening with ON stimulation was not correlated with refractive errors,\" we also found that the effects of reading text with inverted contrast were not dependent of refractive error (Fig. 4) . Recently, Hoseini-Yazdi et al. found that reading text with standard contrast, stimulating predominantly the OFF pathways, caused choroidal thinning that was additive to the choroidal thinning induced by accommodation (Hoseini-Yazdi H RS, et al. ARVO Abstract. 2021;2021). 40 Again, there was no correlation noted with refractive error, in line with our findings and findings by Aleman et al. 12 Also, recently, Hogue and Taylor found that the individual sensitivity to ON or OFF stimuli is variable and, interestingly, it was related to axial length as well (Hogue WTC, et al. IOVS. 2021 ;2021:ARVO Abstract). 41 As in other studies, it should be kept in mind that effect sizes in our study of around 10 \u03bcm are not clinically relevant for vision (note that this corresponds to changes in refractive state of approximately 0.027 D 42, 43 ), but that the study was designed to learn about the output of the retina, taking choroidal thickness changes as a measure.",
