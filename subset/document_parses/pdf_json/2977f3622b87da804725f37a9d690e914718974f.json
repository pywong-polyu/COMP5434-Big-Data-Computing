            "text": "Vector-host infectious diseases remain a challenging issue and cause millions of deaths each year globally. In such outbreaks, many countries especially developing or underdevelopment faces a situation where the number of infected individuals is getting larger and the medical facilities are limited. In this paper, we construct an epidemic model to explore the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases with nonlinear saturated incidence rate and saturated treatment function. This type of incidence rate, as well as the saturated treatment function, is also known as the Holling type II form and describes the effect of delayed treatment. Initially, we formulate a mathematical model and then present the basic analysis of the model including the positivity and boundedness of the solution. The threshold quantity R 0 is presented and the stability analysis of the system is carried out for the model equilibria. The global stability results are shown using the Lyapunov function of Goh-Voltera type. The existence of backward bifurcation is discussed using the central manifold theory. Further, the global sensitivity analysis of the model is carried out using the Latin Hypercube sampling and the partial rank correlation coefficient techniques. Moreover, an optimal control problem is formulated and the necessary optimality conditions are investigated in order to eradicate the disease in a community. Four strategies are presented by choosing different set of controls combination for the disease minimization. Finally, the numerical simulations of each strategy are depicted to demonstrate the importance of suggesting control interventions on the disease dynamics and eradication.",

The disease transmitting biological agents are called vectors. The vectors carry the infection from one human to another or from animals to humans. Vector-host diseases are considered to be 17% of all infectious diseases which results about one million deaths each year. Mostly, the outbreaks of these infectious a e-mail: muhammad.altaf.khan@tdtu.edu.vn (corresponding author) diseases are reported in the tropical and sub-tropical regions and areas where the sanitation systems are problematic and safe drinking-water is unavailable [1] . Currently, about 14 vectorborne diseases are reported in the USA that are of national public health concern. Dengue fever is one of the rapidly spreading worldwide mosquito-borne viral infections [2, 3] . It is a disease of huge complexity and becomes a major health problem in recent years. Due to the rapid growth in the dengue incidence in tropical and sub-tropical countries, especially in urban and semi-urban regions, this infectious disease is posing a serious threat to the world's population. In some areas of Asia and Latin America, dengue is a major cause of illness and mortality among children. A recent study indicates that there are 390 million dengue infection cases each year [2] . This viral infection is reported in only nine countries before 1970. Now the dengue has become a global problem and cases have been reported in more than 125 countries with almost 400 million infections globally every year [1] . In 2015, the worldwide outbreak of dengue was increased dramatically. In the USA alone, 2.35 million infective cases were recorded. In Philippine, about 169,000 new cases were reported and Malaysia exceeded 111,000 suspected cases of dengue. In Brazil, over 1.5 million infected individuals were reported in 2015, almost 3 times higher than in 2014. Also in India, the recorded cases were over 15,000 in 2015. More details of the global burden of dengue can be found in [2] . Malaria is another most prevalent vector-borne infection transmitted by the Anopheles mosquitoes. In 2015, more than 3.2 billion people were at risk, most of them, children under the age of five years. Malaria transmission was found in 95 countries and territories of the world. Globally 100 million people are affected by diseases such as Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and schistosomiasis [1] . Most of these diseases are controllable by adapting protective actions. The Zika virus infection is another deadly mosquito transmitted disease. This virus is in fact carried by the same vector that transmits dengue virus and some other viral infections. In October 2015, an outbreak of Zika epidemic has been recorded initiated from Brazil and has spread to most parts of South and Central America [4] . Currently, the mosquito-transmitted Zika infection is reported in a total of 86 countries and territories around the globe.",

            "text": "The mathematical modeling approach gains much interest in recent years and is helpful to explore the complex dynamics of any real world problem including infectious diseases. These models are used significantly to set an appropriate controlling strategy to eradicate the disease in a community [5] [6] [7] [8] . Using numerical simulation from these models one can predict the disease transmission, i.e., a disease incidences under certain assumptions, and a threshold for epidemic outbreaks can also be obtained from the results of these simulations. An epidemic model based on non-integer order differential operators with singular or non-singular kernel provides a better understanding o the disease dynamics. A number of mathematical models formulated for the transmission dynamics of various infectious diseases are available in the literature for example see [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and references therein. In the last few decades, numerous epidemic models were studied by researchers to analyze and predict the transmission patterns of various vector-borne disease outbreaks in different regions and countries. Anderson et al. [16] formulate an epidemic model considering the geographic spread of dengue fever. A new transmission model was formulated and studied in [3] to explore the dynamics of dengue fever in mainland China. Recently, new mathematical models of Zika virus infection in various countries were formulated in [4, 17] . A combined study of dengue and chikungunya dynamical models have been formulated and analyzed in [18] . There are many mathematical models available in the literature that characterized the dynamics of different vector-borne infections [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The implementation of mathematical modeling approach to the transmission patterns of the novel COVID-19 pandemic is recently studied in [25, 26] .",

The saturated incidence rate is more reasonable than the bilinear incidence rate and is used in many models like [21, 22, 24, 28] . Further, the saturated treatment function is biologically more feasible to use in a situation of sudden outbreaks of a highly infectious disease. In such cases, the population lacks enough medical facilities to overcome the situation, some infected individuals are delayed in getting treatment because far distances to be covered and the availability of sufficient materials therein such as beds, isolation centers e.t.c.",

Initially, we construct the proposed compartmental model with no control measures by considering four different classes for humans and three compartments for vector (mosquitoes) population. Then we carry out the global sensitivity analysis and reformulate the model with three appropriate control measures. The remaining sections are organized in the following pattern: The model description is discussed briefly in Sect. 2. The basic analysis of the model including stability results as well as the existence of backward bifurcation is investigated in Sect. 3. Section 4 contains the global sensitivity analysis. Characterization of the optimal control is presented in Sect. 5. The impact of various control strategies is depicted graphically in Sect. 6.

To examine the sensitivity of parameters of the model, we utilize the statistical techniques namely, the LHS coupled with PRCC as developed in [32] . This technique is one of the most effective techniques and can be applied successfully to acquire monotonic nonlinear relationships Figure 2 shows the graphical results of the PRCC values of the parameters used in the vector-host model. Table  1 has the numerical results of the PRCC and corresponding p-values of the vector-host model parameters. From Table 1 and Fig. 2 , we notice that the contact rates \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 have positive maximum PRCC values and lowest p-values followed by \u03be H and \u03be V , respectively. On the other hand, d V has negative high PRCC and lowest p-value followed by \u03b4 H , \u03b3 and d H , respectively. So, clearly one can observe that \u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 , \u03b3 , and d H are the most dominant factors of the newly developed vector-host model. Hence, the spread of vector-host infectious disease can be controlled by reducing the contact rates \u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 and enhancing the rates of \u03b3 , d V parameters. ",

The simulation results of this case are illustrated in Fig. 5 with sub-graphs (a)-(g). The graphical interpretation of this strategy demonstrates that this combination of control measures is better than the strategies 1 and 2 as the individuals in the susceptible and recovered humans increased significantly with the activation of control measures see Fig. 5a , d. Similarly, the susceptible vectors are also increased very well as shown in Fig. 5e . On the other hand, a slight faster decrease is observed in the population of exposed and infected humans than the previous two strategies see Fig. 5b and (c). Unlike strategy 1, the decrease in infected vectors is comparatively slower than strategy 1 as depicted in Fig. 5f . The corresponding control profile of this case is depicted in 5(h). Overall, this strategy is useful and can be used for the disease eradication. Page From the above discussion, we observe that although the first and third strategies are useful against the infected population both humans and vectors but these strategies are not effective collectively for all compartments. So, the above strategies are not significantly helpful for the eradication of the infection. Therefore, now we activate all the possible three controls at a time, i.e., u 1 (t) = 0, = u 2 (t), u 3 (t) = 0. The simulation results of this case are depicted in Fig. 6a -g and the control profile is shown in Fig. 6h . From the comparison of this final strategy with all the previous three strategies, we notice that this strategy is more effective for the elimination of the infection from the humans as well as vectors population.",

            "text": "Vector-host or vector-borne diseases remain a major public health issue and cause thousands deaths each year. More than 129 countries are at risk of these infections. In this paper, we investigated the dynamics of vector-host infectious disease using a new deterministic mathematical model. Unlike the existing vector-host models, we used nonlinear incidence rate and saturated treatment rate to formulate the proposed model. This type of treatment rate function is also known as Holling type II which accounts for the delay in treatment. Initially, the model is constructed with no control measures. The basic mathematical analysis such as the basic reproduction number, equilibria, boundedness, and positivity of the vector-host model is explored. Further, the local and global stability analysis of the DFE and EE are proven with different stability approaches. Using central manifold theory, the existence of the bifurcation phenomena in the model is discussed. Besides the theoretical analysis of the model, we carried out the global sensitivity of the basic reproduction number for different relevant important parameters. Keeping the sensitivity analysis in mind, we reformulated the control model by incorporating three-time dependent control variables namely, prevention via bed-nets u 1 (t), treatment u 2 (t), and the insecticide spraying u 3 (t). Moreover, we presented four strategies using different combinations of the aforementioned control variables. The impact of each strategy on the disease dynamics is analyzed graphically and discussed in detail. From the graphical interpretations, it is found that although all strategies except strategy 2 are useful and can be used for disease minimization. But, from the simulation of strategy 4, we conclude that the implementation of all control interventions at the same time is the most useful strategy against the disease eradication. We believe that the analysis conducted in this paper will be beneficial for decision-making and health authorities to combat the disease prevalence. In the future, we will extend the present model to fractional order to explore more insights about the disease dynamics.",
