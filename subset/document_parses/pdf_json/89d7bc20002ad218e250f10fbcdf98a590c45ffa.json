The notion of trajectory combines the figure of the intellectuals, as actors, and the stages on which they act. With the help of this model, we seek particularly to study the figure of the global digital public intellectual and the global digital stage on which this figure operates. By studying the case of Project Syndicate (the most important global platform or stage for the circulation of ideas through opinion columns), we show empirically that this stage has particularities that make it a circuit for such circulation. The notion of circuit seems to us more appropriate than field to describe this type of global stage at a transnational scale, still characterized by a lower level of institutionalization.",

In classical times, this materiality involved the printing press and books but, today, also includes a series of digital tools through which linguistic and geographic barriers can be surmounted at a speed that was unthinkable only a few decades ago. This change can be underscored by differentiating between a codex or typewriter era and a post-codex or internet era (Burnham, 2014 (Burnham, , 2018 .

What makes it original and groundbreaking is that it brings together dozens of public intellectuals who share their opinions and columns through it. It describes itself as \"The World's Opinion Page\" and it is, indeed, the world's largest op-ed website (see The Year Ahead 2019 on Project Syndicate's website). PS refers to its articles as \"commentaries\" because they express the author's views on a specific topic. It publishes original commentaries by prominent economists, political leaders, scholars, business leaders, writers, and civic activists, reaching a global audience through over 500 media outlets in over 150 countries. This makes it the most interesting and relevant platform for studying this public intellectual figure and the new way in which ideas are generated and exchanged.",

To better grasp this ever-changing figure, we need to go back to the dark nineteenth century in France when \u00c9mile Zola published his famous J'accuse amid the anti-Semitic Dreyfus affair, in which he took a strong anti-government position. This marks the beginning of an intellectual taking a public stance and, since then, the notion has greatly evolved.",

What these two intellectuals share, over a century apart, is that they took a political position and defended their ideas publicly. Or, as Jacoby put it, public intellectuals are \"writers and thinkers who address a general and educated audience\" (Jacoby, 1987, p.5) . A crucial difference is that Zola was what we will call an \"analog\" intellectual, using old-fashioned methods such as paper, books, and libraries, whereas Stiglitz is not only an analog intellectual but also a \"digital\" one in that he uses tools such as the internet and computers. Burnham (2018) refers to the change from the typewriting era to the internet era, not as a purely technological change, but as one that generates transformations in the intellectuals themselves as well as their practices. Therefore, there are intellectuals, like Zizek, that we can only understand in the internet or postcodex era, in which audiovisual material has a greater impact than text material. This is the great novelty of the late twentieth century and the beginning of this century; thanks to technological progress, intellectuals now have the possibility of being read in a matter of days by millions of individuals around the world. During \"analog\" times, there was already a foreshadowing of the quick and global spread of ideas through digital media; however, this depended on the \"famousness\" not only of who wrote but also of where they were published. Sa\u00efd (2005, p.21) noted that \"an article I might write in New York for a British newspaper has a good chance of reappearing on individual websites or via email on screens in the United States, Japan, Pakistan, Middle East, South Africa, as well as Australia. Authors and publishers have very little control over what is reprinted and recirculated.\" Moreover, with the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity has entered a new period of digitalization and interdependency, whose implications are only just beginning to grasp . Intellectual work is part of this new digital era, and it is essential to analyze the new emerging figure of the global public intellectual and how ideas circulate.",

Various definitions and classifications of intellectuals are emerging in public spheres (Fleck & Hess, 2014) . Indeed, distinct concepts are concealed within different classifications. Gans (2001) distinguishes between \"the generalists, the pundits\" and \"the disciplinary public intellectuals\" while Oosthuizen (2021) distinguishes between \"political public intellectuals,\" \"cultural intellectuals,\" \"academic intellectuals\" and \"organic public intellectuals\". Here, we will not enter into an epistemology of the notion but rather characterize our understanding of it. In this article, we define public intellectuals as having at least four essential features: first, the personal resources which result from their national and/or regional intellectual trajectory; second, a performative intervention that reflects different regional or global contexts (Baert, 2012; Baert & Booth, 2012) ; third, the scale of their readership, ranging from domestic to worldwide; and fourth, the matter of what is \"public\" and their public (Warner, 2002) .",

            "text": "We do not define \"public\" as opposed to \"private\" or \"common,\" but as what is or becomes important for the public in different contexts, which is then configured as an \"audience\". This public is neither static nor permanent, and certain situations can produce its concentration, as in \"captivating the public's attention\" around issues that become relevant, which is also partly explained by the performative logics of intellectual intervention (Bar-El & Baert, 2021) . Thus, when a crisis arises, whether political, social, or economic, this historical event gathers a public around a specific topic, and the public intellectual intervenes, either to subvert the order or -a matter that is sometimes forgotten -to reproduce or preserve it (as, for example, in the case of \"public intellectuals at the service of Trump\": Swartz, 2021) . These crises can thus generate the appearance of new public intellectual figures or contribute to re-validate others who already dominated the academic or media field, or both. For instance, it was during the 2008-2009 crisis and the growing concentration of wealth and income that an economist like Piketty (2013) could become a global public intellectual by publishing his book Le capital au XXI\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, whose arguments made sense beyond the community of economists (Brissaud & Chahsishe, 2017) . It was also during a crisis (of Keynesianism) that the figures of Hayek and Friedman could emerge. Once the monetarist revolution and its political expression in the governments of Pinochet, Thatcher and Reagan were consolidated, they became intellectuals of order and the new economic orthodoxy (Mirowski & Plewe, 2009; Stedman Jones, 2012) .",

(In this regard, Zelinsky is right when he says that the literature on public intellectuals is beguiled by the charisma of those who have been successful, overlooking the existence of trajectories in which nothing guaranteed success: Zelinsky, 2020, p.2) . At the transnational level, we use the term \"stage\" and not \"field\" since the latter has a much weaker connotation outside national borders in terms of institutionalization (Buchholz, 2016; Krause, 2018; Sapiro, 2013; Sapiro et al., 2018) . This was an important conceptual decision. We opted to abandon the notion of \"intellectual field\" on a transnational scale in favor of the category of \"stage\" (transnational intellectual) derived from Goffman's sociology. We do not rule out the usefulness of the notion of \"field,\" but understand its limits and when it ceases to be relevant. We note that authors in this field frequently use the notion of \"capital,\" extending its meaning to give it a global or transnational dimension in a digital age but, symptomatically, do not do the same with the notion of \"field\". Examples of the former include the concepts of \"generalized social capital\" (Schwarz, 2021) and \"celebrity capital\" (Driessens, 2013) .",

In our research, we focus on the distinction between public and academic intellectuals since, as we will see, our case study refers particularly to these figures. It is important to note that academics do not necessarily have to stand out for their convictions; they do not have to address important public matters, nor do they have to reach out to a more or less broad audience in order to exist.

In this sense, the technological dimension is necessary but not sufficient for the emergence of the figure of the global digital public intellectual.

We believe that the figure of the public intellectual typically emerges in crisis situations , which does not imply that public intellectuals of order cannot emerge on the perimeter of these same crises.

For example, the space in which the academic intellectual operates (university and research system) is more institutionalized than that in which the public intellectual operates (typically the media). Hence, the former receives a score of 2 points and the latter a score of 1. We perform the same operation for the geographic and transmission logics. The global space is less institutionalized than the regional one, and the latter less than the national one so they receive 1, 2, and 3 points, respectively. In the case of the transmission logic, analog has a higher level of institutionalization than digital, so it receives 2 points while the latter receives only 1. The following table shows this scoring system. Based on this, we establish a series of complex interactions. Theoretically, there are 12 possible combinations, each with a certain score. For example, the academic (2 points)/national (3 points)/analog (2 points) intellectual has an institutionalization score of 7 points. In this way, we obtain a continuum with two extremes: the highest level of institutionalization is the \"academic-national-analog\" combination (7 points) and the lowest level is the \"public-global-digital\" combination (3 points). Between these two poles, it is possible to describe several relatively institutionalized and objectified stages.",

Within the framework of this analytical proposal, we affirm that the traditional concept of intellectual field, in the Bourdieusian sense, is better adapted to higher levels of institutionalization (i.e., on a national scale) and loses its analytical potential as their institutionalization diminishes. Where this occurs, we consider the concept of \"circuit\" to be more appropriate. The following table illustrates and summarizes the above.

            "text": "This model of analysis is purely theoretical and serves as a heuristic function to compare dissimilar intellectual trajectories from the perspective of our model. Compare, for example, the trajectories of Pierre Bourdieu and Thomas Piketty at different historical moments in which this continuum can be applied. Bourdieu was an analog national academic, then an analog national public intellectual, before becoming an analog global academic and, finally, an analog global public intellectual. He did not reach the status of global digital public intellectual because, at the time of his death (in 2002), mass use of the internet and social networks was only incipient (a time we place on the perimeter of the dot.com bubble between 1997 and 2001). Thomas Piketty, the French economist, moved through similar phases. He was first and foremost an analog national academic and, in 2013, achieved the status of analog and digital global public intellectual with his best-seller Capital in the Twenty-First Century, since he publishes both paperback books and runs a blog with digital columns in French and English. In both these trajectories, translation was essential in bridging language barriers and reaching a global audience. In the analog dimension, translation times have certainly shortened (compare those for Bourdieu's work and that of Piketty) but are incomparably faster in the digital world. The notion of trajectory is very relevant for understanding our model, since we not only consider the variety of intellectual biographies and conceive a dynamic model but also connect to those who study these trajectories, accentuating the pragmatic moment when intellectual actors use a performance in order, for example, to boost their trajectory to a more general or global level or expand their radius of action (Baert, 2012; Baert & Booth, 2012; Bar-El & Baert, 2021) .",

The most institutionalized stages (particularly, national intellectual fields) often serve as a springboard from which to reach other less institutionalized stages. In a typical trajectory, an intellectual is a prominent national scholar before becoming a national public intellectual, or a prominent global scholar before becoming a global public intellectual. This descriptive and analytical exercise could be repeated for different trajectories. This hierarchy of institutionalization is theoretical and referential. However, in both extreme cases, it is difficult to be mistaken. There is little doubt that the analog national academic field is highly institutionalized and reflects a long tradition anchored in universities, research centers, think tanks, etc. At the same time, it seems undeniable that the stage for digital global public intellectuals is an emerging stage that has empirical reality in online platforms with at least two characteristics: they seek to overcome the language barrier through translation, and they respond to the urgent need for explanation and understanding of global crises, without surrendering to the mere analysis of contingency.",

Indeed, the increasingly digital stages on which global public intellectuals intervene lack several of the properties and situational logics that characterize a field. We argue that global public intellectuals operate on a \"global\" intellectual stage that is undergoing an emerging process of institutionalization, of a digital order, for which the notion of \"circuit\" is far more appropriate. This does not mean that the intellectual actors who operate on it do not also operate in certain national fields, whether academic, journalistic, or political. It merely shows that this stage is not configured as a field according to the above definition. The notion of field does not describe the emerging phenomenon of intervention by public intellectuals of a new type, particularly when this occurs on a global scale and through new media. In any case, it is striking to observe that, when referring to the global circulation of ideas in the digital age, authors do not use the concept of \"field\" (we believe because it is not suited to the global level) but, instead, use the notion derived from the concept of \"capital\" (Driessens, 2013; Schwarz, 2021) .",

We take the view that the appearance of digital media (websites, podcasts, online versions of newspapers and magazines, video platforms, etc.) has permitted the appearance of global public intellectuals whose symbolic production can have political and intellectual influence. This is particularly the case in situations of crisis that permit the diversification of public intellectuals' \"modes of public engagements\" in a \"space of opinion\" (Eyal & Buchholz, 2010, p.124 ) that is nothing other than a circuit for the propagation of ideas and conceptions of reality. In other words, the supports for their production and dissemination have undergone a profound transformation (mass use of online communications devices such as smartphones, tablets, Kindle). There has been a veritable explosion of the modes of intervention: (a) interviews in the written press and magazines for enlightened audiences; (b) television interviews and documentaries; (c) interviews and interventions at protest events broadcast on YouTube channels (Nancy Fraser and Judith Butler on the Occupy movement); (d) columns in the written press; (e) radio (the role played by the Fox network in the USA); (f) blogs, podcasts, and all kinds of electronic communication; and (g) webinars and live conversations. All these forms of intervention are not mere means; in addition to opening up new possibilities, they limit and, therefore, transform what is communicated, as well as the figure of the person who communicates, i.e., the public intellectual. For instance, Townsley (2015) highlights the figure of the columnist and the column as a format that determines the form of intervention, referring to the intellectual who writes columns in the media opinion space as \"media-intellectual\".",

However, it has published no columns emanating from the Trump administration or by non-democratic Russian leaders. Although it publishes economists from China, great care is exercised about the content. Little is published about politics in China and, when this occurs, it is through the informed pen of Richard N. Haass (since 2020) and Joseph S. Nye (since 2002). Beyond these boundaries, PS can be said to welcome a diverse range of political and intellectual points of view. (b) The platform covers many subjects since it has sections on topics as diverse as economics, politics, development, sustainability, culture, and innovation. However, economics has always been its core subject. There are several reasons for this, although the main one is that the columns it initially requested were economics-oriented and, as the platform grew, its economics columns attracted the largest readership. As Fig. 3 shows, the proportion of economists participat- ing was always important and has slowly increased, depending on the particular year and international events.",

Global digital public stages of this type cannot be considered universal because a series of factors and particularities determine the paths through which discourses typically circulate. We refer to these paths as global digital public circuits. As we have shown, PS is an example of such a circuit. The circulation of ideas occurs there following north-south coordinates but, even within these coordinates, there are geographic and language emphases in that the columns, considered overall, are translated more into some languages than others. These digital global public stages have permitted the emergence of digital global public intellectuals, who also play a role in the circuits' specifications. They are mostly white, male, Anglo-Saxon economists, with outstanding academic and political careers at universities and in government. Global digital public stages do not extend over the globe as a homogeneous network but, rather, in the form of circuits whose nodes, concentrations, and particularities can be revealed by empirical research.",

With this conviction in mind, we consider it very relevant to study the trajectories of public intellectuals since the figure of the digital global public intellectual implies prior trajectories that involve stages and fields that are not public but academic, not global but local, and not digital but analog. We consider that the proposed model permits empirical analyses sensitive to the various possible trajectories that intellectuals may follow.",

The study of these trajectories according to the model we have proposed is not only useful in the empirical sense of being able to show how global circuits are inhabited by certain types of intellectual trajectories to the detriment of others. The model also has the conceptual utility of justifying why, when it comes to global digital circuits, we speak precisely of \"circuits\" and not of \"fields\" since the latter concept is better suited to stages that are more institutionalized than those seen at the global level where we believe it is more useful to speak of circuits. We consider that, in a context of globalization, it is important not to abuse the concept of \"field\" which, in this case, means taking seriously the fact that global \"circuits\" can exist for the circulation of ideas, categories, and concepts, without this implying the predominance in their origin of something like a global, international, and transnational intellectual \"field\". The Project Syndicate platform is a magnificent example of what is, in the end, a circuit for intellectual circulation that, albeit fed by national intellectual fields, has a logic of operation different from that of a field.",
