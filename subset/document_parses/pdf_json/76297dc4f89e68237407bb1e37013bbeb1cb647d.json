(1,2) The process of translating high-quality care into the largest number of survivors with the highest possible quality of life should be the goal of all ICUs. (3) Assessing ICU performance is, therefore, pivotal to identify outliers, targets for improvement, and bottlenecks in the process of care. Measuring the performance in ICUs is a cumbersome task, but despite its challenges, several methods have been successfully applied in the last three decades allowing performance evaluation and benchmarking. (2, 4) Intensive care unit performance is usually measured through assessment of the standardized mortality ratio (SMR -i.e., the ratio between the actual mortality and the average expected mortality, usually obtained by means of an illness severity score, such as the Simplified Acute and Physiology Score 3 (SAPS3) and the standardized resource use (SRU), usually measured as the ratio between the survivors length-of-stay (LOS) and the expected LOS, also estimated from a severity score. Therefore, two essential aspects of \"performance\", namely success rate and resource use, are combined to provide an overall picture of the unit. (4) (5) (6) This, however, is engrained on several important limitations, including the limited performance of illness severity scores in some scenarios, only partially correctable by statistical adjustments. (6) A recent and sudden changes in the status quo of ICUs (7) were determined by the current COVID-19 pandemic, which represent a challenge to the ICU performance and its accurate measurement. In this \"new normal scenario\", ensuring a good ICU performance is essential for several reasons: it is easier and cheaper to improve performance by increasing the bed turnover than creating an extra bed (involving all of its initial investments, staffing and materials, and medications related costs). Recent evidence show that improvement in the ICU efficiency and, therefore, its performance, can be attained by providing evidence-based care, including light sedation, low-tidal volume ventilation, and measures to", "cite_spans": [{"start": 769, "end": 771, "text": "4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1404, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1408, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1412, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1610, "end": 1613, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "reduce healthcare-associated infections. (8) Adherence to evidence-based medicine (EBM) practices is the first obvious marker of a good performing ICU, and is a candidate for early performance assessment. Therefore, measuring and tracking adherence to EBM for measures and processes of care can provide insightful and actionable information. (5, 9) Of course, many pressing issues may hamper the attempts to measure and improve performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the abrupt shift in the ICU case-mix (e.g. increased severity and number of ventilated patients), need for changes in the whole ICU operation due to droplet precautions measures, costs increases due to additional personal protection equipment, and even a reduction of the available staff either due to illness or burnout. Finally, although data is starting to be published, we have no current tool to accurately predict either COVID-19 mortality or LOS. This represents a major limitation, not only for SMR/SRU but also this reduces the potential use of other metrics based on cumulative outcomes, such as variable-adjusted life displays. Much caution is needed if one aims at using SMR at this moment. Illness severity scores usually performed poorly when single conditions (including sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome) are considered. (2, 4, 6) Additionally, larger periods (usually 2 or 3 months) are required to allow a relevant number of patients with hospital outcomes. Therefore, if SMR and SRU are to be used and benchmarked, they should not be considered alone, neither be solely based on their absolute values, as larger temporal trends will be required. We, therefore, advoke that other variables should be measured to better understand the outcomes and help ICU directors to identify where to invest and/or change practices, aiming to achieve better outcomes. A comprehensive, but pragmatic, understanding of the case-mix and resource use, and its benchmarking, can be both feasible and insightful, ( Table 1 ) and focus on adherence to the process of care may add substantial value to an approach strictly focused on outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 41, "end": 44, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 342, "end": 345, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 346, "end": 348, "text": "9)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1332, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1335, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1338, "text": "6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2005, "end": 2012, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "COVID-19 pandemic represents an abrupt change in the ICU outcomes (\"producing survivors\" process), with a sudden shift in the input, changes in process care, lack of effective and specific treatment protocols, an exceptional speed in changes of ICU routines, among other factors.

For some ICUs, the limiting factor can be lack of equipment, lack of staff, late patient referral, or all the above.

There are changes in illness severity, staff level, oxygenation over time, which results in differences in outputs. These trends together with relative efficiency are shown in panel (B) . Note that at moments 1 and 2 the efficiency is maximized when compared with times 0 and 3 (marked with \"*\"), despite a reduction in staff level from 1 -2 and fluctuations in severity. At point 3, performance seems to worsen (lower survival, less mechanical ventilation free days which are disproportional to increase in admission severity).
