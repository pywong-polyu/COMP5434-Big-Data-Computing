            "text": "Birthweight is an important predictor of newborn health and has been linked to maternal psychological stress during pregnancy. However, it is unclear whether prenatal stress affects birthweight similarly for both male and female infants. We used a well-established pregnancy cohort to investigate the impact of high maternal psychological stress during pregnancy on birthweight as a function of infant sex. Overall, 5702 mother-newborn pairs were analysed. Of these, 198 mothers reported high levels of stress using the Psychological Stress Measure (nine-items version; PSM-9). Maternal psychological stress was assessed between the 24 th and 28 th week of gestation and analyses were performed jointly and independently as a function of neonatal sex (separate analyses for male and female infants). Newborns exposed to high maternal psychological stress during pregnancy (a score above 26 measured using the PSM-9 questionnaire, corresponding to >97.5 th percentile) were compared to newborns of mothers who reported lower stress. ANCOVAs revealed that high levels of maternal stress during pregnancy were linked to infant birthweight as a function of infant sex. Male infants of mothers who reported high levels of stress had a greater birthweight whereas female infants had a lower birthweight under the same conditions, in comparison to mothers who did not report greater levels of stress. Although the effect size is small, these results underline the possibility that male and female fetuses may use different strategies when adapting to maternal adversity and highlight the need to consider infant sex as a moderator of the association between maternal psychological stress during pregnancy and infant birthweight.",

LBW babies are at greater risk for chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, deafness, epilepsy, learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders [4] [5] [6] , while macrosomic babies are at greater risk for shoulder dystocia, clavicular fracture, instrumented vaginal delivery, emergency caesarean section and neonatal hypoglycemia [7] [8] [9] . Birthweight has been linked to different pregnancy-related variables, such as excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy and gestational diabetes (GDM) both of which trigger increased fetal growth [8] . Also, pre-existing maternal conditions, such as a pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) >30, parity >4 and advanced age (>40) contribute to higher infant birthweight [8, 10, 11] . In contrast, LBW is more common in infants from low socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as when mothers present chronic hypertension or nephropathy, or tobacco, alcohol or drug consumption [12] . Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and in particular preeclampsia (PE), have been associated with adverse birth outcomes, including LBW and small for gestational age (SGA) [13, 14] .",

Different studies have shown that MPS during pregnancy is inversely associated with birthweight and gestational age at delivery [16] . Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis activity has been postulated to play a mediating role in the relationship between maternal psychological stress and birth outcomes, such as birthweight [15, 19, 20] . Exposure to stress activates the HPA axis resulting in the release of multiple hormones, including cortisol, for expecting women [21, 22] . Increased maternal cortisol secretion may lead to the increased secretion of placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), resulting in decreased fetal growth and size at birth [15, 23] .",

It has been proposed that sexually dimorphic differences in growth are mediated by the sex-specific function of the placenta, since it is an important mediator for fetal development and growth [24] . In a 2010 review, Clifton hypothesized that male and female fetuses use different strategies to adapt to similar maternal adverse conditions. Male fetuses are hypothesized to institute minimal placental adjustments, all of which would target normal growth, placing them at greater risk of adverse outcome in the presence of a stressful event [24, 25] . Inversely, female fetuses respond to intrauterine adversity through multiple adjustments in the expression of placental genes and proteins, minimally reducing their growth, and allowing them to continuously adjust to other challenges that may emerge in the intrauterine environment as the pregnancy unfolds [24, 25] .",

The PSM is a validated questionnaire used to assess stress symptoms felt by someone in the last four to five days.

In recent years, the PSM has been used in different study contexts [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Developed by Lemyre and Tessier, this unidimensional scale addresses three distinctive domains of stress: cognitiveaffective, somatic, and behavioral [39, 46, 47] . The original version of this scale contains 45 items. A shorter nine-item version was created in 2002 to meet research needs. This version meets the same reliability and validity criteria as the original measure, has an internal consistency of 0.89, and also contains the three stress domains that were part of the original scale [39, 46, 47] . A four-point likert scale is used to answer each of the nine stress items: (1) \"Never\", (2) \"Sometimes\", (3) \"Often\", (4) \"Very Often\". The cut-off points were established from two large-scale studies in general populations. Scores ranging between 9 and 15 are classified as low stress (perceived stress \ufffd the population average), between 16 and 25 as intermediate stress, and above 26 as high stress (>97.5 th percentile). For the purpose of the present analyses, women were divided into two groups: women exposed to high stress (>97.5 th percentile) and women exposed to low or intermediate stress (reference group).",

Analyses based on neonate sex revealed significant differences in birthweight. Male newborns To better evaluate the link between PSM and birthweight as a function of newborn sex, we also performed analyses independently for male and female infants. The results supported those seen in combined model (males + females). Very high PSM (>97.5 th percentile) was marginally linked to increased birthweight by 80.63 g CI 95% [-6.44-167.70] in males, while conversely greater levels of PSM was linked to significantly lower birthweight by -91.17 g CI 95% [-17.60 --164.73] (p = .015) in females.

To further measure whether female and male neonates differ within levels of stress, we used standardized sex-specific birthweight Z-scores for gestational age in analysis. Birthweight Zscores were calculated using reference curves derived from population-based Canadian references [50] . Fig 3 shows the neonate birthweight Z-score as a function of newborn sex and maternal psychological stress levels during pregnancy. After adjusting for covariates, results reveal that male and female newborns in the reference group have a similar birthweight Zscore (Difference: 0.043; p = .065), whereas newborns of mothers exposed to high stress are different: birthweight Z-score was significantly lower for females and greater for males (Fig 3) (Difference in males: 0.198 CI 95% [0.005-0.391], p = .044; Difference in females: -0.225 CI 95% [-0.054 --0.397], p = .01).

This variation in PSM, measured during the second trimester of pregnancy, is sex specific: when mothers reported very high levels of stress, birthweight was greater when neonates were male and lower when they were female, in comparison to neonates of mothers who did not reported high levels of stress. Adjustment for potential confounding variables did not change these observations, suggesting that male and female fetuses respond differently to MPS, which should be considered as a potential determinant of birthweight.

Our results support those of smaller studies showing sex differences in fetal response to MPS and anxiety. Kaitz et al. found that male and female fetuses respond differently to maternal gestational anxiety measured in the third trimester, where accelerated growth of male fetuses (n = 38) and reduced growth of female fetuses (n = 70) was noted in the context of maternal prenatal anxiety [25] . In a cohort of 55 newborns (25 males, 30 females), Togher et al. observed a link between maternal anxiety in the second trimester and lower birthweight in female but not male infants [26] . Rosa et al. found that prenatal stress was not associated with birthweight z-scores (n = 527) but observed that increased prenatal stress was linked to shortened gestational age at delivery and PTB risk in male infants [30] . Our results based on a large cohort replicate and confirm that the effect of high maternal psychological stress during pregnancy on birthweight generates sex-specific responses. These findings suggest that male and female fetuses use different mechanisms to cope with adverse intrauterine environments such as those that might emerge from MPS during pregnancy. There is increasing evidence that suggests that male fetuses continue or accelerate their growth in the face of challenge, and in contrast, female fetuses engage in a minor reduction of their growth [24, 25] . A possible mechanism accounting for such divergent fetal responses involves placental reaction to maternal HPA-axis functioning under stress. When the expecting women experience stress, the HPA-axis is activated and multiple hormones, such as cortisol, are released [21, 22] . In a review by Clifton, it was suggested that birthweight differences may be attributed to variations in placental pathways associated with the operation of such hormones. The placenta of female fetuses adjusts its glucocorticoid metabolic activity in the presence of high maternal glucocorticoid concentrations. In the male fetus, the stress response activates testosterone dependent pathways which may inhibit glucocorticoid regulated pathways [24] . Eriksson et al. suggested that males' placentas may be more efficient at extracting nutrients than females' placentas but may have less reserve capacity to store energy [51] . Present results lend credence to this hypothesis and suggests that further study be made of such processes. Moreover, Tamini et al. observed that the energy intake of pregnant women is about 10% higher when they are carrying a male rather than a female fetus, supporting the hypothesis that women expecting male infants may have higher energy requirements [52] . Interestingly, among males, 2.91% experienced high maternal prenatal psychological stress during the second trimester, compared to 4.09% in females. Our results support those of a recent study by Walsh et al. who observed that maternal prenatal stress during pregnancy influenced offspring neurodevelopment and birth outcomes including the ratio of male to female newborns, showing reduced male births in contexts where mothers experienced high levels of stress [53] .",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. The prevalence of high maternal psychological stress during second trimester was low (3.47%) and it is not clear when in the process MPS may impact obstetrical outcomes. Certainly, different researchers have argued in favor of the second trimester being a time when the fetus is more vulnerable to MPS, but results in this regard have been mixed [54] . Moreover, although we have adjusted results for many confounding variables, we cannot exclude the possibility that other unidentified confounding variables may account for part of the observed associations. One such variable concerns the duration of the experience of stress. The questionnaire that was administered asked women to report on their experience of stress during the four to five days before completing the measure. Mothers reported on their experience of stress only once during their pregnancy, between the 24 th and 28 th week of gestation. The origins of their stress experience remains unknown. It was not possible to know whether their experience referred to circumstances, emotions and cognitions that took place during their pregnancy or that predated it. Since some pathophysiological modifications at the placental level begin during the first trimester, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed effect reflect the presence of stress in the first or second trimester. Further study involving repeated measures of stress are required to more accurately tease out the effect of MPS in this regard. It is noteworthy that recent studies found that perceptions of stress measured during the three trimesters of pregnancy are stable [55, 56] , and that measures of prenatal stress are related to maternal experiences of postnatal stress, as we have recently observed, suggesting the presence of stability in maternal reports of stress during the perinatal period [57] . The effect size is small and not yet applicable in clinical settings. Our results must therefore be interpreted with caution.",

This is the largest study to have addressed this issue, involving 5702 mother-newborn dyads, including 198 fetuses exposed to very high levels of MPS during the second trimester. The high number of mother-newborn dyads allowed us to maintain sufficient statistical power after stratification by neonate sex to test for the stress by newborn sex interaction Our analyses underlined a sex-specific effect of MPS on birthweight. Moreover, the homogeneity of participants in this study is another favorable characteristic, with predominantly women involved in a public health system where all pregnant women have access to similar pregnancy monitoring. While it is important to conduct this study in situations where national and ethnic factors are considered more thoroughly, the homogeneity of the participants in this study reduces the probability that specific characteristics of the sample are responsible for results.",

            "text": "Although the effect size is small, high levels of MPS during the second trimester is associated with birthweight in a sex-specific manner. In both groups (reference and high stress groups), male newborns had a significantly greater birthweight than female newborns. Interestingly, a high level of stress accentuated this difference. Male neonates of mothers exposed to high levels of stress had a greater birthweight compared to neonates of mothers not exposed to high stress. In contrast, in female babies, high MPS was significantly linked to lower birthweight. Our results may generate new research hypothesis, which may provide a better understanding of the effects of stress on expecting mothers relative to the sex of the fetus. For example, our results underline the possibility that male and female fetuses respond differently to intrauterine challenges, such as those posed by MPS and highlight the need to consider other potential determinants of birthweight.
