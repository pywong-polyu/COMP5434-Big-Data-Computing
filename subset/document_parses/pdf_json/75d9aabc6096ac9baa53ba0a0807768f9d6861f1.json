            "text": "In situ generation of antibacterial and antiviral agents by harnessing the catalytic activity of enzymes on surfaces provides an effective eco-friendly approach for disinfection. The perhydrolase (AcT) from Mycobacterium smegmatis catalyzes the perhydrolysis of acetate esters to generate the potent disinfectant, peracetic acid (PAA). In the presence of AcT and its two substrates, propylene glycol diacetate and H 2 O 2 , sufficient and continuous PAA is generated over an extended time to kill a wide range of bacteria with the enzyme dissolved in aqueous buffer. For extended self-disinfection, however, active and stable AcT bound onto or incorporated into a surface coating is necessary. In the current study, an active, stable and reusable AcT-based coating was developed by incorporating AcT into a polydopamine (PDA) matrix in a single step, thereby forming a biocatalytic composite onto a variety of surfaces. The resulting AcT-PDA composite coatings on glass, metal and epoxy surfaces yielded up to 7-log reduction of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria when in contact with the biocatalytic coating. This composite coating also possessed potent antiviral activity, and dramatically reduced the infectivity of a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus within minutes. The single-step approach enables rapid and facile fabrication of enzyme-based disinfectant composite coatings with high activity and stability, which enables reuse following surface washing. As a result, this enzyme-polymer composite technique may serve as a general strategy for preparing antibacterial and antiviral surfaces for applications in health care and common infrastructure safety, such as in schools, the workplace, transportation, etc.",

Plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The transformed E. coli cells were incubated in LB medium containing kanamycin (50 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ) at 37 \u00b0C until they reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 0.4 to 0.6. Expression of recombinant AcT protein was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG. After 16 h, the cell cultures were collected, centrifuged, and cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. To harvest the AcT, cell suspensions were sonicated using a Sonics Vibra (Newtown, CT) cell for 10 min at 60% amplitude with 3 s pulses and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The His 8 -tagged AcT was purified from the supernatant via nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO). Eluents were dialyzed against PBS using 12-14 kDa molecular weight cut-off dialysis tubing and then filtered through a 0.2-\u03bcm pore size polyethersulfone membrane (Millipore, Burlington, MA). Sample purity was determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) where gels were stained with shaking for 1 h at room temperature using Gelcode\u2122 Blue Safe Protein stain and then destained overnight in water.

For the 2-step PDA coating synthesis method, the coating was prepared using 100 \u03bcL of 1 mg mL \u22121 dopamine solution (in PBS, pH 7.4) in wells of polystyrene 96-well plates and incubating overnight at room temperature. The PDA solution was removed after overnight incubation and the plates were washed with 200 \u00b5L PBS prior to adding enzyme. Then, 1-5 \u03bcg AcT was added in 100 \u03bcL PBS and the enzyme was allowed to react with the preformed PDA for 12 h. This resulted in 1-5 \u03bcg AcT per approximately 100 \u03bcg PDA coating. The catalytic activity of the AcT bound to PDA was determined by measuring PAA generated over time in the presence of a 200 \u03bcL solution containing 100 mM PGD and up to 200 mM H 2 O 2 . For fabrication of single-step AcT-PDA composite coatings, an immersion procedure was used in which a dopamine/AcT solution in PBS (pH 7.4) was prepared with 1 mg mL \u22121 dopamine and 10-50 \u03bcg mL \u22121 AcT. For typical experiments, 100 \u03bcL of dopamine/AcT solution were added to wells in a 96-microwell plate and incubated overnight. After incubation, the supernatant was removed and the surface was washed three times with PBS. The resulting coatings were stored in 200 \u03bcL PBS to avoid drying. Quantification of AcT within the PDA composites was performed using SDS-PAGE analysis. Following overnight incubation, the remaining dopamine/AcT solutions were collected and run on SDS-PAGE. A standard curve of band intensity as a function of protein concentration was obtained by image analysis using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The amount of AcT incorporated into the PDA composite was calculated by subtracting the free AcT left in solution from the original amount pre-incubation.",

Conventional use of PDA as a functionalized coating involves the formation of the PDA prior to attachment of surface species, including proteins 46 , although such an approach is only required for situations where the active surface components must be in direct contact with a target. However, a porous PDA with enzymes embedded and covalently attached within the polymeric matrix can serve as a catalytically active material, particularly if the enzyme substrates are www.nature.com/scientificreports/ small and readily diffusible through the coating matrix. This requires the addition of an enzyme to a dopamine solution followed by a single-step polymerization. In the current work, we generated AcT-integrated PDA composites as depicted in Fig. 1 . Under slightly alkaline conditions and in the presence of air, dopamine oxidizes to PDA and, in the process, covalently binds to the free amino groups on AcT, thereby embedding it within the polymer network. This single-step in situ immobilization method results in AcT molecules embedded within a multilayered three-dimensional PDA structure.",

In the absence of AcT, a thin layer of homogenous PDA coating was observed after overnight incubation (Fig. 2b) . The nanoscale granular coating structure is consistent with results in the literature 47 , indicating that PDA-based coatings were formed using the simple immersion procedure. When AcT was added during the polymerization process, the resulting AcT-PDA composite coatings showed greater surface roughness with larger granules as compared to the pure PDA coatings. This suggests that the enzyme molecules crosslinked with the PDA to form AcT-enriched \"islands\" within a more homogeneous PDA background. These islands are roughly 25-35 nm in height with diameters ranging from 100-500 nm, suggesting nanoscale aggregates of AcT within the PDA. Despite these aggregates, however, the enzyme retained high activity. As a result of these experiments, we focused our attention solely on the single-step procedure to develop AcT-PDA composite materials. XPS analysis reveals the presence of AcT in the PDA polymer ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Specifically, the increased intensity at 288 eV in C1s binding energy suggests an increased fraction of C=O in AcT-PDA as compared to PDA only, which indicates the formation of protein-PDA complexes.",

To gain additional insight into the nature of AcT-PDA composite coatings, we examined the steady-state kinetic profiles of both the composite and free AcT. Keeping the H 2 O 2 concentration constant (200 mM) while varying the PGD concentration (3-100 mM), both free and immobilized AcT (2 and 10 \u03bcg mL \u22121 , respectively) followed apparent Michaelis-Menten steady-state kinetics (Fig. 3a) . It should be noted that AcT is stable to high H 2 O 2 concentrations 23 . Based on Eadie-Hofstee plots (Fig. 3b) , free enzyme had (k cat ) app and K m values of 4.7 \u00d7 10 3 s \u22121 and 13 mM, respectively, which resulted in a (k cat /K m ) app of 3.7 \u00d7 10 5 M \u22121 s \u22121 . Comparatively, for the AcT-PDA composites the (k cat ) app and K m values were 1.7 \u00d7 10 3 s \u22121 and 55 mM, respectively, thus having a (k cat /K m ) app of 3.1 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 s \u22121 . The apparent values www.nature.com/scientificreports/ for k cat and k cat /K m were used due to the two-substrate reaction and varying only the PGD. Thus, the AcT-PDA composite possessed ~ 40% of the catalytic turnover as that of the free enzyme, and this was approximately 10% higher than that for previously reported AcT-PEG-MWNTs 23 . The ~ fourfold higher K m value for the AcT-PDA composite compared to the free enzyme is not surprising and suggests the presence of some diffusional limitations that restrict the rate of substrate access to the AcT embedded in the PDA coating.",

The slab had a thickness of 0.26 cm based on 100 \u03bcg PDA per well in a standard 96-well plate geometry.

The absence of enzyme (PGD/H 2 O 2 and PBS alone) led to no observable bactericidal activity. Moreover, complete cell killing was obtained even after five reuses (data not shown). We then expanded to additional bacteria, including the Gram-positive Bacillus thuringiensis and Micrococcus luteus and the Gramnegative opportunistic pathogens Serratia marcescens and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, as a representative cross-section of bacteria.

These surfaces were extensively washed to remove any AcT that leached from the surface, then challenged with 200 \u03bcL of a 10 7 CFU mL \u22121 suspension of B. cereus containing 10 mM PGD and 1 mM H 2 O 2 , and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (Fig. 4b) . After 30 min, an agar overlay was added, the petri dishes incubated for 24 h and the resulting colonies were visualized. As shown in Fig. 4c www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Rapid antiviral activity of AcT-PDA composites. Rapid deactivation of virus particles on contaminated surfaces is critical to achieve reduced viral load and transmission. To this end, we examined two viruses, including a VSV-g pseudotyped lentivirus and a SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus, both carrying an Egfp reporter gene ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . The AcT-PDA composite coatings at 10 \u00b5g mL \u22121 AcT, 5 mM PGD, and 2.5 mM H 2 O 2 were capable of eliminating > 80% of functional viral titer for a lentivirus (using HEK293T as susceptible target cells) and > 70% of functional viral titer for a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (using HEK293T-Ace2 as susceptible target cells) upon exposure to the composites and the substrates in just 5 min, which is consistent with rapid decontamination (Fig. 5) . While the PDA plus substrates condition (no AcT) revealed a drop in viral infectivity for VSV-g lentivirus (possibly due to the H 2 O 2 ), the magnitude of this drop was much higher in the presence of the enzyme due to the generation of PAA. Another way to assess the effectiveness of the AcT- www.nature.com/scientificreports/ PDA composite is to calculate the ratio of infectivity between the two time points. For the VSV-g lentivirus, the ratio of functional virus particles of PDA plus substrates at 5 min and 1.5 min is ~ 0.6, while the same ratio for AcT-PDA plus substrates is ~ 0.2. Similarly, for SARS-CoV-2, the ratio of functional virus particles of PDA plus substrates at 5 min and 0.75 min is ~ 1.0, while the same ratio for AcT-PDA plus substrates is ~ 0.2. Thus, the AcT-PDA composite was effective in neutralizing both VSV-g and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in a very short time, which mimics simple surface contact. In addition, there was a difference in the % infected value between the two virus strains at the first time point (t = 1.5 min for lentivirus and t = 0.75 min for pseudovirus). This was most likely due to the differences in the MOI of the virus used in the antiviral experiment. SARS-COV-2 pseudovirus produced much lower final viral titers (~ 100-fold) than VSV-g pseudotyped lentivirus. Hence, a lower MOI was used for the SARS-COV-2 deactivation experiment. The low viral titers for the SARS-COV-2 pseudovirus is to be expected since the addition of spike glycoprotein in a normal coronavirus occurs at the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) 49 . The pseudovirus titer obtained can be much lower if the envelope glycoproteins are acquired at organelles like Golgi or ER instead of at the plasma membrane 50 . Indeed, deletion of 19 amino acids on the C-terminus of the spike protein that is responsible for transporting the spike protein to the ER has been shown to result in higher pseudoviral titer as the spike protein is no longer retained in the ER but translocates to the plasma membrane 51 .",

Epoxy floor material, stainless steel, and glass coupons were placed in dopamine/AcT solution (1 mg mL \u22121 and 50 \u03bcg mL \u22121 , respectively) and incubated overnight. The coupons were washed three times with PBS and placed individually into sterile petri dishes. The antimicrobial activity of bare and coated coupons was determined by adding 200 \u03bcL of a microbial suspension containing 10 7 CFU mL \u22121 onto the coupons and incubating for 30 min in the presence of 10 mM PGD and 1 mM H 2 O 2 . After incubation, 20 mL of TSB agar was poured onto the coupons and the surviving bacteria were observed after 24 h. Antiviral activity of AcT-PDA coatings. Antiviral activity of AcT-PDA coatings was tested on two different viral strains; a VSV-g pseudotyped lentivirus and a SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus, both carrying an Egfp reporter gene. To produce both viruses, HEK293T cells were seeded in two T-175 flasks and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). When cells were 70-80% confluent, they were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with 26 \u00b5g of psPAX2 per flask (a gift from Didier Trono, Addgene plasmid # 13360), 26 \u00b5g of pLV-EGFP per flask (a gift from Pantelis Tsoulfas, Addgene plasmid # 36083) along with either 6.89 \u00b5g pMD2.g per flask (a gift from Didier Trono, Addgene plasmid #12259) for VSV-g pseudotyped lentivirus production or 8.7 \u00b5g per flask of pHDM-SARS-COV2-S (BEI Resources #NR52514) for SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus production. A medium exchange was performed 24 h post-transfection at which point 5 mM of sodium butyrate was added to the medium. The supernatant containing either the VSV-g pseudotyped lentivirus or SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus was harvested at both 48 h and 72 h after transfection and pooled together.",
