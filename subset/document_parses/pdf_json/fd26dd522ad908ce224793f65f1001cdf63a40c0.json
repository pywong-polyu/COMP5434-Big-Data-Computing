With most diagnostic infrastructure dependent on specialised instruments, their exclusive reagent supplies quickly become bottlenecks in times of peak demand, creating an urgent need for novel approaches to boost testing capacity. We address this challenge by refocusing the full synthetic biology stack available at the London Biofoundry onto the development of alternative patient sample testing pipelines. We present a reagent-agnostic automated SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that can be quickly deployed and scaled, and that accepts a diverse range of reagents. Using an in-house-generated, open-source, MS2-virus-like-particle-SARS-CoV-2 standard, we validate RNA extraction and RT-qPCR workflows as well as two novel detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas and Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) approaches. In collaboration with an NHS diagnostic testing lab, we report the performance of the overall workflow and benchmark SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples via RT-qPCR, CRISPR-Cas, and LAMP against clinical test sets. The validated RNA extraction and RT-qPCR platform has been installed in NHS diagnostic labs and now contributes to increased patient sample processing in the UK while we continue to refine and develop novel high-throughput diagnostic methods.",

Typical automated systems such as the Roche cobas\u00ae unit can process hundreds of samples per day with minimal staff support, while ensuring uniform processing and sample tracking. As with other similar automated diagnostic testing platforms, they are costly and not available in the numbers needed to process hundreds of thousands of daily samples in the UK. Furthermore, they currently suffer from severe reagent supply shortages reducing their theoretical platform capacity to an insufficient practical testing capacity in the UK as in most countries. Thus, an urgent need has arisen for the adaptation of alternative automated liquid handling platforms and diagnostic test approaches and workflows, ideally designed in an open and modular way to allow for diversifying reagent supply away from mainstream and overstretched reagent sources.",

We show that these provide good sensitivity and thus a low limit of detection in RT-qPCR assays. We used the SARS-CoV-2-VLPs as a semi-quantitative copy number standard and as a processing control in the absence of patient samples to design and optimise an automated nucleic acid test (NAT) diagnostic workflow encompassing viral RNA extraction and one-step RT-qPCR. The optimised workflow has been validated using patient samples and results shows high correlation with accredited diagnostic laboratory test results. Finally, .

Furthermore, by automating the workflow, we report an average sample processing rate of approximately 1 000 samples per platform per day which can be modified and scaled to 4 000 samples per day. With our new workflow validated and implemented at two NHS diagnostic laboratories, our work has helped increase the current testing capacity in London and will provide support and validation for Biofoundries and interested laboratories globally.",

The assembled MS2-SARS-CoV-2 VLPs were purified and treated with DNase and RNase to ensure the preparation was free from template DNA and RNA contamination. The purity of the sample was analysed by SDS-PAGE (Fig 1b) . We determined the VLP size distribution using dynamic light scattering (DLS) to be approximately 27 nm (Fig 1c) , which matched well with a previously well characterized MS2 VLP construct [12] . Next, we employed digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to obtain absolute quantities of three serial dilutions of VLPs. Heat lysis has been shown to be effective in releasing RNA from armoured RNA VLPs at levels comparable to commercially available extraction kits [7] . RNA encoding the CoV-2 N protein was extracted from the VLPs at 95\u00b0C for five minutes, followed by amplification using the N1 primer-probe set. The released RNA was serially diluted and absolute quantification was performed. The ddPCR quantification method involves partitioning of the sample into thousands of droplets which individually contain single amplification reactions using the N1 probe. VLP concentration can then be derived using Poisson distribution statistics to determine absolute particle concentration in each dilution. This method allows for highly accurate and precise sample quantification without the need for a standard curve. We analysed the purified MS2-SARS-CoV-2 VLP absolute concentration in serial ten-fold dilutions, which were found to contain 250, 25 and 2.5 copies per ml respectively (Fig 1d) .",

In order to demonstrate the utility of MS2-SARS-CoV-2 VLPs as a standard for optimising and validating automated NAT diagnostic workflows, we assessed whether they could be reliably detected via RT-qPCR using the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Diagnostic Panel primer-probe set. To this end, we extracted the SARS-Cov-2 N protein RNA encapsulated by the MS2 VLP using heat lysis from the serial dilutions quantified via ddPCR and performed One-Step RT-qPCR using the TaqPath master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Three biological replicates were completed to assess the robustness of using the MS2-SARS-CoV-2 VLPs as control RNA (Fig 2a) . The quantified VLP dilutions were also used to generate a standard curve to aid in assessment of viral RNA purification efficiency and to estimate the limit of detection (LoD) of our automated workflow (Fig 2b) .",

Here, we employed the above-mentioned CDC diagnostic primer sets N1, N2, and N3 (with forward primers 5' extended with a T7 promoter sequence) together with a one-step RT enzyme mix to generate cDNA from N gene RNA released from the VLPs. However, unlike qPCR, the subsequent step includes transcription of the amplified segment to RNA and incubation with a guide RNA (gRNA), in this case complementary to the N region of CoV-2, together with a purified recombinant Cas13a protein derived from Leptotrichia wadei (LwCas13a). Upon recognition and binding of the target sequence by gRNA, Cas13 exhibits RNase activity not only for this complex, but also collateral activity for any RNA in its vicinity. Taking advantage of this non-specificity, a quenched fluorescent probe can be added and subsequently cleaved by activated Cas13, thus generating a quantitative signal which can be detected using a standard fluorescence microplate reader. By applying this technology, we assayed MS2-SARS-CoV-2 RNA released through heat lysis and were able to detect the CoV-2 RNA sequence at 2500, 250 and 2.5 VLP copies per reaction (Fig 3) . This low limit of detection was comparable to all of the one-step RT-qPCR master mixes reported above. Thus, we propose this method may be used to substitute current RT-qPCR diagnostic workflows, as it does not require qPCR equipment and is highly amenable to HT automated workflows. Furthermore, it enables 10-to 100-fold increased throughput when assembled in high-density assay plates, with accurate diagnostic test readout available in just a few minutes using a standard fluorescence microplate reader. Another advantage of our CRISPR workflow is the possibility of identifying specific viral serotypes in a multiplexed strain-specific diagnostic which would provide additional information for clinical management.",

To this end, we used a combination of Riffyn and JMP software to generate and track randomised pick lists for the Labcyte Echo 525 acoustic liquid handling platform, which was used to automate the TaqPath master mix, primer-probe, and sample transfer into 96-well qPCR plates. Plate handling time from RNA extraction to qPCR launch was approximately 10 minutes when using the ECHO 525 followed by a qPCR running time of approximately 70 minutes. The extracted VLP RNA assayed by RT-qPCR resulted in Ct values that approximated those achieved with VLP heat lysis described above for the same concentrations, suggesting a high efficiency of extraction using the automated platform (Fig 4b) . Total running time from beginning of the RNA extraction to obtaining RT-qPCR results was approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes.",

Biofoundries are agile facilities with a highly skilled workforce and cutting-edge equipment that can rapidly respond to such new challenges.

Their aim is to develop and apply purpose-built laboratory automation platforms, with an emphasis on versatile equipment, that can be adapted to a variety of synthetic biology workflows and support the translation of the latest scientific developments at their hosting research institutes and beyond.
