Although this entity is mainly characterized by the presence of pathognomonic cutaneous lesions and proximal muscle weakness, the clinical manifestation can be highly heterogeneous; thus, diagnosis might be challenging. Current treatment recommendations for juvenile dermatomyositis, based mainly upon case series, include the use of corticosteroids, immunomodulatory, and immunosuppressive agents. Recently, several specific autoantibodies have been shown to be associated with distinct clinical phenotypes of classic dermatomyositis. There is a need to further evaluate their relevance in the formation of various clinical features. Furthermore, while providing more personalized treatment strategies, one should consider diversity of autoantibody-related subgroups of juvenile dermatomyositis.",

            "text": "Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune disease belonging to the so called connective tissue disorders. It is the most common inflammatory myopathy in children, accounting for approximately 85% of cases. However, it is still a very rare disease [1] . Girls are more often affected than boys, with a ratio of 2.3 : 1, respectively [2] . The mean age of onset is around 7 years. JDM is characterized by the presence of pathognomonic cutaneous lesions and proximal muscle weakness. Typical dermatological features include heliotrope rash and Gottron's papules over the extensor surfaces. However, JDM can be highly heterogeneous, and many other symptoms may be observed during the course of the disease, sometimes making the diagnosis difficult. In adults, elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes, including creatine kinase (CK), transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase, play an important role in the diagnosis and severity assessment of DM. Nonetheless, those enzymes proved to be weakly correlated with disease severity in JDM [3] [4] [5] . The clinical outcome of JDM may vary depending on several comorbidities, such as interstitial lung disease or calcification. In adults, there is a wellestablished relationship between DM and malignancies. However, the paraneoplastic phenomenon has very rarely been noted in pediatric patients, and the current data are limited to a few cases in the literature [6, 7] .",

Autoantibodies against transcriptional intermediary factor 1-gamma (TIF1-\u03b3) are of clinical importance in both JDM and adult DM patients (Table 1 ). These antibodies were originally named as anti-p155 or anti-p155/140 and were identifiable in around 32% of JDM patients. Typically, cutaneous involvement is more prominent in TIF1-\u03b3-positive patients and encompasses extensive erythematous lesions that may be presented within the face, neck (V-sign), shoulders (shawl sign), extensor surfaces of the extremities (holster's sign), and dorsal part of hands. Children are at a lower risk of developing V-sign than adults. However, the presence of this rash is higher than in other autoantibody subgroups. Pediatric patients with TIF1-\u03b3 autoantibodies may present periungual capillary changes. Severe cutaneous manifestations, such as a lipodystrophy and skin ulceration, are more common [10] . This group is also characterized by pronounced photosensitivity and predominantly chronic disease course. The risk of cancer in adult patients with TIF1-\u03b3-positive DM has been reported frequently throughout the literature [11] ; however, such relationship has not been observed in pediatric patients [12] .",

These antibodies have been demonstrated in about 4-10% of JDM patients. According to Rider et al., classic dermatomyositis features such as Gottron's papules, heliotrope rash, shawl sign, and V-sign as well as cuticular overgrowth and carpal tunnel syndrome were more often observed in adults with anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies compared to juvenile cases [14] , whereas symptoms as myalgia and arthritis had similar prevalence in both adults and children with anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies. In the pediatric cohort, anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies were associated with greater muscle weakness and dysphagia. The risk of developing interstitial lung disease (ILD) appears to be lower compared to other dermatomyositis phenotypes [15] . This group of patients has a relatively good prognostic profile, due to a good response to conventional medications (Table 1) .",

Autoantibodies against melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) were previously reported as anti-CADM-140 antibodies that interacted with a 140 kDa cytoplasmic protein [16] . There are some discrepancies between studies evaluating the prevalence of anti-MDA5 autoantibodies. In the Japanese JDM cohort, anti-MDA5 autoantibodies were found in 23.8-33% of cases [17, 18] , whereas in the JDM cohort from the United Kingdom, these autoantibodies were identified in only 7% of patients [19] . These differences could be explained by the diversity in ethnicity or environmental background. The 3 BioMed Research International dermatological features of anti-MDA5-positive JDM include erythematous papules and macules on the palmar surfaces of the metacarpal and interphalangeal joints which, contrary to Gottron's papules, were often painful. Other findings are cutaneous ulcerations located on the lateral nailfolds as well as over the elbows and knees [19] . There is also some evidence for the occurrence of mechanic's hands, fever, and arthritis [20] [21] [22] . Arthritis is often symmetrical, affecting the small joints of the hands, and is associated with morning stiffness [19] . Anti-MDA5 autoantibodies have been described to be associated with many cases of amyopathic dermatomyositis presenting rapidly progressive ILD. It is worth noting, that in one case report of children with anti-MDA5 autoantibodies, infection of COVID-19 turned out to be fatal due to serious pulmonary complications [23] . This subset of patients may require more intensive and complex immunosuppressive therapy, as JDM patients with anti-MDA5 autoantibody-associated ILD are often refractory to conventional treatment strategies (Table 1) .",

The antinuclear matrix protein 2 (NXP2) antibodies, formerly known as anti-MJ antibodies, are correlated with severe muscle weakness, joint contractures, intestinal vasculitis, and polyarthritis (Table 1) . A recently conducted study exploring the clinicopathological subgroups of JDM showed that anti-NXP2 antibodies are linked to higher clinical severity, due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and dysphagia. It was observed that low body mass index (BMI) and positive ANA were associated with gastrointestinal involvement and mortality in this group of patients [24] . In research performed by Wang et al., a lowered CD4/CD8 ratio (p = 0:0255) and high ferritin level (p = 0:0361) appeared to correlate with more refractory cases [3] . Furthermore, serum ferritin was shown to be valuable as a predictor of the occurrence of concomitant ILD [25] . To date, many studies found that patients with anti-NXP-2 autoantibodies are at higher risk of calcinosis; the severity of which is considerably worse in the young children population [26, 27] . Calcinosis is a complication of dermatomyositis more often observed in pediatric patients, and it manifests as deposition of insoluble calcium salts that may be intracutaneous, subcutaneous, fascial, and intramuscular. Sometimes calcinosis can even involve visceral organs. The presence of anti-NXP2 autoantibodies has been shown to increase the risk of calcinosis. In a cohort of 285 pediatric patients, 43% of anti-NXP2-positive patients developed calcinosis compared to 30% of anti-NXP2-negative patients regardless of age (p = 0:025) [27] .",

In a study performed on the large UK cohort, only three patients out of 380 had anti-SAE autoantibodies, which presence was linked to clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis. It is characterized by pathognomonic cutaneous symptoms of dermatomyositis without muscle involvement. This disease is infrequently recognized within a pediatric group [28, 29] . Two patients presented with per-sistent JDM rash without muscle involvement. Interestingly, a weakening and an increase in muscle enzymes were later observed. Myositis was diagnosed by clinical examination, raised muscle enzymes, and muscle biopsy findings. Contrarily, the third patient presented with a history of myalgia and weakness with no rash. This patient subsequently developed characteristic dermatomyositis skin manifestations two years later. Thus, individuals who initially have muscle symptoms may later develop hallmark cutaneous symptoms despite achieving remission of muscle disease.",

Moreover, each patient developed arthralgias and joint contractures. Markedly elevated creatinine kinase level was also reported. It is worth mentioning that children with an anti-HMGCR-positive profile exhibited a strong association with HLA DRB1 * 07 : 01. In adults, the HLA allele DRB1 * 11 : 01 is involved in the pathogenesis of anti-HMGCR DM, which may suggest discrepancies in the epitope reactivity between children and adults [34] .
