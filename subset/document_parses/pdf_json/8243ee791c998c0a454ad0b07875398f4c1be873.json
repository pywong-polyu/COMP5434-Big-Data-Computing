However, its feasibility in low-and middle-income nations such as India remained unclear. Objective: To assess the feasibility of administering a smartphone-based telerehabilitation program for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in India. Material and method: An online cross-sectional survey was administered to stakeholders of the telerehabilitation program: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, health care professionals including pulmonary care physicians, rehabilitation nurses and physiotherapists. The survey sought to ascertain the causes, barriers, and facilitators associated with the implementation of smartphone-based telerehabilitation, as well as strategies for practice improvement. Results: While 71% (n \u00bc 37/52) of the 52 healthcare professionals surveyed were aware of smartphone-based telerehabilitation, implementation was found to be extremely low (n \u00bc 4/37; 10%). The majority of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n \u00bc 21/30; 70%) agreed to accept smartphone-based telerehabilitation as one of their treatment options. In India, challenges to efficient telerehabilitation implementation included a lack of infrastructure, perceived time consumption, a lack of expertise and training, organizational support, and perceived inefficacy. Conclusion: While knowledge of smartphone-based telerehabilitation is high among healthcare professionals and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, implementation of this novel intervention measure has been limited due to perceived constraints associated with smartphone-based telerehabilitation. Adapting national and organizational policies to support smartphone-based telerehabilitation services is critical during this decade of social isolation.",

Apart from the debilitating respiratory symptoms (exertional dyspnea, cough, and recurring chest infection) that impair everyday activities, the extra pulmonary effects (muscle wasting, balance problems, osteopenia, and mental health problems) impair COPD patients' quality of life Wageck et al., 2021) . Pulmonary rehabilitation (\"individually tailored multicomponent intervention encompassing exercise training, diet modification, and lifestyle modification\") combined with pharmacological optimization reduces musculoskeletal morbidity, exacerbation risk, and repeated hospitalization in COPD patients, while also improving their quality of life Spruit et al., 2013; Wouters et al., 2018) . However, low participation and non-adherence to traditional institutional-based pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) continue to be a barrier to long-term COPD care Wouters et al., 2018) . Home-based PR is seen to be more cost efficient due to reduced travel and caregiver strain, more compliance with PR programs, and long-term behavioral change . However, the presence of a physician or therapist through virtual means may enhance the success of home-based public relations campaigns. As a result, there is a need for a combination of institutional-and home-based PR programs, in which participants continue the prescribed exercise regimen, nutritional advice, and lifestyle modification in their homes under the monitoring of health care specialists (Hansen et al., 2020) .",

Time-saving, face to face ease of consultation, less commute, engagement and motivation are postulated to be the facilitators for the smartphone-based telerehabilitation practice as perceived by the patients (Almathami et al., 2020) . Further, our respondents found significant comfort in utilizing the smartphone-based telerehabilitation services compared to conventional rehabilitation due to the following reasons: reduced commute, continued use of home oxygen, less caregiver burden for rehab sessions, minimal equipment and a safe environment. However, a sizable majority of patients reported that telerehabilitation would not save them time, raising the possibility of further research in low-and middle-income nations. Nevertheless, most of the participants did not agree that their healthcare provider might not have a clear understanding of their problem if the sessions were measured and monitored remotely. This hesitancy may be probably due to the lack of reliability of equipment (pulse oximeter, ergometers) needed for measuring and monitoring the sessions and technical difficulties or concerns over security breaches which we have not measured in the survey (Parmanto and Saptono, 2009) .",

Nevertheless, we found a potential age disparity among the healthcare providers and the patients utilizing the tele-rehab services for COPD care. The above age disparity among the healthcare providers and the patient population who participated in the present survey may also be the reason behind the disparity in the utilisation or knowledge of tele-rehab services for COPD in low-middle income countries. Further lack of technical skills, language barrier and lack of appropriate communication strategies for effective tele-rehab may be attributed due to the age disparity among the healthcare professionals and the COPD patients. In a quantitative survey analysis, Seidman et al., dropouts 2017 found that self-rated computer and internet skills or regular tablet or smartphone use or competence regarding healthcare knowledge utilization were found to be crucial determinants for effective telerehabilitation (Seidman et al., 2017) . Similarly, Polgar et al., (2020) reported 31% of the patients of the high-income countries never had internet access and 79% of the respondents preferred face to face rehabilitation rather than getting advice virtually (Polgar et al., 2020) . Extending the community support with adequate training of healthcare professionals may alleviate the fear, stress of the patients in the initial stages of the pulmonary rehabilitation in the virtual mode (Inskip et al., 2018) . Further one-third of our patient respondents perceived language as a barrier to effective remote pulmonary rehabilitation likely due to lack of access or navigation in the smartphones in local languages other than English, which warrants further investigations.",

The targeted approach may have brought homogeneity to the study (McRobert et al., 2018) ; (2) We did not include the other multidisciplinary members (social workers) of pulmonary rehabilitation programs whose responses could change the present study results. We recommend longitudinal studies to examine the barriers and requirements for long-term telerehabilitation adherence in pulmonary care; (3) we found a significant age disparity among the two respondents (healthcare professionals and the COPD patients). Though, we could not control the inclusion, this might have influenced the selection and the performance bias that could be potential condounding our survey results. Future trials should involve healthcare professionals of higher age group that could address the confounding bias; (4) we have not analyzed separately the barriers and facilitators to telerehabilitation among the healthcare professionals who implemented and not implemented the telerehabilitation in their settings. We believe that the perceived barriers to telerehabilitation may differ across the setting and healthcare professionals and are likely to influence the survey results; (4) we have framed the potential barriers and facilitators for patients to utilize telerehabilitation from the practitioner's background rather than the results of focused interviews among the patients. This might have caused some missed barriers from the patient's aspect. Future trials should involve qualitative interviews to identify the potential barriers that might have been missed in the present study.",
