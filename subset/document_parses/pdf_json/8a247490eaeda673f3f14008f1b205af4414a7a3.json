The path to leadership in childcare can be markedly different from other professions, as there is no qualifying criteria; however, previous research has identified that for leaders to be effective they must possess skills, characteristics, and traits of effective leadership. The present study used The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) (in Bass and Avolio, Multifactor leadership questionnaire (TM), Mind Garden, Inc., Menlo Park, 1995) with childcare directors to determine their self-identified leadership styles including transformational, transactional, and passive/avoidant to determine if their leadership style was consistent with recommendations from the field. Results suggest that childcare directors who remain in the role of managers (displaying either transactional or passive/avoidant leadership styles) do not provide the leadership needed to provide a high quality of education for young children, which is consistent with previous research. This research echoes concern from the field for credentialing of childcare directors.",

            "text": "Leadership is a complex topic \"whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.\" (Northouse, 2016, p. 6) . Successful leaders connect and influence people to achieve a common goal even when there is difficulty as \"leadership lies in the manner in which leaders see and act on their own and their followers' values and motivations\" (Burns, 1979, p. 19) . These definitions revolve around human connections and communication which is like-minded with the seminal work of Burns, in that \"the effectiveness of leaders must be judged not by their press clippings but by actual social change measured by intent and by the satisfaction of human needs and expectations.\" (1979, p. 3) . Communication and relatability to other humans is a key to quality leaders, as leaders must form relationships through communication efforts so as to get to know and understand their team members for the benefit of the group. There is a vast amount of research surrounding K-12 in the United States, however historically, limited research and importance have been placed on early childhood leadership (Berger, 2016; Goffin & Janke, 2013; Wise & Wright, 2012) . This is troublesome as early childhood education (ECE) has been an agenda item with local legislation as the problem of closing the gap between ECE and formal (K-12) education persists. Wolcott's (2003) ethnographic piece, The Man in the Principal's Office, is the story of a school system, the economy of a school district, and one principal\u2032s daily routine in the 1970's. The story provides insights into the daily workings of a school and the role a leader, which is connected to many of the same elements and relational networks still present for educational leaders today. These include the daily administrative task of managing the budget, achieving school wide goals, and motivating teachers, children, parents, and the community. In childcare, Rodd (1997) found that directors spent their time on a variety of maintenance tasks including: managing and supervising staff (34%), contact with parents and professionals (22%), staff support and development (16%), managing the budget (11%), and coordinating roles (11%). The difference between a principal and director is that principals tend to have support staff such as a clerk, secretary, and/ or assistant principal, and directors in many cases are the support staff. Thus, when examining the roles of principal and director, both are positions of leading, however, directors seem to not have as many people surrounding them for support as principals.",

While leaders cannot be effective if they are not equipped to manage the day-to-day operation of the center, managing is not the same as a leading. It may be said then that management focuses on maintenance and leadership on development of a vision (Bloom, 2000; Northouse, 2016) . Rodd (2006) notes that both management and leadership are needed in early childhood programs, but there is a difference between the two. Rodd defines management as tending to daily operation of the program, while maintaining the existing condition. Leadership is forward thinking and is concerned with improvement of the organization through vision and philosophy (Rodd, 2006) .",

Research has found that high performing directors in childcare must be business minded, data driven, lifelong learners, all while having a clear vision to motivate, communicate and empower their staff (Coleman et al., 2015) . These directors must create collaborative partnerships within the community and promote family engagement. To be an effective director one does not only focus on the qualities one possesses, but the ability to surround oneself with those who possess skills and traits they are lacking. The fact that there is an absence of programs supporting leadership for the early care profession, how do we increase the leadership preparation for early childhood facilities since the push down is affecting directors, in that their centers are rated based on the teachers' performances?",

            "text": "The general purpose of this study was to contribute to the literature on leadership in childcare, as there is limited research on early childhood leadership (Berger, 2016; Goffin & Janke, 2013) . Specifically, we sought to determine if childcare directors possessed leadership styles recognized in the literature as effective, and which characteristics impacted the director's leadership style. The findings echo the literature on professional development that \"directors with greater levels of administrative training report significant gains in their level of competence\" and growth within their organizational structure (Talan et al., 2014, p. 2) . The largest contributing factor to these results was the childcare center directors' education. Overall, most of the childcare directors self-identified with transformational leadership, which has been identified in the literature as the most effective leadership style (Rusliza & Fawzy, 2016) . This is a significant finding, as previous literature often characterizes childcare leaders as primarily managers who are unprepared for leadership roles (Bloom, 1997; Bloom et al., 2013; Talan et al., 2014) . The directors answered questions from the MLQ Short form, examining their own leadership behaviors, interactions and circumstances with which these interactions took place (Bem, 1972) . The results self-identified directors as possessing \"individualized support, shared goals, vision, intellectual stimulation, culture building, rewards, high expectations, and modeling\" (Hallinger, 2003, p. 335) which is unrelated to a manager, but rather one who motivates and inspires others by providing a \"positive impact on work performance\" (Rusliza & Fawzy, 2016, p. 206 ). This also is linked to the literature on leadership models (Bush & Glover, 2014) as this study has illuminated childcare directors' transformational leadership styles which can inform and lead to changes in childcare leadership practices and research. Previous research (Alatawi, 2017) suggests that transformational leadership can reduce turnover, which at present in the field of childcare is 30% nationally (Casey Family Programs, 2019).",

These two characteristics are consistent with the literature (Coleman et al., 2015) and connect the qualities of a high performing leader to the Herzberg theory (Herzberg et al., 1959) and self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2012) .

Overall, respondents who scored the lowest for passive/avoidant leadership were those with associate degrees; this could be related to both their experience in childcare combined with their training related to the field.",

This meant that the respondents with higher education, particularly bachelor\u2032s and master\u2032s degrees, exhibited these outcomes of leadership (extra effort and effectiveness). The amount of education the respondent received (formal education or professional development), allows one to improve one's leadership skills such as research, marketing, communication with policy makers and risk taking, to promote high-quality programs (Rodd, 1997) . The literature explains that extra effort and effectiveness can be related to a transformational or transactional leader in that these characteristics are outcomes of the leadership styles. Extra effort means one can motivate others to increase their productivity, boost others' drive, and eagerness to try harder. For effectiveness the leader meets employees \"job-related needs\u2026 [while] representing their organization [to others] and meeting organizational requirements\" (Avolio et al., 2004, p. 105 ).",

The literature related to response rates for online surveys versus paper based, alludes to the fact that paper is more effective. However, if online surveys are distributed with a push and followed with reminders the response rate is predictably higher (Nulty, 2008; Saleh & Bista, 2017 ). An additional consideration was that these data were collected during the initial school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020. The procedures and protocols put in place in child care centers likely impacted the response rate of child care directors.",

The field of early care should consider policy standards in the credentialing of their administration, considering findings from the present study and past research (Rodd, 1997) . Guidance could be found in reviewing administrative credentials from both the Educational Teacher preparation programs to consider inclusion of content from the administration standards for K-12 schools (Marks & Printy, 2003) and from childcare administrator credentialing (e.g., Pathways) in the creation of an administrative certification pathway for childcare administrators or for inclusion in Birth to Five teacher certification programs. Business owners of childcare centers should consider the education level of their directors and consider characteristics of transformational leadership when interviewing potential administrators, as hiring transformational leaders is correlated with lower turnover of employees (Alatawi, 2017) . Childcare administrators seeking professional development and growth in their organization should study the characteristics of transformational leadership (Hallinger, 1992; Northouse, 2016; Rusliza & Fawzy, 2016) . Childcare teachers should consider characteristics of transformational leaders when both interviewing for positions in early care environments, as these leaders are more likely to support them as a positive role model and in their own professional development, if they intend to lead in the future.",
