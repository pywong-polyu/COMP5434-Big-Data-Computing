The device is a dedicated, battery-powered microcontroller device equipped with low-power inertial sensors (accelerometer and magnetometer) and wireless communication. The device is based on nRF 52832 system on chip-an integrated ARM Cortex 4F processor and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) v.5 compatible radio transceiver. The device performs regular accelerometer and magnetometer measurements at the frequency of 20 Hz. The set of measured parameters was chosen experimentally to ensure it will be possible to infer individual animal activity based on the sensor readings. Initially, raw measurements were stored on an SD card. They were downloaded every week, analysed offline, and used to design preliminary algorithms. This enabled to design a proprietary data aggregation algorithms that process raw measurements from sensors in non-overlapping time windows of 10 s. Aggregation enables us to extract only the vital information and lowers the amount of data that needs to be transmitted from the CowDevice down to below 20 bytes every 10 s. This amount is small enough to use BLE communication while the aggregated values still allow classifying animal activity (e.g., rumination, feeding, walking, etc.) and decide estrus.",

In this method, the values are transmitted inside a payload of BLE advertisement messages. Advertisements are short messages broadcasted periodically in connectionless communication mode thus ensuring an average power consumption below 300 \u00b5A.' However, because advertisements are broadcasted without acknowledgments from the Hubs, they do not ensure reliable data transmission. It is quite likely that a single advertisement is not correctly received. Therefore, the CowDevice transmits advertisements periodically until new aggregate values are available. Every 10 s, the payload is updated with the new aggregate values, and advertisement transmission is restarted. This method improves the overall reliability of the transmission at the costs of increased energy consumption (compared to single transmission), increased congestion in the communication channel (due to a larger amount of communication), and consequently, a higher probability of collision. Despite the disadvantages, the opportunistic data transmission has proved to be an efficient method for information transmission and was shown to apply to dense networks composed of a large number of BLE devices [11] (Fig. 2) .",

The Bluetooth channel bandwidth is very limited, so only selected aggregating characteristics can be sent for further analysis. To enable optimal selection of transmitted parameters, first, the reference data was collected for 2 months, in the form of recordings with a video monitoring system. Then all measurement data from accelerometer were hand-tagged using a specially developed application. An example graph from this application is shown in Fig. 5 . The selection of relevant features was done with the use of classification tree analysis. Then, the standard decision tree learning algorithm C4.5 was used to enable the detection of selected basic behaviors of a dairy cow (Fig. 6 ).",

The central concept of this indicator is somehow analogous to multidimensional scanning. It aggregates both short and log-termed features of cow activity to a compound measurement estimating estrus occurrence. It allows distinguishing, with very high efficiency, the rising trend of estrus activity, from the increases in the activity caused by other factors. The current value of this indicator (red color) is displayed against the background of historical values from the previous few 1-4 days (green). This type of visualization allows taking into account the physical characteristics of individual cows. Figure 10 merges the sequence of estrus occurrences successfully detected over the six months. The second important task of the CowMonitor system (in addition to the recognition of estrus) is the early detection and diagnosis of critical diseases. After the measurements were carried out, the breeding and veterinary documentation was reviewed to check whether there is a correlation between the alarms generated by the system and confirmed cases of diseases. Mastitis disease was selected as the main subject of the study. During the 6 months of measurements, 10 subclinical or clinical mastitis cases were recorded in the observed herd. In almost all cases, this disease manifests itself in a very sharp decrease in rumination. Figure 11 presents typical shapes of rumination charts for such a situation. In eight cases, the alarm was generated before the mastitis was diagnosed. In the ninth case, the symptoms are visible in the CowMonitor but were too delicate to cause an alarm. Only in one case, no changes in the rumination were observed at all. These first results, with an average disease detection efficiency of around Fig. 11 . Large decrease in the rumination characteristic to the mastitis disease 90%, are very promising. However, the data about a larger number of cases need to be collected to perform reliable statistical tests. The high utility of the CowMonitor system appeared in the difficult case of mastitis in cow number 208. After accurate diagnosis on October 29, appropriate treatment was started (Fig. 12) . Unfortunately, the first type of treatment did not end with a full recovery. There were two sequential relapses during the following days (Fig. 13) . CowMonitor rumination charts, allow accurate monitoring of treatment progress. The vet or dairy farmer can immediately change the type of treatment, when progress is too slow or when the symptoms of relapse occur. Without the CowMonitor system, precise monitoring of treatment progress is much more difficult.",
