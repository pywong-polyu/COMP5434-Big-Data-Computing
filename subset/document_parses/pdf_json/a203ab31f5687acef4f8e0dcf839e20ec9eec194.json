Vaccines with broad immune specificity and control against this re-emerging virus are needed. Here, we described that mice immunized with a priming dose of a DNA plasmid mammalian expression vector encoding ZIKV prM-E antigens (DNA-ZIKV) followed by a booster dose of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector expressing the same prM-E ZIKV antigens (MVA-ZIKV) induced broad, polyfunctional and long-lasting ZIKV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell immune responses, with high levels of CD4 + T follicular helper cells, together with the induction of neutralizing antibodies. All those immune parameters were significantly stronger in the heterologous DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV immunization group compared to the homologous prime/boost immunizations regimens. Collectively, these results provided an optimized immunization protocol able to induce high levels of ZIKV-specific T-cell responses, as well as neutralizing antibodies and reinforce the combined use of DNA-based vectors and MVA-ZIKV as promising prophylactic vaccination schedule against ZIKV.",

ZIKV was discovered in Uganda in 1947, but was confined for the first 60 years to an equatorial zone across Africa and Asia, where only sporadic outbreaks of infections were reported over the next few decades. The virus emerged in 2007 causing an outbreak in the Yap Island of Federated States of Micronesia, with the majority of symptomatic patients exhibiting fever, rash, and arthritis/arthralgia. A larger outbreak of the virus followed in French Polynesia and other Pacific Islands in late 2013, where, in addition to the above-described symptoms, conjunctivitis was also noted. The virus reached Latin America in 2015, and disseminated further to North America in 2016, with 500,000-1,500,000 suspected cases of ZIKV infection reported in the Americas, and more than 4300 cases of microcephaly [1] . As a consequence, the WHO declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern from 1 February to 18 November 2016. The number of incidences in the Americas and the world has waned significantly after 2017 [2] . However, the virus still is circulating and its behaviour could be unpredictable due to its potential for re-emergence [3] .",

Based on model predictions, in the worst-case scenario, over 1.3 billion new people could face suitable transmission temperatures for ZIKV by 2050 [4] . Furthermore, ZIKV can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or spread through sexual contact, breastfeeding, or blood transfusion [1, 2] .

Although, in recent years several vaccine candidates against ZIKV have been developed, and some of them entered in phase I or II clinical trials, there are no approved vaccines yet to prevent ZIKV infection [6] . One of the most promising vaccine vectors is the poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) that has been widely used as a recombinant vaccine vector against several infectious diseases and cancer [7] [8] [9] . and have numerous characteristics that make MVA an excellent vaccine candidate: (a) the packing flexibility of the genome, which allows the insertion of up to 25 kbp of foreign DNA without loss of infectivity, (b) the lack of persistence or genomic integration in the host due to their cytoplasmic replication, (c) the ability to induce both antibody and cytotoxic T cell immune responses against the heterologous antigens with long-lasting immunity after a single inoculation, (d) the stability of freezedried vaccine, (e) its ease of manufacture and administration and (f) the low prevalence of anti-vector immunity in the global population due to the interruption of smallpox vaccination after the WHO declared its eradication in 1980 [8, 9] . The efficacy of recombinant MVA vectors in developing antigenspecific immune responses is due to the expression of gene products within cells that are efficiently presented by both MHC class I and class II molecules, leading to the activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and the induction of potent antibody responses, which promotes robust anti-viral responses that make MVA to act as an adjuvant itself [10, 11] .",

            "text": "We have previously described the generation of an MVA-based ZIKV vaccine candidate expressing prM-E ZIKV proteins, termed MVA-ZIKV [12] . This candidate enabled the production of virus-like particles (VLPs) and induced ZIKV-specific CD8 + T cells and neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice, controlling ZIKV replication in a challenged mouse model [12] . Although MVA-ZIKV was highly immunogenic and protective in susceptible mice models at short timepoints, novel vaccine candidates and/or immunization approaches that could improve the magnitude, and durability of the ZIKV-specific immune responses are desirable. One of the most commonplace methods of immunization used to improve the immune responses generated by MVA-based vaccines is to follow a multiple dose prime/boost strategy, because priming with a different vector impairs the generation of anti-MVA responses able to abrogate boosted immune responses to the antigen encoded in the recombinant MVA vector [13] . The first description of the advantage of combined vectors to enhance specific immune responses and efficacy against a pathogen was work published with influenza and poxvirus vectors expressing a malaria CS antigen, showing that the heterologous combination was superior to homologous vectors, as well as it pointed out the relevance for immunogenicity and protection of the order of vector delivery [14] . The use of heterologous prime/boost protocols that combine an MVA vector with other vaccine agent such as DNA, can improve the antigen-specific immune responses in different animal models [7, 15, 16] . Furthermore, the use of heterologous prime/boost protocols including MVA vector have also demonstrated in human clinical trials to be able to induce good T-and B-cell responses against various pathogens as, for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 [17, 18] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [19] , Plasmodium falciparum (the causative agent of malaria) [20] , ebolavirus (EBOV) [21] , and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [22] . Moreover, the recent development of novel vaccine candidates against COVID-19, showed heterologous prime/boost vaccination strategies able to induce more potent T-cell and humoral immune responses and higher efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 [23, 24] , which will help to find the best-in-class vaccine candidates.",

The results showed that the heterologous DNA-ZIKV/ MVA-ZIKV immunization elicited significantly higher adaptive and memory ZIKV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses than homologous DNA-ZIKV/DNA-ZIKV or MVA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV prime/boost immunization regimens. Moreover, priming with DNA-ZIKV, also increased the magnitude of ZIKV-specific CD4 + T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Furthermore, DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV also elicited a trend to higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV than the homologous immunization regimens. Our findings reveal that the combination of DNA-ZIKV with MVA-ZIKV is an effective approach to induce ZIKV-specific T-cell and humoral immunogenicity, forming a promising vaccine strategy against ZIKV.",

After spleen processing, fresh 4 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes (depleted of red blood cells) were seeded onto M96 plates and stimulated for 6 h in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS containing 1 \u03bcl/ml Golgiplug (BD Biosciences) to inhibit cytokine secretion; monensin 1X (eBioscience), anti-CD107a-FITC (BD Biosciences); and the ZIKV E peptide pool (5 \u03bcg/ml). Then cells were washed, stained for the surface markers, fixed, permeabilized (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit; BD Biosciences), and stained intracellularly with the appropriate fluorochromes. Dead cells were excluded with the violet LIVE/DEAD stain kit (Invitrogen). The fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies used for functional analyses were CD3-phycoerythrin (PE)-CF594, CD4-allophycocyanin (APC)-Cy7, CD8-V500, IFN-\u03b3-PE-Cy7, TNF-\u03b1-PE, and IL-2-APC. In addition, the antibodies used for phenotypic analyses were CD62L-Alexa 700 and CD127-peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-Cy5.5. All antibodies were from BD Biosciences. 2 Analysis of Tfh cell responses.

The correct expression of the ZIKV E protein from the recombinant DNA-ZIKV vector was confirmed and evaluated from cell extracts of transiently transfected HEK293T cells by Western blot (Figure 1(A) ). In addition, by flow cytometry high levels of E protein were observed in a cell clone of stable DNA-ZIKV transfected HeLa cells (Figure 1(B) ). Immunofluorescence analysis of stable transfected cells showed that, as expected, ZIKV E glycoprotein co-localized with calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum marker (Figure 1 (C)). Following synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, flavivirus prM and E assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) that enter into the secretory pathway prior to be released into the extracellular medium [36] . Accordingly, the analysis of the cell culture medium by dot blot confirmed that the expression of DNA-ZIKV induced the release of ZIKV antigens to the extracellular medium (Figure 1(D) ). Sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis supported the particulate nature of the released antigens that was compatible with the production of VLPs (Figure 1(E) ).",

Thus, the ZIKV-specific immunogenicity elicited in mice by DNA-ZIKV or MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates expressing ZIKV prM-E proteins was examined following homologous or heterologous prime/boost immunizations. Thus, Balb/c mice (n = 8/group) were immunized as shown in Figure The results showed that homologous MVA-ZIKV/ MVA-ZIKV and heterologous DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV prime/boost approaches elicited good levels of ZIKV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell immune responses, which were mediated largely by the CD8 + T cell subset (Figure 3(A,B) ). However, no ZIKVspecific CD4 + or CD8 + T cell responses were detected after homologous DNA-ZIKV/DNA-ZIKV immunization. The comparison of the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses induced by heterologous DNA-ZIKV/ MVA-ZIKV and homologous MVA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV showed that DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV elicited a significant higher magnitude of ZIKV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses (around 8-fold and 1.4-fold higher) compared with the homologous regimen (p < 0.001) (Figure 3(A,B) ).",

These include vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus (MV), adenovirus (Ad), and vaccinia virus (VACV). An attenuated version of a recombinant VSV expressing the prM-E of ZIKV elicited both neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses that protected challenged newborn mice born to vaccinated female mice [43] . A live attenuated measles virus vector expressing prM and soluble E (MV-Zika-sE) was shown to protect mice from ZIKV challenge through the development of E-specific neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses [44] . The immunization of NHPs also resulted in ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibody responses in all vaccinated animals. This vaccine and another similarly developed MV vaccine (MV-ZIKV-RSP) are in human phase I clinical trials [6] . Furthermore, several adenovirus vectors expressing prM-E and/or E alone have been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses that confer protection in mice and NHPs [5, 41] . There are also several VACV recombinant vectors as ZIKV vaccine candidates. A two-dose regimen using DNA and/or non-replicating VACV-based (Tian Tan strain) vaccine candidates expressing ZIKV prM-E cassette elicited in Balb/c mice robust neutralizing activity against ZIKV both in a homologous DNA/ DNA and VACV/VACV immunization protocols just as much as in a heterologous DNA/VACV immunization protocol, as well as similar production of ZIKV E-specific IgG antibodies [45] . Their results also showed that DNA-prME/VACV-prME heterologous immunization lead to a significantly greater level of T cell response than both DNA/DNA and VACV/VACV homologous immunization protocols [45] . Various MVA recombinant viruses constructed to express the ZIKV E protein with modifications on the precursor membrane (prM) protein or on the Cterminus envelope transmembrane domain (TM) were evaluated as a non-adjuvanted single vaccination regimen against a ZIKV Brazilian isolate in BALB/c mice, demonstrating a low induction of cellular responses but good anti-ZIKV E titers that were enough immunogenic to substantially reducing the ZIKV loads in blood after challenge [46] . Another MVA-based single vector construct expressing prM-E of ZIKV and the structural proteins of chikungunya virus (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) induced neutralizing antibody responses to both viruses in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice and blocked ZIKV viremia and disease [47] . Additionally, this vaccine candidate also blocked the vertical transmission of ZIKV in immunocompromised female mice and testes damage in male mice [47] . Other MVA-based ZIKV vaccine candidate, this time, targeting NS1 protein was able to protect immunocompetent adult mice in a lethal challenge model [48] .",

We have recently described the generation of MVA-ZIKV, an MVAbased ZIKV vaccine candidate expressing ZIKV prM-E antigens able to form ZIKV VLPs, which was highly immunogenic in mice inducing robust levels of ZIKV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell immune responses, as well as high levels of neutralizing antibodies [12] . Remarkably, one single dose of MVA-ZIKV was able to control Zika virus replication in a challenged mouse model [12] . However, although the MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidate generated was highly immunogenic and protective in susceptible mice models at short timepoints, novel vaccine candidates and/or immunization approaches that could improve the magnitude and durability of the ZIKVspecific immune responses are desirable. This is particularly noticeable with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic where vaccines able to induce broad B and T cell responses with long-lasting immunity are sought.",

In our previous study, we were not able to detect ZIKV-specific CD4 + T cell responses when immunized mice with two doses of MVA-ZIKV [12] . Here, consistently with our previous results, we have barely or no observed ZIKV-specific CD4 + T cell responses within the limits of detection, when mice were immunized with two doses of MVA-ZIKV (in both time-points studied, 10-and 53-days post-immunization); in the case of DNA-ZIKV, there was no CD4 + T cell response at 10 days after the booster but good levels at 53-days post boost, indicating a delay immune response triggered by the DNA vector. However, a significant increase in the magnitude of adaptive and memory ZIKV-specific CD4 + T cell responses was achieved when a DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV heterologous prime/boost regimen was applied. On the other hand, recent studies have confirmed the importance of CD8 + T cells in ZIKV infection and in vaccine-induced protection [51, 53, 54] . Furthermore, in a ZIKV infection model it has been described that CD8 + T cells are capable of local viral control if they arrive in the brain early after viral invasion, demonstrating the benefits of considering this subset when designing vaccines against ZIKV virus [38] . Our work, demonstrates that a combined immunization with DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV was able to enhance significantly the levels of adaptive and memory ZIKV-specific CD8 + T cell responses expressing important cytokines as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2 and the degranulation marker CD107a. A 2018 study observed that an Adenovirus-vectored vaccine containing the ZIKV prM-E elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses (but lower than those elicited with our DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV) in immunocompetent BALB/c mice and provided sterilizing protection against ZIKV infection in Interferon receptordeficient (A129) mice [55] . Other VSV-based vaccine candidate covering the prM-E region of ZIKV that also elicits robust CD8 + T cell responses, but lower than those achieved by our DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV protocol, was able to protect C57BL/6 mice from morbidity or mortality and Neonatal mice born from vaccinated mother were protected from ZIKV replication after challenge [43] .",

Naive CD4 + T cells can differentiate into Th1 and Tfh cells during viral infection [39] . Th1 cells control virus spread, and provide help to the generation and maintenance of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, whereas Tfh cells are involved in the development and sustaining of germinal centre (GC) interactions and, therefore, in the induction of antibody responses. Recent studies found an indispensable role of Tfh cells for the elicitation of ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies and long-term maintenance of antibody response [37] , pivotal for an efficacious vaccine. In concordance with this important role of Tfh on ZIKV infection, we describe here that the MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidate is able to induce potent levels of ZIKV-specific Tfh cells, either when used in a homologous MVA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV immunization protocol or when used in a heterologous DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV immunization regimen. Again, similarly to what we observed with ZIKV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses, the heterologous DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV immunization protocol was the most immunogenic regimen inducing significant higher magnitudes of ZIKV-specific Tfh cells, expressing IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and/ or CD40L than the other regimens used.",

Our previous results demonstrated that MVA-ZIKV induced neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV and was able to significantly reduce ZIKV viremia after a challenge with ZIKV in IFNAR -/mice (non-lethal challenge mouse model) [12] . In fact, the higher reduction in ZIKV viremia was observed in animals immunized with a two-dose MVA-ZIKV regimen that was the immunization protocol eliciting higher levels of neutralizing antibodies compared to a one-dose regimen, reflecting a correlation with levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection [12] . Here, we report that immunization with a heterologous DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV regimen induced a trend to higher neutralizing antibody titers against ZIKV, compared with the previously described and efficacious MVA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV homologous immunization protocol. A recombinant VSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidate expressing ZIKV genes for the prM and E proteins (from ZIKV strain ZikaSPH2015) was able to generate a high titer of neutralization Ab, in a similar range as our MVA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV and DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV immunization protocols did, and also demonstrated that progeny of vaccinated females are largely protected from lethal ZIKV infection [43] . Later in 2018, Bullard and colleagues stated that prime/ boost strategies utilizing Adenovirus-based vaccines candidates expressing ZIKV prM and E proteins as the prime induced a strong anti-ZIKV humoral immune response, with neutralization titters measured as PRNT50 reached 400. Nonetheless, the study showed that vaccination strategies with these kind of recombinant vaccines that elicited lower neutralization titters, in a similar range that the ones elicited by our MVA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV and DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV immunization protocols, were as efficacious as higher neutralizing titters protecting anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated C57BL/6 mice challenged with ZIKV against weight loss and death [56] .",

Depending on the nature of the vaccine, leading to activation of B over T cells, vice versa or more balanced, these parameters might contribute differentially to the protective responses. We have previously demonstrated full efficacy of the homologous prime/boost immunization with MVA-ZIKV, and even with a single dose of MVA-ZIKV [12] . In the current study, we could assume the same efficacy of the heterologous DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV prime/boost immunization, as we achieved better immune responses in all immune parameters analysed. Efficacy experiments to extend correlates of protection (antibodies and CD4 + or CD8 + T cells) of the DNA-ZIKV and MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates, used in homologous or heterologous prime/ boost immunization protocols, will be tested in the future.",

To date, there are limited information about the possible relationship between memory T cell responses and the longevity of vaccine efficacy against ZIKV, but it is known that ZIKV can infect individuals for long periods, indicating that the generation of effective memory T lymphocytes activity may be important in helping to protect against ZIKV infection [51] . Besides, different recombinant MVA vaccine candidates have proved in clinical assays to be able to induce long-lasting immune responses [58, 59] . Our results showed that immunizing with a heterologous DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV regimen increased the magnitude of the memory ZIKV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses compared with homologous regimens MVA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV and DNA-ZIKV/DNA-ZIKV, which is one of the most commonly vaccination strategies in the ongoing clinical trials performed for ZIKV [52, 60] . Moreover, we have described the presence of neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV at the memory phase, showing that this heterologous DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV regimen is able to induce also durable humoral immune responses. Thus, the ability of the DNA-ZIKV/MVA-ZIKV immunization regimen to elicit high memory ZIKV-specific T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies adds more value to this regimen in potentiating durable responses that might extend vaccine protection.",

This more balanced T and B cell activation represents a promising outcome of this combined vaccination strategy for clinical studies on ZIKV. Currently, the heterologous combination of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is gaining support to further enhance the immunogenicity over the homologous vaccine administration that is being applied as a mass vaccination campaign to the human population. Understanding the B and T cell immune responses triggered by combined vaccines is needed for better implementation of worldwide vaccination programs.",

At 10 days post-boost half of the animals were sacrificed and adaptive ZIKV-specific T cell (CD4, CD8 and Tfh) immune responses were analysed by a polychromatic intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay.To detect the ZIKV-specific T cell responses, splenocytes from immunized animals were stimulated ex vivo for 6 h with ZIKV-specific peptide pools spanning the entire ZIKV E protein. The percentages of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells that produced IFN-\u03b3 and/or IL-2 and/or TNF-\u03b1 and/or CD107a established the overall magnitude of ZIKV-specific CD4 + or CD8 + T cell immune responses.
