Active play encompasses many concepts but can be conceptualized as creative activity in which children are physically active and is often unstructured [1] . Unfortunately, a low prevalence of children in the U.S. meet PA recommendations [5] . Children are recommended to be physically active for a minimum of 60 minutes each day for health benefits [6] . Further, research suggests that children may play outside less than previous generations [7] . Specifically, in rural communities, children face barriers to participating in PA and active play, namely few safe PA resources, decreased walkability or active transportation opportunities, long distances to resources, and concerns for safety [8, 9] . In response to these barriers, rural communities often employ creative solutions to provide support for PA and PA resources [9, 10] .",

Play Streets is a place-based intervention in which community members temporarily (2-4 h) close a street or activate a public space, such as a field or a parking lot, to provide a safe place for children to play. While Play Streets have been used in urban areas for decades [11] [12] [13] , rural communities have recently adapted them to fit the needs of their communities [14, 15] . Play Streets typically occur episodically during the summer (June-September) to provide safe active play opportunities in a time of reduced PA and structured opportunities for activity [16, 17] . Play Streets have successfully encouraged active play and PA for children in both rural and urban settings [11, 14] . Reported previously, as a primary aim of this larger study, Play Streets are effective ways to promote PA and active play among children and adolescents [14] by getting people outdoors playing and interacting with others in their community.",

Community connectedness includes the following interrelated concepts seen in the literature to directly or indirectly influence health: collective-efficacy, social capital (bonding, bridging, linking), social cohesion (structural, cognitive, relational), social identification (cognitive, affective, in-group ties), and social support (structural, emotional, instrumental, informational, appraisal, conditional) [19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

Further, social cohesion and sense of community may also provide community members access to resources (i.e., social capital) which would not be available to them in a less connected community [42] [43] [44] .

However, interventions often have unintended side effects or impacts beyond the stated purpose of the program or aim of an evaluation or study, which can be regarded as externalities. Originated in the field of health economics and also applied in other disciplines including behavioral science, externalities represent unsolicited health-related costs or benefits derived from policy, programs, or other action [50] . For example, a population reaching herd immunity (i.e., reduced risk of spread) against a particular virus due to widespread vaccination benefits not only those who get vaccinated, but also those who do not get vaccinated. An important defining feature of externalities is that they involve no additional input of resources. That is, externalities are non-primary effects of a behavior as it exists. Such second-order effects have occasionally been explored in health contexts, such as population health benefits of creating a bike-sharing infrastructure in a community [51] , increased obesity stigma related to the introduction of graphic warning labels on sugary drinks [52] , and water and air quality effects in neighborhoods surrounding livestock production facilities [53] . Studies have further examined externalities related to social conditions in communities, suggesting that higher social cohesion can have positive overall impacts on wellbeing for individuals and the community as a whole [54] .",

When public spaces are inclusive, equitable, and enjoyable to inhabit, the use of the existing infrastructure increases, having the potential to improve overall quality of life in addition to PA opportunities [57] . Prior research suggests that Play Streets may foster a sense of social cohesion and sense of community within the neighborhood and can help create and strengthen a community's social environment; however, this has not been explicitly examined [58] . Therefore, it is worth considering externalities related to health behavior interventions (i.e., health externalities) such as Play Streets that utilize (\"activate\") otherwise inactive public spaces.",

            "text": "This article comes from a larger study assessing the implementation of Play Streets in rural communities. More information on the formative procedures as well as PA outcomes can be found elsewhere [14, 15] . To summarize briefly, during 2017 four partner organizations located in diverse low-income, rural communities (rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) code greater than or equal to 4.0) [59] across the U.S. were recruited based on experience implementing community events and willingness to implement Play Streets. RUCA codes classify U.S. census tracts, counties, and zip codes along the rural-urban continuum using measures of population density, urbanization, and daily commuting using U.S. census and American Community Survey data. The classification includes whole numbers 1-10 that designate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural using population size and primary commuting flows, with further detail provided on secondary commuting flows indicated by decimals. RUCA classifications define codes of 4.0-6.0 as micropolitan (population: 10,000 to 49,999), 7.0-9.0 as small towns (population: 2500 to 9999), and 10.0-10.3 as rural [59] . Given the varying definitions and diversity across rurality, a minimum RUCA code of \u22654.0 was used as inclusion criteria for recruitment of partner organizations [9] . In addition to meeting this criteria, the four participating communities were selected to represent varying degrees of rurality that were low-income, with large populations of African American, American Indian, Latino, or White, non-Hispanic residents. Each partnering community organization received a mini-grant of $6000 to implement four, three-hour Play Streets throughout the summer (June-September 2017) for a total of 16 Play Streets for the entire study. Community organizers could determine how, when, and where the Play Streets were implemented to best fit their community; however, they were required to focus on school-aged children, be open to the public at no cost, and spend at least $1000 of their grant on reusable materials or equipment such as hula hoops, frisbees, and balls. Considering community needs, each Play Street looked slightly different and most of them took place in open fields, school yards, and existing parks, as streets were not always feasible for the communities.

Next, each researcher coded half of two additional transcripts, one from a child focus group and one from an adult focus group. Researchers then reconciled differences in coding on these transcripts until consensus was reached for the coding frame. Next, each researcher was randomly assigned three transcripts to code (one of each type; implementation team, child, and adult). When coding of a transcript was complete, a second researcher was assigned to read the transcript and coding to check that the coding represented the meaning of the words and was in alignment with the coding frame. The two researchers then met to reconcile any differences. Since the concepts are interrelated, in some cases a piece of text could have been coded with more than one code as the meaning in the text described elements of two interrelated concepts or codes.

While Play Streets in this study were implemented with the goal of increasing safe opportunities for active play and PA for children, there were also health externalities in the form of social impacts. Creating enhanced community connection through Play Streets may be an avenue to reduce health disparities in rural communities while also building community resilience. Enhancing community connections creates opportunities for additional health benefits above and beyond those from PA, suggesting that PA and active play could be a multi-purposed vehicle to community-level health and wellbeing. It is important to note that while not included in the present study, these spaces need to be inclusive to help realize benefits related to social connections.",

Communities may consider including or \"coupling\" Play Streets with other health promotion initiatives or community services (e.g., health fairs, nutrition seminars, vaccination clinics, safety demonstrations), allowing the community to address multiple health objectives simultaneously while also addressing a potential barrier of transportation and access [15] . Given disparities facing rural populations, providing multiple health resources as part of a single community-event may be particularly effective and increase accessibility. This judicious approach also has potential reciprocal benefits for a community by increasing access to and opportunities for PA and active play when it is part of other community efforts and Play Streets also serving as a means to draw engagement with other community and health resources. It should be noted that existing community resources and organizations may influence the types of organizations and individuals most \"ready\" to successfully implement Play Streets and similar initiatives. Thus, implementers should pursue partnerships most appropriate for their specific communities. Play Streets can be initiated and implemented by a variety of partners and can include anyone seeking to promote health and/or foster relationships within their communities (e.g., advocates, community-based organizations, faith-based institutions, health departments, hospitals (including residents), libraries, neighborhood associations, policy makers, public servants, schools) [62] .",

These findings and evaluations out of Chicago and other urban areas suggest value in scheduling Play Streets that recur across multiple years and also recur multiple times within a year [11] [12] [13] . Important considerations for implementers include logistical challenges (e.g., location, date/time, activities, bathrooms), the human resources needed, identification of active play equipment and partners, marketing, and retaining free access to all families, and the potential of competing demands and/or loss of novelty across time. However, our findings suggest a strong potential for enhancing social connectedness characteristics from more regular implementation of Play Streets in rural communities. Because of the benefits of Play Streets, rural communities should consider how to sustain them. Local policies could be implemented to facilitate the approval process to close streets to traffic, when feasible, or that support joint/shared use of school and community facilities and places to locate Play Streets [71] .",

            "text": "While this study identifies multiple social connectedness benefits as health externalities of Play Streets, a few limitations need to be considered. Most notably, the interview and focus group guides for this study were designed to examine implementation and PA outcomes, without direct consideration of the social connectedness framework presented in this paper. Because of this we did not ask questions framed specifically for these concepts and coding was impacted, specifically considering the inter-connectedness of the codes which creates a challenge for discriminatory validity. However, the identification of these health externalities also provides strength to the study in that these conceptual themes emerged unprompted. Given the salience of these concepts in the current study, future researchers should consider a more direct, a priori examination of these concepts and how Play Streets and other community-based PA interventions can influence community connectedness. Additionally, considering the study design, there are possible limitations given the potential response bias, not knowing if participants' responses were due to the intervention itself or the perception of the intervention, and the lack of pre-intervention data for comparison. Certain limitations are also possible in focus group research (e.g., respondent fatigue, group dynamics), however we have sought to minimize such effects in the current study by employing best practices related to group size and number, homogeneity, and topical clarity [72, 73] . Additional research may examine dynamics of social connectedness in PA interventions using different methods (e.g., survey) to further develop understanding. Future research should also include additional rural communities. While the four communities included in this study represent multiple layers of diversity seen throughout rural America, they do not represent all rural communities.",

However, the health externalities seen through enhanced social opportunities provided throughout these communities were evident when speaking with adult and child participants as well as the implementation teams. Play Streets provided opportunities to create connections and strengthen existing ones, which in turn provided community members with far-reaching social benefits not limited to the health benefits of PA alone. Community-based PA interventions and programming (such as Play Streets) that enhance and capitalize on community connectedness are effective ways to reduce health disparities and improve the overall health and wellbeing of residents. While PA benefits are sufficient reason for community-based active play interventions like Play Streets in the short-term, the additional benefits of increasing community connectedness should be considered as an important vehicle toward improved health and wellbeing for rural communities.
