            "text": "Background Studies about support needs of young adult childhood cancer survivors (YACCS) previously focused mainly on information needs. This study assessed support needs and associated factors (sociodemographic, medical, and psychosocial functioning) in Dutch YACCS. Methods YACCS (aged 18-30, diagnosed \u2264 18 years, time since diagnosis \u2265 5 years) cross-sectionally filled out a questionnaire regarding their need for various types of support (concrete information, personal counseling, and peer contact) in eight domains (physical consequences of childhood cancer, social-emotional consequences, relationships and sexuality, fertility, lifestyle, school and work, future perspective, insurance and mortgage), and questionnaires assessing health-related quality of life (PedsQL-YA), anxiety and depression (HADS), and fatigue (CIS-20R). Descriptive statistics were used to describe support needs. Linear regression was used to identify characteristics associated with support needs. Results One hundred fifty-one YACCS participated (response = 40%). Most YACCS reported a need for support in one or more domains (88.0%, N = 133). More than half of the participants reported a need for concrete information in the domains lifestyle, fertility, and physical consequences of childhood cancer and 25-50% in the domains insurance and mortgages, future perspective, and social-emotional consequences of childhood cancer. In the domains lifestyle and physical as well as emotional consequences of childhood cancer, 25-50% reported a need for counseling. Overall need for support was positively associated with middle (\u03b2 = 0.26, p = 0.024) and high (\u03b2 = 0.35, p = 0.014) compared to low educational attainment and (sub)clinical anxiety (\u03b2 = 0.22, p = 0.017), and negatively associated with social functioning (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.37, p = 0.002) in multivariate analyses. Conclusion YACCS report the strongest need for support, for concrete information, in the domains lifestyle, fertility, and physical consequences of childhood cancer. Associated factors were mostly socioeconomic and psychosocial in nature. Psychosocial care should be an integral part of survivorship care for YACCS, with screening for psychosocial problems, information provision including associated emotional consequences and support if necessary (psycho-education) and tailored interventions, and adequate referrals to more specialized care if necessary.",

Due to childhood cancer treatment, many CCS experience late effects, (chronic) health problems that may manifest up until many years after the end of treatment [3, 4] . Besides physical late effects, CCS may experience psychosocial problems and impaired quality of life [5, 6] . Therefore, survivorship care aiming at both their physical and psychosocial health is crucial in keeping CCS as healthy as possible after treatment. Current standards of care recommend that survivorship care should contain routine screening and provision of psychosocial interventions in order to optimize early detection and treatment of psychosocial problems [7] . However, limited data is available about what CCS themselves report to need in terms of psychosocial support during survivorship care.",

Unmet information needs in CCS and AYA cancer survivors were found to be associated with psychosocial problems such as anxiety, depression, distress, and a lower quality of life [10, 11, 14] . Furthermore, unmet information needs can negatively impact survivorship care attendance [10, 12] .

Young adulthood is an important developmental stage with many challenges. This life phase is marked by the development of autonomy and identity [17] . The experience of childhood cancer and late effects was found to hinder YACCS' development in terms of achieved milestones regarding autonomy development, psycho-sexual development, and social development [18] . This delay in development may influence their quality of life [19] . Thus, young adulthood may be the prime time to empower YACCS to take control of their own health. In addition, various studies have shown that YACCS are vulnerable to psychosocial problems, such as reduced (health-related) quality of life and higher levels of distress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and fatigue [5, 6, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . One of our recent studies on Dutch YACCS showed that their psychosocial well-being is worse than that of Dutch peers, and that the impact of cancer played an important role in explaining psychosocial well-being [25] . Therefore, YACCS could benefit from psychosocial surveillance and support as a part of their survivorship care.",

More anxiety and poorer overall HRQOL were previously identified as predictors of more [11, 14] . Through examining the various subdomains of HRQOL to gain a deeper understanding of which parts of HRQOL would influence support needs, we identified social function as the most relevant subdomain of overall HRQOL for needs. No medical characteristics were associated with the overall support needs. We found different associated factors for support needs in specific domains. Support needs in certain domains (physical and social-emotional consequences of childhood cancer, relationships and sexuality, school and work, and future perspective) were mostly predicted by psychosocial factors, specifically lower social functioning and reporting (sub)clinical anxiety. Support needs in other domains (fertility, lifestyle and health after childhood cancer) were mostly predicted by sociodemographic characteristics such as female sex and higher educational attainment. The latter was not in line with previous studies. A study among survivors of AYA cancer found that those with lower educational attainment had more unmet needs [9] and a study of information needs in CCS found no effect of educational attainment [11] . The difference with earlier literature may be explained by the investigation of specific topics, like fertility and lifestyle and health after childhood cancer. While medical characteristics were not associated with needs in most domains in the present study, higher age at diagnosis and cancer recurrence were associated with need for support related to insurance and mortgages and relationships and sexuality.",

First of all, a need for support regarding fertility was strongly related to female sex and higher education, but not to any variables related to treatment that could cause infertility or any psychosocial variables. Need for support regarding sexuality, however, was significantly associated with lower social functioning and marginally associated with (sub)clinical anxiety. These results indicate that sexuality and fertility are subjects that are of interest to different subgroups of CCS and should both be discussed during survivorship care including the possibilities for support. Furthermore, looking at earlier literature about work and school performance of (YA)CCS [33, 34] , it seems surprising that the need for support in this domain in the current study was the lowest among all domains (29.8%). It could be the case that problems relating to work and school are only pronounced in a small subset of the YACCS in this study. For example, central nervous system (CNS) tumor survivors were previously reported to be at an increased risk to experience problems related to school and work [33, 34] .",

Currently, YACCS attendance of survivorship care is not optimal [8, 35] , while there is evidence to suggest that they are vulnerable on both the physical and psychosocial levels [3, 5, 6, 20, 23, 25] . The suboptimal attendance is worrisome, because survivorship care is crucial to keep CCS as healthy as possible. CCS not attending survivorship care in (young) adulthood may be a result of a suboptimal transition from pediatric to adult care [36] . Making psychosocial survivorship care more tailored to the needs of CCS at all life stages, and during the vulnerable phase of young adulthood in particular, could help improve attendance. Insight into the needs of YACCS who did not attend survivorship care would be helpful. Unfortunately, the present study could not provide this insight because attendance of survivorship care was not assessed. Knowing what YACCS need is a first step to tailoring psychosocial survivorship care to their needs. Monitoring using patient reported outcomes in clinical practice could be useful to assess unmet needs and to monitor HRQOL as an indication of needs for which psychosocial support can be offered [37, 38] .",

Having an accessible and age-appropriate information program could improve the participation of YACCS in their survivorship care [39, 40] . Looking at the results of the present study, information for YACCS should go beyond the physical consequences of childhood cancer and specific late effects, but also focus on emotional and social consequences. Besides providing information, health care providers should be encouraged to routinely discuss the possibilities for support, such as counseling, with YACCS in survivorship care [7] . YACCS in need of such psychosocial support have previously reported difficulties finding it [16] . Therefore, survivorship care centers should offer psychosocial support in addition to information provision directly to YACCS, or provide adequate referrals, usually to clinics in the network of care. To be of the best service to survivors, medical and psychosocial health care professionals need to work together multidisciplinary [16] . While doctors are responsible to provide patients with accurate medical information and advice, psychosocial care providers may help survivors attach a meaning to that information and cope with the impact this information has on them (e.g., counseling after news about infertility or a higher risk for subsequent tumors, or implementing lifestyle advice in daily life). YACCS could benefit from age-appropriate psychosocial interventions. Survivorship care clinics could specifically consider developing and offering interventions that can be delivered online, as the current events of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have forced us to consider more innovative ways to deliver psychosocial care away from hospitals or health care facilities. Online psychosocial care is especially compatible with survivorship care, because of the often low frequency of survivorship care clinic visits. Existing online interventions that could be used or adapted for YACCS include cognitive behavioral therapy-based group interventions such as Recapture Life-AYA and Op Koers Online [41, 42] .",
