            "text": "Background: Since 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged worldwide. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in a few patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Furthermore, according to recent findings, the virus has been detected in urine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same as that for the severe acute respiratory syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the possible cause of kidney damage and the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system. Methods: We used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and new independent kidney single-cell RNA sequencing data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expression in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. The Pearson correlation coefficients between ACE2 and all other genes were first generated. Then, genes with r values larger than 0.1 and P values smaller than 0.01 were deemed significant co-expression genes with ACE2. Results: Our results showed the enriched expression of ACE2 in all subtypes of proximal tubule (PT) cells of the kidney. ACE2 expression was found in 5.12%, 5.80%, and 14.38% of the proximal convoluted tubule cells, PT cells, and proximal straight tubule cells, respectively, in three published kidney cell atlas datasets. In addition, ACE2 expression was also confirmed in 12.05%, 6.80%, and 10.20% of cells of the proximal convoluted tubule, PT, and proximal straight tubule, respectively, in our own two healthy kidney samples. For the analysis of public data from three bladder samples, ACE2 expression was low but detectable in bladder epithelial cells. Only 0.25% and 1.28% of intermediate cells and umbrella cells, respectively, had ACE2 expression. Conclusion: This study has provided bioinformatics evidence of the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system.",

            "text": "In 2019, mysterious pneumonia cases emerged and rapidly spread across the globe. Deep sequencing analysis and etiological investigations then confirmed that the pathogen was a type of newly identified coronavirus that had been labeled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The rapid spread of 2019-nCoV has caused the outbreak of pneumonia worldwide, making it a severe threat to international public health security within a short period. [1] [2] [3] Based on bioinformatics analyses, it has been shown that the 2019-nCoV genome is 88% identical to two batderived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21), 79% identical to SARS-CoV, and 50% identical to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). [4] Protein structural analyses revealed that 2019-nCoV had a receptor-binding domain similar to that of SARS-CoV, directly binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. [5] [6] [7] [8] The most common symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection are fever and cough in most patients, with symptoms of chest discomfort, progressive dyspnea, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported in a small number of patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. The laboratory findings of 99 patients infected with 2019-nCoV showed that three patients (3%) had different degrees of increased serum creatinine. [9] In another clinical observation study, four (10%) of 41 patients, including two of 13 (15%) intensive care unit (ICU) patients and two of 28 (7%) non-ICU patients, showed elevated serum creatinine. [10] A total of 3.7% of patients died of renal failure as shown in an analysis of 88 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related deaths. [11] Additionally, the latest research confirmed that 27.06% (23/85) of patients exhibited acute renal failure, and severe acute tubular necrosis was observed by hematoxylineosin staining in six patients post-mortem. The 2019-nCoV antigen was detected in kidney tubules by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well. [12] Moreover, 2019-nCoV was detected in urine samples by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of a patient with a 2019-nCoV infection. [13, 14] However, why and how 2019-nCoV induces AKI in urine remains largely unknown. Also, whether 2019-nCoV can be transmitted through the urinary tract remains a largely unanswered question. As ACE2 plays an important role in 2019-nCoV infection, we aimed to identify the ACE2expressing cell composition and proportion in normal human kidneys and bladders by single-cell transcriptomes to explore the possible infection routes of 2019-nCoV and the roles of ACE2 in urinary tract system infection.",

The other nephron subtypes, such as collecting duct and distal tubule as well as immune cells, all showed extremely low gene expression. To validate this result, we further analyzed normal kidney samples from two healthy donors. The 4736 cells were classified into nine cell types, which highly overlapped with public data, including seven nephron-specific subtypes based on canonical marker genes [ Figure 2A ]. The PT (CUBN, SLC13A3, and SLC22A8) was classified into proximal convoluted tubule and proximal straight tubule based on different marker expression levels. [18, 20] Collecting duct principal cells (AQP2), collecting duct intercalated cells (ATP6V0D2), and glomerular parietal epithelial cells (KRT8 and KRT18) were also annotated, and these results are in line with the previous result. Furthermore, we identified a cluster of loops of Henle cells (UMOD, SLC12A1, and CLDN16), which was absent in the public dataset. Additionally, the stroma and immune cells, composed of a small number of endothelial cells (CD34 and PECAM1) and monocytes (CD14, FCN1, and VCAN), were found [ Figure 2B ].

The co-expressed genes were enriched in multiple membrane-related cellular components (CC) [ Figure 4B and 4E]. Notably, brush border and brush border membranes were significantly enriched CC terms, which aligns well with the cellular locations of ACE2 detected by immunohistochemical analysis. [21] The enriched KEGG terms included the normal functions of ACE2, such as the renin-angiotensin system, PT bicarbonate reclamation, mineral absorption, and multiple metabolism-related pathways [ Figure 4C and 4F]. The results confirmed that ACE2 and its related genes are essential to maintain the functionality of the kidney. [24] For the bladder dataset, the CC and KEGG enrichment results were generally consistent with those of kidneys, where membrane proteins and renal functions such as absorption and metabolism were involved [ Figure 5A and 5B]. We performed PPI analysis for ACE2 and its co-expressed genes in both the kidney and bladder, as shown in Figure 5C and 5D. Whether these interacting proteins are involved in the pathogenic changes of PT and umbrella cell infections is unclear and needs to be further investigated.",

While most of these patients exhibit respiratory symptoms, a wide range of non-respiratory symptoms have also been reported, demonstrating that other organs are affected during the disease. In the analysis of the clinical features of patients infected with 2019-nCoV, renal function damage has been confirmed, [9, 10] and continuous kidney substitution treatment was needed in approximately 9% of all 99 infected patients. [9] Gabarre et al [25] systematically reviewed AKI in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Besides, kidney injury and renal dysfunction have been observed in other coronaviruses associated with respiratory infections, especially two betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), [26] which are genetically similar to 2019-nCoV. [4, 8] A previous study reported that 36 (6.7%) of 536 patients with SARS developed AKI, and 33 of all 36 patients (91.7%) with renal dysfunction died. [27] Importantly, SARS-CoV fragments have been detected by polymerase chain reaction in urine specimens of some patients. [28] Furthermore, persistent SARS-CoV infection and replication have been observed in the kidney particularly in tubular epithelial cells in vitro, [29] indicating that kidney damage in patients with SARS could be due to direct viral infection in target cells except for other triggers, such as the host immune response, severe pneumonia, and ARDS. While very similar pathogenically to SARS-CoV, the detailed mechanism of renal involvement of 2019-nCoV remains unclear.",

[29, 30] scRNA-seq, a new approach that is increasingly used in the field of biology and medicine, can analyze cell types and expression genes at the cellular level. Based on our single-cell analysis in both normal kidneys (both the public and our data) and bladders, we found detectable levels of ACE2 in both the kidney and bladder. Similar to our data, Deng and coworkers [31] analyzed public kidney data and suggested that the kidney is at high risk of coronavirus infection. Moreover, in our data, we found that PT cells have higher expression percentages than bladder epithelial cells, which may indicate that the kidney is more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection than the bladder. Compared to the expression levels of ACE2 in the digestion system, [15] the lower expression of ACE2 in the urinary system could suggest fewer patients with renalrelated symptoms, which positively correlates with the observations for SARS patients. The co-expression and pathway analysis revealed critical functions of ACE2 in the urinary system, which may explain the dysfunction of the kidney caused by ACE2-binding viruses. Moreover, ACE2 expression in exterior cells (PT cells in renal tubules and umbrella cells in bladder epithelium) may also be one of the causes of the presence of viruses in the urine.",
