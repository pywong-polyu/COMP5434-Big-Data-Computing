However, the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic raises the question of whether society is going to continue down a path of increased awareness of sustainable consumption or whether the pandemic will move people to focus more on themselves. Based on data gathered before and near the end of the first pandemic lockdown in Germany in spring 2020, this research demonstrates that ecological, social, and voluntary simplicity consciousness deteriorated in the minds of sustainability-conscious consumers, with notable impacts on their willingness to spend sustainably and their shopping affinity. Furthermore, we identify segments that show particular vulnerability to the lockdown by reacting with a decrease in their ecological consumption consciousness. This study concludes with a discussion of the pandemic's implications for the spread of sustainable consumption styles and human well-being.",

The virus is associated with the acute respiratory syndrome disease COVID-19, which sometimes has a severe to fatal disease progression. The coronavirus pandemic has occurred on a global scale, has affected a large number of people, and has led to economic pressure and turbulence. As an event compromising the lives of numerous people, causing vast economic and social damage, and requiring coordinated government resources to manage, the coronavirus pandemic fulfills the characteristic of a natural disaster. However, a crisis of this type may also give rise to opportunities for change. From J. F. Kennedy comes the following quote:",

Sheth (2020) argues that consumption patterns can be greatly altered by disruptive changes in living conditions (consumption context) resulting from natural disasters. Prior research shows that emotional distress and possibly loss of possessions and jobs due to natural disasters can impact individuals' consumption behaviors and lifestyles (e.g., Forbes, 2017; Kennett-Hensel et al., 2012; Sneath & Lacey, 2009 ). Based on a literature review of past catastrophic events (including economic contractions, natural disasters, and terrorism), Zwanka and Buff (2020) conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic, like other natural disasters, is experienced by people as a life-threatening situation. People fear for their health and lives, and they worry about job and income losses. Therefore, according to Zwanka and Buff (2020) , the pandemic has the potential to trigger anxiety, stress and fear on a large scale. Initial empirical findings show that people in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic have adjusted their consumption behavior to these adverse conditions (Liu et al., 2021; Naeem, 2021; Profeta et al., 2021) .",

The indirect causal effects capture the impact of the pandemic on sustainable consumption, which manifests through changes in consumers' sustainable consumption consciousness (see Figure 1 ).

We uncovered previously unknown dampening effects of lifethreatening situations on sustainable consumer behavior for the coronavirus pandemic. The results suggest that during disaster experiences, the subjective importance of environmental and climate protection decreases for individuals. Analysis of consumer segments that are particularly vulnerable to a decline in their consciousness of sustainability because of the pandemic shows that, on average, consciousness of ecologically sustainable consumption is more volatile than consciousness of socially sustainable consumption and of voluntary simplicity. Our findings provide valuable insights to consumer policymakers who are attempting to counteract a pandemic-induced decline in sustainable consumption consciousness by instituting appropriate measures. Bearing in mind the need for wide-scale adoption of sustainable consumption patterns worldwide for the environment and climate (note the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12) as well as for the well-being of individuals and future generations (e.g., Balderjahn et al., 2020; Rich et al., 2017; Xiao & Li, 2011) , insights into the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainable consumer behavior are highly relevant.",

Usually, consumer behavior follows habitual routines that are rarely consciously reflected upon. However, if the living circumstances underlying these consumption habits change rapidly and drastically, behavioral adaptation processes are to be expected. Sheth (2020) notes that consumer behavior depends on the consumption context (e.g., technology availability), situation (e.g., supply situation), and living conditions (e.g., social relationships). These framing factors of consumption can underpin existing consumption habits, but they can also disrupt and change them.

However, only a few survey studies were published on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainable consumption behavior (e.g., Chae, 2021; Severo et al., 2021; Tchetchik et al., 2021) and experimental studies that can establish a causal link between the pandemic and changes in sustainable consumption patterns are lacking.

Considering the scenario of a \"window of opportunity\" for sustainable consumption, theoretical perspectives have suggested a positive effect of the coronavirus pandemic on sustainable consumption patterns (e.g., Cohen, 2020; Mathios et al., 2020; Tonne, 2020) . During the lockdown, people could use time they previously spent on consumption activities, work, and travel (commuting, business, and leisure) for (recreational) activities at home, with the family, and in nature. Sand\u00edn et al. (2020) show that people under confinement valued outdoor activities more than before. The rediscovery of nature, forests and lakes could increase consciousness of the protection of nature. Thus, people might have adapted to the pandemic by recognizing the benefits of a slower pace of life, and this realization may have enhanced their appreciation of nature and voluntary simplicity, that is, a frugal and modest way of living \"\u2026that is outwardly simple and inwardly rich\u2026\" (Elgin & Mitchell, 1977, p. 13) . The closure of stores, restaurants, and other service outlets through government-imposed lockdown severely limited personal consumption. Reducing consumption may have led some people to realize that they can also achieve well-being with less consumption. In this study, we relate general personal wellbeing (also called psychosocial well-being) to people's ability to lead a self-determined and meaningful life (Ryff, 1989 ) (different from the concept of happiness). People also may have had more opportunities to reflect on and draw conclusions about their consumption habits and the consequences for the environment and society, leading to more responsible consumption choices (He & Harris, 2020) . Moreover, the study by Sand\u00edn et al. (2020) revealed that during the pandemic, people learned to value personal relationships and time spent with the family more. Similarly, Baker et al. (2007 Baker et al. ( , 2015 showed that people affected by a natural disaster connect more intimately to their social communities and place less importance on material possessions. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, feelings of increased solidarity and the need to take responsibility for others (e.g., older people) may have broadened people's outlook to a greater interest in more sustainable lifestyles.",

            "text": "These arguments support the suggestion that people's CSC may have increased during the lockdown. However, there are also good arguments that suggest the opposite, namely, a negative effect of the pandemic on sustainable consumption. A rapidly increasing body of evidence reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic, like other disasters, has caused psychological distress in the form of anxiety, panic, and depression (see reviews by Kontoangelos et al., 2020; Salari et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) . In consequence, the pandemic may have resulted in increased focus on the self at the expense of ethical concerns, resulting in a \"time of turning away\" from sustainability consciousness. Some authors have proposed that consumer decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic has been driven largely by self-interest and emotions (He & Harris, 2020) , leading to panic buying and hoarding, for example (see, e.g., Naeem, 2021) . The pandemic has forced people to adjust their lives and consumption patterns in a variety of ways (see, e.g., Kirk & Rifkin, 2020) , tying their attention to the self and distracting them from environmental and climate change issues. In addition, the mass media have mainly reported on pandemic-specific topics, and sustainability issues have received little attention. \"Fridays for the Future\" demonstrations could no longer take place, and global warming disappeared almost completely from the media coverage. In this respect, the media virtually \"fueled\" the emergence and reinforcement of psychological stress, leaving little room to address sustainability issues. As noted above, people also needed to take responsibility for caring for others and protecting them against becoming infected. In this respect, moral licensing effects (e.g., Blanken et al., 2015) may also play a role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moral licensing is an unconscious mechanism in which acts of solidarity aimed at benefiting others are mentally \"accounted for\" as moral credits that entitle for acts that predominantly or exclusively benefit the acting individual. Through engaging in acts of solidarity during the pandemic, individuals may feel entitled to behave more selfishly in other areas of life (e.g., justifying a choice to consume less sustainably).",

Within the European Union (EU), per capita consumption decreased by 12.3% in the second quarter of 2020 (Eurostat, 2020) . This decline in consumption can be explained by the closure of stores during the lockdown, consumers' reluctance to buy due to fears of infection (see Goolsbee & Syverson, 2021) , and economic fears resulting from a drastic decline in economic output and rising unemployment. Although in Germany, the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were mitigated by substantial government transfers such as shortterm work compensation, economic output declined by 5%, and the unemployment rate increased by $1% in 2020 (Duell & Vetter, 2020; Federal Statistical Office of Germany, 2021) .",

            "text": "In a review summarizing 10 publications on the role of consumption in recovering from a natural disaster, Daniel (2018) concludes that consumption helps reinstate the consumer's sense of control and facilitates reconstruction of the consumer's crisis-ridden identity. People affected by a natural disaster look for ways to cope with psychological distress and with the personal losses associated with the devastating event (Mathur et al., 2006) . During a disaster, people often feel that they are losing control of their lives. In such situations, consumption can actually serve the function of helping to cope with the emotional stress caused by disasters . It has been shown that lost control can be reinstated through the consumption of utilitarian goods (e.g., clothes, towels; see Forbes, 2017) . A natural disaster is a transformative event. During such transition stages, consumer vulnerability may increase, that is, a state of powerlessness connected to the consumption of marketing messages and products (e.g., Baker, 2009; Baker et al., 2005) . Shopping can boost feelings of joy and pleasure (H\u00fcttel et al., 2018) ; hence, consumers might indulge in impulse purchasing (i.e., unplanned, emotional, and reactive purchasing) to alleviate personal distress and depression and to compensate for unmet personal needs (Beatty & Ferrell, 1998; Kim & Derek, 2012; Rucker & Galinsky, 2008) . During the COVID-19 pandemic, people may also enjoy trying out previously unused services, such as home delivery and online purchasing (Pantano et al., 2020) . Moreover, for many people, possession of material goods is part of their personal self-perception and identity (e.g., Belk, 1988) . Against this background, people appear to increasingly consume more hedonically oriented and pleasure-generating products that provide symbolic benefits (e.g., signaling social status) during and after catastrophic events (Forbes, 2017; Kennett-Hensel et al., 2012 ). An increasing desire to shop can be explained by not only people's desire to leave the COVID-19 crisis behind, but also the objective restrictions on shopping behavior during the lockdown. According to the theory of psychological reactance, people react against restrictions on their behavioral freedom by on the one hand, preferring the restricted behavior more strongly and on the other hand, seeking ways to circumvent these restrictions (Brehm, 1966) . In terms of lockdown, this reaction means that the desire to be able to shop again is becoming stronger. Therefore, our third hypothesis is as follows:",

Since the concept of sustainability encompasses an ecological (planet), a social (people) and an economic (prosperity) dimension, in this study, we use the CSC concept proposed by Balderjahn et al. (2013) , which distinguishes between these three sustainability dimensions. Balderjahn et al. (2013) define CSC as the intention to consume in a way that improves the environmental, social and economic aspects of quality of life. The ecological dimension of the CSC model captures the awareness of purchasing products that are manufactured, packaged, or disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner, while the social dimension addresses the treatment of workers during the manufacturing process (e.g., respect for human rights, lack of discrimination). It has been shown that consciousness of ecologically and socially sustainable consumption has a positive impact on the purchase of green and fair-trade products (e.g., Balderjahn & H\u00fcttel, 2019) . In this respect, it can be expected that consciousness of ecologically and socially sustainable consumption will have a positive (negative) effect on the willingness to spend money for sustainable (unsustainable) purposes.",

According to Iyer and Muncy (2009) , voluntary simplicity constitutes one form of anti-consumption. Researchers have emphasized that reduced overall consumption levels are essential to meet global sustainability goals (e.g., Hobson, 2013; Lorek & Fuchs, 2013) . Voluntary simplifiers are people who distance themselves from materialism and product ownership and, out of a sense of self-determination, limit their consumption to what is necessary (Balderjahn et al., 2021; McDonald et al., 2006) . They consciously buy only products that they truly need and those that best meet their needs. In addition, they strive for a meaningful life and do not perceive product renunciation as a sacrifice but rather as a gain (Etzioni, 1998; Seegebarth et al., 2016) . We thus presume that voluntary simplicity consciousness exerts a negative influence on both the willingness to spend-whether sustainable or not-and consumers' affinity for shopping. Since we assume a negative, mitigating direct effect of the pandemic on the consciousness of voluntary simplicity (H1), the pandemic will have a positive, reinforcing indirect effect on the willingness to spend money and shopping affinity.

While for some people the lockdown period might have provided more peace and relaxation, a broader share of the population has suffered psychological distress (Salari et al., 2020) and economic vulnerability. There are some indications that women, older people and workers with fewer skills and lower education levels are more likely to be affected by the negative psychological and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (Forte et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) . Moreover, Dang and Nguyen (2020) found that women are more likely than men to lose their jobs during the pandemic and that women's labor income also declines more significantly. However, it remains unclear how these findings might translate into changing sustainable consumption consciousness and consumption behaviors. Due to the novelty of the pandemic, no scientific studies that address this question are currently available. Consequently, we take an explorative approach in our analysis by asking the following research question:",

(2013) to assess respondents' consciousness of ecologically and socially sustainable consumption as well as their consciousness of voluntary simplicity. While both ecological and social consciousness focus on product manufacturing, voluntary simplicity captures respondents' disposition to buy only products that they consider necessary. All three dimensions of the CSC concept are measured using three items (see Table A1 ). As indicators of willingness to spend sustainably, we focused on a range of sustainable and non-sustainable consumption options (e.g., rail travel vs. air travel). We measured respondents' willingness to spend by asking, \"Imagine you saved \u20ac100 in the last heating period through your economical use of energy. How likely would you be to spend the money on the following?\" and providing six consumption options covering four broad consumption domains (travel, food, electronics, and donations).",

According to the classification of Rogers (2003) , following the adoption of an innovation, 2.5% of a population can be classified as innovators, and 13.5% can be classified as early adopters. Based on the market share of organically produced foods, the number of people who currently maintain sustainable consumption styles in Germany is consistent with this classification (German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, 2020). For innovations to spread, opinion leaders, that is, experts on the topic that make these practices observable to others in everyday life, are needed (Bandura, 1977; Rogers, 2003) . Against this background, we selected a sample of people with high affinity for sustainability. In our view, people of this type play a decisive role in the diffusion of sustainable consumption styles, and the extent and strength of their beliefs can serve as (early) indicators of the speed at which sustainable consumption is spreading in society. The sampling approach thus allows us to assess whether the coronavirus pandemic will promote or slow the progressive penetration of sustainable consumption styles in Germany in the near future.",

Through its economic power, Germany accounts for a large share of the world's consumption of natural resources. Thus, Germany is well suited for an analysis of sustainable consumption styles. Of the OECD countries, Germany had the third highest greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 (OECD, 2019). Overall, this indicates that there is high potential for better protection of natural resources and the climate in Germany, and a significant part of this potential can be achieved by increasing the diffusion of sustainable consumption styles. Table 1 shows the socioeconomic characteristics of the samples. Most respondents were female ($84%, waves I and II), and almost half of them had university degrees. Compared to the German average, the respondents are more highly educated, earn above-average incomes and live in larger households. The mean age of the respondents in the sample, 44-45 years, is close to that of the general German population. The respondents in wave II were slightly younger than those in the first wave. This demographic structure (more formal education and higher socioeconomic status) corresponds to that of opinion leaders (Rogers, 2003) .

The total indirect effects of the lockdown on the willingness to spend options via all three CSC dimensions are strongest for climate donation (\u00df = \u00c00.035, p < 0.001) and smartphone purchase (\u00df = 0.028, p < 0.001) and weakest for traveling by train (\u00df = \u00c00.012, p < 0.001) (see Table 2 ). In contrast to the total indirect effects (sum of the three individual effects of consciousness of ecologically and socially sustainable consumption and of voluntary simplicity), the results for the single indirect effects are mixed. Through the pandemic's weakening of consumers' consciousness of ecologically sustainable consumption, their willingness to spend money on the sustainable (unsustainable) consumption options significantly decreases (increases) (\u00df TRAIN = \u00c00.010, p < 0.01; \u00df PLANE = 0.013, p < 0.01; \u00df SMARTPHONE = 0.008, p < 0.05; \u00df VEGAN RESTAU-RANT = \u00c00.020, p < 0.001; \u00df STEAKHOUSE = 0.013, p < 0.001; \u00df CLIMATE DONATION = \u00c00.030, p < 0.001). Attenuated consciousness of socially sustainable consumption by the pandemic significantly weakens consumers' willingness to spend money on sustainable consumption options (\u00df TRAIN = \u00c00.004, p < 0.05; \u00df VEGAN RESTAURANT = \u00c00.005, p < 0.05; \u00df CLIMATE DONATION = \u00c00.008, p < 0.01), but has no significant impact on the unsustainable options. Thus, H4a is fully confirmed for consciousness of ecologically sustainable consumption but only partially confirmed for consciousness of socially sustainable consumption. The attenuated consciousness of voluntary simplicity because of the pandemic lockdown leads to a significant increase in shopping affinity (\u00df = 0.062, p < 0.001), willingness to spend money on smartphones (\u00df = 0.020, p < 0.001), traveling by plane (\u00df = 0.010, p < 0.001), and visiting vegan restaurants (\u00df = 0.010, p < 0.001). However, contrary to H4b, the indirect effects on traveling by train, visiting a steakhouse, and making a climate donation are nonsignificant (H4b is only partially confirmed, see Table 2 ). In summary, while the analysis fully confirms H1 and H3, we find only partial support for H2, H4a, and H4b. However, most of the sub-hypotheses are confirmed (see Table 3 for an overview).",

In this way, we could analyze the moderating effects of the pandemic on the relationships between the demographic variables and CSC. Before conducting the analysis, we assessed measurement invariance between the two samples (wave I and wave II) to rule out the possibility that different meanings were attributed to the measurements by the respondents in the two data collections. Based on the guidelines of Chen (2007) and Cheung and Rensvold (2002) , a multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis revealed that scalar measurement invariance held between the two study waves' constructs (see Table A3 for the measurement models' fit indices and their comparative changes). Consequently, when estimating the structural equation multiple-group model, we constrained the factor loadings and the intercepts to equality across both samples. The resulting model showed good fit (\u03c7 2 /df = 758.556/276, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.031; CFI = 0.978; TLI = 0.959; and SRMR = 0.032).

In particular, the role of gender in the respondents' consciousness of ecologically sustainable consumption changed with the advent of the COVID-19 crisis. While in wave I, the consciousness of ecologically sustainable consumption did not differ significantly between the genders, in wave II, consciousness of ecologically sustainable consumption weakened significantly among men. Similarly, in wave II, education level has a greater effect on amplifying consciousness of ecologically sustainable consumption, although it has no significant influence in wave I. In addition, by the time of wave II, the coronavirus pandemic had neutralized the significant negative impact that income levels had on the consciousness of environmentally sustainable consumption in wave I (see Table 4 ). Put simply, compared to wave I, the consciousness of environmentally friendly consumption significantly weakened in wave II after the lockdown, especially among men, people with lower levels of education, and low-income earners.",

The findings of our study concerning the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on consumer behavior are consistent with observations of behavioral adjustments during natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods, or tsunamis). While people affected by disasters react on the one hand with restrained consumption (because of economic constraints and uncertainty) (Kennett-Hensel et al., 2012) , on the other hand, their desire to be able to consume \"normally\" again increases, as does the tendency to make impulsive purchases . Changes in consumer behavior emerge because of individuals' adjustments to the personally experienced adverse impacts of the disaster. Nishio et al. (2014) observed that after the Tohoku earthquake in Japan, the importance of environmental values had decreased among people. The present study draws a similar but much more precise conclusion: It found that sustainable consumption and sustainable consumption consciousness have declined in many facets (ecological, social and voluntary simplicity) because of the pandemic. Our study is one of the first studies to highlight and provide evidence that behavioral adjustments during the coronavirus pandemic can be explained with the large body of scientific knowledge on the effects of natural disasters on humans.",

The results show how susceptible to change sustainability consciousness is when people are facing life-threatening disasters such as the coronavirus pandemic. The particularly strong decrease in consciousness of voluntary simplicity is remarkable. The results of this study suggest that for people under lockdown, the desire to consume (more) to counteract the many constraints of the pandemic and to compensate for unmet needs is increasing. To summarize, as we hypothesized, possible positive effects of the pandemic, such as reducing work intensity and allowing people to rediscover nature and to spend more time with family, appear to be masked or suppressed by the adverse effects of the pandemic, such as psychological distress and fear of severe COVID-19 disease. Behavioral adjustments to the pandemic situation appear to draw consumers' attention away from the harm that unsustainable consumption causes to the environment, the climate, and future generations. The question that emerges is whether the sustainability consciousness of consumers (CSC) will recover to pre-pandemic levels after the pandemic or whether the loss of CSC will persist, at least in the medium term.",

As a response to the lockdown, the desire to be able to consume carefree again can be explained as a mental strategy of coping with stress , as an attempt to regain control over one's own life (Daniel, 2018) , and as a reaction to the shopping bans. Moreover, consumption might be an attempt to compensate for unmet needs (see Beatty & Ferrell, 1998; Kim & Derek, 2012) such as the lack of contact with friends during the pandemic. Overall, many consumers probably have a hidden need to lead a \"normal life\" again, to make their own decisions, and to regain the sense of pleasure and identity that led to the increase in shopping affinity.

Through a positive relationship between consumers' CSC and sustainable spending, weakened sustainable consumption consciousness because of the pandemic lockdown also has an indirect negative impact on the willingness to spend money for sustainable purposes.

The weakening of the consciousness of voluntary simplicity during the pandemic leads to an increase in the willingness to travel by plane, to buy a smartphone, and to go to a vegan restaurant. The indirect effects on the other consumption options are not significant. Regarding the options \"air travel\" and \"purchase of a smartphone,\" this finding can be explained by the characterization of voluntary simplifiers as a sustainable consumer group (e.g., Peyer et al., 2017; Seegebarth et al., 2016) . Against this background, the significant decrease in the consciousness of voluntary simplicity triggered by the first pandemic lockdown tends to lead to more consumption of these unsustainable consumption options than of the sustainable options (travel by train and climate donation). Finally, the indirect positive effect of the pandemic via consciousness of voluntary simplicity on shopping affinity is nearly as high as the direct effect of the pandemic in this case. This result shows that the increased desire to go shopping results to a considerable degree from a shift in consumers' consciousness toward embracing more consumption-oriented lifestyles. Compared to the other two consciousness dimensions of the CSC concept, the consciousness of voluntary simplicity exerts the strongest influence on shopping affinity.",

There are some indications that people with a lower socioeconomic status are at increased risk of suffering from the psychological effects of the pandemic (e.g., Rodr\u00edguez-Rey et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) . Against this background, it is conceivable that this group of consumers places an increased focus on personal adaptation to the threats of the pandemic at the expense of consciousness of ecologically sustainable consumption. Moreover, this segment of the population might forego more expensive green products as a reaction to increased financial pressures and economic insecurities resulting from the pandemic. Changes in the demographic influences on CSC between the two survey waves were found only for consciousness of ecologically sustainable consumption, not for consciousness of socially sustainable consumption or of voluntary simplicity.",

Overall, the findings of this study indicate that the pandemic is not a favorable time for sustainable consumption. It is a time when people have turned away from their intention to consume sustainably. Even though the willingness to consume has decreased during the pandemic, the increase in shopping affinity during the lockdown may result in a jump in private consumption after the lockdown. The psychological stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic and people's need to cope with the lockdown seem to dwarf concerns about the planet. Given the need for a shift toward greater sustainability (e.g., Assadourian, 2010) and the positive effect of sustainable consumption on not only nature but also personal and societal well-being (McGregor, 2014) , the results of this study are alarming. Since our study involved sustainability-conscious people who are accelerators of sustainable consumption in their personal social networks, it can be inferred that the pandemic will slow the spread of sustainable consumption styles. Against this background, the coronavirus pandemic might pose a risk to not only people's health and mental well-being but also the environment and climate as well social sustainability.",

This change means, however, that in the long run, through an ongoing exploitation of nature by pursuing economic progress, quality of life and well-being are at risk. In this respect, it seems appropriate to take measures during a pandemic that counteract personal anxiety, fears and stress and convey confidence, including giving people freedom and restricting them as little as possible. Only if people can retain or quickly regain control over their own lives will they be more open to social and ecological challenges and be more willing to consume sustainably. However, legislation passed by the German government to reduce the number of coronavirus infections severely restricted people's behavior during the lockdown, and complementary measures to reduce psychological distress were missing. The negative consequences of this policy for sustainable consumption are highlighted in this study. Thus, the (severe) psychological consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown should not be overlooked. In the post-pandemic period, the government's primary focus should be supporting and improving the well-being in particular of those populations who suffered most from the lockdown. This focus would support not only the well-being of the people who suffered greatly from the lockdown but also the preservation of our planet.",

Such social marketing campaigns during the coronavirus pandemic must not stoke fears by highlighting the risk of infection and illness, but rather highlight rewarding ways to cope with the pandemic (e.g., promote mindfulness, empowerment, and self-efficacy) while evoking positive feelings (e.g., hope and humor) as well as empathy for living in a healthy natural environment. In practice, fear appeals have both weaker and unintended deleterious effects (Hastings et al., 2004; Lewis et al., 2007) . Specifically, fear appeals may elicit maladaptive responses (e.g., ignoring the message, denying the danger to oneself, and developing counterarguments) that serve not to combat the danger addressed but to cope with the negative feelings evoked by the fear message. In summary, social marketing campaigns during the coronavirus pandemic should not address fear and anxiety but convey positive emotions to individuals of the possibility of a beneficial and livable future by preserving nature and the climate.",

For future pandemic-related research, it is important to include the entire population in a representative manner. Since the coronavirus pandemic is a global phenomenon, studies on the consequences of the pandemic on sustainable consumption should be carried out in as many countries as possible. This range would make it feasible, on the one hand, to compare different measures taken by governments to combat virus infections in the respective countries with regard to their effect on sustainable consumption consciousness. On the other hand, differences in the reactions and behavioral adjustments of people in different cultures could be observed. Due to the brief period of time that elapsed between the second survey (wave II) and the end of the lockdown in Germany, the time-lagged, medium-to long-term effects of the coronavirus pandemic on sustainability orientation are beyond the scope of this study.

Nevertheless, the pandemic and the lockdown are representative of a multitude of mechanisms that affected people during this time, but which we were unable to uncover here with regard to sustainable consumption consciousness. Therefore, future research should identify the causes and background through which the pandemic attenuates CSC. To capture consumer behavior as well, this study operationalized the intention to consume sustainably by asking about the willingness to spend money on certain sustainable and unsustainable options. This analysis was supplemented by measuring the preference to return to pre-pandemic levels of consumption (shopping affinity). These analyses and results were informative and can serve as guidance for government policies to restore and promote sustainable consumption styles undermined by the coronavirus pandemic. However, with these sets of questions, we have captured only a selection of sustainable consumption options and were unable to analyze actual expenditures or purchases. However, since the lockdown restricts consumption and thus consumer spending through closed stores, it will be difficult to take actual purchasing behavior into account. Future research should seek solutions to this issue. ",
