It is a gradually progressive disease that affects close to one million people living in the United States and more than 10 million people globally, according to statistics published by the Parkinson's Foundation [1] . This same source estimated that 60,000 new cases of PD are diagnosed annually in the United States alone. For individuals with Parkinson disease (IWPD), in addition to the cardinal motor symptoms (i.e., bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor) that arise from dopaminergic depletion in the substantia nigra pars compacta [2] , non-motor features such as cognitive deficits, psychiatric disturbance, and autonomic dysfunction are well recognized symptoms. Some of these non-motor disorders have been known to even predate the appearance of motor signs by more than a decade before a PD diagnosis can be established clinically [3] . Collectively, these motor and non-motor symptoms contribute to declined function and quality of life (QoL) [4] .",

With disease progression, Lewy pathology can become widespread, which is associated with cognitive impairment, leading to the possibility that as many as approximately 80% of IWPD in the advanced disease stage developing dementia [7, 8] . Approximately one in four IWPD without dementia has mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-the earliest stage of cognitive dysfunction [9, 10] . Cognitive impairment is known to affect an array of executive and non-executive (e.g., attention, information processing speed, visuospatial ability, working memory) functions in PD [11, 12] . Thus, dual-task performance (essential for activities of daily living (ADL) such as walking while holding a conversation) is especially problematic when the neural correlates that are implicated in central executive function and attentional capacity are affected by PD, leading to cognitive impairment and reduced motor automaticity [13] .",

However, side effects such as dyskinesia, pulmonary valve fibrosis, and depression have been associated with the use of these therapeutics, and the efficacies of the treatments have been shown to diminish over time [14] . Even though an effective pharmacological treatment for cognitive impairment in IWPD has yet to be available [15] , evidence-based, albeit limited, therapeutic benefits of challenging the impaired cognitive systems have been found [16] . As such, dual-task training (DTT) composed of physical and cognitive training elements can play an important role in the neurorehabilitation of IWPD in terms of improving their motor and cognitive function as well as their overall QoL [17, 18] . In the majority of previous studies, DTT protocols were designed as the simultaneous use of a single physical task with a single verbal cognitive task [19] . A DTT program, composed of a compendium of functional and cognitive tasks targeting a wide range of motor and cognitive functions while continually being adapted to individual training needs over the entire intervention duration, has not yet been studied.",

            "text": "More recently, game-based interventions have been gaining increasing attention in their use of motivation and engagement to enhance rehabilitation outcomes in clinical populations. These benefits of gamification applications are primarily realized through the facilitation of rewarding experiences via the deployment of multisensory stimulation, interactivity, and fun gameplay during the rehabilitation process [20] . Consequently, the therapeutic gains of rehabilitation can be potentiated by promoting greater investment of effort into training participation, especially training involving functional tasks that are highly repetitive in nature and that can easily become boring and discouraging for patients. Patients who experience enhanced motivation and who are highly engaged during training are also more likely to adhere to the training protocol and stay committed to the training program until completion, thereby reducing dropout rates [21] . Specific to the PD population, the use of game technology developed for recreational purposes (e.g., Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii) in implementing exergaming paradigms has mostly resulted in improvements in motor and cognitive outcomes, and were no worse than conventional or traditional rehabilitation [22] . Gamified technology has also been specifically developed for training purposes that aim to target specific motor and/or cognitive functional domains. However, to date, its integrated use as a rehabilitation tool in delivering DTT in PD neurorehabilitation is largely absent or limited in its technical adaptability for accommodating the different training needs of individual recipients in real-time [23] . The SMARTfit \u00ae line of products is one such gamified training platform developed for multifunctional motor and cognitive training while also incorporating interaction technology with versatile configuration, but its utility for rehabilitation has yet to be tested in any clinical population (www.smartfit.rocks accessed on 1 October 2021).",

Primarily, the efficacy of physical-cognitive DTT was examined by comparing its effects to those of physical single-task training (STT) on changes in motor and cognitive outcomes. Due to a reported association between perceived disability and QoL, we assessed perceived disability (measured by Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living [MDS-UPDRS II]) as a proxy measurement of QoL [24] . The second objective was to study the feasibility and safety of physical therapists' implementation of an adaptive, gamified DTT paradigm using the SMARTfit \u00ae Trainer system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize technology in an adaptive manner for the integration of motor and cognitive interactions to address the personalized training needs of IWPD.",

Based on a simple randomization method whereby consecutive participants were alternately assigned to one of the two orders, five participants received the DTT-STT order while four were given the STT-DTT order (see Table 1 for sequence details). For each training condition, the participants completed two to three training sessions per week over an average of 8.8 weeks. For each training condition, each participant received a summed amount of training hours that is equivalent to 24 one-hour sessions. To minimize carryover effects from the first training condition, the participants underwent a washout period averaging 11.5 weeks before starting the second training condition. A physical therapist provided one-to-one instructional supervision during every session of the two training conditions. The STT condition consisted of task-oriented trainings involving the practice of six real-life functional tasks (such as sit-to-stand and gait; see Table A1 with table format and vision parameters modified from King and Horak [2009] ) [30] . For each functional task, three levels were set in five parameters (amplitude, endurance, balance, vision, and accuracy), allowing the task difficulty to be adjusted and to progress over time. Each task was practiced with quality of movement as an essential element. In contrast, the DTT condition integrated the abovementioned functional tasks with a variety of gamified cognitive tasks themed on executive function, attention, information processing speed, working memory, visuospatial ability, and language processing (see Table A2 ). During the DTT sessions, the SMARTfit \u00ae Single (www.smartfit.rocks/products/smartfit-single accessed on 1 October 2021) and SMARTfit \u00ae Strike Pods (www.smartfit.rocks/products/ smartfit-strike-targets accessed on 1 October 2021) were used in tandem to facilitate visuo-tactile interaction between participants and equipment during task execution. The cognitive tasks that were performed simultaneously with these functional tasks were selectable by the physical therapist from an inventory of 16 items available in the SMARTfit \u00ae Single system application. The games were customizable in terms of level of task difficulty (e.g., temporal demands, presence or absence of distractor stimuli, required level of tactile force output), duration of play, appearance (e.g., types of icon or symbol, display colors), and availability of auditory feedback. These customizable features allowed the adjustment of the degree of challenge and provided choice for supporting the autonomy of the participants. Due to the nature of the intervention involving the use of the SMARTfit\u00aeequipment in the DTT condition and not in the STT condition, the physical therapists and investigators were not blinded to the training conditions.",

These training requirements were assessed by one of four physical therapists (i.e., YC, DB, LS, and NG) who were assigned on a rotational basis to supervise each session. The participants were also allowed to exercise autonomy in choosing the order that they would like to receive the three pairs of functional tasks (see Table A3 for detailed descriptions of these six tasks and their difficulty levels) [34] . Specifically, at the beginning of each round of three consecutive sessions they were asked to select one of the three pairs of functional tasks (e.g., Pair 1) to use for the current session as well as to decide on the order for the remaining two pairs of functional tasks to be used for the next two sessions (e.g., Pair 3 followed by Pair 2). In addition, the cognitive tasks to be used in the DTT condition were selected by the physical therapist with the consensus of the participants being sought in real-time. That is, when a participant preferred one cognitive task (e.g., arithmetic multiplication) to another one (e.g., arithmetic subtraction) that had been suggested by the physical therapist, the choice of the participant would be used. At each participant's discretion, they could also rest at any time (unless otherwise stipulated for the endurance parameter of two functional tasks: multi-plane locomotion and gait) and for any duration during each session.",

Participants were required to wear an optical heart rate sensor on their forearm throughout the duration of each training session (Polar OH1, Polar Electro, Inc., New York, NY, USA). The DTT program feasibility criterion was determined by a minimum total duration of 24 h of attendance and a minimum session-average exercise intensity at the moderate level across participants. Adverse events, if any, were also monitored and recorded throughout the course of the study. Three outcome domains (i.e., motor function, cognitive function, and perceived disability) were measured before (i.e., pre-test at T0 and T2) and after (i.e., post-test at T1 and T3) each training condition using the following five instruments: The participants were instructed to maintain their dopaminergic medication regimen as directed by their neurologists, and all training and assessment sessions were conducted during the \"ON\" state (within a period of four hours after medication).",

Although gamified DTT was found to be as efficacious as STT across all participants, actual score improvements (as indicated by 84% CIs of normalized changes in score not including the null value) were achieved in more outcome measures after gamified DTT (i.e., in MDS-UPDRS III, M-PPT, TMT B/A ratio, and MDS-UPDRS II) compared to after STT (i.e., in M-PPT and TMT B/A ratio). Broadly and across all three outcome domains (i.e., motor function, cognitive function, and perceived disability), five participants (P1, P2, P3, P5, and P7) were able to show improvements in their motor and cognitive function as well as in their perceived disability after undergoing gamified DTT compared to two participants (P1 and P7) who achieved improvement in all of these three outcome domains after receiving STT.

The lack of significant difference between training conditions may be attributed to the high inherent challenge in the STT. The STT in this study consisted of six real-life functional tasks that IWPD commonly experience difficulty in [47, 48] . In addition, IWPD have been reported to demonstrate impaired automatic movement and to compensate by using explicit cognitive strategies when carrying out daily activities [49] . Thus, the STT in this study may already be cognitively demanding to IWPD. The presumed inherent challenge of STT is supported by the observed improvements in motor (frailty as measured by M-PPT) and cognitive (set shifting as measured by TMT B/A ratio) function induced by STT, as indicated by the findings that the 84% CIs for the changes in both measurements following STT were above zero. Thus, integrating cognitive training via the SMARTfit \u00ae Trainer system to an already cognitively taxing physical training may not provide as much benefit as originally expected. Additionally, of note, both of the gamified DTT and STT protocols used the same set of functional tasks, which were specially designed to not only be task-specific, but to also allow variation in terms of three difficulty levels across five parameters (i.e., amplitude, endurance, balance, vision, and accuracy). This implies that the training outcomes of the gamified DTT were compared with those of a high standard of training intervention (in the form of the STT) rather than traditional, usual-care physical rehabilitation.",

The 84% CI for improvements in MDS-UPDRS III following gamified DTT did not overlap with zero, but such an improvement was not observed after STT. In addition, more participants achieved a MDC/MCID in their MDS-UPDRS III scores after gamified DTT than they did after STT (DTT MDC :STT MDC = 4:2). This finding suggests that gamified DTT may provide an additional benefit in mitigating motor symptoms and modulating disease progression. The additional benefit of gamified DTT that was observed on motor function rather than on cognitive function is an interesting finding. Previous studies showed that compared to STT, DTT can promote automatic movement and reduce the interference of a secondary task on the primary motor task performance in IWPD [50, 51] . Having the participant's attention be devoted to a cognitive task during physical training may prohibit the use of compensatory cognitive strategies and may render the IWPD more reliant on the striatal motor pathway in movement execution, which may promote the restitution of the impaired striatal motor pathway [52, 53] . These findings may reveal the potential importance of adding cognitive challenge into physical rehabilitation in IWPD who are in the mild to moderate disease stage.",

Defining participants who improved more than the MDC and/or MCID values in at least one of the five outcome measures for either gamified DTT or STT as treatment responders for gamified DTT or STT, respectively, three categories of treatment responses can be discerned from these clinically relevant findings: (DS) two participants (P1 and P7) responded positively to both gamified DTT and STT, (D) three participants (P2, P3, and P6) seemed to respond well exclusively to gamified DTT, and (S) a favorable treatment response exclusive to STT seemed apparent for one participant (P5).

Comparing the demographic and clinical characteristics of the three participants who responded most positively to only DTT (i.e., who belonged to the D treatment response category) with those of the one participant who responded the most positively to only STT (i.e., who belonged to the S treatment response category), the only clear distinction between these two categories is the former having faller status (D category) and the latter having non-faller status (S category). This comparative result may be indicative of faller status (defined as having had at least one fall event in a period of six months prior to study participation) as a potential viable classifier criterion for identifying a unique subgroup of IWPD who would benefit the most from gamified physical-cognitive rehabilitation relative to physical rehabilitation alone. Three participants (P2, P3, and P6) in the current cohort fit this fall history profile and indeed, they each improved in three outcome measures (two of which surpassed the MDC and/or MCID values for P2 and P6; one for P3) across at least two outcome domains (P2 and P3: motor, cognitive, and perceived disability; P6: motor and cognitive) after gamified DTT. In comparison, they responded less to STT, with two (P2 and P6) of them having each made improvements in only two outcome measures (all of which did not reach the MDC and/or MCID values) across at least one outcome domain (P2: cognitive; P6: motor and cognitive) and one (P3) of them having made no improvement in any of the five outcome measures. Importantly, the motor improvement for all these three participants (P2: 8 points; P3: 12 points; P6: 7 points) exceeded the MDC and MCID values (of 5 and 2.5 points, respectively) for MDS-UPDRS III-the gold standard established for assessing motor function in the PD populationupon the completion of gamified DTT, but not after STT. This finding indicating that IWPD with faller status respond more positively to therapeutic treatment involving gamified DTT may highlight the greater need for this subgroup of IWPD to receive training focused on improving their capacity for dual task performance. As indicated by the results of Heinzel et al.'s study showing a relationship between dual-tasking effects and fall risk for people with PD, higher deficiency in dual task performance in terms of walking 20 m in a straight line while checking boxes printed on paper (attached to a handheld clipboard) predicted a higher probability of future falls [54] . As a sidenote to the observations of the current study, the three participants in the D treatment response category received gamified DTT before STT, whereas the one participant in the S treatment response category underwent STT before gamified DTT (see Appendix B for details). Although the order of the two training conditions was randomly assigned to these four participants so as to achieve counterbalancing across all nine of the enrolled participants, the effect that the order of the training conditions might have on training effects could not be determined in the current study due to a statistical power limitation.",

A study by Strouwen et al. (2019) showed that IWPD who had better cognitive function and slow gait velocity during dual tasking benefitted from DTT the most [55] . Together, these findings support that DTT individualized to each participant's clinical characteristics is needed. For example, a person with PD who has mild cognitive impairment may benefit more from training requiring the simultaneous performance of a choice reaction task (of relatively low cognitive challenge) during multi-plane locomotion (of relatively complex physical challenge) than training involving performing a complicated arithmetic task during multi-plane locomotion, especially at an early phase of a training program. However, the sample size in this study is insufficient for subgroup analyses, and further research is needed to identify whether other factors or cut-off values can be used to identify those IWPD with certain clinical characteristics who may respond to gamified DTT or STT better.",

Relative to the baseline PD-CRS score of 53 points (at T0), this participant subsequently reached and maintained a non-demented cognitive status by performing 40% better at the test session after the first training condition (with a score of 74 points at T1), which was STT, 34% better at the test session after the washout period (with a score of 71 points at T2), and finally 43% better at the test session after the second training condition (with a score of 76 points at T3), which was gamified DTT. There is paucity in the research literature of studies investigating training effects on the cognitive function of IWPD having MCI because cognitive dysfunction, as assessed by neurocognitive screening tests, is commonly used as an exclusion criterion for research participation involving the PD population, especially in fall intervention studies [57] . Hence, this unique case (P7) may be highly valuable in suggesting that it is beneficial for IWPD who have nonmotor symptoms affecting cognition and mood to receive some form of physical training, be it gamified physical-cognitive DTT or physical STT. This is because physical training with or without combining with cognitive training has the potential to not only reverse cognitive decline from the demented state to the non-demented state during initial training within the first 7.5 weeks (which is the length of STT period for P7), but that it also shows the potential of retaining some of that improvement in cognitive function for at least 11.5 weeks (which is the length of washout period for P7) after training, and to continue enhancing cognitive function during subsequent training in the last 7.5 weeks (which is the length of gamified DTT period for P7). With MCI being a risk factor for dementia, which is a major public health issue [58] , training protocols that can be used as preventive measures or therapeutics to delay its onset, revert it back to normal cognition, or slow down its conversion to dementia will have important implications for alleviating individual, societal, and economic burden. It would also be interesting to investigate the potential training benefits of gamified DTT in treating mild depression and low mobility confidence (the other clinical characteristics unique to this participant, but not assessed as training outcome measures in the present study) in future studies.",
