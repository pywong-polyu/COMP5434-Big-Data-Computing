            "text": "Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to all states in India. Due to limitations in testing coverage, the true extent of the spread may not be fully reflected in the reported cases. In this study, we obtain time-varying estimates of the fraction of COVID-19 infections reported in the different states. Methods Following a methodology developed in prior work, we use a delay-adjusted case fatality ratio to estimate the true fraction of cases reported in different states. We also develop a delay adjusted test positivity estimation method and study the relationship between the estimated test positivity rate for each state and the estimated fraction of cases reported. Setting We apply this method of analysis to all Indian states reporting at least 100 deaths as of 10 October 2020. Results Our analysis suggests that delay-adjusted case fatality ratios observed in different states range from 0.47% to 3.55%. The estimated fraction of cases reported in different states ranges from 39% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 1.38%, from 18.6% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.66%, and from 2.8% to 19.7% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.1%. We also demonstrate a statistically significant negative relationship between the fraction of cases reported in each state and the testing positivity rate. Conclusions The estimates provide a means to quantify and compare the trends of reporting and the true level of current infections in different states. This information may be used to guide policies for prioritising testing in different states, and also to analyse the time-varying effects of different quarantine measures adopted in different states.

Since then, the infection has spread throughout the country, with every state reporting at least one case positive case of COVID-19 as of 10 October 2020. However, the reported cases may not give the full picture of the extent of the infection as testing coverage has not been complete. Data from covid19india. org 1 suggest that the number of tests conducted up to 10 October 2020 in various states were in the range of 29 to 182 per 1000 residents. Although patients hospitalised with symptoms are typically tested, those who develop mild symptoms at home and those who do not develop symptoms are unlikely to be tested. The testing protocols used in different states have also changed significantly over the duration of the pandemic. Nevertheless, knowing the true extent of the prevalence of infection throughout the country is critical for policy making around handling the outbreak, including determining the required level of deployment of testing and treatment infrastructure and personnel. Estimating the timevarying level of under-reporting existing in different states can help in determining the true time-varying extent of the infection.",

The fitted distribution is a lognormal distribution p with a mean delay of 13 days and a SD of 12.7 days. Let p s represent the probability that an eventually fatal case leads to death during the s-th day from the day of confirmation. Let c s denote the number of new cases and d s denote the number of new deaths reported on day s from a region.

Moreover, in regions with low testing coverage, testing tends to be performed only on people who are most at risk of having contracted the infection. Consequently, in such regions, a larger fraction of the tests conducted also tend to turn out positive. Therefore, we expect a negative correlation between the fraction of cases reported in a region and the test positivity observed in a region, defined as the fraction of tests that are positive. In order to test this hypothesis, we also computed the test positivity rate of the different states. As testing rates are time-varying, we again use a Poisson model to estimate the positivity rate. We assume that the result of test performed on 1 hour is obtained with equal probability on the same day, the next day, or the day after. We model the number of positives reported on a particular day t as a Poisson random variable with the mean given by the product of the positivity rate and the average number of tests performed on days t -2, t -1 and t. We then perform Poisson regression on the data on reported positives and tests performed to obtain a smoothened estimate for the positivity rate of each state.

The nCFR column represents the naive CFR estimate one would estimate by using the ratio of total deaths to total cases, and cCFR gives the corrected CFR obtained after accounting for right censoring in deaths via the method described above. It can be seen that the ratio of cCFR to nCFR varies from 1.1 to 1.4, which suggests that it is important to account for the delay in reporting while estimating CFR's. In the same table, we also provide estimates of the under-reporting obtained assuming baseline CFR's of 1.38%, 0.66% and 0.1%. These numbers are the ratios of total deaths to the number of deaths that should be expected if the reported cases were accurate. As expected, the estimate for the fraction reported is significantly lower for lower values of the assumed baseline CFR compared with those for higher values of assumed baseline CFR.

The method can be applied using only the daily reports of cases and deaths from different states. An alternative method one could adopt to quantify under-reporting may be to use results of serological testing 10 11 for COVID-19 antibodies among the general public. Randomised antibody testing in a general population may be used to estimate the fraction of the people who have the COVID-19 antibody in their system, which in turn serves as an estimate of the total population who have been exposed to the virus. This could then be used with the total cases reported to arrive at an estimate for the fraction of cases reported. An advantage of this approach is that this provides a direct way to measure past infections. However, antibody testing does not provide an estimate of when a person was infected, and hence is not sufficient to estimate the temporal variation in the underreporting. This method therefore does not directly provide an estimate of the current prevalence of the infection in the population, which on the other hand can be obtained by the method proposed in the current study. Furthermore, in order to have accurate estimates, one would have to test a substantial portion of the population of the state and also cover a wide area of the state. This requires additional testing which could be expensive. The proposed method on the other hand uses only reports of cases and deaths, which are more readily available.",

It is known that one of the causes of high test positivity in a region is the lack of broad testing across the population, and hence one can expect that such regions also have higher prevalence of unreported cases. This could explain the negative correlation we observed between the estimated fraction of reported cases from a region and the test positivity from the region.",

If the number of deaths reported is undercounted, this would lead to an incorrectly high estimate for the fraction of cases reported. This limitation can be partially addressed if the under-reporting rate for deaths can be estimated by other means. For example, it may be possible to estimate the fraction of COVID-19 deaths reported based on the protocol for death-reporting followed in different regions. If it is known that only a fraction \u03b1 of the actual deaths are reported, this can be used to adjust for the resulting bias in the estimation of the fraction of cases reported. In particular, the formula for the adjusted CFR cCFR given in the methods section may be scaled by 1/\u03b1, and the formula for the expected deaths e t may be scaled by factor \u03b1. These adjustments in the method will then lead to more accurate estimates for the adjusted CFR and the fraction of cases reported.",
