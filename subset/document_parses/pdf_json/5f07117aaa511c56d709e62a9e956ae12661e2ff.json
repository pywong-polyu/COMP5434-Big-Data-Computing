            "text": "Introduction. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between trauma volume and alcohol prohibition during the COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa. Methods. This was a retrospective analysis of trauma volume from Worcester Regional Hospital in South Africa from 1 January to 28 December 2020. We compared total volume and incidence rates during five calendar periods; one when alcohol sales were allowed as per normal and four when alcohol sales were completely or partially banned. Poisson regression was used to model differences between alcohol ban and non-ban periods. Results. During the first period (pre-COVID-19, no ban), the trauma admission rate was 95 per 100 days, compared to 39 during the second period (complete ban 1), 74 during the third period (partial ban 1), 40 during the fourth period (complete ban 2) and 105 during the fifth period (partial ban 2). There was a 59-69% decrease in trauma volume between the no ban and complete ban 1 periods. When alcohol sales were partially reinstated, trauma volume significantly increased by 83-90% then dropped again by 39-46% with complete ban 2. By the second half of 2020, when alcohol sales were partially allowed again (partial ban 2), trauma volume increased by 163-250%, thus returning to pre-COVID-19 levels. Discussion and Conclusions. Our study demonstrates a clear trend of decreased trauma volume during periods of complete alcohol prohibition compared to non-and partial alcohol bans. This finding suggests that temporary alcohol bans can be used to decrease health facility traffic during national emergencies.

Throughout 2020, there were five lockdown levels all with varying limitations in movement and included social distancing measures [12] .

Total volume of admissions and operations at three-weekly intervals were calculated and mapped onto lockdown periods. The time period 23-28 December 2020 was excluded because these dates fell outside the final 3-week interval. Since each time period had a different number of days, standardised rates were calculated by dividing the number of cumulative admissions or operations in each period by the number of days in each period and multiplying by 100 to give a rate per 100 days. Stab wound admission rates were compared across time periods as a proxy for intentional injury.",

Each time a complete ban was instituted, there was a significant drop in trauma volume which was lost by allowing alcohol (even partial sales). Specifically, there was a 59-69% decrease in trauma volume between pre-COVID-19 and the first complete ban period. When alcohol sales were partially reinstated, trauma volume significantly increased by 83-90% then dropped again by 39-46% with the second alcohol ban. By the second half of 2020, when alcohol sales were partially allowed again, trauma volume increased by 163-250%, thus returning to pre-COVID- 19 levels. The pattern for intentional injury (using stab wounds as a proxy for intentional injury) was similar to the overall trauma admission and operation trends. It could be argued that the relationship of the alcohol bans on trauma admissions and operations was merely the effect of restrictions or curtailment of mobility or the lifting of curfews/relaxing of hours. The effect of the changes in hours of curfew has, however, been shown to be negligible or moderate in a time series analysis of the effect of the alcohol sales ban on mortality. When the curfew was shortened during the complete alcohol ban, there was no change in the number of unnatural deaths. However, when the alcohol ban was subsequently partially lifted, unnatural deaths increased even with the same curfew hours [21] . While restrictions on mobility are important, particularly in terms of vehicular trauma, anecdotal evidence regarding what happened when the first complete alcohol ban was lifted further indicates that the availability of alcohol directly increases trauma volume, and then in mid-July 2020 when alcohol sales were prohibited, trauma presentations dropped sharply [22] . Our study also shows that partial bans have substantially less effect on reducing trauma volume compared to complete alcohol prohibition.",

A major rationale for alcohol prohibition during the COVID-19 lockdown was to decrease the volume of persons with injury needing non-COVID-19 medical intervention, to create beds for COVID-19 patients [11] . In the USA where alcohol was not banned, there was an increase in alcohol-related trauma with risk factors possibly being stress and stay at home orders [23] . Since alcoholrelated trauma can account for up to 40% of emergency department visits in SA, identifying policies to reduce injuries is paramount to free up space for hospitals to treat patients with COVID-19 who are also competing for ward beds, intensive care unit beds, ventilators, medical supplies and attention from doctors, nurses and other hospital staff [9] . Alcohol is known to be associated with intentional and unintentional injury and this study demonstrates that alcohol prohibition correlates with a decrease in health seeking behaviour for injury. For future pandemics or other situations where a reduction in traffic to health facilities is needed, this type of policy can be considered. However, given the hardships experienced by persons involved in the liquor manufacturing trade and retail sectors as a result of the prohibition on alcohol sales and also the difficulties experienced by persons with alcohol dependence who can no longer access alcohol, it might be preferable to also look at investigating the impact of a basket of less restrictive temporary interventions to try to achieve the same goal [24, 25] .",

The first was that the national lockdown, which started the same day as the first complete alcohol ban, may have been a confounder in the initial decrease in trauma admission and operation volumes. However, our study showed that the lifting of the alcohol ban resulted in an immediate increase in trauma admissions suggesting alcohol prohibition likely had an independent effect. In addition, as SA moved from level 3 to level 1 lockdown, both trauma admission and operation incidence returned to pre-COVID-19 rates. The type and severity of all injuries were not captured and thus could not be compared across study periods. In addition, the absolute numbers of admissions and operations may have been too low to show a possible true effect of partial bans decreasing trauma volume. Finally, this was a single centre study, which could limit the generalisability of its findings. However, our findings are supported by Navsaria et al. who using data from five hospitals in the Western Cape compared trauma volume in the pre-lockdown period to the level 5 lockdown (complete alcohol ban) and found a greater than 50% decrease in trauma visits, which was not sustained after alcohol sales were partially allowed [16] .",
