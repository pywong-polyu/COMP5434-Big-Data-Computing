Research institutions scattered across a large number of jurisdictions collaborate in producing and analyzing biomedical big data. National data protection legislation, for its part, grows increasingly complex and localized. To respond to heterogeneous legal requirements arising in numerous jurisdictions, decentralized health consortia must develop scalable organizational and 6 technological arrangements that enable data flows across jurisdictional boundaries. In this article, proposals are made to enable health sector organisations to align established biomedical ethics process and data analysis practices to shifting data protection norms through both public law co-regulation, private law tools, and design-oriented approaches.",

This structure is adopted because researchers with common interests and compatible expertise are often established in unrelated and geographically distant research institutions. The structure is also useful because it allows researchers to collaborate in the generation, curation, analysis, and preservation of biomedical data for future use, allowing for the data created to serve as a shared source of knowledge for biomedical research. 1 Numerous international research consortia have developed a sophisticated architecture of organizational bodies and technical infrastructure to provide access to their stewarded data both to internal collaborators and to external collaborators. Such infrastructure includes technological elements, such as online portals for data access and cloud-compute resources to help store and analyze data. 2 Consortia also implement 'policy' infrastructure-including governance bodies, consortium policies regarding data inclusion criteria, and common procedures to access shared data. 3 Model contracts or model informed consent materials are also adopted to streamline compatible data collection and data sharing activities. Consortia that have adopted these approaches to data sharing include the UK Biobank, the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), and the H3 Africa Consortium.",

Furthermore, it recognizes scientific research purposes as an individual legal basis for the processing of personal data. 9 That is, Convention 108+ explicitly establishes that the processing of personal data for scientific research purposes, including further processing beyond its original purpose of collection, should be considered lawful so long as appropriate safeguards are utilized. 10 Although almost all Member States of the CoE have signed the treaty, ratification is still not complete. Adherence by non-Member States opens up the potential scope of application of the treaty and could provide for its global effect. However, expectations in this respect must be kept low. 11 Thus far, only eight countries that are not CoE Member States have ratified Convention 108. 12 No non-Member State countries that are heavily engaged in the international exchange of data have ratified the Convention as of yet.",

The USA has specialized laws such as the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which governs covered entities in the health sector, 29 and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Privacy of Consumer Financial Information Rule. 30 Numerous other jurisdictions have adopted an approach to data privacy law that lies at the intersection of the holistic European 'data protection' approach and the sector-specific USA 'privacy' approach. For example, hybrid legislative characteristics are common to data privacy laws adopted in jurisdictions such as Canada, 31 Japan, 32 and South Korea. 33 Such hybrid legislation generally regulates data distinctly for each economic sector or across specified contexts of data use (eg private-sector legislation, public-sector legislation, and health-sector legislation). Certain kinds of information, which can include information used for journalistic purposes or information related to employment, are carved out of the ambit of data privacy statutes (eg on the understanding that such data should not be considered personal or private in nature).

To reiterate, the European Commission can issue an adequacy decision in favor of a nation, a subnational territory (eg a prefecture, province, or state), one or more specified economic sectors, or an international organization. Once such a finding is made, the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the recipient destination becomes significantly less burdensome from a legal compliance standpoint.

Less onerous data localization laws impose significant preconditions on the international transfer of personal data, or limit such transfers to State-approved circumstances or legislatively specified use-cases (cf. Section 8 'International Data Transfers' below). 36 Furthermore, some jurisdictions have incorporated to their national data protection legislation default presumptions against the use or the movement of certain special categories of personal data, absent exceptional justification. Such categories of data often include biometric data, health data, and genetic data, 37 or data that is generated in local health institutions. 38 Numerous countries including China, 39 Russia, 40 and the Canadian province of British Columbia 41 have adopted one form or another of data localization legislation. 42 Even some EU countries, such as Germany, have imposed limitations on data processing in specified healthcare contexts. These limitations exercise a comparable function to data localization laws. The processing of personal data by a digital health application, as well as processing of personal data on behalf of a third party through such an application, may only take place in Germany, the EU Member States, in the EEA, in Switzerland, and in third countries for which an adequacy decision has been issued by the European Commission. 43 Accordingly, appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR cannot operate as transfer mechanisms for such data processing. Furthermore, derogations such as the explicit consent of the data subject under Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR cannot legitimize a data transfer in this context. Minimum requirements that providers with parent companies in third countries without an adequacy decision must fulfil in order to be able to process personal data through such applications on behalf of the manufacturer take into account both technical measures in the form of encryption of all data controlled by the manufacturer, as well as organizational measures that provide a sufficient guarantee to prevent a data transfer outside of the scope of application of the GDPR to the parent company. 44 However, insured persons may be physically present in a third country for which there is no adequacy decision. In such a case, health data may pass through a server in that country, in which case its law applies to the insured person and the processing is no longer the responsibility of the manufacturer. The offering of health apps via the online stores of providers in third countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision is possible if the login data are strictly separated from the health data, because the login data are processed for the purpose of downloading and updating the app, whereas the processing of health data serves other purposes. 45",

However, a second objective of data protection legislation is to foster the use of data for the purposes of economic development and scientific innovation. Indeed, data protection is an emergent regulatory framework subject to a number of practical controversies, and elements that require further clarification through regulatory guidance, and community or industry guidance (ie through approved codes of conduct and BCRs). Furthermore, soft law guidance becomes particularly relevant when rights and interests concerning data protection need to be balanced against interests arising from data processing that are also rooted in human and fundamental rights such as the right to research freedom and the right to benefit from scientific development. In addition, bioethical principles and values can guide the data protection compliance efforts of health consortia, merging relevant rules into a governance framework. Such guidance can be directly relevant to long-term decisions made by health consortia in balancing their many duties stemming from ethics, law, and public policy. This way, interpretive guidance and the codification of ethical standards can foster sector-specific 61 normative interoperability between different normative systems mandating rules for data processing. 67 There also exists guidance specific to international clinical trials (eg the ICH Harmonized Guideline). 68 Such international bioethics guidance has placed much emphasis on interventionist research. However, there is a growing body of international research ethics guidance that is directed to database science, longitudinal studies, and biobanks (eg the 2016 Declaration of Taipei of the WMA). 69 Traditional medical ethics literature introduced the four principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice in guiding ethical decision-making. 70 These principles have influenced the development of the medical ethics guidance and research ethics guidance concerning data as well.

These practices relate to the gathering of informed consent, 91 the return of research results and incidental findings, 92 and the secondary use of research data and biomaterials. 93 Such pronouncements establish international comity relative to ethics oversight and longitudinal data governance practices. These practices generally entail respect for participant autonomy both to participate in research and the right to choose not to be informed of their genetic information. These practices also establish a general right to the free circulation of genetic and biomedical data so long as such sharing and use occurs in compliance with best ethical practice (eg oversight, involvement of the participants in decision-making, review of research protocols, etc.). 94 Third, accepted definitions for gradations of biomedical data identifiability and the permissible uses of data according to its identifiability are enshrined in such data ethics guidance. 95 It is generally understood that individuals shall have a great degree of control over the acceptable uses of their genetic data in identifiable form (ie in direct association with their direct identifiers), absent certain limitations thereto established in domestic law (eg for select direct healthcare provision purposes and criminal law purposes, or for scientific research purposes in accordance with domestic law). 96 Furthermore, secondary uses of data in anonymized or coded form (ie all direct identifiers are removed and replaced with an alphanumeric code) are often considered to be acceptable. 97 Individual control of the permissible uses of data, 98 and the requirement to subject the use thereof to rigorous ethics oversight, are more limited where the data are irreversibly anonymized (ie irreversibly de-linked). 99",

In practice, ensuring normative interoperability refers to the actions of regulators or of regulated parties to create stable institutional and organizational practices between collaborators that are subject to distinct legal requirements or statutory frameworks. For regulators, this can mean creating laws that grant regulated parties sufficient discretion in deciding the methods to use in achieving compliance, so as to ensure that distinct legal regimes do not create significant challenges arising from the conflict of laws.

In practice, this could be achieved if national data protection regulators issued regulatory guidance stipulating that biomedical researchers should defer to local or international research ethics requirements to interpret their data protection obligations, in instances of legislative ambiguity. This contributes to achieving normative interoperability by encouraging regulated entities to use established bioethics norms with longstanding histories of interpretation, and relative stability across different countries, to interpret their respective data protection obligations. Normative interoperability is thus enhanced between binding research ethics guidance and data protection law, and between the data protection norms of distinct jurisdictions.",

This occurs where the law leaves aspects of its functioning to be devised by private actors. In the context of data privacy and data protection legislation, examples of such 'outsourcing' include the creation of sectoral codes of conduct or BCRs. 124 Other examples include the determination of the appropriate security safeguards to be used to ensure that data are held and shared according to an appropriate standard of privacy and security. 125 Having provided an overview of the conceptual relationship between existing health data governance approaches, data privacy, and data protection legislation in the context of normative interoperability, we now discuss specific data governance methods derived from the practice of international biomedical research consortia.",

Core Consent Elements constitute a series of mandatory minimum ethico-legal permissions for data collection and use that must be obtained by prospective data contributors. Establishing such a list of prerequisites to data contribution ensures that the datasets present in the database can be used for common purposes, without data custodians or downstream data users being required to manually assess the permissions inherent in each dataset relative to the intended secondary uses thereof. Such an approach is less rigid than mandating each data contributor to obtain identical permissions in data or to utilize the same consent materials across each participating research site. 131 Template consent materials common to a health consortium can further help local research institutions and researchers ensure that their research consent practices and research consent forms reflect the core consent elements required to contribute data to the consortium. Each contributing research institution can also meaningfully assess the compliance of their legacy data with the core consent elements of a consortium, by using a retrospective consent filter.",

However, the challenge inherent in implementing differential privacy is that a workable balance of privacypreservation and data utility can be difficult to achieve. Technical solutions to this issue have included formalizing the amount of information leakage that a differential privacy method permits, in comparison to the reduction of data utility. The former process can entail introducing a privacy budget to a query platform, either at the platform level or on a per-user basis, that restricts access platform-wide to the data deriving from a specified record, or restricts a specified user's access to the platform, once a specified threshold of information deriving from a single record has been revealed through the use of the platform. 152",

The use of a genomic beacon system reconciles values of privacy and data utility in making the existence of genomic information known at the variant level, but in masking or altering the results of queries that are formulated in a strategic fashion to reveal genetic information about a specific individual. One potential technical approach to reducing the potential for long-term data storage to create a heightened risk to individual privacy is to automate the deletion or anonymization of records using algorithms. This can be done at the point of data ingestion in automatically removing direct identifiers such as names and home addresses from ingested data. This can also be done on an ongoing basis, in automating the removal of data from datasets after a set period of time has elapsed or if criteria are met that demonstrate that the data are no longer of utility to the consortium. 154",

Ethicolegal data governance measures therefore foster convergence between bioethics norms and data protection law, creating a common culture of data sharing in combination with appropriate safeguards and oversight. These governance practices encourage the standardization of biomedical data stewardship practices despite the lack of harmonization amongst national laws. Perhaps in the future, national legislatures and regulatory bodies could further enable the legal interoperability of health and biomedical data exchange by recognizing, explicitly or tacitly, the governance measures that biomedical research consortia already espouse as legal compliance best practices.

These matters sometimes include the respective apportionment of intellectual property rights between the contributor, the consortium, and downstream users in primary and derived discoveries.

The approaches articulated in the UNESCO Draft Recommendation include public-private partnerships to promote industry engagement in open science initiatives, and the development of laws and national policies that enable open science. Other actions proposed therein include the open licensing of research outputs, and increased State investment in technological infrastructure, such as internet access, computational resources, and non-commercial information repositories. 82 2. International Commitment to Shared Benefit from Biomedical Data International commitments to the open sharing of biomedical and genetic data are also reflected in statements establishing balancing of the human right to participate in research and benefit from its products, individual confidentiality interests, and ethical interests in the welfare of research participants. Such instruments include the, Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (UNESCO, 1997), 83 the International Declaration on Human Genetic Data (UNESCO, 2003), 84 and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (UNESCO, 2005). 85 Other relevant policy statements include the Guidelines on Human Biobanks and Genetic Databases (OECD, 2009) 86 and the Recommendation on Research on Biological Materials of Human Origin (Council of Europe, 2016).",

NHGRI AnVIL: Requesting Data Access A traditional controlled access process is applicable to most dbGaP data. A simplified controlled access process is applied to select data that is authorized for General Research Use (GRU). Each cohort participating in dbGaP manages access to its data independently, through its own data access committee (DAC). The dbGaP controlled access process utilises two paths to data access, one for NIH staff member applicants and another for NIH-external applicants. The ICGC Data Access Compliance Office (DACO) and Data Access Committee (DAC) administer requests for most ICGC controlled-access data.
