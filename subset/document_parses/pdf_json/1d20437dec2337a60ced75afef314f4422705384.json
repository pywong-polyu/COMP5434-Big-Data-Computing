We report a case of delayed angioedema and associated urticaria to hyaluronic acid dermal fillers post COVID-19 infection. To our knowledge, this is an unusual case of hypersensitivity reaction of eight-month latency. Although the aetiology warrants further research, the author suggests utilisation of a four-week time window between dermal filler injections and COVID-19 vaccination.",

The hyaluronic acid dermal fillers that were injected by the clinician were monophasic in nature, 20mg/mL concentration, and crosslinked.

Surprisingly, thirteen days later she developed angioedema of the lower face and lips as well as urticaria of the hands despite not having had any dermal filler treatments for 8 months. Upon clinical examination, she was asymptomatic with regards to COVID-19 but there was firm swelling palpated at the site of the previously injected dermal fillers, except over the zygomatic region. She was managed with oral corticosteroids (60mg prednisolone with a gradual taper) and high-dose antihistamines (40mg cetirizine daily) which eventually allowed the swelling to subside. Hyaluronidase was kept on standby but was not required given the marked improvement of the swelling and tenderness in the first 24 hours. Symptoms completely resolved by day 25 without the need of dissolving the hyaluronic-acid dermal fillers with hyaluronidase ( Figure 1 ). dermal fillers and may manifest in the form of erythema, oedema, and nodules [2] . In addition, certain triggers may exacerbate such responses, for example, poor injection technique, wrong product choice, dental procedures, medications, and viral illnesses [2] . It is reassuring to know that the reported global incidence rate of both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions for hyaluronic acid derma fillers is only 0.8% [2] . Immediate hypersensitivity reactions typically occur within minutes via a mast-cell mediated response causing the release of histamines. On the other hand, delayed hypersensitivity reactions typically occur after a few days, although they can also occur several weeks or months later [3] .",

She was not injection-naive as has never reported any acute or delayed complications in the past. With her last treatment being eight months previously, surprisingly she developed an alleged delayed reaction to the dermal fillers. A thorough clinical history revealed the likelihood of COVID-19 infection and, subsequently, she was antigen positive. What is unusual in this particular case is the presence of urticaria on the patients' hands. it is difficult to conclude the exact aetiology of this; however, one explanation could be the breakdown of hyaluronic acid into smaller fragments causing a systemic inflammatory response. It is important to consider differential diagnoses of late-onset nodules, foreign body granulomatous reactions, and biofilms.",

Each of these patients was treated with oral corticosteroids and antihistamines. However, in our patient, the delayed hypersensitivity reaction at the site of filler injections was noted 15 days post active COVID-19 infection and not post COVID-19 vaccination. Amongst existing theories as to why delayed hypersensitivity reactions are seen in patients who have dermal fillers and certain infective viral triggers, is that dermal fillers may act as adjuvants to T-cell activation, therefore, enhancing the antigen-specific immune response [5] .",
