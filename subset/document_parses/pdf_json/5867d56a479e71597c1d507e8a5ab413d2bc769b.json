Specimen collection currently requires trained medical personnel (3), thus exposing staff to a high risk of infection (4) . These tests are not always successful at the first attempt, and shortages of swabs and protective equipment are frequently reported (2) . Additionally, mass testing requires an increased number of trained personnel at specimen acquisition sites. Consequently, the nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collection method is causing an economic and logistic burden on healthcare systems. Additionally, nasopharyngeal swabbing causes discomfort to the patients (5) and there are several contraindications, such as coagulopathy or anticoagulant therapy, and significant nasal septum deviation (6) . Clearly, there is a need for a simpler and less invasive method that also reduces the risk to healthcare personnel.",

The other five, interventional studies are examining the effectiveness of several potentially beneficial compounds, including azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, beta-cyclodextrin, citrox 3 and peginterferon lambda, on the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In these studies, besides NPS specimen collections, saliva tests are also planned. Unfortunately, in the trial protocols very little information is available about the optimization and validation of the saliva collection protocols, the transportation and storage of the saliva samples, the viral RNA assay methods to be used for the saliva samples, and the choice of appropriate internal controls, which is important given the scarcity of human DNA in saliva samples.

This new saliva-based diagnostic collection method, which RUCDR has developed in partnership with Spectrum Solutions and Accurate Diagnostic Labs (ADL), claims to allow an easier and therefore broader screening of the population compared with the current method using nose and throat swabs. Another accelerated EUA for the \"Curative-Korva SARS-Cov-2 Assay, \" which was specifically designed for use with oral fluid samples, was also approved to permit the testing of oral fluids, i.e., saliva (https://www.fda.gov/media/137088/ download). Nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and nasal swabs can also be used with the Curative-Korva SARS-CoV-2 Assay, but their performance with this assay has not yet been assessed (https://www.fda.gov/media/137088/download). These two saliva-based, FDA-approved assays are now in use to test for COVID-19 infection, in spite of the fact that no independent, scientific analysis has yet established their effectiveness. Our present work is the first integrative meta-analysis study to review the existing multi-study evidence for validity of the salivabased approach.",

But most studies lack any direct comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of NPS-and saliva-based assays. The one important exception is a study which compared saliva and NPS specimens for the detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR (4). This study, which included results from 236 patients with 11 different viral respiratory infections, including coronaviruses, revealed no significant difference in the sensitivity and specificity of saliva-and NPS-based tests (4).

One obvious source is debris from the nasopharyngeal epithelium which drains into the oral cavity (17) . Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 may actually infect the salivary glands and the virus is then secreted into the saliva from the glands. No information is available on this. But it is of note that during the infection of rhesus macaques by the SARS coronavirus, epithelial cells lining salivary gland ducts are an early target of the virus (34) . One consequence of this is the production of SARS-specific secretory immunoglobulin A into the saliva (35) . Thirdly, SARS-CoV-2 from blood plasma may access the mouth via the crevicular fluid, an exudate derived from periodontal tissues (36) . Fourthly, infected oral mucosal endothelial cells, which show overexpression of ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection, may also contribute to the viral load in saliva (37) . Finally, salivary cells may endocytose viruses and virus-containing exosomes from the circulation at their basolateral surface and release them into the salivary lumen by exocytosis. Such mechanisms have been revealed for other macromolecular constituents of the blood, such as DNA and RNA (8) . Any or all of these five possible sources may contribute to the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of COVID-19 patients. Given also that the main sites of viral infection (nasal, oral, pharyngeal or respiratory tract) may differ between individuals, it is quite possible that in some patients the virus is more readily detected in the saliva and in others it is more readily detected in an NPS specimen. Such differences might also be related to genomic variations between patients (38) . Consequently discrepancies between NPS and saliva test results, rather than indicating a deficiency in one or other test, may be an expected outcome, and it may have implications in terms of assessing asymptomatic carriers (39, 40) . Either way, our present level of understanding paves the way for more intensive studies of these important issues, extending well-beyond the design of better diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infection (6, 38) .",

Clearly the two confidence intervals overlap, suggesting that the outcomes of the saliva tests and NPS tests are not very different. There appears to be a slight tendency for NPS tests to be more sensitive but this is not statistically significant. On the other hand, one study reported the opposite tendency with the virus detectable in the saliva but not the NPS sample on a significant number of occasions (21) .

This may have had a significant effect on the sensitivity of the saliva test. Azzi et al. used a simple drooling technique to collect saliva and they resuspended the collected specimens in 2 ml of PBS (14) . In contrast, To et al. collected saliva specimens that also contained fluid from the posterior oropharynx obtained by coughing up and clearing the throat (17) . Another study (18) asked patients to pool saliva in their mouth prior to collection, and to spit 1-2 ml into a collection pot. The act of pooling saliva in the mouth may have stimulated additional saliva secretion, which could have diluted the viral load in the specimen. In this case no transport medium was added to the specimens but, after transportation to the laboratories, liquid Amies medium was added. Wyllie et al. used a self-collection technique: patients were asked to spit repeatedly into a sterile urine cup until one third was full (21) . This too could have diluted the sample with additional virus-free saliva. The remaining two studies did not describe the collection method at all (15, 16) . Additionally, two of the studies specified that specimens were collected in early morning to avoid anomalies introduced by eating, drinking and tooth brushing (17, 21) . The rest of the studies did not specify the time of collection or mention any other confounding factors that may have affected the sample. Taken together, the sample collection protocols of the included studies are quite diverse. But it is promising that even without validated, standardized collection protocols, the studies reviewed here yielded very similar results.",

Drooling is a well-established saliva collection method that is generally recommended for analytical purposes (44) . Due to its simplicity, it does not require trained personnel, it can be self-administered, and it can be done at home if necessary. Even in the clinic, the drooling method is safer than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabbing, with no need for infected swabs to be carried through the air from the patient to the container. The fact that nasopharyngeal swab sampling sometimes has to be repeated in overt COVID-19 patients before a positive result is obtained suggests that the reliability of that sampling method is lower than might be expected from saliva sampling. Moreover, this saliva collecting technique also avoids the mixing of fluids from different anatomical regions such as the oropharynx (14) .",

This simple comparison does not allow us to address any of the more complex questions that arise from the widely varying presentation of different COVID-19 patients. For example, are there significant differences in the sensitivities of the two sampling methods according to the primary location of the infected cells? Are there higher viral loads in the saliva, and is there therefore a higher saliva test sensitivity, in COVID-19 patients who only present with a loss of taste sensation or who are asymptomatic? Are saliva tests more or less sensitive than NPS tests in patients whose infection is mainly localized to the respiratory tract? Correlation studies comparing saliva and NPS viral loads in patients categorized by the nature and severity of their symptoms should be very informative. Time series data on the relative viral loads in the saliva and NPS specimens may be useful in predicting the progression of the disease and in guiding treatment. But, as discussed above, these studies will require careful optimization and standardization, particularly of the saliva collection protocol.",

Among these, 13 are non-interventional, focusing on the diagnostic value of various specimens including saliva, and five interventional studies also planned to use saliva as a diagnostic tool, but with a primary focus on evaluating potential treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Unfortunately, these registered clinical trials vary considerably in the amount of information presented about the proposed testing methodology. Neither the non-interventional nor the interventional protocols have clear descriptions of the collection, transportation and storage of saliva samples, and the optimization of the viral RNA assay for saliva specimens.

Despite the large number of records found in the systematic search of the literature, only 6 studies could be included. Although intensive research is in progress regarding COVID-19, there are still only a handful articles fulfilling our eligibility criteria. The limited amount of reported data makes it difficult to perform comprehensive analyses and to thoroughly investigate the causes behind certain trends in the results. Another issue that hinders in-depth analysis is the lack of methodological homogeneity, and the inadequate reporting of methods and outcome parameters. A significant limitation is the lack of false-positive data, based on an independent reference, that would be required for 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables to allow estimation of the test specificities. Thus, the more rigorous statistical methodologies specially developed for meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy could not be used in this work.",

Additionally, there are several other confounding factors that might have affected the detectability of viral RNA in the saliva, such as the timing and method of sample collection, the choice of transport medium, storage and transport temperatures, the time passed between specimen collection and RNA isolation, and the extraction and PCR kits used for isolation, amplification and detection. None of these factors could be properly addressed in our analysis owing to the lack of information in the reported studies.",
