In cone and cone-rod dystrophy, the cones are affected first, and later the rods may be involved. Affected people may also experience haemeralopia (extreme glare) and loss of central and colour vision. The phenotype may vary between different family members with the same mutation, as exemplified in ABCA4 mutations where a single mutation in family members can result in macular dystrophy, and cone-rod dystrophy phenotypes. 9 10 The RPE65 gene (OMIM 180069) is expressed in RPE cells (supporting cells for the photoreceptors), and encodes RPE65 protein, a critical component of the visual cycle and necessary for vitamin A metabolism in cells. 11 Biallelic mutations in RPE65 lead to degeneration of photoreceptors in humans. [12] [13] [14] Natural history studies show variability in age of onset, degree of severity and disease progression. 15 16 Biallelic RPE65 mutations are responsible for about 10% of RP cases with LCA phenotype (LCA type 2), and about 2% of adults with typical RP phenotype (RP 20). 17 IRDs are genetically diverse, with over 300 responsible genes and loci identified to date in genomic and mitochondrial DNA. 18 Gene therapy refers to a set of strategies that modify the expression of an individual's genes or repair abnormal genes. 19 Over 20 gene therapy products have been approved globally for systemic indications, with the two principal approaches including direct in vivo administration of a viral vehicle for gene delivery, and ex vivo therapies generating genetically engineered cells for reintroduction to the patient. 20 Voretigene neparvovecrzyl (Luxturna) has recently been approved in several jurisdictions for the treatment of biallelic mutations in RPE65 causing retinal dystrophy. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Trials of ocular gene therapy for at least 10 IRD are underway. 27 28 Gene therapy in IRD is thought to have a 'therapeutic window' in that it must be performed while there are residual viable photoreceptors, retinal interneurons and optic nerve. 29 There is limited data on the potential gains and risks of ocular gene therapy, with results limited to published clinical trials, and no long-term studies available. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] In general treatments of direct in vivo administration via subretinal injection of a viral vehicle for gene augmentation appear to have an acceptable safety profile. Immunogenicity is low, but inflammation can be triggered, and immunosuppression may be necessary in some cases. Future RNA-based therapies may have less risk of immune reaction. 30 Currently, there is limited understanding of the potential participant perspective for approved ocular gene therapy. Ganne et al 31 demonstrated that members of the public have a low level of knowledge of genetic eye disease. Studies to date have focused on participants in early-stage clinical trials of experimental therapies, rather than those receiving approved treatments. The only study of patient-reported outcomes among potential RPE65 gene therapy trial recipients found a high information need and wish to take part in medical decisions. 32 A 2012 study of potential participants in a choroideraemia gene therapy Phase I trial revealed participant misconceptions of the value of trial participation in safety studies. Participants tended to overestimate treatment effect, underestimate possible risks and show misconceptions about the timing of treatment. 33 A later study of potential choroideraemia trial participants (NCT02077361) confirmed these findings and noted the value of early-stage published data in influencing treatment decisions and the need to improve postoperative experiences of trial participants. 34 Similarly, Turriff et al 35 found potential participants in a Phase I/IIa gene therapy trial for X-linked retinoschisis were motivated by therapeutic hope, although the authors considered the individuals to be realistic in their assessments.",

However, like most medical and surgical procedures, there are associated risks. Hence, it is imperative that researchers and clinicians are aware of patient perspectives on the imminent arrival of approved ocular gene therapies, and use this information to facilitate patient informed consent processes, and to better inform regulatory bodies and reimbursement strategies. Thus, we aim to develop a tool to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of the risks and benefits associated with approved and future gene augmentation therapies among people with IRDs. In addition, we aim to assess the quality of life, attitudes towards clinical trials, and vision-related quality of life among this cohort.",
