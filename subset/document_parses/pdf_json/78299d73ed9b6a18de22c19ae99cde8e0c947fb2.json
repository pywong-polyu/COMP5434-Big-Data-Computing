Bangladesh witnessed the worst dengue epidemic in 2019 with 70 188 confirmed cases, including 67 deaths. 1 Since the first case was detected, Bangladesh has experienced 1945 765 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 29 058 deaths. 2 In Bangladesh, dengue virus infection usually emerges during monsoons, with most cases occurring from June to September every year. 3 Although two different viruses are responsible for the disease, both can present as asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe form, with resembling clinical features. 4 Both diseases can present clinically with fever, headache, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhea. In addition, both may cause thrombocytopenia. Although high grade fever, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, skin rash and bleeding manifestations are predominant symptoms of dengue, COVID-19 typically causes comparatively low-grade fever, cough, sore throat, anosmia and respiratory distress.",

Among them, 37 patients tested positive for dengue NS1 antigen and antidengue IgM based upon clinical and laboratory suspicions. MaxLINE Dengue NS1 antigen test kit, manufactured by Avecon Healthcare, was used to perform the dengue NS1 antigen, and Aria Dengue IgM/IgG combo rapid test kit (CTK Biotech) was used to perform antidengue IgM.

Group A dengue fever patients for the most part presented with prodromal symptoms such as fever, myalgia, headache and skin rash. On the contrary, group B dengue fever patients developed signs of fluid leakage such as pleural effusion, hypotension and bleeding manifestations. Considering laboratory parameters, group B dengue fever patients exhibited a noteworthy reduction in platelet count and increase in hematocrit levels along with a comparatively greater increase in liver enzymes. Among the 11 cases, 45.5% (cases 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11) developed severe COVID-19 disease, requiring oxygen support. Also, 45.5% of patients (cases 1, 2, 4, 5 and 10) developed group B dengue fever, 9% developed group C dengue fever (case 11) and the remaining 45.5% (cases 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) developed group A dengue fever. Only one of the patients developed dengue shock syndrome (case 11). However, the severity of both diseases in a single patient was not observed, except for in one patient (case 11). Patients who developed severe COVID-19 with increasing oxygen demands over time revealed mild symptoms of dengue virus infection and vice versa. The patient who developed severe COVID-19 and group C dengue fever (case 11) unfortunately died after 4 d of ICU attendance. All the other patients were followed up by telephone after 28 d of discharge to check on the development of any complications. No patients reported any long-term complications within this period. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a flavivirus, whereas COVID-19 infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is transmitted by respiratory droplets. Coinfection has been reported across tropical and subtropical dengue-endemic areas of the world. 5 Detailed clinical features and demographic representation in coinfected patients are described in Table 1 . Fever was the most consistent symptom in coinfected patients, although high grade fever was predominantly observed in dengue compared with COVID-19 patients. Both diseases may clinically present with myalgia, headache and diarrhea. The striking features of dengue virus infection include retro-orbital pain and skin rashes. Predominant respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea and nasal congestion typically point to a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. 6 The most common hematological manifestation of dengue virus infection is a dramatic reduction in platelet count along with hematocrit changes; COVID-19 disease may also present with thrombocytopenia, but there is less significant decrement, with the most common hematological abnormality being lymphopenia. Acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein and ferritin, are elevated, and liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferases and alanine aminotransferases) may be altered in both cases. Significant renal involvement was not reported in any of the cases. Hyperglycemia in previously nondiabetic patients (cases 3, 8, 9 and 10) was observed in those who developed severe COVID-19 disease and received steroids during the course of illness (Table 2 ) . The management challenge of coinfection can be regarded as a double task. First, dengue fever group B and C patients need integral fluid support, whereas, in COVID-19 disease, intravenous fluid is usually avoided to bypass the risk of pulmonary edema. Second, both diseases may be complicated by coagulopathy. In COVID-19 disease, this leads to an increased incidence of arterial or venous thrombosis causing elevated D-dimer, which invites the use of low molecular weight heparin. On the other hand, such agents cannot be considered in the management of dengue infection due to the risk of overt bleeding. 7 Because of these contradictions, the management of coinfected patients requires timely decisions and supervision. For our cases, we provided carefully controlled intravenous fluid support to group B dengue fever patients. All these patients received 20% curtailed intravenous normal saline from their calculated daily fluid requirements. Only one patient (case 11) received plasma expander in bolus dose, due to refractory shock. In terms of anticoagulants, severe COVID-19 patients with platelet counts of > 75 000/mm 3 received a therapeutic dose of anticoagulant. Patients whose platelet counts were 50 000-75 000/mm 3 with a threefold or higher increase in D-dimer received half a dose of anticoagulant. However, patients who had platelet counts of < 50 000/mm 3 with a threefold or higher increase in D-dimer did not receive any anticoagulant because of the risk of overt bleeding. Although steroids do not have any role in dengue fever, patients with severe COVID-19 manifestations received a high dose of steroids for 4-5 d to combat hypoxia and prevent long-term pulmonary fibrosis. An overview of important treatment modalities is described in Table 3 .",
