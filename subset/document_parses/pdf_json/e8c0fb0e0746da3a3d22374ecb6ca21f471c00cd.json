            "text": "Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are not recommended in COVID-19 patients receiving dexamethasone because of potential drug-drug and drug-disease interactions affecting anticoagulant concentration and activity. To evaluate short-and long-term pharmacokinetic interactions, serial through and peak DOAC plasma levels were prospectively measured during and after dexamethasone therapy, as well as during the acute phase and after recovery from COVID-19 in hospitalized, noncritically ill patients undergoing treatment with DOACs. Thirty-three (18 males, mean age 79 years) consecutive patients received DOACs (17 apixaban, 12 rivaroxaban, 4 edoxaban) for atrial fibrillation (n = 22), venous thromboembolism (n = 10), and acute myocardial infarction (n = 1). Twenty-six patients also received dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for a median of 14 days. Trough DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within and below expected reference ranges respectively in 87.5 and 8.3% of patients, with no statistically significant differences at 48-72 h and 14-21 days after dexamethasone discontinuation. Peak DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within expected reference ranges in 58.3% of patients, and below ranges in 33.3%, of whom over two thirds had low values also off dexamethasone. No significant differences in DOAC levels were found during hospitalization and after resolution of COVID-19. Overall, 28 patients were discharged alive, and none experienced thrombotic or bleeding events. In this study, dexamethasone administration or acute COVID-19 seemed not to affect DOAC levels in hospitalized, non-critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Venous and arterial thromboembolism represent frequent complications of COVID-19, affecting around 15 and 5% of hospitalized patients, respectively [1, 2] . Due to the relatively elderly age as well as the direct and indirect effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), atrial fibrillation is also highly prevalent in this patient population, with estimates ranging from 10 to 13% [3] . Adequate anticoagulation is therefore crucial in COVID-19 [2, 3] . Current guidelines suggest low-molecularweight heparins as the preferred anticoagulants in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [1, 4] . Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) generally represent the first-line anticoagulants for patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation, however, their safety and efficacy remain uncertain in COVID-19 [5] . One of the potential reasons for concern is the pharmacological interaction between DOACs and COVID-19 medications [6] , which may interfere with cytochrome CP450, mainly CYP3A4, or transporter permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), and affect DOAC clearance and half-life [6] [7] [8] . Of note, dexamethasone, administered intravenously at a dose of 6 mg, has become standard-of-care for the treatment of hypoxemic COVID-19 patients [4] . Whether concomitant administration of DOACs and dexamethasone, a well-known inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp [9, 10] , results in lower DOAC concentrations that may be clinically relevant is currently uncertain [6, 7, 11] .",

To evaluate the influence of COVID-19, DOAC levels were measured during the acute hospital phase and after recovery from COVID-19. Trough samples were collected about 30 min before DOAC administration, whereas peak samples were collected on the same day, at 2-4 h from DOAC administration. DOAC levels, expressed as drug concentration-equivalent (ng/mL), were measured using chromogenic assays calibrated for apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban (Biophen Dixal Coachrom, Hyphen Biomed, France), and dabigatran (Innovance DTI Assay, Siemens Healthineers AG, Germany). DOAC plasma levels at steady state were compared with the expected reference ranges derived from international consensus guidelines [7] .

Low-molecular-weight heparins are the suggested anticoagulants in hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to expert consensus guidelines [4] . Drugs employed for COVID-19, particularly those interacting with CYP3A4 and P-gp metabolic pathways, may affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of DOACs, thereby altering their anticoagulant activity [6] [7] [8] . Dexamethasone, an inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, may reduce bioavailability and increase clearance of DOACs, potentially leading to reduced plasma concentrations [9] [10] [11] . Although it remains possible that a longer exposure or higher doses of dexamethasone would result in clinically relevant effects, our data, which confirm and expand previous preliminary findings, seem to be reassuring as they suggest that relevant systematic interactions, if any, are unlikely [13] . However, the current findings are limited by the small number of patients included, both overall and by DOAC type, which hampers firm conclusions on DOAC safety and efficacy in COVID-19. Since all patients received activated factor X inhibitors, results may not apply to patients receiving dabigatran. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as observed in COVID-19, have been linked to downregulation of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes including CYP3A4, which could counteract the enzyme-inducing effects of dexamethasone [14, 15] . Furthermore, the coagulopathy associated with SARS-CoV-2 may result in altered concentrations of coagulation factors, including higher levels of activated factor X, and influence DOAC anticoagulant activity [1, 12] . We found that DOAC levels following resolution of Fig. 1 Panel A shows DOAC plasma levels according to dexamethasone use; Panel B shows the distribution of patients with DOAC levels within, below and above the expected reference ranges in relation to dexamethasone use COVID-19 were similar to those observed during the acute phase of disease, suggesting that both SARS-CoV-2 and the associated inflammatory response may not have a relevant impact on DOAC anticoagulant activity. It is worth pointing out that reference ranges adopted for DOAC plasma levels are subject to high inter-individual variability and do not represent the optimal therapeutic window [16] . Therefore, despite there were no thrombotic or bleeding complications during DOAC treatment, it cannot be excluded that patients with DOAC concentrations within the expected reference ranges may still experience such events. Adequately powered randomized trials evaluating the pharmacological and clinical profiles of DOACs in COVID-19 are urgently needed to inform on the optimal anticoagulation strategy in these patients.",
