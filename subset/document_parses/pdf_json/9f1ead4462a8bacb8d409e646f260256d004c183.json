            "text": "Neospora caninum is a protozoan associated with abortions in ruminants and neuromuscular disease in dogs. Classically, the immune response against apicomplexan parasites is characterized by the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, IFN-g and TNF. TNF is mainly produced during the acute phases of the infections and binds to TNF receptor 1 (CD120a, p55, TNFR1) activating a variety of cells, hence playing an important role in the induction of the inflammatory process against diverse pathogens. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of TNF in cellular and humoral immune responses during N. caninum infection. For this purpose, we used a mouse model of infection based on wildtype (WT) and genetically deficient C57BL/6 mice in TNFR1 (Tnfr1 -/-). We observed that Tnfr1 -/mice presented higher mortality associated with inflammatory lesions and increased parasite burden in the brain after the infection with N. caninum tachyzoites. Moreover, Tnfr1 -/mice showed a reduction in nitric oxide (NO) levels in vivo. We also observed that Tnfr1 -/mice showed enhanced serum concentration of antigen-specific IgG2 subclass, while IgG1 production was significantly reduced compared to WT mice, suggesting that TNFR1 is required for regular IgG subclass production and antigen recognition. Based on our results, we conclude that the TNF-TNFR1 complex is crucial for mediating host resistance during the infection by N. caninum.",

In vivo, we found an intriguing increment of IL-12 and IFN-g levels in bodily fluids and lung homogenates of Tnfr1 -/mice during the first week of infection. IL-12p40 levels were significantly higher in the peritoneal exudates and serum samples of Tnfr1 -/mice compared to WT controls seven days post-infection (P<0.05, Figure 4A ). In the same manner, IFN-g production was also upregulated in the peritoneal fluid, serum and lung homogenates of Tnfr1 -/mice at the same time point (P<0.05, Figure 4B ). No differences in the concentration of IL-12 and IFN-g were detected in liver homogenates of both mouse lines, even between na\u00efve and infected mice, which denotes a probable non-specific detection of the cytokines in that tissue. In order to explain these apparently contradictory results, we sought to determine FIGURE 1 | TNF is crucial for the survival of mice against Neospora caninum. Groups of WT and Tnfr1 -/mice were infected with 1\u00d710 7 Nc-1 tachyzoites and survival was observed for 30 days. Differences between groups were compared using Kaplan Meier survival analysis, through the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Two independent experiments were performed with similar results, and the graphs represent the biological replicates (n = 10 mice/group) of one of those individual experiments. whether the absence of TNF receptor 1 would impact the production of effector molecules known to be crucial for parasite killing. We analyzed the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the peritoneal fluids of WT and genetically deficient mice. Interestingly, the concentration of NO was significantly reduced in Tnfr1 -/mice if compared to WT controls (P<0.05, Figure 4C ), suggesting that signaling through TNFR1 is necessary to induce the production of proper amounts of effector molecules in response to N. caninum.",

In our study, infected Tnfr1 -/mice presented 100% of mortality during the course of infection, with high parasite burden and intense inflammatory infiltrates in the brain (30 d.p.i), indicating that this pathway contributes to host protection during infection latency. Also in agreement with what was found for T. gondii, previous studies demonstrated that Tnfr2 -/mice were resistant during the acute phase of infection by N. caninum, although mortality was described later on, during the chronic phase of infection (Ritter et al., 2002) . The authors also described similar cerebral tissue damage amongst the groups, which is a clear difference from our results. In corroboration, the absence of intact TNF signaling did not alter the phenotype induced by the acute phase of the infection, with similar parasite burden and inflammatory status of livers and lungs of both groups of mice.",

Cytokines as IL-12 and IFN-g are important for the control of intracellular parasite replication and host resistance during the acute phase of the infection against N. caninum (Khan et al., 1997) . As observed in this study, the absence of TNFR1 did not impair the production of these key cytokines. In fact, these cytokines were not only produced but also upregulated during the infection in peritoneum, serum, and lungs, probably in a compensatory mechanism related to the lack of effector molecules, as NO. TNF is a key component for the induction of these cellular effectors, due to the activation of STAT1 and NF-kB, in a positive feedback loop (Ohmori et al., 1997; Blaser et al., 2016) . Also, the synergy and mutual dependence between TNF and IFN-g to induce those crucial factors has also been intensively demonstrated (Nacy et al., 1991; Liew, 1993; Sch\u00e4ffer et al., 2006; Karki et al., 2021) . In an infection model with Citrobacter rodentium, severe tissue damage and increased expression of IL-12p40 and IFN-g in Tnfr1 -/mice was also observed (Goncalves et al., 2001) . On the other hand, WT and Tnfr1 -/mice showed similar production of IFN-g during T. gondii infection, although Tnfr1 -/mice were highly susceptible to the infection (Deckert-Schluter et al., 1998) . Partial IFN-g signaling due to the lack of receptor 1 (IFN-gR1) had in TNF a compensatory mechanism to induce killing of T. gondii, while the same strategy would not be suficient to kill Salmonella tiphymurium (Janssen et al., 2002) . In that sense, in a scenario where one of these key cytokines is missing, it's likely that the lack of effector molecules will prompt parasite growth, and the increment in antigen availability will attract more inflammatory cells, in a recurrent phenomena that may lead the animals to death.",

Previous work by our group demonstrated that nitric oxide is a key molecule for direct control of N. caninum, since deficient mice in iNOS presented uncontrolled parasite replication and extensive inflammatory lesions (Barros et al., 2019) . Thus, as expected, the production of NO in Tnfr1 -/mice during N. caninum infection was diminished, indicating that both pathways are linked. Some studies also showed more susceptibility to T. gondii infection in Tnf -/or Tnfr1 -/mice due to the absence of NO, which contributed to an increased parasite burden (Gazzinelli et al., 1993; Deckert-Schluter et al., 1998; Schluter et al., 2003) . It is important to note that a study with murine microglial cells infected with T. gondii showed that TNF and NO production are crucial to control the infection even in the absence of IL-12 and IFN-g (Pimenta et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "The cytokine milieu induced by activated cells contribute to isotype changes of antibodies, where the profile of antibodies produced is directly related to the immune response triggered by the pathogen (Innes, 2007) . Indeed, in N. caninum infection, the production of specific immunoglobulin is important to inhibit the invasion of tachyzoites in host cells and to control parasite replication (Aguado-Martinez et al., 2017) . Our study showed that the absence of TNFR1 stimulated an exacerbated Th1 response, followed by a humoral response skewed towards IgG2a-specific antibodies. IFN-g is a hallmark of Th1-type cellular responses against N. caninum (Mineo et al., 2010) and plays an important role in IgG class switch with predominant IgG2a isotype, inhibiting the expression of the other subclasses (Snapper and Paul, 1987; Long et al., 1998; Rojo-Montejo et al., 2009) , specially IgG1an IgG subclass biased towards the Th2 phenotype (Stevens et al., 1988) . IL-12 is a key cytokine in that context, committing CD4+ T cells to the Th1 phenotype (Germann et al., 1993) . Overall, antigen specific IgG1 antibodies were not only less concentrated in the serum of Tnfr1 -/mice, but also did not recognize the major antigenic bands present in parasite's soluble extract, denoting a probable loss of function that should be properly investigated. Also, A B C FIGURE 4 | While TNFR1 does not downmodulate the production of key Th1 cytokines during the infection, it is essential for the production of proper levels of nitric oxide (NO). Groups of WT and Tnfr1 -/mice were evaluated for IL-12p40 (A) and IFN-g (B) production 7 days after the infection with 1\u00d710 6 Nc-1 tachyzoites in the peritoneal fluids, serum samples, lung and liver homogenates. NO concentration was evaluated 7 days after infection in peritoneal fluids (C). Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Data were analyzed using the Two-way ANOVA test, followed by Bonferroni post-test. Differences were considered statistically significant (*) when p < 0.05. For the in vivo assays, two independent experiments were performed with similar results, and the graphs represent the biological replicates (n = 5 mice/group) of one of those individual experiments. detection of antigen-specific total IgG showed signs of early decay in Tnfr1 -/mice by ELISA and WB. Although we are not able to point out the specific reason for the phenomenon, it is probably related to the fundamental role of TNF signaling in B cell biology and its proper responses to antigens (Figgett et al., 2014) .",
