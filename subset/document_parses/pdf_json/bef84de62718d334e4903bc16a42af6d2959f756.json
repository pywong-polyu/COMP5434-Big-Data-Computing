To explore this topic, we adopted a mixed-methods approach that included content analysis, comparative thematic analysis and a series of focus groups. Whilst coherency and consistency are touted as essentials in public health messaging, our textual analysis highlighted the disconnect between political communication and news media coverage. Whereas the UK government relied on vague references to curves and peaks to underpin a narrative of consistency and certainty in public health policy, the UK news media referred to specific numbers from within and outside the UK to criticise the government's approach as haphazard and lacking. This disconnect gained even more significance during our focus groups. When discussing numbers, participants referred to news media coverage rather than political messaging, using these figures to challenge the timing and nature of the UK lockdown. These findings present a significant critique of the UK government's communication during this health crisis. Instead of putting forward a coherent, homogenous and clear message to the public, the discourse around numbers and risk was diffracted, disconnected and opaque. This was largely due to the competing narratives presented by the news media.",

These instructions, however, varied from country to country. Most liberal democracies and authoritarian regimes responded by placing entire segments of the population into 'lockdown', closing almost all economic activities, imposing travel bans and restrictions on free movement (Griffiths, 2020; Oltermann, 2020; Pearson and Nguyen, 2020) . However, some political leaders adopted less stringent public health measures that focused on protecting the economy (Eisenhammer and Spring, 2020; G\u00f3mez-Bruera, 2020; O'Reilly, 2020) .",

Whilst it was never officially confirmed, many commentators referred to the UK approach as something approximating 'herd immunity'. This strategy was described by Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, as focusing on protecting the elderly and vulnerable, whilst allowing the general population to largely carry on as normal. In doing so, it was thought that the UK would 'reduce the peak of the epidemic, pull it down and broaden it', while allowing business as usual (FT, 2020) . Within days of the explanation by Vallance, a significant U-turn took place. On 16th March, the UK government announced stricter measures. In addition to the current advice (washing your hands and self-isolating for seven days if you have symptoms of the virus), they also asked for whole households to isolate if one member of that household showed symptoms and strongly advised people to stay at home and not visit public spaces (e.g. bars, cafes and restaurants).",

In a period where public messaging changed significantly, we argue that coherency of this communication is particularly important. To assess the consistency of this communication, we place political messaging and public exposure within the 'media space' (Castells, 2011) . In doing so, we examined how the news media covered political messages and developed their own narratives on numbers. Understanding the way this quantitative information flowed between politicians, the news media and the public during a time of great uncertainty and danger is particularly important to the study of health and political communication. An incoherent, disjointed narrative presents significant issues concerning public adherence to health measures (Parvanta et al., 2010; SAGE, 2020a SAGE, , 2020b .",

In doing so, we focused on the central issue of coherency and clarity through a focus on three sites of communication: politicians, journalists and the public.",

When used rhetorically, numbers are generally used to construct a phenomenon in a particular way that legitimises policies or ideological positions (Desrosi\u00e8res, 1998; Fioramonti, 2014; Lugo-Ocando and Lawson, 2017; Merry, 2016; Zuberi, 2001) . For example, Assa (2019) documents how measurements of states' wealth have been a centuries-long rhetorical struggle by nationstates to legitimise specific economic policies. The contemporary incarnation is the rise of gross domestic product as the definitive account of national economic prosperity, effectively delineating between rich and poor countries and dictating the successes or failure of macro-level economic decisions (Fioramonti, 2014) .",

More often than not, these numbers are used to express 'risk'one of the defining logics of modern society and politics (Beck, 1992 (Beck, , 2006 (Beck, [1986 ). This can be observed in public health campaigns, where government advertisements express the risk of certain behaviours to individuals' health. A recent Public Health England (PHE) campaign explained that 'smoking increases the risk of developing more than 50 serious health conditions' (PHE, 2020a) . The hope here is that individuals will perceive the risk of this type of behaviour and be dissuaded from engaging in it. But these numbers are not just used to express the dangers of a certain behaviour, they can also express the effectiveness of certain campaigns. The PHE-led Stoptober campaign explained that 'if you can stop smoking for 28-days, you are five times more likely to stay smoke-free for good' (PHE, 2020b) .",

Quantitative information on risk is also used by governments to legitimise specific public health policies they are seeking to introduce. For example, an increased taxation on cigarettes might be legitimised by presenting the risk that smoking presents to the wider public. Often the political narrative centres on 'evidence-based policy', where scientific research and advice dictate changes in public health policy. Over the past 20 years, academic literature has increasingly argued that this is not always the case. Instead, the logic of science-based policy is often inverted: governments and politicians performatively listen to scientific research yet actually use this information to justify decisions that have already been taken at the political level (Hope, 2004) . In these cases, science is tasked with the responsibility of validating policy.",

Within this dynamic, the news media also engage with notions of riskoften journalists adopt notions of shared risk to campaign for empathy and action (Cottle, 1998; Lugo-Ocando and Andrade, 2019) . As Bakir (2010: 5) explains, there is a range of research that examines the relationship between the news media and risk, focusing on the media's role in: 'providing risk knowledge to inform citizens; generating and determining public acceptability of different risks; motivating the public to take responsibility for, and action regarding, risks; and providing imaginative schemata regarding voluntarily chosen risks'.",

This can be observed across the previous literature on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome and Ebola (Luther and Zhou, 2005; Towers et al., 2015; Washer, 2004) . The same can also be said for understanding how individuals are exposed to, interpret and assess risk during epidemics (Briggs and Hallin, 2016) . This piece intends to address that gap by examining the communication of numbers across politics, the press and the public during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic that struck the world in 2020 (O'Grady, 2020).

Furthermore, the advice to the UK government from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Behaviour (SPI-B), a sub-group of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), repeatedly stressed the need for clear government messaging on the risk posed by the pandemic to ensure public adherence to public health measures was based on rational, informed decisions.

This covered a three-day period on either side of the UK government's change in public health policy on 16 March 2020. It was on this day they shifted from a relaxed approach to the virus, characterised as 'herd immunity', to more stringent public health measures (FT, 2020) . This period was also defined by a wealth of different, competing numbers in public discourse. Most notably, the publication of a report from Imperial College London (ICL) that reported 260,000 lives would be lost if the government did not change its course of action (Kelly, 2020; van Elsland and O'Hare, 2020) .

It seems, therefore, that quantitative explanations regarding the spread of COVID-19 were not an important part of the government's discourse.

The number of tests was the most frequently used within an article (n = 5) and predicted cases the least (n = 1). In all but one article (n = 6), these numbers were used in relation to policy.

The second extract, on the other hand, positioned the UK as intimately linked to the epidemiological trajectory of Italy. This notion that the Italian experience was to be replicated in the UK in 'a couple' or 'few weeks' was a commonly expressed sentiment across different groups.

(Participant 2a, 2020) I was watching the news in Italy and in Spain, and looking what was going on. The people were not aware of the serious situation that was coming to us. (\u2026) I feel it took very long for the government to take a serious action for this. (Participant 3e, 2020) For these participants, it seems that their notion of risk, formulated through numbers, was rooted in what was happening in other European countries. In particular, the stark numbers emerging from Italy, especially when considered in relation to China, seemed to resonate with participants. This was particularly acute when discussions referred to these numbers to criticise government policy. Whilst not unanimous, a relatively coherent critique could be identified across all groups: the government saw the risk coronavirus posed from other countries yet did not act quick enough to prevent the virus from spreading in the UK. The narrative from these focus groups largely matches with the results of an online survey about COVID-19 conducted by researchers at ICL. Their findings highlight a similar level of distrust regarding government policy, with many participants believing that the UK would follow the same path as Italy, in terms of rising numbers of cases and deaths, if nothing was done (ICL, 2020) . This is a particularly important finding when we consider the analysis of political communication and news coverage above. It seems that focus group participants referred to numbers, and the narratives they underpinned, from the news media rather than politicians.",

Within the role as a mediator, the news media did not passively replicate government messages. Instead, their coverage fits within conventional normative assumptions about how the news media should actsuch as being a 'watchdog' and holding the government to account (Kovach and Rosenstiel, 2007) . Not only did they provide more specific statistical information than the government, but also did they used this information to criticise the official health policy. This critique provided a considerable counter-point to the government's messaging regarding continuity and control that was based on vague references to numbers. Such a finding counters some of the emerging literature regarding the coverage of coronavirus. Researchers found that newspaper coverage in Argentina, Mexico and the US followed efforts by public health authorities to create public engagement and, simultaneously, to contain a sense of alarm and control discourse about the pandemic (Hallin et al., 2020) .",

For our participants, the quantitative notion of risk was not expressed in terms of personal risk to the diseasefor example, you have a 2% chance of dying from coronavirusor in terms of the prevalence of the disease in the UK at a general levelfor example, there are around 10,000 cases in the UK. Instead, participants referred to the number of deaths per day observed in other countries that were deemed similar to the UK. This was most obviously observed in the data emerging from Italy. These daily death tolls operated in a similar way to projections. They functioned for our participants as a statistical foreshadowing of an impending health crisis. The exclusion of this information from the government press releases suggests that communication of risk during crises does not always emerge from the government. The news media play an active role too. In other words, the idealised flow of information from politicians, through the news media, to the public is less important in this case than the relationship between our participants and the information they received from journalists. The concerns expressed by SPI-B on 4 March 2020 over the news media presenting alternative public health policies to the public seem to have played out in practice (SAGE, 2020b).",
