Comparing the epidemic lifespan of the nodes with largest degrees with the infection time between them, we propose a general dual scenario, in which the epidemic transition is either ruled by a hub activation process, leading to a null threshold in the thermodynamic limit, or given by a collective activation process, corresponding to a standard phase transition with a finite threshold. We validate the proposed criterion applying it to different epidemic models, with waning immunity or heterogeneous infection rates in both synthetic and real SF networks. In particular, a waning immunity, irrespective of its strength, leads to collective activation with finite threshold in scale-free networks with large degree exponent, at odds with canonical theoretical approaches.",

            "text": "For epidemics leading to a steady (endemic) state, the main object of interest has been the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, which is defined as follows [6] : Individuals, represented as nodes in the network, can assume two different states, susceptible (S) or healthy, and infected (I ), and capable of transmitting the disease. Infected individuals recover and become spontaneously susceptible again with a rate \u03b2 that can be taken equal to 1. Transmission of the disease is effected by a rate to transmit the disease through an edge connecting an infected to a susceptible node equal to a constant \u03bb. After a considerable theoretical effort, it has been shown that the behavior of the SIS model in uncorrelated [2] SF networks is far from trivial [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Two competing theories were initially proposed to account for the SIS epidemic threshold. Heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) theories [1] , neglecting both dynamical and topological correlations, provide a threshold \u03bb HMF c = k / k 2 [8, 17] , which tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit for \u03b3 3, and is finite for \u03b3 > 3. Quenched mean-field (QMF) theory [9] , including the full network structure through its adjacency matrix A ij [2] , but still neglecting dynamical correlations, predicts instead a threshold \u03bb QMF c 1/ m , where m is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The scaling form of this threshold is given by [11, 18] \u03bb QMF c 1/ \u221a k max for \u03b3 > 5/2, where k max is the maximum degree in the network, while for \u03b3 < 5/2 it yields \u03bb QMF c k / k 2 in agreement with HMF theory. Numerical simulations [11, 12, 14] indicate that QMF is qualitatively correct in SF networks, implying that the epidemic threshold vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when k max diverges, irrespective of the degree exponent \u03b3 .",

The fact that the lifetime \u03c4 rec k is diverging with degree k faster than \u03c4 inf k,k for any value of \u03bb is the ultimate cause of the null epidemic threshold in the SIS model [10, 14, 15] . However, other epidemic and dynamical models on SF networks, in particular the contact process (CP) [19] , defined by an infection rate inversely proportional to the degree of the infected node, \u03bb/k, possess a finite threshold which can be better captured in terms of a HMF theory [20, 21] .

Here we determine the recovery \u03c4 rec and infection \u03c4 inf time scales of hubs for generic epidemic models including waning immunity and arbitrary edge-dependent infection rates and, building on these results, we propose a classification of endemic epidemic transitions on networks: When \u03c4 rec \u03c4 inf , a scenario of local hub activation with mutual hub reinfection is at work [14] , leading to \u03bb c \u2192 0 when the recovery times diverge in the thermodynamic limit. In such scenario, QMF theories are expected to be qualitatively correct. On the other hand, for \u03c4 rec \u03c4 inf , mutual hub reinfection cannot take place, and an endemic state is possible only through a collective activation of the whole network in a standard phase transition occurring at a finite threshold. In this second scenario, HMF theories should be correct.",

To estimate this quantity, we approximate the dynamics of a hub of degree k by that of a star-like graph, composed by a center connected to k nodes (leaves) of arbitrary degree, the red nodes in Fig. 1 (c), where we neglect infection coming from outside the star. For analytical tractability, we consider a simplified generic epidemic process with two states (S, I ) in the leaves and three states (S, I , R) in the center. The rate of infection along an edge from a leaf to the center is approximated by \u03bb in k and from the center to a leaf by \u03bb out k , see Eq. (1); that is, we consider the effect of the leaves as an average over their possible degree values k , weighted with the probability P (k |k). The transitions I \u2192 S (leaves), I \u2192 R and R \u2192 S (center) have constant rates \u03b2, \u03b2, and \u03b1, respectively. The lifespan for this dynamics is larger than in the real model, where leaves can also assume the R state, and so it provides an upper bound for the true \u03c4 rec k . We approximate this dynamics in a star as follows: (i) At t = 0 the center is infected and all leaves are susceptible.",

This collective transition is consistent with the finite threshold numerically observed in the CP on SF networks [20, 21] , in agreement with HMF predictions [19, 21] . Interestingly in the case of the CP, the QMF prediction [30] coincides with the HMF theory [19] , \u03bb c = 1, indicating a threshold completely independent of the network structure.

These results are backed up by numerical simulations of the KJI model on star graphs; see Fig. 2(a) . The mutual infection time of hubs for \u03b8 < 1/2 scales similarly as in the SIS dynamics \u03c4 inf,KJI \u223c N [(\u03b3 \u22123)/(\u03b3 \u22121)]b(\u03bb) for \u03b3 > 3 and \u03c4 inf,KJI \u223c const for \u03b3 < 3, the only difference being in the factor\u03bb = \u03bb k \u2212\u03b8 k 1\u2212\u03b8 / k . For \u03b8 1/2, we have 1/\u03bb out k and thus \u03c4 inf,KJI diverging as in the CP case. Thus, in the case \u03b3 > 3, where HMF and QMF predictions disagree markedly for \u03b8 < 1/2, we obtain that, for \u03b8 < 1/2, the transition should be driven by a hub activation mechanism, since in this region \u03c4 rec \u03c4 inf , and thus should correspond to a vanishing threshold, qualitatively in agreement with QMF, which indeed predicts a threshold \u03bb QMF,KJI c \u223c k \u03b8\u22121/2 max ; see Appendix A. For \u03b8 > 1/2, on the other hand, the hub lifetime is finite, compatible with a collectively activated transition, and corresponding to a finite threshold, in agreement with both HMF and QMF theories. These predictions are verified in Fig. 2(b) by means of numerical simulations of the KJI model on SF networks using the quasistationary (QS) method [20, 31] , estimating the effective threshold for each network size as the position of the main peak shown by the susceptibility \u03c7 = N ( \u03c1 2 \u2212 \u03c1 )/ \u03c1 (see Appendix C for simulation details). For values of \u03b8 close to 1/2, however, long crossovers are found in the threshold, in analogy with the behavior observed in the lifespan of stars. Indeed, after a crossover that can be very long as \u03b8 approaches 1/2, the epidemic lifetime of the KJI model on star graphs of increasing size reaches the asymptotic regime of a stretched exponential; see Fig. 2 . These crossovers, also observed in the numerical estimate of the QMF threshold (see Appendix A), explain the apparently constant threshold observed in Fig. 2 for \u03b8 = 0.4. Equivalent scenarios can be drawn for \u03b3 < 3 with critical values of \u03b8 smaller than 1/2.",

The scenario that we expect in this range of \u03b3 values is thus a SIS-like transition, with the hub reinfection mechanism at work and a vanishing epidemic threshold, in qualitative agreement with QMF. In order to check the prediction, we have performed numerical simulations of the SIRS model on SF networks using the QS method (see Appendix C for details).

We consider in particular the location-based social network Gowalla [33] and the product copurchasing network in the Amazon website [34] , possessing degree exponents smaller and larger than 3, respectively; Fig. 5 (c). According to QMF theory, the thresholds for these networks are equal to the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of their adjacency matrix. By means of a numerical diagonalization, we obtain the values \u03bb QMF,Gowalla c = 0.0059 and \u03bb QMF,Amazon c = 0.042. Our simulations show, in the case of the Gowalla network, with a degree exponent \u03b3 2.4 < 3, that numerically estimated thresholds are essentially independent of \u03b1 and very close to the QMF prediction. This behavior is consistent with the theoretical expectation of a hub activated dynamics, to be observed in the regime \u03b3 < 3; see Fig. 5(a) . On the other hand, for the Amazon network, with degree exponent \u03b3 \u2248 3.5 > 3, we observe effective thresholds that diminish with increasing \u03b1, approaching the QMF prediction for \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e.

            "text": "In the present paper, building on an extension of the theory of Ref. [14] , we have proposed a general criterion to discern the nature of thresholds in epidemic models. The criterion is based on the comparison of the time scales of hub recovery (lifespan) and hub reinfection. When the lifespan is larger than the infection time, dynamics is triggered by a hub activation process, akin to the SIS dynamics: Hubs survive for very long times, and are able to reinfect each other, in such a way as to establish a long-lived endemic state. This hub activation scenario leads to a vanishing threshold when the lifespan is diverging faster than the reinfection time in the thermodynamic limit. In this case, QMF theories are expected to be qualitatively correct. The reason underlying the effectiveness of QMF theories lies in the fact that they take into account the full topological structure of the network, and are dominated by the effects of the largest hubs. On the other hand, for a lifespan smaller than the infection time scale, hub activation cannot be sustained and possible epidemic phase transitions should be the result of a collective activation process, leading to a standard phase transition at a finite threshold, as in the case of the CP. In this second scenario, HMF theories should be qualitatively correct, due to the fact that they work on the annealed network approximation, in which every node can interact with every other with a degree dependent probability [35] . To check the validity of the criterion, we have investigated a generic epidemic model with spontaneous recovering, waning immunity, and edge degree dependent infection rates on scalefree networks, for which we can compute analytic expressions for the hub recovery and infection time scales. The model has as particular cases the fundamental epidemic models, as the SIS, SIRS, and CP as well as more complex ones as the generalized SIS model of Ref. [23] , which we have considered. After exemplifying our framework with the known cases of the SIS and CP models, we present an extended discussion of the SIRS model, an extension of the SIS model with waning immunity. While previous analytic approaches (HMF and QMF theories) predict for the SIRS model the same behavior as the SIS model, the main result from our criterion is that we are able to show that, instead, the effect of even a small amount of waning immunity is able to restore a finite threshold (albeit affected by possible strong finite-size effects) in scale-free networks with degree exponent \u03b3 > 3, at odds with the QMF theory valid for SIS in this regime, and in agreement with HMF theory. Our predictions are corroborated by means of numerical simulation on synthetic uncorrelated scale-free networks, as well as on real correlated networks.",
