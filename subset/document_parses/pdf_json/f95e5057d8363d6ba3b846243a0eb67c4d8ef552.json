Communities of color were disproportionately impacted by social conditions (i.e., disparities in poverty, housing, education, and wage), systemic and structural racism, limited access to health care, and other health comorbidity factors that led to elevated risks for a COVID-19 infection and deaths in these communities (13, 14) . Additionally, a higher proportion of individuals of color were deemed essential front-line workers and suffered from higher rates of COVID-19 exposure as early lockdowns were put into place (15) . In San Francisco, CA, Latinx/Hispanic individuals comprised 80% of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and 20% to 25% of all COVID-19 cases, despite only making up 15% of the total population (12) . In April of 2020, preliminary data reported from the CDC showed that black/African American communities made up 34% of all U.S. COVID-19 cases, while only making up about 13% of the national population (16) . Additionally, while only 20% of the U.S. counties are predominantly black/African American, 52% of the COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of the COVID-19 deaths occurred in these counties (13) . Differences in early spread and impact of COVID-19 across urban populations and communities of color possibly shaped worry and concern surrounding contracting COVID- 19 .",

Higher reports of fear and anxiety related to the coronavirus pandemic occurred globally (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . For example, Akdinez (18) found that 90% of all people surveyed increased the frequency of handwashing due to the virus, as well as a 50% increase in people wearing gloves. Similarly, Li et al. (24) found an increase in sleep disturbance and suicidal thoughts related to the pandemic, commonly caused by worry, decreases in social interactions, and lower perceived social support. Gender differences were found with COVID worry, where female worry was linked to health concerns associated with the COVID-19 virus and male worry more strongly linked to economic and societal changes that accompanied COVID-19 restrictions (25, 26) . Gender expressive and non-binary communities reported greater stress due to barriers to gender-affirming health care and legal rights, as well as social isolation (27, 28) . Media sources pertaining to the virus appeared to shape anxiety levels, with social media posts reportedly causing more worry than information obtained through academic sources (29) .",

This transition affected both primary education and university students, with virtual learning reducing students' access to necessary materials and interpersonal interaction, thereby reducing their ability to engage (30) (31) (32) . This shift in the learning environment affected other academic, social, mental, and physical aspects of the university experience as well, as students reported reduced connections with peers and faculty and greater feelings of isolation (33), a reduced sense of belonging, and higher rates of mental health distress, which could impact student success and retention (34) (35) (36) . At another university in the Southeastern United States, 71% of students reported increased levels of stress and anxiety related to the pandemic, resulting in difficulty concentrating, reduced sleep, decreased social interactions, and fear and worry about the health and wellbeing of loved ones (21, 37) . Young adults experienced a higher rate of suicidal thoughts as a result of the pandemic (10) . Alterations in university function negatively impacted students by reducing their access to core necessities such as reliable food, housing, and Internet, along with disability services and university job income (33) . Many schools transitioned from remote to in-person instruction during the Fall of 2020, which brought challenges to both students and faculty in balancing worry with the desire for connection with others.",

Female students were more likely to report negative effects from social isolation, report higher rates of stress, and more readily used social media to cope with the social isolation associated with the pandemic relative to male peers (38, 39) . Additionally, a study by Zhu (40) found that males utilized video games as a distracting coping mechanism during the pandemic, while females turned to social media outlets, which potentially exposed them to more fear-based articles about the pandemic (41) , and thus, may have exacerbated their anxiety. Additionally, individuals who previously suffered from mental health concerns, such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) prior to the pandemic reported a worsening of symptoms during the pandemic (42) (43) (44) . Mental health struggles plagued black/African American and Latinx/Hispanic communities during the pandemic compared with white Americans (10, 11, 33, 34) . Thus, life changes due to disruptions to learning environment, changes in social connections, and social resources may have contributed to student mental health struggles associated with the virus (18, 19, 25, 32, 39) .",

At the time of this survey, 5.57 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in the United States, accounting for approximately 24.5% of all cases since the pandemic began (5). Our goal was to explore if there were differences in how COVID-19 impacted everyday lives of students enrolled within biology courses from differing demographic groups. Specifically, we asked how (i) COVID-19 worry, (ii) stress response, and (iii) COVID-19-related food insecurity differs in race/ethnicity (Indigenous American, Asian/Asian American, black/African American, Latinx/Hispanic, white, or multiple races) and gender (cis male, cis female, gender expressive) across students attending the University of South Alabama, and whether the size of the individuals' community of origin relate to overall worry about the pandemic.",

Factor 1 corresponded to a combination of the COVID-19 danger and contamination and COVID-19 contamination measures on the COVID-19 Stress Scales. Factor 2, \"COVID-19 stress response, \" grouped survey questions together that asked students about the extent that the virus was affecting their mental state, including disturbing thoughts, dreams, and mental images relating to COVID-19 (Table 3) ; this factor explained 9% of variation in questionnaire data. Factor 2 corresponded to a combination of the COVID-19 traumatic stress and COVID-19 compulsive checking measures on the COVID-19 Stress Scales. The third factor, \"Food insecurity, \" explained an additional 3% of variation and grouped questions related to students worrying about grocery stores running out of food and water, as well as grocery store closures related to the pandemic.

The first principal component of each factor of interest made up over 60% of the variation in the data and explained 63% of the data variation for COVID-19 worry, 69% of the variation for COVID-19 stress, and 89% of the variation for food insecurity. Scores from the first principal components of each of our three factor groupings were used as response variables within an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with race/ethnicity, gender, size of hometown, and interactions between them as predictor variables. If no significant interaction effects were found, we removed interaction terms from our model. Next, to determine differences within treatments, we conducted a Tukey post-hoc test on significant predictor variables using the TukeyHSD function. Finally, we plot modeled parameter estimates from predictor variables after accounting for other predictor variables using the effects package (52) with the ggplot2 package (53) .

            "text": "We surveyed returning college students enrolled in biology courses during the Fall of 2020 to understand how our student body was experiencing COVID-19-related worry, stress responses, and food insecurity. We found racial and gender differences in worry and food insecurities associated with COVID-19. Overall, we found that black/African American, Asian/Asian American, and Latinx/Hispanic students were significantly more worried about contracting and transmitting COVID-19 compared with white peers, and female and gender expressive students were 15% and 40% more worried about contracting COVID-19 relative to male peers. Students that grew up in larger metropolitan areas were significantly more worried about contracting and transmitting COVID-19 relative to peers from more rural communities. Additionally, we found that black/African American and Asian/Asian American students significantly more worried about food insecurities associated with COVID-19 relative to their white peers. Surprisingly, the higher rates of worry associated with COVID-19 did not translate to higher self-reported stress responses-sleeplessness, panic attacks, nightmares, etc.-for students of color. Conversely, gender expressive students exhibited greater stress responses. Overall, our results are reflective of the struggles met by communities of color that were evident during early parts of the pandemic. Additionally, it highlights differences in the COVID-19related stressors and coping among gender. At the time we conducted our survey, the virus had infected 5.57 million people and resulted in 174,300 deaths in the United States alone (5) . The pandemic took an enormous toll on the economy, social structure, and the mental health of many Americans. Students across the country reported increased levels of stress and anxiety associated to the coronavirus, with some gender disparities being reported. Another university in the Southeastern United States found 71% of students reported increased levels of stress, leading to reductions in sleep, concentration, and social interactions (2, 21) . Our results revealed previously reported factors surrounding stress and coping, while illuminating some curious findings as well.",

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that male gender was a protective factor against stress (54) , and that females may be more vulnerable to anxiety and stress, which was also present in this study. To date, few studies examined relationships between student demographics and the COVID-19 virus, such as one study looking at gender disparities and found that females were more likely to report negative effects from social isolation compared to males, reported higher rates of stress, and more readily used social media to cope with the social isolation associated with the pandemic (38, 39) . Additionally, a study by Zhu (40) found that males utilized video games as a distracting coping mechanism during the pandemic, while females turned to social media outlets, which potentially exposed them to more fear-based articles about the pandemic (41) , and thus, may have exacerbated their anxiety. A recent study by Takmaz et al. (55) reported similar levels of COVID-19 worry associated with virus danger and fears of contamination, contamination worry, and traumatic stress and compulsive checking responses for women surveyed in the Fall of 2020. Our study adds to recent studies highlighting the challenges that female college students have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, gender expressive students-students reporting as non-binary, transgender, gender fluid, gender queerreported higher worry and stress responses compared to their male counterparts. Because only seven total students that identified as gender expressive participated within our student questionnaire, we must take our results with a grain of skepticism; however, student experiences from this marginalized group do reflect the results obtained within other recent reports. A recent paper by Woulfe and Wald (28) found that gender expressive individuals reported higher stress during the pandemic because of greater barriers to gender-affirming health care. The pandemic possibly worsened this health care gap and made gender affirming individuals more worried about medical care, should they get sick with COVID-19. The CDC reported in February that gender and sexual minority individuals had higher rates of underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk hospitalization or death due to COVID-19. Another study in major U.S. cities suggested that trans women faced increased harm associated with COVID-19 due to employment, income, and vulnerability to mistreatment in health care (56) . Thus, gender-expressive students likely encountered additional stressors during COVID-19, especially in places like the Southeastern U.S. where access to culturally competent and gender affirming health and mental care is a challenge. The most curious finding of this study was the lack of selfreported stress responses in students of color, despite reporting higher worry. We would have expected that the levels of worry reported for students of color would be reflected in stress as well, as the effect size was quite significant. This raised questions about the prospect of how racism and microaggressions may serve as mediating variables in these data. Though blatant racism has appeared to diminish over time (57) , systemic and structural racism may be increasing (58), along with more covert forms such as microaggressions (57) . The impact of these types of racism can result in racial trauma, which can impact the individual experiencing this with extensive and enduring symptoms that mirror those in posttraumatic stress disorder (59) . However, racial trauma is not always considered in a health care setting because of the diagnostic criteria requiring exposure to a traumatic event, not frequent or persistent occurrences. Research suggests that microaggressions can be predictive of depressive and anxiety symptomology, as well as sleep and somatic issues (60, 61) . Most studies suggest that racial microaggressions and trauma symptomology are correlated, however, studies also show that individuals who experience a trauma event do not always report that trauma symptomology are connected to experience with race (62) . It is unclear whether life experiences impacted underreporting of trauma symptoms, or whether these individuals may dismiss their own symptomology as \"normal\" due to the dismissal of race related trauma in health care and educational settings (63) . Additionally, we do not know how much the region and culture impact this facet of the study, which should be investigate more thoroughly in the future.",

            "text": "Overall, fear of contracting the COVID-19 virus was directly related to the early transmission and severity of symptoms associated during early pandemic in the Southeastern U.S. (12, 13) . COVID-19 disproportionally impacted communities of color (13) which likely shaped why students of color experienced greater worry and food insecurities while trying to function in an academic setting. The overall demographic makeup of Mobile, Alabama, which is home to 188,720 individuals, is a predominantly black/African American community, with black/African Americans making up approximately 52% of the overall population. Additionally, Mobile, Alabama is a highly urbanized area and about 25% of its citizens living below the poverty line (64) . Since 2001, black/African American and Latinx/Hispanic households were twice as likely to experience food insecurity compared with white households at any given time (65, 66) . Following the start of the pandemic, hoarding practices also led to mass shortages of food and cleaning supplies in stores all across the country (67), further fueling the fear and worry surrounding the virus. It is logical that individuals from more densely populated regions had higher worry than those from less populated regions, as exposure was greater and ability to isolate from people was less available. While strong patterns of COVID-19 worry, stress, and food insecurity were observed across gender, race/ethnicity, and size of the community students grew up in, we found no consistent patterns within other demographic groupings that we looked at. For instance, we measured student year in school, first generation college student status, whether students were enrolled in biology courses as majors or non-majors, how far students commuted to campus daily, and whether students were born internationally and none of those demographic variables significantly predicted COVID-19 worry, stress, or food insecurities (Table S2 ). This suggests that our results may extend beyond the biology department and may help us understand student COVID-19 worry and stress campus-wide and should serve as a guide for helping university campuses future campus closures and transitions to and from virtual learning. Long-term COVID-19 worry, stress, and food insecurities will continue to be monitored as we continue to navigate COVID-19 variants and the subsequent rises and declines in cases and hospitalizations.",

The decision to re-open college campuses to in-person instruction, the start of college athletics, and any other in-person events, highlighted new challenges for the students (7, 30) . We found that COVID stress and worry was lower in our study relative to studies using the COVID-19 Stress Scales from the spring and summer of 2020 (43, 68) ; however, COVID worry and stress was similar in women that were collected during the Fall of 2020 (55) .

Our findings highlight the impact of the pandemic on multiple groups of potentially marginalized students including women, gender expressive students, and students of color.

Vaccine distribution has changed people's concerns for mask wearing, social distancing, and hygiene, but the new strains have proven to be even more infectious. As new challenges are presented, it will be critical to gather this information so universities can ensure proper resources are available to all students. We advocate for the application of lessons that we have learned during the COVID-19 pandemic to alter university policies and procedures during future natural disasters, pandemics, or major disruptions in college learning. It is important to monitor student health during any major shift in societal norms and structure, such as during elections, wars, and campus shootings. When the norms are disrupted, student mental health and wellbeing can be impacted. Having programs on campus to help with these issues as they arise will be critical to help catch psychiatric distress before it becomes more dysfunctional. Future work should attempt to understand how students develop and implement coping resources to overcome and persevere through worry and stress related to university disruptions (39, 69, 70) .",

Any broad-scale conclusions across all college students or different university contexts based on our findings would be erroneous, although our results are in-line with previously published papers (21, (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) 55) . All aspects of the students' living situation were not incorporated into this study. We must acknowledge the limitations of the number of participants in our survey that identify as gender expressive (n = 7) or diverse racial/ethnic groups (Indigenous/Native Americans n = 6, Latinx n =13), which may hinder the interpretation of our findings. We chose to retain these students even if we cannot make strong inferences from these groups rather than omit them from our study.
