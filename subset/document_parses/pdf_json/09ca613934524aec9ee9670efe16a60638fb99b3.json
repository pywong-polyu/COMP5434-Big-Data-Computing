Incorrectly discharging a patient may risk clinical worsening leading to readmission 3 or even death, 4 while admitting a patient who does not necessarily require inpatient-level care may risk in-hospital adverse events 5 and contributes to overall boarding/crowding and system strain. 6 Sizeable variation in admission rates exist by hospital and physician. 7 8 While there are differences in individual physician practice Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba Focuses on admission decision making for a population of patients without the level of definite medical acuity to warrant inpatient care but considered for hospitalisation for other reasons. \u25ba Makes use of a novel approach that captures inthe-moment decision making as documented by the physician involved in admission evaluation, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of other retrospective or criteriabased methods. \u25ba Examines written narratives from the physician using a qualitative approach to thoroughly capture what factors are considered as well as how the decision is made. \u25ba Single-site study conducted in the US where use of triage hospitalists is relatively common, thus findings may not be broadly applicable elsewhere. \u25ba Research protocol based on written database entries from one physician's perspective lacks the ability to probe or clarify information as in an interview process or to integrate multiple physician perspectives.",

[22] [23] [24] It has been reported that factors not directly related to the patient's acute medical illness such as lack of social support or follow-up, departmental constraints and poor information flow influence hospitalisation, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] but there remains need for more comprehensive understanding of the process as a whole. How is the admission decision arrived at and how are various contributing factors integrated into the decision? Additionally, most of the current literature focuses on ED physician perspective even as internal medicine trained hospitalists increasingly serve in the role of 'triage physician' providing an inpatient-based acute care screening and approval for admissions. 30 31 We propose that hospitalists can provide a useful vantage point from which to learn more about this phenomenon.",

During weekly team meetings with the principal investigator (MB), discrepancies were identified and reconciled. In addition, new entries to the codebook were suggested for emerging themes that had not previously been captured. Once thematic saturation was achieved, a comparison sample between coders measured inter-rater reliability with Cohen's kappa score 0.79. After completion of the first round of coding as the group reviewed and organised the findings, we agreed that enough information was available to encompass what factors were being considered by the triage physicians and how they affected decision making and any additional actions the triage physician took. We revised the codebook slightly to fit this shift in focus and applied the final version to all entries. From here, we built a conceptual model by mapping themes and subthemes into phases of decision making.",

Or, sometimes the lack of access was assumed by the physician based on history: '[symptomatic anemia] patient seemed to have cognitive impairment and had missed other outpatient appts for work-up; didn't have case manager or anyone at home to remind him to seek care, so it seemed better to admit him and complete his w/u' (#84). Living alone and lacking sufficient supports to independently manage an illness was cause to consider hospitalisation. In some instances, the medical need was thought to be relatively minor but unable to be provided outside of the hospital due to other social barriers: 'Patient has COPD, was desatting with ambulation, but probably not much different from his usual baseline. Unfortunately, he lives at [homeless shelter] and cannot be set up with home oxygen' (#58). Reciprocally, medical illness also served as a barrier to social stability and in fact could create or contribute to an unmet social need: 'Patient is actually near her baseline from CKD/CHF standpoint, but cannot ambulate to the bathroom quickly enough and is incontinent; was kicked out of her motel and shelters for wetting the bed' (#215).",

            "text": "Our findings are congruent with previous research indicating that physicians commonly operate outside the guidance of clinical risk scoring tools that stratify patients into those appropriate for admission vs discharge. [37] [38] [39] Clinical uncertainty 40 has been posited as a key underlying driver in these guideline-discordant admissions; our findings take this one step further and suggest that the mechanism by which uncertainty leads to hospitalisation is via the concern for an unmet need that leads to perception of elevated risk if discharged. Furthermore, we propose that our model provides deeper context to understand findings in healthcare utilisation literature. For example, despite focused attention, so-called 'inappropriate' admissions (in which patients do not receive inpatient level care and therefore are thought not to have benefited) continue to be prevalent. [41] [42] [43] [44] We found that physicians thoroughly considered the provision of a safe disposition; when structures around patients were inconsistent or unreliable and this placed the individual at risk, hospitalisation was considered but generally not until other options had been significantly explored. Thus, the term 'inappropriate admission' is an oversimplification of the phenomenon and requires broadening to encompass the full capacity of concerns being addressed at time of admission. Likewise, the model proposed in this manuscript expands on the notion of what has been called 'unwarranted variation' or 'variation that we couldn't explain based on the basis of illness, patient preference, or medical science' 45 by identifying that physicians make decisions with their patients in a broader context than the purely biomedical. Sutherland and Levesque's 46 analytic framework published in 2020 describes 'warranted variation' through the three key perspectives of capacity (intrac table resource constraints and unpredictable events; proficiency-based service delivery), agency (patients' needs; patients' informed expectations) and evidence (judgement used to interpret and apply evidence in local context; equivocal evidence or diffusion of innovation). In this light, much of the admission decision-making process outlined in this study reflects components of warranted variation. Each individual healthcare site and surrounding community has its own mix of resources that influence provision of care for any unmet medical and social needs identified. Each patient has a unique set of individual circumstances, social factors, environmental details and health requirements. Each provider must navigate these complex situations to determine the appropriate risk/benefit litmus for admission versus discharge. In a space in which there exist such wideranging considerations, very little comprehensive guidance, and a potentially high-stakes decision, then, it is not entirely surprising to see prognostic variability and decision-making heterogeneity, manifested in our study as both the initial discrepancy between referring ED Open access provider (who called for admission) and triage physician (who questioned the definite need for such) as well as the 'physician disagreement' identified as a phase 3 theme.",

As we describe, they often attempted to intervene in aspects of care coordination with varying degrees of success.
