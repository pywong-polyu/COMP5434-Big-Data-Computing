The second definition is an objective function metric, which depends on the balance and extent to which our two conditions are fulfilled. The aim is to solve the differential equations, and find decisions affecting their boundary conditions that are optimal and maximize the objective function. Our equation set is based on a standard Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered (SEIR) model framework (7) . Each of the four compartments has a modeled population, and as time evolves, people move through each class toward recovery (or death). The novel part of our analysis is that the SEIR equations are solved for two groups (i.e., communities). The first community is a non-quarantined group, and during the full lockdown, this represents the essential workers required to maintain health provision, or essential services. The second community is those in quarantine.

This is high when many people are removed from quarantine, as they are available to work-a desirable outcome. However, its value switches to a near-infinite negative should the health service threshold be crossed due to high infection numbers. Our model calculates the highest possible objective function (the optimal strategy) and returns the number of release dates, their time of occurrence, and the number of people at each time. For comparison, we perform parallel simulations, where we release all in quarantine to the non-quarantine pool, but allow the return to quarantine later if necessary, should infections risk exceeding the capacity of the health services.

However, models are especially useful in two circumstances, and that we exploit. First, although simulations may lack absolute precision, predictions will have some level of robustness. Such predictions give strong indications of expected responses to a range of different boundary conditions, i.e., alternative release scenarios. Numerical model flexibility and speed of operation enables \"what if?\" questions to be asked of alternative forms of graded lockdown release. Second, by repeated operation of a model, it is possible to scan across ranges of parameter values. After governments start to release people, changes to infection levels can be compared against ensembles of simulations with perturbed parameters. Data-model comparison allows selection of the most appropriate parameter value; an approach sometimes referred to as \"adaptive learning.\" The trajectory for that value becomes a more reliable forecast for the days and weeks beyond the available data. Evidence this approach is feasible is illustrated in data of infections in countries before and during a lockdown.

(8) calculated an R 0 of 1.15-4.77 when fitting to data from the initial outbreak in Wuhan. This corresponds in our case to a \u03b2 ranging from roughly 0.25-1.06. Similarly, when fitting to data from the initial outbreak in Italy, Giordano et al. (9) estimated a total transmission rate of 1.048, split between the four different infected classes they considered. These data-fit estimations risk failing to capture the impact of asymptomatic or unrecorded individuals, especially for the wider-ranging classes of our model, with a vision toward informing policy. For this reason, our sensitivity analyses (below) also consider transmission rates up to twice as high as these values.

Any decision to begin easing lockdown measures will require constant monitoring and a high-level of population testing to track the likely rise toward a second-peak of infections. We show that employing a gradual release strategy, where groups of the population are slowly released from quarantine sequentially, will slow the arrival of any subsequent infection peaks compared to an on-off strategy, where lockdown is ended for all individuals imminently and reinstated when subsequent infections begin to increase. In all considered instances (i.e., parameter variations), it will not be possible to end lockdown for the entire population for any longer than 2 weeks, as the number of infected individuals is then expected to quickly overwhelm the health service following such a release. By ensuring that the increase in the number of infected individuals is as slow as possible, this will enable health officials to monitor more accurately the evolving situation, and provide more time to respond to unexpected increases in the number of infected individuals. We note that our approach does not consider the ethical responsibilities that will also impact any policy decision. If enough hospital provision was available, many more people can return to employment, but we recognize this will result in increased risk of further mortalities.

While it is desirable to return the population to work as early as possible, our optimal calculation states that this 1-2 weeks \"wait\" period is crucial in ensuring that the number of infected individuals is as low as possible when ending any lockdown measures, to reduce the growth of new cases. After this sufficient, cautious, wait period has ended, people should then be released from quarantine, with the knowledge that as many as 1 in 100 of them (under the worst-case scenario) may require critical care (10) in the coming months.

Such measures can be in tandem with strong policies to shield the most vulnerable. The authors note that with varied approaches to lockdown release by differing countries, there is an opportunity to learn from this by intercomparison. Undoubtedly, all countries leaving lockdown, however implemented, will heavily scrutinize data for any evidence of an emerging \"second wave\" of infections.

This would further ease any subsequent strain on the health system, and potentially further bolster a herd-immunity effect. We stress, however, that any decision to gradually release a proportion of the population by demographic criteria must be supported by periodical biomolecular investigation into the infectivity of such a group, as any sector released from quarantine will immediately be at increased risk, and may infect others.
