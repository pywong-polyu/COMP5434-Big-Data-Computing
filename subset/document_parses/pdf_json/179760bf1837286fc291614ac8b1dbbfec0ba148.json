Biosci. Eng. 17(4):2853-2861, 2020). Important properties of the model, like nonnegativity of solutions and their boundedness, are established. Also, we have calculated the basic reproduction number which is an important parameter in the infection models. From stability analysis of the model, it is found that stability of the biologically feasible steady states are determined by the basic reproduction number (\u03c7 0 ). Numerical simulations are done in order to substantiate analytical results. A biological implication from this study is that a COVID-19 patient with less than one basic reproduction ratio can automatically recover from the infection.",

During this rampant situation, to stop the virus propagation, almost all the regions of the world have been locked-down by applying strict social distancing measures and banned social gathering in all circumstances. Research is going on all over the world to control this epidemic from different points of view, such as pathology [2, 3] , microbiology [4, 5] , mathematics [6, 7] , and so on [8] [9] [10] .

            "text": "As we know, mathematical studies demonstrate the best strategies for controlling any type of disease or virus infection in humans [11, 12] . The modeling of any disease helps to decide on public health and introduces the disease treatment. When the primary studies of any deadly disease cannot give us any concluding remarks to take significant decisions to control the pandemic situation, the key facts of mathematical modeling always help the human civilization. Mathematical models of viral dynamics with viral and antiviral drug effects are examined and assisted by their transparent structures and biologically feasible parameters. There is much work to be done now and in the future to assess the figure of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Also, a few studies focused on confirmed cases, risk history, and disease schedule characteristics [8, 12, 13] . Mathematical models of epidemiology have been developed to help policymakers in making the right decisions at the right time. These models highlight that isolation plays an important role in controlling the spread of the virus [6, 13] . But this is not a solution to the long-term vision as a country's economic growth globally is declining due to the locked-downs to maintain social distancing [7] . Therefore, researchers and scientists are now developing dynamic viral within-host models to understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. To date, only a few host-level models [4, 5] have been developed to understand the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and its interactions with the immune system. Most of them are linked to HIV [14] , hepatitis virus [15] , Ebola [16] , influenza [9, 17] , and other models.",

At this stage of the virus route, the T cells activate and further they involve differentiation. Besides, the T cells produce cytokines (INF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10) associated with the different types of a T cell. A large amount of cytokines provides a greater activation of the immune response to fight the virus. Particularly T cells, CD4 + T cells, and CD8 + T cells have played a significant antiviral role in a fight against pathogens. There is also a risk of mounting autoimmunity or devastating inflammation. CD4 + T cells help the immune system of the body by generating virus-specific antibodies with the activation of T-dependent B cells. However, CD8 + T cells can kill virally infected cells, as they are cytotoxic. In general, a large number of CD8 + T cells in the infected SARS-CoV-2 body are found in nearly 80% of the total infiltrative inflammatory cells in the interstitial pulmonary tract, which play a significant role in clearing CoVs. The loss of CD4 + T cells is correlated with reduced conscription of lymphocytes and neutralizing the production of antibodies and cytokines, resulting in severe immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed SARS-CoV lung clearance [2, 18] .",

As stated by Theorem 3, the noninfected steady state S 1 (22.41, 0, 0) is globally asymptotically stable. This analytic result can be verified by Fig. 2(a) .

But with greater infection rate and other parameters in such a way that \u03c7 > 1, the viral load cannot be controlled and infection persists in the human body. This situation can be handled with a proper treatment strategy, otherwise the number of the virus-free epithelial cells will decrease and those of the virus-infected epithelial cells and the free virus will increase in a patient's body with time. As a result, the patient's condition will deteriorate with time, which will lead to extreme conditions like death of the patient. ",

First of all, we have proved that all analytic solutions of model (2.1) are nonnegative and uniformly bounded, conditions which are necessary for a biologically feasible model. For the model, we have found two biologically feasible steady states, noninfected and infected steady states. Local stability of both steady states was discussed. Also, we have found the global stability criteria for both steady states. Biologically, it follows that for the basic reproduction number \u03c7 0 < 1, infection will be cleared from a human body without any treatment; otherwise we have to implement some treatment in order to reduce and to remove the infection from the body. It is our future work to apply different treatment policies in this model in order to clear the virus from an infected human body. It is also found that if basic reproduction number is greater than one then infection will persist for any amount of viral load in the host's body.",
