            "text": "Flexible actuation of droplets is crucial for biomedical and industrial applications. Hence, various approaches using optical, electrical, and magnetic forces have been exploited to actuate droplets. For broad applicability, an ideal approach should be programmable and be able to actuate droplets of arbitrary size and composition. Here we present an \"additive-free\" magnetic actuation method to programmably manipulate droplets of water, organic, and biological fluids of arbitrary composition, as well as solid samples, on a ferrofluid-infused porous surface. We specifically exploit the spontaneously formed ferrofluid wetting ridges to actuate droplets using spatially varying magnetic fields. We demonstrate programmed processing and analysis of biological samples in individual drops as well as the collective actuation of large ensembles of micrometer-sized droplets. Such model respiratory droplets can be accumulated for improved quantitative and sensitive bioanalysis -an otherwise prohibitively difficult task that may be useful in tracking coronavirus.",

            "text": "I n a broad range of applications including microfluidics 1,2 , bioanalysis 3 , optofluidics 4 , and heat transfer [5] [6] [7] , flexible and programable actuation of droplets is highly demanded. To this end, a wide range of droplet actuation methods using optical [8] [9] [10] , electrical 11 , and magnetic [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] as well as chemical cues 6 have been developed. Successful approaches should allow for strong, reversible, and freely programmable droplet actuation while imposing as little restrictions as possible on droplet composition and sizes. For example, for microfluidics and bioanalysis, the approach should be compatible to biological fluids without suffering from fouling. For high precision analysis, the actuation of micro-sized droplets is needed, while for other applications the actuation of large droplets is required. However, the above requirements have remained challenging to fulfill. For example, electrowetting-on-dielectric, the most successful electrical droplet actuation method 11, 19, 20 , still suffers from long-term stability problems caused by electrical degradation [21] [22] [23] and biofouling 24 on intrinsically hydrophobic substrates. Alternatively, electrodewetting on hydrophilic substrates was proposed 25 . The direct contact between electrode and droplet, however, may cause electrochemical reactions. Contactless light [8] [9] [10] and magnetic [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] actuation methods may circumvent these problems. Yet, most light-based methods 9,10 suffer from slow droplet transport, due to the low actuation force provided by light. On the contrary, magnetic actuation, widely used in microfluidics and bioanalysis 12 , provides large force, and thus potentially fast droplet transport. Moreover, the electromagnets can be miniaturized down to microscale 26, 27 , holding promise for digital magnetic microfluidics 28, 29 . However, magnetic actuation generally necessitates magnetic additives in the droplets 28, 30 , which causes sample contamination concern. To address this problem, one could instead make the substrate magnetically active [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . So far, however, the control offered by these methods has been insufficient for digital microfluidics and other automated droplet operations.",

Contrary to most previous actuation methods that directly drive droplets, our WRAP method manipulates the ferrofluid wetting ridge which \"wraps\" and carries the droplet. Thanks to this indirect actuation, the method is tolerant to variable droplet compositions and properties. It allows to actuate a wide range of sizes of droplets of water, organic fluids, as well as complex biological materials as long as they are immiscible with the infusion liquid. In particular, WRAP does not require magnetic additives in the sample drop.",

To demonstrate the basic functionality of WRAP, we sprayed water droplets with diameters from \u223c10 \u00b5m to several hundreds of \u00b5m ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) onto a liquid-infused porous surface with \u223c2\u00b0contact angle hysteresis. The porous substrate ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) was infused with a ferrofluid consisting of silicone oil with Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (see Methods). Characterization of the ferrofluid properties is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 . An excess of several tens of micrometers of this fluid was kept on the surface. Together with the positive spreading parameter and the resulting cloaking layer of ferrofluid on the water 31,32 (see Supplementary  Table 1 ), this excess ensures that saturated wetting ridges form independently around each drop 33 . The infused ferrofluid imparts the surface with magnetic activity [15] [16] [17] [18] . Upon turning on an electromagnet (see Methods for details) underneath the sample, all droplets within a collection area of several cm 2 were quickly set in motion and accumulated within a single big drop on top of the magnet (Fig. 1a , Supplementary Video 1). By contrast, without magnetic actuation, the droplets could only randomly coalesce over the whole surface ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). 1 Magnetic actuation of additive-free droplets on ferrofluid-infused slippery surface. a Collective actuation of numerous micro-sized droplets.

            "text": "Before exploring these aspects, we focus on the actuation mechanism of WRAP. Optical imaging and high-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging both confirmed the spontaneous formation of a ferrofluid wetting ridge around each droplet ( Fig. 1b-d) . This wetting ridge is pulled up by capillary forces 34 . Its volume increases with increasing drop size. Far away from the magnet, its shape is governed by the balance of capillarity and gravity. However, being made out of ferrofluid, the wetting ridge is also subject to magnetic forces. This becomes particularly apparent directly on top of the magnet, where the magnetic stress competes with both capillarity and gravity to form a characteristic protrusion 35 (Fig. 1b , left, Supplementary  Fig. 5 ). Note that surface instability was not observed, which is explained in Supplementary Note 1). Far away from the magnet, however, magnetic forces are weak and the meniscus merely experiences a net force pulling it against the direction of the magnetic field gradient, as any dipole in an inhomogeneous external field. Such magnetic forces, drive the droplet (Fig. 1c , Supplementary Video 2). The ferrofluid infused in the porous surface also experiences magnetic forces, but its movement is significantly slower, and thus plays a minor role in the droplet actuation process ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). To explore the actuation force in more detail, we deposited droplets of variable size and surface tension on the surface and monitored their average velocity upon activating the magnet for ferrofluids with a variable weight concentration of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Upon activating the electromagnet, the droplets were immediately set in motion towards the magnet. The velocity, averaged over a travel distance of~2 cm, was found to increase with the concentration of Fe 3 O 4 particles in the ferrofluid (Fig. 1e) , suggesting that the magnetic force scales as the total magnetization of the wetting ridge. As we increase the drop size, we found the average speed to increase with the drop radius (Fig. 1f) . Finally, droplets with higher surface tension pull more strongly on the ferrofluid, resulting in larger volume (and hence the magnetization) of the wetting ridge. As a result, higher surface tension also led to an increased average sliding velocity (Fig. 1g) . Note that the high absolute drop velocities up to 5 mm/s were facilitated by the excess of ferrofluid on the sample, which guarantees the formation of a fully developed wetting ridge with minimum viscous dissipation 36 .",

            "text": "Versatility of WRAP. The above results suggest that WRAP can actuate droplets both individually (Fig. 1c , e-g) and collectively (Fig. 1a ). In addition, WRAP offers a range of unique advantages. First, the indirect actuation via the wetting ridge allows to manipulate a wide range of fluids, from pure water, to organics (Fig. 1g) , and biological droplets with complex composition. In Fig. 2a -c, we demonstrate the actuation of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, a widely used basal medium to support cell growth, Fig. 2a ), fetal bovine serum (FBS, Fig. 2b ), and buffy coat (Fig. 2c) . Second, WRAP can actuate solid samples such as dried E.coli samples (Fig. 2d , e) or synthesized chemical particles ( Supplementary Fig. 7) , since solid samples also naturally raise wetting ridges (Fig. 2d ). This is a function that is fundamentally impossible for many other droplet actuation methods. Third, WRAP can be operated on variable substrate geometries, such as straight ( Video 5). Moreover, the strength of the magnetic force is sufficient to actuate droplets against gravity, as demonstrated in Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 8 for 45\u00b0tilted surfaces, and a vertically oriented one in Fig. 2j (Supplementary Video 6) . Fourth, WRAP also allows for programmable actuation. As shown in Fig. 2k , a droplet (dyed for later fluorescence characterizations) can be actuated along complex paths (such as a letter 'M') by sequentially activating electromagnets at different locations beneath the surface (Supplementary Video 7) . Fifth, during all these operations, the anti-fouling properties of the liquid-infused surface that have been demonstrated in many previous studies 37, 38 are fully preserved: no traces of residual fluorescence could be detected after manipulating the dyed droplet along a complex path (Fig. 2l) . Finally, the choice of the ferrofluid is also versatile. For example, to actuate low surface tension droplet, fluorocarbonbased ferrofluid can be used ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). All these results suggest that our actuation method may be employed in biomedical analysis involving complex fluids without suffering from fouling, on both closed (Fig. 2f, g) and open microfluidic ( Fig. 2a -c, h, j) platforms, and can be operated programmably (Fig. 2k ).",

The capability of WRAP to actuate individual droplets in a discrete and programmable manner allows us to implement more complex digital microfluidic droplet operations such as droplet splitting, droplet generation, droplet transport, and merging of droplets. The latter two are easy for WRAP, but the first two are less clear. Since splitting a droplet automatically generates smaller droplets, droplet generation and splitting can be realized in the same way. Splitting droplets by magnetic forces has been a challenging task, especially in the absence of magnetic additives within the droplet 29 . Here, we designed a \"ferrofluid-based cutting\" technique to split the droplet based on the magnetically induced protrusions at the ferrofluid surface, as illustrated and experimentally demonstrated in Fig. 3a -d (see also Supplementary Video 8). The procedure involves several steps: first, we activated a magnet in Position 1 (Fig. 3a) to pull part of our reservoir droplet into a channel, a geometric constriction on the surface, until that channel was completely filled with the droplet fluid (Fig. 3b) . Then, a magnet at Position 2, close to the upstream entrance of the channel was activated to create a protrusion of ferrofluid above the magnet (Fig. 3c) . This cut the droplet in the channel into two parts. We then moved the upper part out of the channel by actuating a magnet in Position 3 (Fig. 3d) . Here the electromagnet was placed further than the electromagnet 2 to induce smaller actuation force, so that the bigger droplet was not trapped again. Theoretically, the radius of generated droplets has a positive correlation with the volume of the channel. Therefore, as demonstrated in Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 13 , the radius can be controlled by varying the channel length or height.",

More elegantly, complex paths can be achieved by incorporating a patterned ferromagnetic layer into the substrate below the liquid-infused surface. Such a layer, which can be fabricated in various ways (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 10 ), modulates the magnetic field distribution (simulated horizontal projection of the magnetic flux density in Fig. 3f . Details of the simulation in Methods and Supplementary Fig. 11 ) and guides droplets along paths imposed by the pattern. Droplets can be forced to move along curved paths (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Video 9) . Or, in path with Y-shaped junctions droplets originating from different sources can be brought together and merged using a single actuator ( Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 10) . Furthermore, the field modulation pattern can be conveniently switched to guide sequential droplet actuation ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). To demonstrate the possibility of biochemical analysis using this unique capability of WRAP, we performed a Griess test (Fig. 3g ) which is widely used in diagnosing urinary tract infections 39 and detecting forensic nitroglycerine 40 . Droplets of Griess reagent and sodium nitrite solution from different reservoirs were transported and merged to a sample analysis region, which was divided into three sections to analyze different samples spectroscopically. Finally, the merged droplet was transported to the waste deposit region. In our experiments, we used three nitrite samples with initial concentrations of 0, 0.4, and 0.9 mM (concentrations down to 1 \u00b5M can also be analyzed, see Supplementary Fig. 14) , respectively, and analyzed the samples merged with Griess reagent with UV-vis spectrometer (Fig. 3j) . These results demonstrated the potential of WRAP in digital droplet microfluidics.",

The latter is believed to play a central role in the transmission of the coronavirus and the related Covid-19 disease 41 . In Fig. 1a we demonstrated the capability of WRAP to simultaneously actuate an ensemble of microdroplets. This capability can be further combined with ferromagnetic field modulation layers, formed with iron needle arrays, to collect droplets at specific locations on a surface.

For respiratory droplets, a particular challenge is that they display a broad size distribution including many small droplets of a few micrometers. Once deposited on a solid surface, such small droplets are difficult to manipulate because their large surface-and edge-to-volume ratio make droplets easy to be pinned on tiny surface defects. Moreover, the random positioning of droplets sprayed or coughed onto a surface precludes any actuation mechanism that relies on welldefined drop positions and/or sizes relative to actuator(s), such as electrodes. The unique capabilities of WRAP, however, allow for such actuation for a wide range of droplet sizes and arbitrary initial positions (Fig. 4f) . In Fig. 4g , we show the accumulation of sprayed microdroplets (ranging from~10 1 \u03bcm to hundreds of \u03bcm) containing dye-stained E. coli (10 7 colony-forming unit per mL, or CFU/mL) on a ferrofluid-infused slippery surface with a field modulation layer with square lattice to guide droplet accumulation. Without activating the magnet, randomly coalesced and distributed droplets were too small, and the fluorescence signal could be barely detected. Upon activating the magnet, however, the smaller droplets coalesced and accumulated at the pre-defined locations. This led to an almost 20-fold increase of the fluorescence signal that could easily be detected. By averaging the intensities on the lattice pattern, we can quantify the pathogen concentration. As shown in Fig. 4h , the fluorescence intensity increases linearly with the logarithm of the E. coli concentration, a phenomenon that happens at moderate analyte concentration 42, 43 .",

The growing black part at the center was the ferrofluid (12 v/v% Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles) raised by the electromagnet. b The actuation force is provided by the ferromagnetic wetting ridge that spontaneously forms around the deposited droplet. The dotted lines and the solid arrows illustrate the magnetic induction lines and the droplet moving direction, respectively. c Snapshots of a typical actuation process. Red dotted arrow indicates the droplet moving direction. Inset: magnified optical image of the deposited droplet (rose red dashed rectangle), showing the wetting ridge (blue dashed rectangle). d Confocal fluorescence image of the wetting ridge. e The driving velocity increases with the concentration of the magnetic particles (Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles) in the ferrofluid (drop volume: 2 \u00b5L). f The velocity also increases with the droplet radius for different liquids, presumably because the ridge volume increases with the droplet size, and g it increases with the surface tension of the droplet (orange solid squares), presumably because a liquid with higher surface tension generally raises higher ridge (blue open squares).
