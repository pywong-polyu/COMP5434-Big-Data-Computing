[1] It is worth noting that the onset and course of this disease are generally slow, which may conceal for 3 to 5 years or more than 10 years. [2] In recent years, the morbidity and mortality of hepatic cirrhosis are both increasing, and has ranked the fourteenth of the most frequent cause of adult deaths worldwide. [3] Studies in the UK and Sweden report that the annual incidence rate of hepatic cirrhosis is 15.3-132.6 per 100,000 people. [4] A screening program in France shows that the prevalence of hepatic cirrhosis is 0.3%. [5] However, due to the insidious onset, this disease is often asymptomatic at early stages; therefore, the actual prevalence may be higher than reported. [6] Cirrhosis can lead to various fatal complications, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, infections and so on. [7, 8] All of which may increase the mortality of patients and bring financial burdens to patients' families and the society. [9] Critically ill cirrhosis is a type of clinical critical illness with a high death rate and attracts increasing attention. [10] Existing study has focused on patients with critically ill cirrhosis. A survey abroad has indicated the 30-day in-hospital mortality of patients with critically ill cirrhosis and bacterial ascites reaches 33%. [11] The high death rate has highlighted the importance of early identifying the patients with high risk, which is helpful to earlier make treatments.",

The selected variables were independent variables, and 30-day in-hospital death was dependent variable. The number of decision trees was 800, and the maximum depth To determine the performance of the model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), and the area under the curve (AUC). The cut-off points were ascertained based on the Youden Index. The model performance was validated using the data of testing set. The learning curve was used to evaluate the stability of this model and the calibration curve was used to assess imitative effect. The feature importance computed by Gini importance was used to assess the important variables. The Gini importance was computed from the Random Forest structure, and the average over all trees in the forest was the measure of the feature importance.

[28] [29] [30] [31] Jacqueline et al conducted North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease-Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Score to assess mortality risk in hospitalized cirrhotic patients. Multivariable modeling demonstrated that this score was an independently validated tool to predict 30-day survival in cirrhotic patients. The sensitivity and specificity were 84% and 70%, respectively. Huang and Yao [31] established a new predictive model with combination of ascites albumin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and MELD. Through logistic multivariate regression analysis, ascites albumin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and MELD were identified as the 3 independent risk factors related to the 30-day death of patients with liver cirrhosis and Logistic regression model has certain requirements for sample size, which theoretically requires a large sample, otherwise the test formula is unreasonable. Furthermore, logistic regression model cannot solve the problem of multicollinearity. As far as we know, there is rarely study using random forest model to predict the death of cirrhotic patients within 30 days of admission up to now. In this study, we established a random forest model to The random forest model could accommodate numerous variables, and had strong predictive power and better tolerance to data outliers. The AUC of our model was as high as 0.908 with the sensitivity of 83.6% and the specificity of 80.6%, indicating the good performance of the random forest model in clinical application.",

SOFA was considered as the best prognostic score to evaluate cirrhotic patients in the ICU according to nearly all of the literature. [13, [18] [19] [20] Our study also identified SOFA as an important predictor for death, and SAPS II presented better discriminative ability for death of cirrhotic patients within 30-day hospitalization. A prior prospective study reached a conclusion that SAPA II and SOFA showed better prediction performance than MELD in ICU mortality for cirrhotic patients. [13] In the future, larger sample sizes are needed to verify the priorities of different prognostic scoring systems in ICU cirrhotic patients.",

[16] Ning et al [21] discussed the clinical features and prognosis in Chinese cirrhotic patients with ascites, and found the concentration of BUN was an independent risk factor for 30-day hospital mortality. The serum bilirubin level better reflects the liver's synthetic and excretory functions, thus, the mass of prognostic scoring systems included TBIL and bilirubin as ingredients. [22, 23] Our study demonstrated that BUN, TBIL and bilirubin were significant predictors for 30-day admission death. Previous studies provided a specific explanation. [24] [25] [26] It is reported that intrahepatic cholestasis, portal flow distortion or shunting, and hemolysis caused by splenomegaly may all lead to the increased level of bilirubin. Recent research compared the value of bilirubin and TBIL for predicting prognosis of cirrhotic patients, and results showed bilirubin performed better predictive value. [27] Our study used random forest model to predict the 30-day inhospital deaths of ICU cirrhotic patients, and logistic regression was used to screen out the important variables to establish the prediction model. The internal validation had confirmed that the random forest model could perform well. However, some limitations should be concerned. First, our data were collected from the Medical Information Mart of the Intensive Care Database III version 1.4, which inevitably existed data missing. Data missing may affect the performance of the model, and some potential valuable variables for prediction may exclude due to severe data missing. Second, since our study included the patients with critically ill cirrhosis, the prediction performance in those with mild or moderate cirrhosis was unclear. Moreover, our study was lack of external validation, which needed to perform in the future.",
