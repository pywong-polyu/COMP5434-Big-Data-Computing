The sample consisted of 30 teachers recruited from different cities of Turkey using criteria sampling. Phenomenology was the research method of choice. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview form and analyzed using content analysis. Participants use MOOCs because they are free of charge and have good content and high quality. MOOCs help them learn science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, gain professional knowledge, and develop skills, and positive attitudes and values. Most participants are interested in integrating MOOCs in their classes; however, they face various problems during MOOCs, such as loss of motivation and Internet connection issues. It is recommended that MOOCs be designed in such a way that they increase participants' motivation and allow for feedback.",

This change has led to a revision of higher education and promoted the efforts to integrate ICTs in higher education (Turan et al. 2013) . Recent developments of ICT provide flexibility and facilitate access to information, leading to the emergence of online higher education platforms, one of which is massive open online courses (MOOCs).",

            "text": "Massive Open Online Courses are free and easily accessible courses that allow thousands of people to receive education at the same time. MOOCs were inspired by the Connectivism and Connective Knowledge course developed by Downes and Siemens in 2008 (Cormier and Siemens 2010) . Massive Open Online Courses have attracted widespread interest in the last decade, but they have been offering courses and certificates on such websites as Coursera, edX, and Udemy since 2012 (Baggaley 2013). Today, MOOCs are also used as a new version of e-learning in higher education and professional development programs (Conole 2014; Laurillard 2016; Vivian et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2018) . Massive Open Online Courses have been a point of controversy since they became part of higher education and professional development programs. For example, Martin (2012) and Miller (2012) argue that MOOCs are a disruptive innovation for higher education, whereas Lederman (2013) states that they result in less learning than face-to-face education. Besides, only about 25% of those who enroll in MOOCs complete the courses, which is one of the major setbacks (Bozna 2016; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2018; Jordan 2014; Radoiu 2014) . Another setback is the inadequate technological infrastructure of MOOCs (Sukhbaatar et al. 2018) . However, MOOCs are becoming more and more popular and are increasingly used in higher education because they are free of charge, have open resources, promote student-student interaction and contextual learning, and break the limits of time and space.",

Coursera, edX, and Udemy are the most popular xMOOCs platforms that offer courses on different topics. xMOOCs are used in a wide range of areas, especially computer engineering, philosophy, history, and nursing (Bellack 2013; Sharma et al. 2014 ).

Teachers can attend online courses out of work whenever and wherever they want. Therefore, MOOCs are used as an alternative to conventional teacher training programs (Koukis and Jimoyiannis 2018) .",

Those countries apply STEM education to achieve economic and technological advances, to establish a link between schools and industries, and to increase science and mathematics literacy (T\u00fcrk et al. 2018) . Moreover, STEM education helps students develop the creativity, problemsolving, and critical thinking skills required by the 21st-century business world. Therefore, countries integrate STEM education into formal and informal education. Teachers play an essential role in this process (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m 2020a ), but only those who have a good grasp of STEM education can integrate it into formal and informal education (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and \u015eahin-Topalcengiz 2019) . Although STEM education is new to Turkey, many teachers are interested in learning it, increasing the demand for related courses. However, there are few people in Turkey with a Ph.D. in STEM education, and only a certain number of people are allowed to enroll in STEM courses, resulting in unmet demand (Colakoglu and Gokben 2017) .",

Not all teachers can have training in STEM education, due to different working conditions and socioeconomic status. However, they all can access online STEM courses and attend them whenever and wherever they want. Massive Open Online Courses can, therefore, be used for online STEM education. Teachers can also take them to improve themselves during the Covid-19 pandemic that has taken hold of the whole world. To that end, an 80-h free training on STEM education was designed for participants in line with the STEM Teacher Institutes model (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m 2020b) . The training was based on xMOOCs, allowing attendees to receive direct information about STEM fields. This study is important because it is the first to offer long and free xMOOC training on STEM fields to teachers in Turkey. Moreover, teachers are expected to acquire professional knowledge and develop professional skills and attitudes in STEM education. We, therefore, believe that this study will pave the way for further research on this topic. In this context, this study aimed to determine how teachers perceived MOOCs for STEM education. The main research question was, \"What are teachers' views of MOOCs for STEM education?\" To this end, the study sought answers to the following subquestions: ",

Polly and Hannafin (2010) also state that long-term training promotes teachers' professional development. Therefore, an 80-h training was designed. 4. Determining the format of MOOCs for STEM-PDT-MOOCs: The format was based on xMOOCSs, which, unlike conventional online learning, allows teachers to learn directly. 5. Creating STEM-PDT-MOOCs content: It was made sure that MOOCs addressed different components, such as course introduction and course registration videos, live classes, discussion forums, assignments, and assessment activities (Agarwal 2012; Chamberlin and Parish 2011; Evans 2012) . Afterward, STEM education content was determined because it is stated that education content for teachers should focus on a field and offer pedagogy specific to it . Therefore, specific content was developed. Table 5 provides information on STEM-PDT-MOOCs components and content. 6. Registration: Participants who applied for STEM-PDT-MOOCs were enrolled. 7.

Young (2013) emphasized that one of the main reasons why learners use MOOCs is because they receive a certificate at the end of the training. According to Bali (2013) , teachers use MOOCs because they have the opportunity to observe online learning environments, participate in discussions, experience student specializations, and have access to free resources of high quality. Brooks and Gibson (2012) also reported that teachers use MOOCs because those courses are flexible, facilitate teacher-teacher communication, and can be attended anywhere, anytime. These results show that teachers use online education services when they are provided with appropriate learning platforms. The fact that our participants highlighted the content of MOOCs and the qualification of instructors shows that they want to get the right information.",

Most participants find MOOCs useful in STEM education, which is consistent with the literature. Subbian (2013) states that MOOCs can be used to facilitate interdisciplinary education, to achieve learning in STEM fields, and to teach the pedagogy of STEM education. Both our results and those of others show that MOOCs can be used in STEM education. Some studies suggest that MOOCs can also be used to teach topics related to specific fields. For example, Parson et al. (2019) reported that most teachers find MOOCs useful for professional development, which is in line with our results. However, some studies argue that MOOCs are not useful (Martin 2012; Miller 2012; Sukhbaatar et al. 2018) , which is in contrast to our result. These results show that MOOCs are a new online educational platform that warrants further research. The COVID-19 pandemic has also shown how crucial online education is. MOOCs play a vital role in sustaining education during outbreaks and other extraordinary circumstances. In other words, they are a useful source of training and education for both educators and learners. Moreover, they are convenient because they are easily accessible to anyone interested in deepening their knowledge whenever and wherever they want. Therefore, they allow people to access education 24/7 and support lifelong learning. The results show that they can be used to continue education in both ordinary and extraordinary situations, like the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This result has been reported by Koutsodimou and Jimoyiannis (2015) and Bruff et al. (2013) as well. This result indicates that teachers are open to improving themselves and learning about new approaches. However, some participants are not interested in using MOOCs in their classes because they think that MOOCs reduce the quality of education and increase the workload and also because not every student has the technological infrastructure in their home. This result has been reported by some studies as well (Lederman 2013; Sukhbaatar et al. 2018) . This result indicates that those participants are not interested in improving themselves and learning about new approaches.",

Participants have to deal with Internet connection issues, communication problems, problems with the discussion form, weak student-teacher interaction, poor video quality, inadequate measurement and evaluation, and lack of practice. Moreover, one of the most critical problems of MOOCs is the lack of feedback, according to most participants. However, it is impossible to give feedback to everyone on time due to the nature of MOOCs (Hodges et al. 2016; Roth 2013) , which is why student-student interaction is so crucial in MOOCs. These results are similar to ours, suggesting that giving instant feedback to attendees during MOOCs ensures success. Our participants also stated that the lack of feedback during MOOCs reduced their motivation.",

MOOCs ensure that education continues regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, teachers can use them both to receive STEM education and to improve themselves in other fields. For example, Coursera offers online courses for anyone interested in engineering. In this context, MOOCs provide teachers with the opportunity to improve professional competence and ensure lifelong learning.",
