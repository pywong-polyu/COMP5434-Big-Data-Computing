            "text": "Background: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) plays a fundamental role in providing good quality healthcare services to citizens, as they are the first responders in distressing situations. Few studies have used available EMS data to investigate EMS call characteristics and subsequent responses. Methods: Data were extracted from the emergency registry for the period 2013-2017. This included call and rescue vehicle dispatch information. All relationships in analyses and differences in events proportion between 2013 and 2017 were tested against the Pearson's Chi-Square with a 99% level of confidence. Results: Among the 2,120,838 emergency calls, operators dispatched at least one rescue vehicle for 1,494,855. There was an estimated overall incidence of 96 emergency calls and 75 rescue vehicles dispatched per 1000 inhabitants per year. Most calls were made by private citizens, during the daytime, and were made from home (63.8%); 31% of rescue vehicle dispatches were advanced emergency medical vehicles. The highest number of rescue vehicle dispatches ended at the emergency department (74.7%). Conclusions: Our data showed that, with some exception due to environmental differences, the highest proportion of incoming emergency calls is not acute or urgent and could be more effectively managed in other settings than in an Emergency Departments (ED). Better management of dispatch can reduce crowding and save hospital emergency departments time, personnel, and health system costs.",

This systematic, digital program is structured to guide nurses in helping the caller to provide the required information, in determining the appropriate intervention (dispatch of a specific rescue vehicle or provide phone advice) and, in case of need, in instructing the rescue team to better respond to the identified health demands. It also assists nurses in assigning the correct EMS criticality code (red: need of an immediate response, life-threatening situation with a chance of survival; yellow: rapid response, presence of a possible life-threatening condition not in an immediate danger of death; green: the situation is not an emergency, presence of injuries, acute but stable conditions; and white: the situation is not an emergency, minor injuries not a life-threatening situation, medical care not often required) and in determining which rescue vehicle should be dispatched. A second nurse then locates and dispatches the requested rescue vehicle, based on the EMS criticality code and vehicle availability.",

The likelihood of completing a rescue into a hospital ED by type of rescue vehicles in relation to the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) criticality codes assigned was evaluated by a set of logistic regressions. Results were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for all other variables. Population estimates were reported as a rate per 1000 inhabitants.

            "text": "Coherently with other studies, medical problems as cardiocirculatory, neurological, and respiratory, accounted for the largest proportion of EMS intervention requests [25] . Interestingly, given the robustness of our data, although each incoming emergency call is preliminary handled by a highly qualified nurse further supported by a computerised MPSD, \"unclear problems\" accounted for nearly a quarter of the total rescue vehicle dispatched, with little variations by year. Studies on the occurrence of such calls in the EMS are sparse and reported some variations ranging from 11% in Norway [26] , to 18% in Denmark [27] , to nearly 20% (2 million unknown or non-reported complaints over more than 10 million calls) in the USA National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) population [28] . The high occurrence of unclear problems in Italy could be also due to the EMUR registry internal structure, as it uses ICD9 codes to categorize requests, which are meant to diagnose and classify pathologies and may not be accurate enough to identify the callers' complaints in emergency situation. In other contexts, the emergency situation is classified by using a chief complaint classification codes [29, 30] . This approach that is based on specific caller's complaints is likely to be more accurate, as it defines the situation or visible problem as judged on site by a non-professional, resulting in a lower number of unidentified/unclear conditions. Regardless of the reasons, when the cause of a call is reported as unclear, the risk stratification may be less sensitive, leading to the assignment of a higher or lower EMS criticality code than the one needed [29] . This can result in an unnecessary response or in an unmatched response, with more advanced rescue vehicles being sent in basic emergencies, and vice-versa. As a consequence, resultant unneeded EMS transports could affect hospital workloads and reduce the number of cases that could be effectively managed on-site through the dispatch of a more appropriate vehicle. Indeed, M\u00f8ller (2017) found a higher mortality rate (incidence rate ratio 1.26; 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.36) in patients whose calls were registered as unclear complaints, denoting the need to improve the classification system in order to provide a better, more effective response [27] .",

As the transport is likely to be appropriate in patients receiving an urgent critical code, green codes occurrence should be further analysed. Given that Basic EMVs crew is only allowed to transport patients, calls receiving a non-urgent code can only be dispatched into a hospital ED, independently of the health need. As green codes accounted for nearly 800,000 transports over the 5 years period, the 86% of them had probably contributed to the ED overcrowding. With some exception, a huge proportion of such incoming calls may more effectively managed in a primary care setting than in an emergency department, saving hospital ED time and reducing health system costs [25] . Moreover out-of-hospital EMS reorganization, as for example by providing necessary care on-scene, or by providing advice over the telephone, as occurred in the recent COVID-19 crisis, could contribute to the reduction of unnecessary pressures on ED personnel [33] . The need to further foster primary care is, indeed, supported by the evidence that under the COVID scenario the Italian government (D.L. 14 del 9/3/2020.) intervened in reorganising the EMS system response. To avoid massive ED accesses new pathways of care and professional teams, such as USCA (Special Unit for Continuity of Care), were activated to better respond the health demand and to avoid unnecessary or spontaneous hospital accesses [34] .",

Our data showed that, with some exception due to environmental differences, the highest proportion of incoming emergency calls is not acute or urgent and could be more effectively managed in other settings than in an ED.
