Practical identifiability (for which most existing evaluation methods rely on estimations and are based on Fisher information matrix or likelihood profiling (Raue et al., 2009)) of these parameters will be discussed in section 2.3. Figure S3 present the occupancy numbers of the six compartments of the model when one parameter is varied while the others are fixed. Because the epidemics start date and state is different in each region, it is necessary to estimate in priority E 0 and A 0 . b, D e and D I have a similar impact on the simulations, and we chose to prioritize the estimation of the transmission b as it is a important actionable driver of the epidemics, that can potentially be reduced by interventions. r and D q have little impact on I (in) but are informative for H (in) . Since r can be estimated from other data sources, we prioritized the estimation of D q . In addition, there is a strong rational to estimate b and D q as they are directly involved in the computation of the reproductive number. So in the end, we assume D e , D I , and r fixed and we will estimate E 0 , A 0 , b, and D q . Both D e and D I are set to a common value across regions, estimated from previous studies referenced in Table  2 . To set r, we used data collected from general practitioners through the re-purposing of the R\u00e9seau Sentinelles network to monitor COVID-19 and provide a weekly estimation of the number of incident symptomatic cases (regardless of their confirmation status through a PCR test) at the region level. Thus, for each region, r i is set to r s the ratio of observed incident number of ascertained cases over the incident number of symptomatic cases (as defined by the incident symptomatic cases reported by the R\u00e9seau Sentinelles network).
