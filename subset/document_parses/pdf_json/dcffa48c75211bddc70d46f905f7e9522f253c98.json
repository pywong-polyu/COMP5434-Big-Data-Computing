In the absence of a vaccine or widespread natural immunity, most nations have adapted the tenets of social distancing, wearing of masks when in public, and limited work hours, all in an effort to limit exposure and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These policies have extended to the clinical laboratory: a recent survey reported that laboratories have decreased the items available in their test menus, staggered staffing to limit individual employee exposures, implemented employee temperature checks, and increased the decontamination of the workplace and clinical instruments [1] . The impact of these changes on laboratory turnaround time (TAT) and other quality metrics has been largely unexplored [2] . The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall test volume has also largely been unexamined.",

Access to the facility was limited to employees, patients, and no>1 additional individual accompanying a patient. All persons entering the facility were temperature-checked upon arrival and were screened for risk factors before being allowed entry. Social distancing was implemented in the waiting area by placing seats ~ 6 feet apart. A high fraction of patients are being actively treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and other treatment protocols for which rapid turnaround time is necessary, and patients frequently are required to wait in the clinic for the results of laboratory tests before being allowed to leave. For this reason it was decided that 1) the laboratory menu would be unchanged, rather than shift any of the testing to the main laboratory, 17 miles (~27 km) from the outpatient facility 2) the level of staffing would be minimally reduced by 10% to decrease the risk of transmission between employees and maintain (or improve) TAT 3) batching of specimens by the phlebotomy staff before transport to the laboratory would be minimized to decrease collect to receive TAT 4) laboratory procedures should be carefully reviewed by lab personnel to ensure that all testing was performed efficiently and correctly, to ensure that intralaboratory TAT was maintained 5) special attention would be given to efforts to minimize exposure of employees (e.g. masking of employees at all times, frequent hand washing, frequent decontamination of instrument and counter surfaces).",

The study period was March-June 2020, which included the first month the protocol changes were implemented and the last full month for which data was available. The statistics for the study period were compared to the same months in 2019.

Table 1 shows the results of Mann-Whitney U-statistics comparing the median order to collect, collect to receive, and receive to verify turnaround times for each month during the study period to their comparable month in 2019. Order to collect turnaround times remained stable throughout the study period. There was a significant improvement in the chemistry collect to receive turnaround times for all months and for March and April for the hematology testing, as evidenced by the marginally decreased median and interquartile ranges for these periods. There was a slightly improved chemistry receive to verify turnaround time for March-May 2020 compared to 2019. The hematology receive to verify turnaround times were relatively constant over the study period and did not significantly differ from those in 2019. Looking at the graphical description of the collect to receive turnaround times (Fig. 1) , it is can be seen that the improvement in turnaround times was due to The number and types of unacceptable specimens received by the laboratory are listed in Table 2 , which compares the 2019 and 2020 data. The number of unacceptable specimens remained constant over the study period and were identical to those recorded for 2019. In 2019 these errors accounted for 0.22% of the testing volume. In 2020 these errors accounted for 0.24% of the testing volume.",

When we adapted this strategy, there were few reports to assist the planning for a laboratory response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, most publications in the medical literature regarding COVID-19 and laboratory planning were largely speculative in nature and limited to review articles and editorials [2] . Other papers were more applicable to direct patient care rather than being laboratory-specific or were related to treatment and testing of infected patients or individuals with suspected infection. Barba et al, for example, describing the response in an academic center in Madrid, stated that the care of non-COVID patients was reduced [7] . Likewise, DeJonge et al, referencing guidelines proposed by Willan et al [8] [9] [10] suggested that clinicians make appropriate decisions regarding testing indication and frequency before sending a patient for phlebotomy. Other guidelines proposed by DeJonge et al and others [11] included segregation of COVID-positive from COVIDnegative patients, minimal use of paper forms, social distancing, appropriate use of personal protective equipment by laboratory personnel, and frequent hand washing and other hygienic procedures to minimize spread [8] .",

They reported a statistically significant prolongation in TAT due to increased time from specimen collection to specimen receiving [12] . This strategy would likewise have been unsuccessful in our laboratory, due to the long distance (17 miles) and transit time for specimens to be transported from the outpatient clinic to the main hospital laboratory.

The error rate was similar for both periods, with errors accounting for 0.22% of specimens in March-June 2019 compared to 0.24% for the comparable period in 2020. A specific pattern of error was not identified. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions about the effects of biosafety enhancements on preanalytical errors due to the low frequency of these errors, these data suggest that preanalytical errors were not markedly different in 2020 compared to 2019. The distribution of preanalytical errors differs from that described by Narula et al, in their survey of preanalytical errors in a tertiary care medical center laboratory, in which inadequate sample-to-anticoagulant ratio, insufficient sample for analysis, and incomplete requisitions were the main error types [16] . The overall error rate was within the range of previously reported studies [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

Our findings support our hypothesis that the implementation of these changes would not significantly impact laboratory quality as measured using these metrics despite an overall increase in laboratory volume in the last month of the study period. We conclude that this plan can be successfully re-introduced in the event of a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections or similar infectious disease outbreak, and that our plan may be generalizable for use in stat laboratories that serve a population with a high fraction of at-risk co-morbidities.",
