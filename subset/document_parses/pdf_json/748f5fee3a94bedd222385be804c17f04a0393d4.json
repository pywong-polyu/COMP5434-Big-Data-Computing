It has become a serious public health event threatening people's lives and safety. Due to the rapid transmission and long incubation period, shortage of medical resources would easily occur in the short term of discovering disease cases. Therefore, we aimed to construct an artificial intelligent framework to rapidly distinguish patients with COVID-19 from common pneumonia and non-pneumonia populations based on computed tomography (CT) images. Furthermore, we explored artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate CT features and laboratory findings on admission to predict the clinical classification of COVID-19. This will ease the burden of doctors in this emergency period and aid them to perform timely and appropriate treatment on patients.",

In addition, CT features and laboratory findings on admission were combined to predict clinical types of COVID-19 using AI algorithms. Lastly, Spearman's correlation test was applied to study correlations of CT characteristics and laboratory findings.",

Soon a novel coronavirus was isolated from these patients, which belonged to the betacoronavirus family and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Zhu et al., 2020) . On February 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as it had spread quickly all over the world and developed into a plague (Mahase, 2020) . By May 11, 2021, more than 159 million people were confirmed infected with more than 3 million cases of mortality. The crowd was affected easily, and the common clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, and fatigue Huang et al., 2020) . Mild patients may have no obvious clinical symptoms, while severe patients may have dyspnea and hypoxemia. The incubation period of COVID-19 was 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days, and it was infectious even in the incubation period (Sun et al., 2020) . The main transmission route was via respiratory droplets and close contact (Li et al., 2021) . Patients with COVID-19 but with no symptoms may have transmitted the virus to close contacts before a definite diagnosis could be made. Though there are many studies on identifying effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 Peng et al., 2021) , most of them need further experimental and clinical validation (Peng et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Therefore, early diagnosis was extremely important.",

However, due to sampling deviation, with low viral load (the number of virus replications cannot reach the qPCR detection threshold) in the specimen and the accuracy of detection reagents, the detection results may be false negative (Ai et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Rubin et al., 2020) , which resulted in suspected patients not being identified and isolated in time. This would lead to further spread of infection, resulting in the epidemic being difficult to control. On the other hand, patients with COVID-19 could not get timely treatment if not identified, so a series of nucleic acid tests may be required to eliminate the possibility of false-negative results in suspected or discharged patients. During the outbreak of a highly infectious epidemic, a novel method for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 was urgently needed.",

In the critical epidemic situation of Wuhan, China, CT played an important role for patients who had negative nucleic acid tests but with symptoms or close contact with the confirmed patients. The most common CT findings in patients affected by COVID-19 included ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution . Pleural effusions, lymphadenopathy, and discrete pulmonary nodules were very rare (Kanne, 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020) . Consolidation was considered as a sign of disease progression. However, CT alone was not suitable for independently ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection to the best of our knowledge because some patients may have normal radiological features at early stages of the disease and doctors could not distinguish by naked eye observation (Chung et al., 2020) . During the period of the epidemic, the physicians needed to analyze numerous CT images to judge the condition of patients and integrated them with clinical information to make the final judgment. Thus, developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based imaging analysis methods was crucial to support physicians. Mei et al. (2020) had established an AI algorithm to combine chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, laboratory testing, and exposure history to rapidly diagnose patients with SARS-CoV-2.",

(2020) also reported that volume lesion ratio of lung was well linearly correlated to clinical parameters, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin. In order to investigate the association between CT features and biochemical indicators, we performed Spearman's correlation tests and found key biochemical markers. The threshold of significant correlation was p < 0.05 after correction with the Holm-Bonferroni method, then the p-value was further refined into p < 0.001 (marked as 1), p < 0.01 (marked as 2), and p < 0.05 (marked as 3), which are labeled in Figure 5 . In addition, we selected a |correlation value| of CT feature \u22650.35 and a |correlation value| of laboratory findings \u22650.30 to show in Figure 5 . Eosinophil ratio (EO%), eosinophils (EOS), and lymphocyte number (LYM_N) showed highly positive correlations with the X370 feature of CT (lesion features). Generally speaking, the increase of eosinophils and lymphocyte number at the same time is considered to be caused by virus infection, which may be reflected on CT images of the lung. Glucose (GLU), red cell distribution width standard deviation (RDW_SD), chlorine (Cl), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were highly correlated with the X242 and X89 feature of CT. CRP, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), direct bilirubin (DBIL), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and total bilirubin (TBIL) were highly correlated with the X402 feature of CT, whereas indirect bilirubin (IBIL), DBIL, and TBIL showed highly negative correlations with the X49 feature of CT.",

Based on these CT images, we applied three network structures to construct FIGURE 5 | Correlations of lung imaging features and laboratory findings. Horizontal axis represents biochemical index, and vertical axis represents CT features. Number one indicates p < 0.001, number two indicates p < 0.01, and number three indicates p < 0.05. a deep learning model for disease classification. Among these, vgg19 represented the best performance with an AUC of 0.95, which provided a favorable tool for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. It was conceivable that if this model was applied to medical units, it would help radiologists and clinicians fight against the pandemic and reduce their burden. Especially in remote areas or communities where there was lack of experienced doctors, it would be an effective complementary measure. For patients with COVID-19, we further developed a deep learning model to predict the clinical classification through CT images of the first examination after admission. However, the classification effect of the prediction model based on three network structures was lower than expected, so the laboratory findings were added to improve the prediction effect and the performance of vgg19 was raised to an AUC of 0.90. This would be conducive to the timely arrangement of an appropriate treatment plan according to the patient's condition to achieve the efficient management of patients. Thus, based on the routine examination items of patients, we built a rapid identification and classification system of COVID-19. In addition, we found that CRP, EOS, LDH, and other indicators were significantly correlated with the CT image features of the lung.",

            "text": "Our research still had some limitations. Firstly, the sample size used to build the model was relatively small. Deep learning typically needed a large number of samples to extract features and the training model in order to achieve wider applicability and higher accuracy. Our model put forward the feasibility of using CT images to predict the trend and classification of COVID-19 disease, and more samples are needed to optimize the model and test the generalizability of the an AI model. The cooperation with more medical centers or hospitals may contribute to the improvement of this work. Secondly, as the number of severe and critical patients was too few, their CT slices were not included in this study. The model still needed to be improved in predictable subtypes and disease severity. If we could collect more CT images of severe patients to train the model, this study will include more comprehensive types of prediction and will be more applicable in clinical practice. Thirdly, we adopted the chest CT slices directly without preprocessing of lung segmentation in order to save time, while lung segmentation preprocessing was generally regarded to improve the accuracy of AI training (Chung et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . In weighing the advantages against the disadvantages, we chose transfer learning based on resnet18, vgg19, and vgg16 pre-trained CNN models in the ImageNet data sets (Shin et al., 2016) and fivefold cross-validation. Finally, besides early diagnosis, tracing the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is also critical for understanding and preventing the further outbreak of this virus (Li et al., 2021) . There are many methods to identify the evolution of influenza that could be adopted in SARS-CoV-2 (Yang et al., , 2014a . In addition, ideas like antigenic map (Barnett et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2017) and sequence-based virus antigenicity prediction (Sun et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014b; Yao et al., 2017) are helpful for the vaccine design of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, drug-target interaction identification (Peng et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2019) based on the existing two targets (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2) may contribute to the prevention of COVID-19. However, it is out of the scope of this study.",
