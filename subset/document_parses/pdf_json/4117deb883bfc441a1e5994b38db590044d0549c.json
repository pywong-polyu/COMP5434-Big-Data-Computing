Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low affinity binding to the 35 murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promotor. In contrast to non-transgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to two different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs 40 of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals revealed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the lower dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice with 60% surviving infection whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared to female mice. This is the first highly lethal murine infection 45 model for SARS-CoV-2. The K18-hACE2 murine model will be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the assessment of MCMs. 50 3 Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice",

An important factor in host tropism of the virus is this receptor interaction and reduced affinity between these two molecules greatly impacts host susceptibility to infection. Both SARS-CoV and possibly to a greater extent SARS-CoV-2 bind to murine ACE2 (mACE) poorly compared human ACE2 (hACE2) (20) . Accordingly, mice are inherently refractory to infection by ACE2 utilizing 75 Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice human coronaviruses (21) (22) (23) . In these animals, infection by SARS-CoV (22) and SARS-CoV-2 (23) is rapidly controlled, although older mice are more permissive to lung replication, but nevertheless lung injury is limited and mortality is generally low. Indeed, even infection in mice lacking adaptive immunity due to RAG deficiencies (no T-cells or B-cells) are protected against severe SARS-CoV disease, whereas mice genetically devoid of STAT-1, an important molecule 80 involved in innate immunity, are sensitive to infection by SARS-CoV(24-26).

On day 3, two mice per group were euthanized to assess disease severity. The remaining 5 mice per group were monitored up to 28 days. We also infected C57BL/6, BALB/c and RAG2 deficient mice with a challenge dose of 2x10 4 pfu. On day 4, all groups of infected K18-hACE2 mice began to lose weight, which was more pronounced in the female mice compared to the male mice in either challenge dose group 110 ( Fig. 1A & Fig. S1A ). Non-transgenic mice did not lose any weight and no animal succumbed to disease. Starting on day 5, several K18-hACE2 animals began to show signs of respiratory disease, included labored breathing and conjunctivitis. On day 5 through day 7 the majority of mice (15/20 mice) began to meet euthanasia criteria (n=13) or died (n=2). An additional animal in the low dose male group succumbed to disease on day 11, after a period of weight loss. The highest mean weight 115 loss was in the female groups (>20%), although male mice lost >12% weight (Fig S1A,B) . Of the K18-hACE2 mice in the high dose challenge groups, all females and 80% of the male mice succumbed to disease.

There was no statistical significance in survival between the other groups. Lung homogenates taken on day 3 showed high levels of virus in K18-hACE2, in contrast to C57BL/6 or RAG2-deficient mice which had low levels of virus (Fig. 1B,C) . The virus RNA levels were nearly identical between all the infected K18-hACE2 groups and remained high in most of the euthanized mice, with the exception of the mouse that died on day 11.

Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia was identified in less than half of infected animals. This lesion had a relatively patchy distribution except in the most severely affected animals where it is more abundant. In areas of septal inflammation, exudation of fibrin and edema into alveolar lumina from damaged septal 150 capillaries was observed in most animals. Vasculitis was the most common finding and was present in ~95% percent of all mice (Fig. 3A,B) . The lesion encompassed small and intermediate caliber vessels, and was often characterized by near circumferential infiltration of the vessel wall by numerous mononuclear inflammatory cells. This lesion also contained small amounts of fibrin and occasional necrotic debris, affecting all tunics and obscuring the vessel wall architecture. However, 155 the endothelial cells surrounding lung vasculature were largely free of viral RNA (Fig. 3B) . In one low dose male mouse that died on day 11, evidence of numerous fibrin thrombi were identified in the small and intermediate vessels, suggestive of a hypercoagulable state within the lung. This same animal had marginally detectable virus in the lung (Fig. 1C) , and fibrin thrombi were not identified in other organs including liver and kidney. Infected K18-hACE2 mice had elevated 160 numbers of TUNEL positive cells, suggesting increased cell death (Fig. 3C) . We also detected increased expression of Ki-67, a marker for cellular proliferation, likely expressed by proliferating Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice pneumocytes and potentially by replicating alveolar macrophages (Fig. 3D) . Neutrophilia was detected by H&E staining, consistent with an increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive cells (neutrophils, basophil and eosinophil) detected by IFA (Fig. S3A) . However, the MPO positive 165 cells were devoid of viral antigen (Fig. S3A) . There was also an increase in the presence of CD68 positive macrophages (Fig. S3B) and a pronounced increase in CD45 and CD3 positive cells in infected lungs, indicative of infiltrating leukocytes including T-cells, which is consistent with histologic findings (Fig. S3C) . These data indicate that K18-hACE2 mice develop a pronounced lung injury upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2.",

Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was found throughout the brain including strong but variably diffuse signal in regions of the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, medulla, pons and midbrain (Fig. 6A, Table S1 ). Similar intense but less diffuse signal was present within the hippocampus. ISH positive cells included neurons of thalamic nuclei. In contrast, cells within the vessel walls and perivascular spaces infiltrated by mononuclear inflammatory cells were negative 220 for viral genomic RNA (Fig. 6A) . Histopathological changes were detected in the brains of several infected K18-hACE2 mice euthanized on day 5-11, but not in most mice taken on day 3 (Fig. 6B , Table S1 and Fig. S7 ). In the thalamus/hypothalamus, vasculitis was the most common lesion characterized by endothelial hypertrophy and increases in mononuclear leukocytes within the vessel wall and/or filling the perivascular space. Small amounts of necrotic debris were also 225 identified. In the majority of these cases, the vascular lesion was characterized by the presence of increased numbers of microglia within the adjacent neuropil. Occlusive fibrin thrombi were also detected within the thalamus in a few mice. Meningitis was observed in a subset of animals and Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice was associated with infiltration of mononuclear leukocytes (majority lymphocytes) and is most prominent adjacent to vessels. In the mouse that died late on day 11 with massive pulmonary 230 clotting, the rostral cerebral cortex brain lesions included small to intermediate size vessel walls multifocally expanded by mononuclear inflammatory cells and perivascular hemorrhage extending into the adjacent neuropil (Fig. 6B) . Increased numbers of microglia were readily detected on H&E stained sections, expanding outward from the perivascular neuropil. An increase in numbers of microglia were found in the neuropil surrounding affected vessels. Additionally, brains also 235 showed signs of neuroinflammation indicated by increased staining of Iba-1 and GFAP indicating microgliosis and astrocytosis, respectively (Fig. 6C) . Necrosis was identified in at least five animals, and was most prominent within the periventricular region of the hypothalamus as well as in the amygdala. The lesion was characterized by moderate numbers of shrunken, angular cells with hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, pyknotic nuclei and surrounded by a clear halo (Fig. S7) . The 240 morphology and location of individual cells was suggestive of neuronal necrosis, but further investigation will be required to confirm this finding. Viral spike protein was detected in NeuN positive cells, indicating viral infection of neurons (Fig. 6D) . Viral antigen was absent in GFAP positive cells suggesting virus does not productively infect astrocytes. These data indicate that similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also targets the brain of K18-hACE2 mice, causing brain 245 injury. As indicated by duplex ISH labeling of brain, neurons are positive for both hACE2 transgene expression and viral genomic RNA (Fig. S8) . No animal showed outward signs of neurological deficient, such as hind limb paralysis, head tilting or tremors. 250 Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice Other murine infection models for SARS-CoV-2 involving transgene expression of the human ACE2 protein have been reported (23, 33, 34) .

Transduced lung cells expressing hACE2 supported SARS-CoV-2 replication and lung pathology ensued along with weight loss. However, disease was generally mild with no lethality. Blockade of the type I interferon system using pharmacological intervention was needed to produce the most severe disease 26 . Murine systems faithfully producing the major 265 elements of severe disease observed in humans will be more useful for identifying the most promising MCMs. The K18-hACE2 mice lost considerable weight >12% in males and >20% in females and lethality in the high dose exceeded 90%. Acute lung injury was detected in all animals succumbing to disease, with vascular damage the most common lesion. Similar to findings with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infected the brains of K18-hACE2 mice. Brain infection resulted in 270 vasculitis and inflammation, with SARS-CoV-2 antigen detected in neurons. It is possible virus enters the brain via the olfactory bulb, as has been reported for SARS-CoV, although more studies Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice will be required as virus may also have entered the brain via inflamed vessels. Whether mortality results directly from brain infection is not clear, but this has been speculated as the major cause of mortality in SARS-CoV infected mice (32) . Infection in the brain was delayed by at least four 275 days, as it was an uncommon finding in day 3 animals. Thus, early during infection lung appears to be the primary target. We have not yet evaluated the protective efficacy of MCMs in this model, but it has been reported that antibodies protect against SARS-CoV, demonstrating the K18-hACE2 system is useful for evaluating countermeasures against ACE2-targeting human coronaviruses.",

The pathophysiology of human neurological injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 is ambiguous and a direct role of the virus has not been established. Other coronaviruses are associated with neurological disease, including HEV67N in porcine, and in humans SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV(47). SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice showed evidence of neuroinflammation, neurovasculitis, 325 meningitis and hemorrhage, emulating many of the human findings. SARS-CoV has been shown to infect the human and mouse brains and data suggest it replicates in neurons. In the K18-hACE mice, neuronal cells in the olfactory bulb, retina and brain were positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and antigen, suggesting these cells are supportive of a productive infection. In the K18-hACE2, we suspect virus accesses the brain via infection of the olfactory bulb and then spreads to 330 neurons and other regions of the brain via connective neuron axons (32).

Furthermore, as neurological sequelae during COVID-19 are an important component to severe disease, the K18-hACE2 model may provide a more defined understanding of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the CNS.MATERIALS AND METHODS345Viruses and cells. A third passage SARS-CoV-2 strain WA-1/2020 viral stock was obtained from the CDC and is from a human non-fatal case isolated in January 2020. A master challenge stockof virus was propagated by making two passages in Vero76 cells in Modified Eagles Medium with Earle's Salts (EMEM) (Corning) supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX, 1% NEAA, and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco). After 3 days, supernatant was collected and clarified 350 by low speed centrifugation. Virus (P5 from the founder stock of virus) was quantified by plaque assay and determined to be endotoxin free. All virus work was handled in BSL-3 containment at USAMRIID. Mice. C57BL/6J (BL6), Rag2 KO mice and K18-hACE2 mice [B6.Cg-Tg(K18-hACE2)2Prlmn/J] (6-8 weeks old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Mice under isoflurane anesthesia 355 were challenged intranasally with the indicated dose of SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 strain diluted in a total volume of 50 \u00b5L of PBS (25 \u00b5L per nare). Mice were uniquely identified using ear tags (Stoelting) and provided an acclimation period of at least one week prior to commencement of the experiment. Mice were supplied nutrient gel when weights began to decrease. Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice Ethics statement. All animal studies were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act 360 and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and adheres to principles state in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council(49). Animal experimental protocols were approved by a standing internal institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC). The facilities where this research was conducted are fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory 365 Animal Care International. Animals meeting pre-established criteria were humanly euthanized after consultation with veterinary staff. Despite efforts to euthanize moribund mice, some were found dead (n=2). RT-qPCR. Organ tissue was homogenized in 750 \u00b5l Trizol reagent using a Tissuelyser II (spleen and liver) (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) or gentleMACS dissociator system on the RNA setting 370 (Lung). RNA was extracted from Trizol per with modifications to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, following the addition of chloroform and transfer of the aqueous layer, equal amounts of 70% Ethanol (Decon Laboratories, Inc) was added to the aqueous layer, then the nucleic acid was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Nanodrop 8000 was used to determine RNA concentration, which was then raised to 100ng/\u00b5l in 375 UltraPure distilled water. Samples were run in duplicate, 500 ng per sample, on a BioRad CFX thermal cycler using TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix according to the CDC's recommended protocol of 25\u00b0C for 2 minutes, 50\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of , 95\u00b0C for 3 seconds and 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds. The forward and reverse primer and probe sequences are: 2019-nCoV_N2-F, 5'-TTA CAA ACA TTG GCC GCA AA-3', 2019-nCoV_N2-380 R, 5'-GCG CGA CAT TCC GAA GAA-3', and 2019-nCoV_N2-P, 5'-ACA ATT TCC CCC AGC Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice GCT TCA G-3'. The limit of detection for this assay is 1 x10 4 copies. A synthetic RNA containing the real-time RT-PCR assay target sequence was acquired from Biosynthesis, Inc. (Portland,OR,USA). The approximate target copy number was determined using the nucleic acid sequence and the molecular weight of the synthetic RNA, and a stock at a known target copy number per ml 385 was generated by resuspending the RNA in TE buffer. A standard curve was generated by serially diluting the stock standard curve in DNAse/RNAse free water (Invitrogen) and running the curve concurrently with the samples being tested.Histology. Necropsy was performed on the indicated organs. Tissues were immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 14 days. Tissue were then trimmed and processed according to390 standard protocols (50). Histology sections were cut at 5-6 \u00b5M on a rotary microtome, mounted onto glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Examination of the tissue was performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. Cytokine and chemokine analysis. Serum cytokine and chemokine analysis was performed using a magnetic bead-based plex mouse panel (Thermo fisher) targeting the indicated molecules. 25 \u00b5l 395 of serum per mouse per time point was used. Plates were analyzed on a MAGPIX system (Millipore Sigma) and quantitated against standard curves using MILLIPLEX analyst software. In situ hybridization. To detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in FFPE tissues, in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 HD RED kit (Advanced Cell 400 Diagnostics, Newark, CA, USA) as described previously(51). Briefly, forty ZZ ISH probes targeting SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA fragment 21571-25392 (GenBank #LC528233.1) were designed and synthesized by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (#854841).

After rinses with PBS (pH 7.4), the section were blocked with 415 PBT (PBS +0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% normal goat serum overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then the sections were incubated with primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV Spike at a dilution of 1:200 (40150-T62-COV2, Sino Biological, Chesterbrook, PA, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV NP at a dilution of 1:200 (40143-MM05, Sino Biological), mouse monoclonal anti-pan cytokeratin at a dilution of 1:100 (sc-8018, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, 420 TX, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-e-cadherin at a dilution of 1:100 (33-4000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) at a dilution of 1:200 (A039829-2, Dako Agilent Pathology Solutions, Carpinteria, CA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-CD3 antibody at a dilution of 1:200 (A045229-2, Dako Agilent Pathology Solutions), rat monoclonal anti-CD45 antibody at a dilution of 1:100 (05-1416, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, 425 Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-CD68 at a dilution of 1After rinses with PBT, the sections were incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 at dilution of 1:500 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and goat anti-430 mouse or anti-rat Alexa Fluor 568 at a dilution of 1:500 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) antibodies, for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were cover slipped using the Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal system (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and processed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). 435 TUNEL staining. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) lung tissue sections were deparaffinized in Xyless II buffer (LabChem) 2x for 10 m each and rehydrated using an ethanol gradient (100%, 95% and 70%). Apoptotic cells were detected using the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL assay (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol. 440 NanoString gene expression analysis. Total RNA samples were analyzed using the nCounter mouse neuroinflammation (v1.0), nCounter mouse neuropathology (v1.0) and nCounter mouse myeloid (v2.0) code sets. Probe set-target RNA hybridization reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (NanoString). For each hybridization reaction, 100 ng total RNA was used. Purified probe set-target RNA complexes from each reaction were processed and 445 immobilized on nCounter cartridges using an nCounter Max preparation station, and transcripts were quantified on a digital analyzer (Gen, v.2). Data from each NanoString panel were first Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice processed independently using nSolver (v.4.0) software (NanoString) as follows: following quality control checks on the individual RCC files, raw counts across samples were normalized to the mean counts for spiked synthetic DNA-positive controls present in the hybridization reactions 450 to mitigate platform-associated sources of variation. Background thresholding was performed to the mean of negative control samples. Candidate reference genes were selected using the nCounter advanced analysis (nCAA) module (v.2.0.115), which implements the geNorm algorithm for downselection(52). Starting with a set of candidate reference genes, the algorithm identified the top five most stable genes for each panel. For each sample, normalization was 455 performed by dividing the counts for each gene by the geometric mean for the five selected reference genes. These three normalized data sets were then combined in nSolver as a multi-RLF merge experiment and then input into the nCAA module for differential expression, gene set, cell type and biological pathway analysis. The threshold for differential expression was a log2 fold change of >1 and a p-value of <0.05. 460 Statistical analysis. Survival statistics utilized the log-rank test. Statistical significance of virus titers were determined using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Significance levels were set at a p value less than 0.05. All analyzes were performed using Prism software. Golden JW, et al SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis in K18-hACE2 mice 23. Bao L, Deng W, Huang B, Gao H, Liu J, Ren L, et al.
