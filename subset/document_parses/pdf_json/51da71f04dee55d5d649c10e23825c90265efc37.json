            "text": "Coronavirus-caused diseases are common worldwide and might worsen both human health and the world economy. Most people may instantly encounter coronavirus in their life and may result in pneumonia. Nowadays, the world is fighting against the new coronavirus: COVID-19. The rate of increase is high, and the world got caught the disease unprepared. In most regions of the world, COVID-19 test is not possible due to the absence of the diagnostic kit, even if the kit exists, its false-negative (giving a negative result for a person infected with COVID-19) rate is high. Also, early detection of COVID-19 is crucial to keep its morbidity and mortality rates low. The symptoms of pneumonia are alike, and COVID-19 is no exception. The chest X-ray is the main reference in diagnosing pneumonia. Thus, the need for radiologists has been increased considerably not only to detect COVID-19 but also to identify other abnormalities it caused. Herein, a transfer learning-based multi-class convolutional neural network model was proposed for the automatic detection of pneumonia and also for differentiating non-COVID-19 pneumonia and COVID-19. The model that inputs chest X-ray images is capable of extracting radiographic patterns on chest X-ray images to turn into valuable information and monitor structural differences in the lungs caused by the diseases. The model was developed by two public datasets: Cohen dataset and Kermany dataset. The model achieves an average training accuracy of 0.9886, an average training recall of 0.9829, and an average training precision of 0.9837. Moreover, the average training false-positive and false-negative rates are 0.0085 and 0.0171, respectively. Conversely, the model's test set metrics such as average accuracy, average recall, and average precision are 97.78%, 96.67%, and 96.67%, respectively. According to the simulation results, the proposed model is promising, can quickly and accurately classify chest images, and helps doctors as the second reader in their final decision.",

The tissue of the lungs can be attacked by bacteria, viruses, and rarely parasites, as result, a lung infection may occur.

Traditionally, pneumonia is diagnosed through reviewing the patient's medical history, physical exam, and other diagnostic tests like a blood test, sputum test, pulse oximetry test. Moreover, the chest X-ray is the main tool in diagnosis. People at high risk of having pneumonia are older than 65 or younger than 2 years of age or already have health problems. The disease can be seen at any age, but children under 2 years of age, people with very low immune systems, and people over 65 years of age are at high risk. According to the data of the World Health Organization (WHO), 450 million pneumonia cases are recorded every year in the world [36] .",

The disease has worsened both human health worldwide and the world's economic health. Also, it has nearly collapsed health systems in many countries, thus it has been declared by WHO as a global pandemic [28, 42] . Indeed, the disease tied to the new coronavirus was originally called novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) and later named COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) by WHO [20] . COVID-19 negatively affected many people around the world and caused many deaths at the rate of 6.14% globally [16] . COVID-19 resembles almost 79 percent of SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS epidemic that occurred between 2002-2003, also, COVID-19 is 96 percent similar to coronaviruses seen in bats. The pathologic result of SARS and COVID-19 is diffuse alveolar damage with fibrin-rich hyaline membranes and a few multinucleated giant cells [31] , but COVID-19 is more deadly than SARS, the number of deaths in COVID-19 has already overtaken that of in SARS epidemic.",

In medicine, computerized systems assist doctors during interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment as a second reader to reduce medical errors and save time [25] . Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been a dominant method in medical imaging used in computer-aided diagnostic systems with successful results in classification and feature extraction problems due to their ability to take advantage of Spatio-temporal correlation structures. There are vast number of successful CNN based studies such as, in medical imaging, COVID-19 image classification [37] , detection of breast cancer [29] , diagnosis of lung lesions [38] , detection of hand osteoarthritis [44] and brain tumor classification [18] are some of these studies. To design a successful CNN model diverse, but labeled data corpus is required. Moreover, the quality of the images and the appropriate network are important components [19, 21, 40] . However, in situations where enough data is not available, data augmentation and transfer learning can be used [23, 27] . Transfer learning allows a pretrained model to be applied to different problems after some modifications to the model's structure and re-training the modified model for fine-tuning using the problems' dataset. It is exceptionally important where the annotated data is scarce. This is a crucial advantage of transfer learning because it is difficult to obtain adequate annotated medical data [8] .",

On the other hand, scientific developments based on deep learning have begun to emerge in medical image analysis, both in extracting features that represent data and in diagnosing diseases. CNNs, which make use of the structural and configurational information available in the images, produce expertlevel performances in the fields of medical imaging. For example, Padma and Kumari used convolution 2D techniques applied to open-source data sets of COVID-19. As a result of the study, they proposed a binary classifier that takes chest X-ray images as input to identify COVID-19 with 99% accuracy and 98% verification capability [33] . Moreover, Catak and Sahinbas used 278 positive, 66 negative X-ray images and 39 positive and 30 negative images for the test. In this study, VGG[Visual Geometry Group]16, VGG19, ResNet, DenseNet, and Inception models were used. VGG16 had the highest accuracy rate with 75% success among models [12] . In another study, Shan et al. [39] used VB-Net neural networks to detect COVID-19 infection sites on CT images. The system was trained using 249 COVID-19 patients and validated using 300 new COVID-19 patients. The proposed model gave 91.6% \u00b1 10.0% Dice similarity coefficients between automatic and manual segmentation and an average POI estimation error of 0.3% for the whole lung in the validation dataset [39] . Akram et al. [1] proposed a method that automatically classifies COVID-19 CT images. The method uses features extracted by wavelet transform and fractal texture analysis and applied feature selection with a genetic algorithm. They achieved a 92.6% accuracy rate in the method they used Naive Bayes as a classifier. Khan et al. [26] classified the contrast enhancement preprocessed COVID-19 CT images with the pre-trained DenseNet-201. As a result, they achieved a high accuracy rate of 94.76%. Sahlol et al. [37] proposed a hybrid method using Inception CNN and feature selection algorithm based on marine predators algorithm (MPA) to classify COVID X-ray images. They achieved high accuracy rates of 98.7% and 99.6% in their trials on two different datasets.",

[30] , using quite less number of COVID-19 chest X-rays, conducted deep learning-assisted automatic detection of COVID-19 and pneumonia types. They proposed CNN-based architecture, called CovXNet, that uses deep convolution with varying rates of expansion to efficiently extract various features from chest X-rays. At first, chest X-rays of normal and (viral/bacterial) pneumonia patients were used to train CovXNet. Training of this initial phase was carried out by limited chest X-rays, and later with some additional layers, the model trained more with COVID-19, and other pneumonia patients' chest X-ray images. In the proposed method, different forms of CovXNets were designed, trained with X-ray images of various resolutions, and a stacking algorithm was used for further optimization of their estimates. Finally, a gradient-based differential localization was integrated to distinguish the abnormal regions of X-ray images that refer to different types of pneumonia. Extensive experiments using two different datasets, multiple satisfactory detection performance with an accuracy of 97.4% for COVID / Normal, 96.9% for COVID / Viral pneumonia, 94.7% for COVID/Bacterial pneumonia, and 90.2% for multi-class COVID/normal/Viral/Bacterial pneumonias provides [30] .",

Conversely, Spatio-temporal correlation structures have been proven to improve the effectiveness of models [3] [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, the dataset was augmented artificially to increase the model's effective size, as image data augmentation not only prevents CNN from learning irrelevant patterns, overfitting, and memorizing exact details of training images but also supports temporal and spatial relationships. Herein, a series of online data augmentation such as reflection, translation, and scaling was applied during training. Classification model Classical deep learning models accept inputs in vectorial form; however, especially in medical images, structural information contained in nearby pixels or voxels is important, and vectorization destroys the structural information. CNNs are aiming to take advantage of spatial and configuration information. They have the ability to learn hierarchical features from the data using a backpropagation algorithm. A typical CNN pipeline in image processing contains a pile of convolution, data reduction, and accumulation layers. Convolution layers are used as small-scale detectors to explore the features of an image. Suppose I represents an input image of size m \u00d7 n in the image domain D, where I (i, j, 3) is pixel value at location (i, j ) with i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 m and j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 n. Here, the third coordinate represents the number of channels, and for the sake of being more succinct, it is usually omitted, thus, I is considered as a two-dimensional function on D. It is worth mentioning that each operation mentioned below is applied to each channel separately. CNNs are composed of a variety of layers such as convolution layers, pooling layers, fully connected layer Each convolution layer uses filters, say F of size (2p + 1) \u00d7 (2q + 1), to output so-called feature maps (aka activation maps) by convolution operation to I , that is,",

General approach is padding to obtain an output of size m \u00d7 n. See [22] for details. The convolutional layer is completed by adding bias term b(i, j ) i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 m and j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 n followed by applying nonlinear activation function \u03c3 (x) to each element of the output in (1) to destroy linearity and fix pixel values. Thus, under the assumption that both input and output of (1) having the same size, we obtain S(i, j ) = \u03c3 ((I * F )(i, j ) + b(i, j )), i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 m and j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 n. (2) For the choices of nonlinear activation functions, see [2] . After that, during the pooling layer, a downsampling operation is applied to each feature map. With an equal dimensional pooling of size k, the windowed area of size k \u00d7 k over the feature map S is summarized. The most commonly used pooling function \u03c1 is max pooling since it preserves detected features. The output of the pooling layer, say W , also depends on the stride value s, the amount of window moved after each pooling operation, and the padding t. Thus,",

However, in some cases, nucleic acid testing has some disadvantages, including delays in results, relatively low detection rate, and shortage of supplies. Moreover, in the early stages of COVID-19, some patients may already have positive pulmonary imaging findings but lack sputum and therefore may receive negative RT-PCR test results from nasopharyngeal swabs. These patients are not diagnosed as suspected or confirmed cases, isolated, treated, and become potential sources of infection. Mahmud et al. [30] identified the distinctive localization of abnormal areas on X-rays that might help to diagnose variations of the clinical features of pneumonia. It is stated that this result obtained with a small number of images can be improved by increasing the number of images. Panwar et al. [34] pointed out that economic differences may cause limitations in testing and that rapid determinations made through such images can help hospital administration and medical professionals. Dansana et al. [17] drew attention to the importance of early detection of covid19 and analyzed the data with 3 different models.
