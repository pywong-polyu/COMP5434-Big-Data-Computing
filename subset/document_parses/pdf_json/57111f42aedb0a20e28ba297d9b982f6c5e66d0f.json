The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus which causes an acute respiratory illness now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a \"coronavirus\", virions (the infective form of the virus) of bulbous surface projections of peplomers (proteins on the surface of the virus) with a net negative charge (carboxy terminus) can have distinct surface adsorption properties including specific transmembrane domain and endodomain assembly effects. It is a pathogenic nanoparticle of about 120 nm diameter where scientists and epidemiologists are just learning how quickly it spreads and the needs to mitigate exposure. It is still largely unknown how persistent they are in the environment and how they transmit beyond what is known in treating communicable viral diseases in the past. The protection of the frontline healthcare worker is of primary importance. As a result of the worldwide emergency response, there have been many fears of shortages in personal protective equipments (PPEs) including masks, suits, and face shields, but more importantly critical clinical care equipments such as ventilators, respirators, and other medical devices. These shortages are due to the unpredictable situation of producing or stocking enough supplies to prevent overwhelming the medical system and in providing tests, care, and protection with growing numbers of infected people. The procedures put in place to \"flatten the curve\" including lockdowns have also produced a tremendous strain in economic activity and has affected the supply chain, exposing the needs for new manufacturing models. To this pandemic, additive manufacturing (AM) has emerged as an alternative and rapid distribution of PPEs and medical devices. This has harnessed volunteerism in many 3D printing focus groups, universities, companies, and others to provide for emergency needs of frontline workers and hospitals. It has also largely emerged that 3D printing of polymer materials and its wide adaptation in PPEs and medical devices including rapid prototyping will play an important role in future responses to a pandemic. A new model has emerged in that design, materials, distributed manufacturing, repairs, and rapid deployment will be used for risk mitigation for many emergency situations.",

Medical devices that are being used to diagnose, prevent, and treat COVID-19 are many including diagnostic tests, ventilators, and PPEs. For testing, the in vitro diagnostic tests are usually conducted on samples such as swabs of mucus taken from the nose or throat, or blood taken from a finger prick. Testing is important to diagnose and get accurate numbers in sampling populations and assessing risks of further spreading. Although many test kits are being developed, the basic tests rely on some types of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures. Next to consider is a ventilator. This is a medical device used to assist patient breathing (by mechanical or pressure control) by moving breathable air into and out of the lungs with intubation. [1] This is considered a critical care procedure of last resorts and is typically found in intensive care units (ICU)s. On the other hand, the use of PPEs are prevalent, which serves as a barrier between infectious pathogens (e.g., viruses and bacteria) and the nose, eyes, mouth, and the skin. They are needed everywhere especially by frontline workers and are deemed consumables. Contaminants include those from respiratory secretions, body fluids, and blood. Common PPEs used in caring for patients with or under investigation for COVID-19 include isolation gowns, N95 respirators/masks, face shields/eye protection, and gloves. [1, 2] In fact, there are many other critical needs including sterilizable devices, ventilator disposables, and sample collectors that are still emerging. More importantly, these devices and test kits must first be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before usage.",

            "text": "Ventilators are a critical piece of equipment for patients suffering from COVID-19. It is estimated that about 5% of all patients with COVID-19 will require a ventilator to support their respiration while recovering from the severe lung disease. [8] It is critical for healthcare facilities to have a sufficient number of ventilators because access to such equipment directly affects the number of deaths associated with the disease in an ICU. An understanding of the operation of ventilators as they relate to the symptoms of COVID-19 are paramount as faulty design and operation can lead to unintended consequences including lung failure. To put it simply, a critically ill patient is unable to breath on their own. The mechanical ventilator supports the patient's respiration by providing positive pressure to the lungs. During inhalation, the ventilator provides tidal volume for a set amount of time. During exhalation, the positive pressure is removed and the patient exhales passively. This sequence repeats for a specified number of breaths per minute. Mechanical ventilation can be administered noninvasively using masks or helmets or invasively using endotracheal tubes (intubation). In the USA, noninvasive ventilation is not recommended for patients with COVID-19 due to the high risk of aerosolization and the rapid rate of respiratory deterioration. [8] Figure 1 shows the main components of a mechanical ventilator which are mainly the power source, controls, monitors, safety features, and auxiliary components. [9, 10] Personal protective equipment Face shields Most face and eye PPEs being used in the USA are designed, tested, and manufactured according to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z.87.1-2010 standard. [11, 12] Face shields usually have the following components: frame, visor, and suspension. Materials for commonly used PPEs for COVID-19 are summarized in Table I . Supplementary Figure S1 shows the minimum specifications in urgent manufacturing of face shields. [13] \u2022 Frame: This is the part which holds the visors, and also fits the face shield onto the head of the health personnel. There are adjustable and nonadjustable frames, metal clip-on frames, and detachable frames. \u2022 Visor: This is also known as the window/lens. Visors may also be coated to impart ultraviolet light (UV) protection, antistatic, antiglare, and antifogging properties, as well as scratch resistance features to extend its life. [11, 19] \u2022 Suspension system: These are plastic materials which could have a pin-lock system, ratchet mechanism or Velcro\u00ae. Elastic straps may be used for nonadjustable systems. Some models have temple bars, nose pads, and bridge assemblies in order to maintain correct the face shield position. Other models have bands for added support and depth adjustment.",

Air-filtering respirators prevent bacteria and other contaminants from reaching the mouth and nose. Air-supplying respirators on the other hand provide clean air to the user (health professional) usually from a tank or other uncontaminated source.

A commercially available N95-type respirator would usually have a pliable (usually aluminum) nosepiece to allow the user to adjust the fit at the nose. [14] Another type of respirator aside from the N95 respirator is the PAPR. A PAPR provides filtered air (providing positive air flow) to users in a hazardous environment. It is a device which covers the whole head of the health professional and uses a battery-powered blower providing airflow through a filter to the hood or face piece. The type of filter is dictated by the type and amount of airborne contaminant. [20] PAPRs only function in ambient environments, i.e., they do not supply air in a low-oxygen environment. [21] Essential parts of a PAPR include the cartridge/canister for filter, blower, tubing, head gear/hood, and batteries. [24] Supplementary Figure S2 (b) shows an example of a PAPR.",

            "text": "Surgical masks prevent pathogens from the mouth and nose of a health worker from contaminating a patient during surgery. Surgical masks are not effective in filtering out viruses (as viruses are smaller than bacterial pathogens). There are several classifications of surgical masks (i.e., four levels of ASTM certification) which depends on the level of protection they provide the wearer, namely, Minimum protection, Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 3 is used for heavy exposure to aerosol, spray, and fluid. Masks are tested for the following: bacteria filtration efficiency (BFE) in vitro, particle filtration efficiency, breathing resistance, splash resistance, and flammability. [16] Surgical face masks are usually made with nonwoven polypropylene (PP) fabric, with 20-25 grams per square meter (gsm) in density. The 20-gsm fabric is produced via a spunbond process. In the spunbond process, the melted plastic material is extruded in a web (on a conveyor), where strands bond with each other upon cooling. The 25-gsm mask material is produced via meltblown technology. In this process, the plastic is extruded through a die with hundreds of small nozzles. The material is then blown by hot air to become tiny fibers. Cooling and binding on a conveyor follows. The diameters of these fibers are less than 1 \u00b5m. Nonwoven (disposable) surgical masks are made with three or four layers, usually covering both sides of a layer of textile with nonwoven-bonded fabric (as filter layers). These filter layers are effective at filtering out particles above 1 \u00b5m. The level of filtration of a mask depends on several factors, namely, the way the fiber is manufactured, the structure of the resulting web, and cross-sectional shape of the fiber. In manufacturing masks, initially, the nonwoven material is assembled from bobbins, the different layers of the mask are then ultrasonically welded, and then the other parts such as the nose strips and ear loops are stamped. The masks are sterilized before packaging and shipping. [16] Protective gowns Healthcare workers need these gowns from picking up transmissible diseases from patients, and these are classified by the FDA into nonsurgical, surgical, and surgical isolation gowns. Nonsurgical isolation gowns are used to protect wearers from the transfer of body fluids and microorganisms in low or minimal risk patient isolation situations. [17] They can be based on woven and nonwoven fabrics. They can also be considered reusable (sterilizable) or disposable, respectively. Woven fabrics or textiles are mostly made from polyesters and are washable. Nonwoven-based fabrics are mostly meltblown polyethylene (PE), PP, polyamides (PAs), and polycarbonate (PC). It is to be noted that protective gowns, bonnets, and shoe covers are common clean room supplies as well and are widely available until recently.",

For the insoles, meltblown nonwoven PP, PC, or PA is usually used. [18] Overview of AM AM introduction AM, commonly called 3D printing, is an advanced fabrication method in which three-dimensional objects are created by depositing the material in a series of successive thin layers. [25] Figure 2 (a) illustrates the major steps of AM. The 3D printing workflow typically begins with a three-dimensional computeraided design (CAD) model of a part. The solid CAD model is converted to a polyhedral representation of the part, usually in the STL, OBJ, or AMF file type. [26] This 3D file is loaded into a software called a \"slicer,\" which accepts parameters from the user and \"slices\" the file into a series of layers. The slicer then generates a set of numerical instructions for building each layer in successive order and stores them in a file type, usually called G-code, that is readable by the 3D printer's microcontroller. [27, 28] The 3D printer follows the G-code instructions and builds the part by adding the material one layer at a time. When the print is completed, the user may perform post-processing operations, such as removing the support material, curing, heat treating, and cleaning. [25] Common AM technologies are shown in Fig. 2 (b). 3D printers may be classified by their mode of operation. Some of the most common 3D printing technologies are summarized in Table II . Supplementary Figure S3 illustrates the fuse deposition modelling, which is the most common 3D printing technology. [29] 3D printing enables the manufacture of geometrically complex parts with little added complexity to the user. [35] Among AM's core uses are short run production, rapid prototyping, experimental material research, injection mold making or tooling, and product visualization. AM produces significantly less waste than traditional subtractive manufacturing methods, such as computer numerically controlled machining. [25, 28] Recently, 3D printing has been used in advanced applications to create biocompatible medical devices, silicone foams with tunable elastic properties, high-performance composite materials, and highly efficient salt water desalination membranes.

Many companies, universities, and research centers in the 3D printing community are contributing to the design and production of different types of PPE locally. These include reusable respirator/protective facial mask to tackle the deficiency of N95 mask, facial shield to give extra protection of essential workers, and hands-free door-open accessories to open the door using arms instead of the hand. Likewise, there are other small parts produced by rapid prototyping 3D printing such as the attachment on masks or goggles for a better fit, 3D-printed human head models to test the seal function of the masks or goggles.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human services -National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases led and created the NIH 3D Print Exchange website, where hundreds of 3D-printed medical models including PPE designs are available. The FDA has released guidelines for 3D printing relief items and directs readers to a NIH website which is functioning as an exchange for 3D printable files and information. [37, 38] Among the different PPEs, the APR is one of the most effective equipment to decrease the spread of airborne virus. Lots of efforts from the 3D printing community has responded to producing reusable protective masks. Different designs of printing mask .stl files were released as open resource to the community. Current efforts on 3D printing reusable protective mask from worldwide organizations are summarized in Table III . Aside from the listed projects here, many projects are being done by individuals and teams on websites as summarized in Supplementary Table SII . Each of these designs include a sealed cup-shaped part along the lower face, as well as a removable cartridge and cap to sit the filtration unit. While different printing materials including polymer filament and sintering polymer powder were chosen for the mask, different 3D printing methods were involved including fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA) and multi-jet fusion (MJF). The FDM printing method has minimal requirement on the printing materials, and the most popular filaments used are polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) due to their wide availability in 3D printing labs. For example, Provenzano et al. from George Washington University selected several designs from the open resource and used PLA and ABS filament for FDM 3D printing. They evaluated the printability, leakage, and fitting performance of each model and further improved the model based on seal, comfort, and sizing. [45] The Copper 3D company, which produce antibacterial 3D printing filament, developed their own model NANOHACK 2.0 based on FDM 3D printing. They employed their own antibacterial PLACTIVE\u00a9 filament, which is a FDA-registered material that could eliminate more than 99.99% of fungi, viruses, and bacteria. [46] Burget and coworkers from Czech Technical University developed their own prototype of protective mask using an HP Multijet Fusion printer, which sinters polyamide (PA) powders in contrast to melting polymer filaments. They achieved the production efficiency of approximately 70-100 pieces/day per equipment. They also specify that the printed parts possess more compact structures compared with FDM printing, which are much impermeable to virus and microorganisms. [47] Table II.

            "text": "Many hospitals around the world do not have enough equipment in their facilities to accommodate all of their patients for COVID-19. Because of this shortage, many companies and universities are using 3D printing to provide the equipment and parts that hospitals need, particularly ventilators. Figure 3 shows 3D-printed devices and facilities to address the needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many organizations are already developing new ways to manufacture ventilators such as the Oxford University OxVent, [52] Mechanical Ventilator Milano, [53] and MIT Mechanical Ventilator [54] just to name a few. These designs are low cost, freely available online, and are meant to be mass produced in case of an emergency. The low cost of these three ventilators come from their use of off-the-shelf components and manual bag valves commonly found in medical facilities. The current practice for the bag valves requires manual operation during patient transport. However, there is some concern with these designs because critically ill COVID-19 patients usually require intubation which these designs do not support. Perhaps, other designs such as VentilAid [55] and E-Vent [56] are more favored due to their simplicity and manufacturability. The ventilator design challenge has even reached automotive companies. Tesla is designing a ventilator using spare parts from their Model 3, [57] and many other automakers, like Volkswagen, have claimed to begin manufacturing ventilators as well. [58] Many groups are also helping with replacement parts to the existing equipment. Isinnova, an Italian engineering firm, 3D-printed replacement oxygen valves for a local hospital. Another Italian company, CRP Technology, manufactured emergency valves for assisted ventilation. [58] Johns Hopkins University has designed a ventilator splitter to allow ventilators to be shared with multiple patients, [59] and a similar ventilator splitter has been produced by Prisma Health, a health organization in South Carolina. [58] Many of the designs made by these companies are \"free use,\" so that anyone around the world can print their design and help their communities. While potentially useful, many are concerned about the use of ventilator splitters. Splitting the air flow between multiple patients will not guarantee each patient will receive adequate amounts of air. Also, the defects that can come with 3D-printed models may lead to high risks of cross-contamination. ",

            "text": "Polymer materials can be classified into three major categories: thermoplastics, elastomers, and thermosets. [64] Thermoplastics are mostly composed of linear molecular chains, and the interactions between individual chains are physical interactions, such as Van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding. Typical thermoplastic polymers are PE, PP, polyamides (PA), PLA, and PVC. The physical interaction between linear chains can be broken by heat or solvent, which allows the thermoplastic to be processed by melting or dissolving. [65] Traditional heat processing includes injection molding, blow molding, and compression molding where polymers are heated above its melting temperature to become liquified, followed by pressurizing into a mold and solidifies by cooling. The shapes of thermoplastic products are determined by the geometry of the mold. Solution processing is also used for thermoplastic, especially in thin film fabrication, where polymers are dissolved in an appropriate solvent, deposited onto targeted surfaces, and the polymers will solidify upon the drying of the solvent. Both heat and solution processing are employed in 3D printing of thermoplastics. FDM, [36, 66] one of the most dominant 3D printing technique, is based on the melt-extrusion-deposition process of thermoplastics, as shown in Supplementary  Fig. S3 . Instead of shaping polymer into molds, 3D printing builds polymer in a mold-free process in which architectures are generated via a layer-by-layer stacking manner. Direct ink writing (DIW) or viscous solution printing has been recently used to 3D print thermoplastic polymers in solution. To maintain the 3D shape of polymer solutions, the rheological properties and solvent evaporation rate need to be properly modified. [35, 67] A thermoset polymer is composed of molecular networks in which polymer chains are connected together by covalent bonds (chemically). Gels and pastes can be crosslinked by noncovalent bonds (physical interactions). Therefore, thermosets cannot be melted or dissolved due to the strong covalent crosslinking interaction. Processing of a thermoset is normally conducted by injecting unreacted or partially reacted precursors into a mold, followed by complete crosslinking inside the mold [64, 65] and also requiring the material to be thixotropic. 3D printing of thermosets also starts with the liquid precursor. Depending on the crosslinking mechanism, different techniques are applied. UV-cured thermosets, such as acrylate-based resin, are normally printed by SLA, while thermally cured thermosets are mostly printed by DIW. [33, 68] Elastomers can be further classified as thermoplastic elastomers or thermoset elastomers which describe their origin or similarity in properties to the two other classes of polymers.",

It can have various tacticities and higher crystallinity. It has low strength and hardness, but high ductility and toughness. In general, it has better thermomechanical properties and chemical resistance. \u2022 PVC: When the methyl group of PP is replaced by chloride, it gives very different properties than PP or PE. It has very high hardness, rigidity and mechanical strength, and excellent chemical resistance to acid, base, and salts. To process these materials, heavy plasticization including phthalates is required. \u2022 Polyamide (PA), also called nylon, is a family of synthetic polymers with repeating units linked by amide groups. PA is normally produced by the condensation reaction. It can also be produced by the self-reaction of amino acid or ringopening polymerization of lactam, producing a mono repeating unit. The amide group (--CO-NH) is highly polar and forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds which facilitates the crystallization of PAs, thus offering excellent mechanical strength and chemical resistance. confers high rigidity, and the BPA structure exhibits excellent impact resistance, durability, and high temperature resistance. \u2022 PLA is a thermoplastic polyester, which draws great attention recently due to its derivation from renewable resources and biodegradability. It is produced from ring-opening polymerization of lactide, a monomer that has abundant renewable feedstocks. \u2022 Polyurethane (PU) is a class of polymers with repeating units linked by urethane groups additively, which is produced by the reaction between isocyanate and hydroxyl groups. PU can be divided into two categories: crosslinked PU and thermoplastic PU (TPU). TPU is one of the most important elastomeric polymers. It consists of alternating hard segments in which short rigid structures form crystalline domain, and soft segments in which long soft chains generate amorphous domain. \u2022 Silicone also called polysiloxane, refers to polymers that contain siloxane group, consists of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms. The siloxane chains exhibit excellent heat resistance, low thermal conductivity, low electrical conductivity, low toxicity, and high hydrophobicity. When the siloxane groups are crosslinked into a network, silicone becomes a highly elastic rubber with superb properties.",

For clinical use, the FDA standard has the final word for certifying the application with contact to the human body. Specific challenges in applying these standards to 3D-printed polymer parts can be addressed by fist evaluating with existing monolith materials standards (ASTM, ISO, and EN) and then differentiating the directionality of the additive layering process including the role of post-printing curing or annealing. Reliability and sterility in clinical settings will be important and is a role fulfilled by the FDA approval process.",

Face masks/shields, Venturi valves, and other oxygen masks are some of the most sought after equipment seeking approval in a new 3D-printed form. Table V outlines how some of the highest affected countries and their government medical agencies are responding to these demands for 3D-printed equipment. Most of the designs for 3D-printed PPE and devices fall into the Class I and Class II devices. The various types of medical devices and their qualifications are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5 . [93, 94] A few agencies that seem to be leading the charge in developing guidelines and approvals for these new devices are the FDA of the United States and Health Canada of Canada. Knowing that 3D-printed medical devices and PPE can give rise to concerns about compromised levels of cleanliness and protection, both countries have designed specific protocol and requirements that must be followed before approval, and production of PPE and medical devices can ensue. Both the FDA and Health Canada are working to authorize a few key designs that can be widely produced to allow for enhanced quality control. [13, 83] Like the FDA and Health Canada, the European Union (EU) has also quickly developed changes to their existing medical procedures to specifically combat the spread of COVID-19 with the help of these 3D-printed pieces of equipment. Forms and guidelines are required to be met before approval from the EU and can be given for designs and production. Harmonized standards are now available for these 3D-printed devices to follow, and some Class I devices can even make it to market with a declaration of conformity.

A producer may participate in a Cooperative Network if it cannot meet the desired service-level requirement of its external customers. The network would consolidate the external customers and routes an arriving external customer to one of the members. [99] On the other hand, Distributed Manufacturing is a form of decentralized production/manufacturing which is autonomous and is near the end-user. This form of manufacturing usually makes use of information technology. This is the opposite of the traditional centralized way of manufacturing which is large in scale and usually needs long lead time and forecasting. [100] In this framework, the process of producing goods/items/ devices will start from the need in the community or industries. Standards (either in the item/device itself or in the manufacturing process or testing procedures) will have to be considered. Government regulations for the production, distribution, use, and disposal will also have to be considered as well. File sharing communities (web) such as thingiverse and grabcad in the case of 3D printing will also play an important role in this framework. A local or national database of all who have 3D printers as well as the available 3D printing technologies and materials will have to be established preferably by a university or a maker community in a locality. These local players will then try to localize designs available in file-sharing communities. This DiCAM network may be tapped during National Emergencies or even during local disasters/needs.",
