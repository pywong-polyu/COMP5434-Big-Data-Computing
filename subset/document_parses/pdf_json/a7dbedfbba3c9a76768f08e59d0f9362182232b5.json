This study aims to explore how risks of coronavirus infection interact across age groups using data from South Korea. Methods: Daily new COVID-19 cases from 10 March to 30 April 2020 were scraped from online open sources. A multivariate vector autoregressive model for time series of count data was used to examine the risk interactions across age groups. Case counts from previous days were included as predictors to dynamically examine the change of risk patterns. Results: In South Korea, the risk of coronavirus infection among elderly people was significantly affected by other age groups. An increase in virus infection among people aged 20-39 was associated with a double risk of infection among elderly people. Meanwhile, an increase in virus infection among elderly people was also significantly associated with risks of infection among other age groups. The risks of infection among younger people were relatively unaffected by that of other age groups. Conclusions: Protecting elderly people from coronavirus infection could not only reduce the risk of infection among themselves but also ameliorate the risks of virus infection among other age groups. Such interventions should be effective and for the long term.",

Since December 2019, over 11 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over 528,000 people have died of coronavirus infection (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, accessed on 4 July 2020). Of them, elderly people and people with underlying chronic conditions suffered the heaviest disease burden [3] [4] [5] . For example, in the US, as reported by the US Center for Disease Control and Intervention, about 80% of deaths were people aged 65 or above (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html), and 43.4% of hospitalizations were people aged 65 or above [6, 7] . On the other hand, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in South Korea was about 2.1% as of 16 July 2020, according to the Korea Center for Disease Control report (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/).",

Elderly people generally have weaker immune systems than younger people due to aging, and they are also more likely to have multiple chronic conditions [9, 10] . Thus, elderly people may have severe symptoms if infected with coronavirus [11, 12] . On the other hand, elderly people may have been exposed to myriads of infections over their lifetime which may provide partial immunity against new virus infection. Although cross-reaction of antibodies between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was observed, cross-neutralization was rare [13] . Thus, it was unlikely elderly people might have any effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",

Unfortunately, due to insufficient testing kits, heterogeneous diagnosis criteria, and varied implementation of different interventions, epidemiological data on COVID-19 pandemic among different countries (and even within a country) and during different periods were often noncomparable [14] . One notable exception is South Korea, where extensive contact tracing and mass testing not only curtailed the epidemic but also generated high-quality data. In South Korea, both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases were identified promptly from the very beginning of the epidemic [15, 16] . Thus, depicting a complete picture of the epidemic process was possible in South Korea.",

The COVID-19 pandemic was waning down since 10 March 2020 (see Figure 1 ) [17, 18] . However, potential rebounds of new cases have been warned by many public health experts [19] . This is reflected in an epidemic curve with a long tail and occasional spikes, which is demonstrated in the epidemic process in South Korea (https://www.kcdc.info/covid-19/) [15, 16] . In addition, if the seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity of SARS-CoV-2 behave like previous coronaviruses, a recent study predicted that a long-lasting and multi-wave epidemic was possible [20] . Furthermore, after the first epidemic peak is passed, which suggests mitigating interventions are likely effective, the society is expected to gradually return to normalcy [21] . Strategies for re-opening the society should be evaluated, and exploring risk patterns of infection during the post-peak period will provide important evidence for decision-making. In the COVID-19 epidemic, given the disproportional disease burden born by elderly people, it is imperative to examine risk patterns of coronavirus infection among elderly people after the peak of the epidemic. Epidemic data from South Korea will allow us to examine the risk interactions among different age groups, which can serve as an exemplary reference model for other countries.",

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo was used to obtain posterior distributions of parameters. Diagnostic plots showed all chains mixed satisfactorily and were converged. In addition, negative binomial models were also fitted, and results were similar to those reported here except for wider confidence intervals (Appendix B, Table A1 ). Notice that the dispersion factors (1/\u03be) estimated from the generalized Poisson models were 2.66 (1.58-5.13), 1.44 (0.96-2.46), 2.21 (1.37-3.82), and 0.90 (0.59-1.50) for those aged 60 or above, 40-59, 20-39, and 0-19, respectively. These estimates were of moderate magnitude and two of them (age group 40-59 and 0-19) were not statistically different from 1. This also suggested that negative binomial models might overestimate the dispersion factors which led to wider confidence intervals.

Figure 1 presents the epidemic curves with fitted values by age groups for South Korea. After 10 March, there was a small spike among those aged 60 or above around 20 March 2020, and a small rebound among those aged 20-39 (e.g., around 30 March to 5 April 2020), followed by those aged 40-59 and aged 60 or older. Table 1 describes associations of risks of infection across age groups in South Korea. In addition to tracking the effect from the first lag day (yesterday) among elderly people, the current daily counts of infection among elderly people were doubled (risk ratio = 2) with a one-unit increase in the natural logarithm of case counts (or 2.8 times increase in daily counts) on the day before yesterday (lag 2) among those aged 20-39. Additionally, an increase in infection during the fourth prior day (lag 4) in those aged 20-39 was associated with a decrease in daily counts in elderly people, possibly due to a periodic effect. As the epidemic came in waves, an increase in the case counts in the young age group would have taken an additional four days to qualitatively impact the risk of infection among elderly people. Finally, an increase in infection in the youngest population during the fifth lag days was also associated with an increased risk of infection among elderly people by 64%.",

Although virus transmission might differ among age groups [8, 29] , the risk interactions were likely due to personal interactions between people of different age groups. Respiratory infectious diseases often spread through personal contacts [30] . Previous studies showed that contacts were more frequent in young age groups than older age groups, and interactions across age groups were less frequent than within each age group [31] . During the emerging pandemic of COVID-19, stringent control measures such as lock-down, strict social distancing, and stay-at-home rules, were often implemented promptly, leading to an abrupt and significant change in contact patterns within and between age groups. Modern techniques such as contract tracing apps, infection risk IDs, and instant notifications of cases also allowed us to efficiently isolate cases and quarantine high-risk people. The observed risk interactions between age groups in South Korea might be largely due to the change in contact patterns during the pandemic period. As shown in our study, there were two-five lagging days in the risk interactions across age groups, especially between old and young people. On the other hand, the infection among elderly people may still be affected by and also affect the risks of infection among other age groups. In addition, in the US, half of the infected cases could not be traced back to known cases in a telephone survey conducted in outpatient and inpatient settings of academic medical centers [32] . Therefore, although elderly people may refrain from contacting known cases, they may be still at risk of infection by doing regular activities such as grocery shopping. Passive community interactions may play an important role in sustaining the epidemic.",

It should be noted that this type of model likely overfits the data, and collinearity among lag variables also exists. Thus, having a priori hypotheses and choosing biologically relevant lags are critical in building correct models and interpreting the results. Our lag models were based on the observed incubation period of COVID-19 and for testing pre-specified hypotheses. The principle of our methods was similar to that of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [41] and University of Texas-Austin models [42] , all of which relied on time series analysis of count data. However, we did not attempt to predict future cases.
