Strategies to address these challenges included establishing regular team-meetings to develop new solutions, focusing on few reliable sources of information, working in alternating shifts, increasing telemedicine, establishing window and open-air practices and building networks with other health care providers. Respondents criticized the lack of consideration of their experiences in planning pandemic measures within primary care.",

Even well-prepared countries were unable to provide medical staff with sufficient equipment, potentially resulting in unnecessary fatalities among frontline workers (general practitioners and hospital staff) and the spread of the virus in nursing homes (5, 6) . Even though the role of primary care (PC) in health emergencies is essential (7) , research on pandemics revealed gaps involving primary care in pandemic preparedness and response planning. Challenges identified during the influenza A (H1N1), the SARS pandemic and previous local disease outbreaks were: Restrictions in the provision of information and guidelines, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), performing public health tasks, obtaining support from authorities, adequate training, emotional impacts of facing an unknown pathogen, high workload, financing of epidemic/pandemic measures, organizing of practices and care of those taken ill (8, 9) . In case of SARS-CoV-2, general practitioners not only had to react to a pandemic outbreak, but were also confronted with a disease without being able to follow the recommendations to protect themselves, their staff and patients from infection.",

Routine consultations were cancelled and telephone triage has been introduced before patients are admitted to the practice. This led to the challenge to steer indignant and unsettled patients who felt threatened by the pandemic and entered the practice or kept their symptoms secret, which was already found at the 2009/A/H1N1 pandemic (26) . The familiarity between GP and patient is an important aspect that differs from other medical specialists.

While GPs in the U.S. were confronted with a lack of reimbursement of telehealth care and Senate's stimulus package of March 2020 does not provide funding for self-employed GPs (27) , financial worries, especially due to quarantine, are unnecessary for GPs in Germany. Section 56 of the infection protection law stipulates that GPs and their practice staff are entitled to compensation if the practice is banned for infection protection reasons (28) . The concerns are subjected to the lack of information. Less clearly regulated, is the loss of income for the time of reducing patient contacts to a minimum. As long as financial issues are settled posthoc, the financial worries of PC providers will remain during the pandemic. Internationally, there are good examples of adhoc support: Australia provided incentive payments to keep practices open, transferred personal billing practices to telehealth consultations and offered financial support during the crisis (29) . New Zealand reimbursed GPs for the costs of the transition to telehealth care (2) .",

Later during the pandemic, a monitoring system for intensive care beds (with ventilation options) was set up in Germany. Further key aspects were overloaded hotlines and the unavailability of health departments and politicians who made promises that could not be met by the GPs. This reflected that PC representatives were only marginally involved in development of pandemic preparedness plans and measures. A claim to include PC physicians in the pandemic planning was already made by Dunlop et al. (30) . Clark went even further: \"This need goes beyond having representatives of physician specialty organizations; rather, there should be a mechanism to solicit input from providers currently practicing in PC (not hospital-based) settings\" (31) . Our findings suggest that there is an urgent need to establish a strong two-way communication channel between care providers and politicians, because no one can better provide information on the actual situation at the frontline than the frontline workers themselves. This cooperation provides the chance to exploit the maximum potential of options to handle a health emergency. The time to establish the communication channels is now-during the ongoing pandemic. Furthermore, these communication channels should be implemented permanently, as they have the potential to strengthen the overall functioning and resilience of the PC system.",

Despite various challenges, GPs have successfully applied pragmatic and creative strategies in their practices to overcome the difficulties during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These valuable strategies presented here should be considered in primary care and preserved and provided with future pandemic preparedness plans. Increased communication within and between practices to share knowledge and experiences proved to be a key strategy. It allowed to deal with worries and establish innovative ideas such as sharing forces and pooling remaining PPE. Pandemic preparedness plans should include options to ensure this kind of communication. Stakeholders should address the reported system deficits such as insufficient flow of information and lack of consideration of the experience of GPs in the planning and implementation of pandemic measures. As a first step, stakeholders must recognize that (1) the key medical specialists who will provide patient care during a pandemic are the general practitioners and (2) that their practical experiences provide a valuable resource to support the feasibility of pandemic measures to ensure patient care.",
