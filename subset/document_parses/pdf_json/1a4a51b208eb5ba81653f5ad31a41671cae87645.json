            "text": "Introduction: Health care workers are at the frontline of the response against the COVID-19 outbreak. Poor preparedness and infection prevention practices among health care workers compound the hazard and occurrence of COVID-19 hospital transmission. Thus, the study aimed to assess preparedness toward COVID-19 pandemics and associated factors among health care workers in Hospitals of Eastern Ethiopia. Methods: Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 20 June to July 10 2020. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 423 health care workers. Data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS Version 23. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with the outcome variable, and statistical significance was declared at a p-value less than 0.05. Results: This study revealed that the proportion of health care workers' preparedness toward the COVID-19 pandemic was 40.9% (95% CI: 36.2-45.9). Working in a public hospital (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.6-4.3), being unafraid of transmitting COVID-19 to patients (Adjusted odds ratio/AOR = 4.6, 95% CI: 2.2-10.0), feeling safe at the workplace (AOR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.7-6.4)), satisfied with the infection control policy (AOR = 6.0, 95% CI: 2.3-15.0), and not feeling anxious about the likelihood of COVID-19 spread (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3-3.4) were significantly associated with COVID-19 preparedness. Conclusion: The majority of the health care workers were not prepared for COVID-19 pandemics. Feeling safe at the workplace scared of transmitting COVID-19 to patients, satisfied with the infection control policy, and feeling anxious concerning the likelihood of COVID-19 were factors associated with health care workers' preparedness to COVID-19. The current awareness creation training, including motivational and psychological preparation for all health care workers, is mandatory, regardless of their profession or working place.",

            "text": "COVID-19 has first emerged as a group of mysterious cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, China 1,2 and it was declared as a pandemic disease by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 after it was declared first as a public health emergency disease back in the start of March 2020. 3 COVID-19, which has never been detected previously in humans, is capable of transmitting both from human-tohuman and animal-to-human. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Even though the major route of transmission of the COVID-19 is through the respiratory route (sneezing and coughing), it can also be transmitted by touching already infected objects and surfaces, which indicates that the virus can live in many places. 3, 5, 6 The clinical features of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to symptomatic by showing severe respiratory impairments. [7] [8] [9] However, the most common symptom of the virus is mainly respiratory, including shortness of breath, cough, and fever, 4,6-8, 10 and the rare ones include the inability to smell and taste, diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and hemoptysis. [9] [10] [11] The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the already existed problem of the world about the economic predicament, morbidity, and mortality. 2, 12, 13 Globally, the last updated, from 3 October 2020, confirmed cases of COVID-19: 34,838,209, deaths: 1,033,356, and recovered: 25,898,926 were reported. 2, 12 In Ethiopia, the first reported case of COVID-19 was from Addis Ababa on 31 March 2020 and currently there are 289,962 confirmed cases and 4489 deaths from COVID-19 pandemic. 14, 15 With the predominant upsetting problem of COVID-19, different kinds of measures were taken by countries around the globe to prevent its continuous worldwide spread, including complete lockdown, quarantine service for suspected persons, avoidance of crowding, and closing of transport and education services. 16, 17 According to the Amnesty analysis, worldwide there were more than 17,000 health care workers (HCWs) have died because of this pandemic. According to Amnesty, as of figures compiled by Friday, at least 3507 HCWs died from COVID-19 in the United States, with the number of 3371 in Mexico, 1143 in Brazil, 1131 in Russia, and 931 in the United Kingdom. Unsafe working conditions and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been some of the main issues faced by health workers worldwide throughout the pandemic, especially in the early phases. 18 In Ethiopia, the total deaths due to nosocomial infections (NIs) are estimated to account for 691,000 individuals (30%). 12 This study aimed to fill the current information gap by assessing preparedness toward the COVID-19 pandemic and its factors affecting HCWs in Dire Dawa health facilities, Eastern Ethiopia. The questions that we have tried to answer to this study were as follows: To what extent do HCWs have prepared toward COVID-19 pandemics? And which predictors have a significant (major) effect on preparedness among frontline HCWs?",

This study was almost similar with study conducted in North West of Ethiopia (41.3%). 20 In this study, we tried to look compared HCWs' preparedness between public and private health facilities and it was found that HCWs in the public hospital were 2.7 times prepared for COVID-19 than those who were working in private hospitals. This is contradict with the study conducted in Palestine where governmental hospitals were significantly less likely to have all appropriate PPE than non-governmental institutions (p = 0.001). The difference might be due to the lack of accesses of PPE equipment in Ethiopia to distribute for private health facilities. In addition, this could be because of the availability and accessibility of PPE and hygiene materials within public hospitals/ HCs, as support from governmental and non-governmental organizations prioritize to private health facilities. 21 This study also identified a significant association between HCW's preparedness and satisfaction with the infection prevention strategy at their hospital. Accordingly, those satisfied HCWs were 6.0 times more likely to be prepared to COVID-19 than those who were not. This finding is congruent with a similar study conducted in Ethiopia. 22 This could satisfy health professionals to have a good psychological and physical readiness to combat COVID-19 infection.",

This finding could indirectly suggest a difference in self-assurance developed in advance among HCWs which has to do with confidence while doing their routines, either learned or gained knowledge and experiences; this means that unprepared HCWs are scared to transmit their patients. This finding was inconsistent with the studies done in African countries. 23 The difference might be personal belief/thinking that means scared to transmit disease. In the current study, a sense of safety or security/ feeling safe at their workplace with the existing safety measures showed significant association with preparedness toward COVID-19. Accordingly, HCWs having a sense of safety or feeling of security were 3.3 times more likely to prepare than those who do not feel safe. The possible reason for the observed association could be the positive impression of HCWs possesses on their work environment, intellectual perception, or conscious awareness. In action to this, those HCWs, who feel safe at the workplace, could have enough confidence about their preparedness compared to their counterparts. This finding is supported by the study conducted in India. 13 Although feeling safe about their colleagues with the existing safety measures, concerned about dealing with COVID-19 patients and age was previously reported to have a significant effect on preparedness to COVID-19, 24,25 none of them showed such effect in our study. 24, 25 Since the study was cross-sectional, it did not establish a possible temporal relationship. Also, the scarcity of similar studies makes it difficult to compare our findings with other findings. Finally, our search strategy found limited studies, especially no studies from our country.",
