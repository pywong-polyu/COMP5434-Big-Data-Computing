The respondents were able to answer 80-90% of the knowledge-based questions of the survey. A more careful/anxious attitude, but not knowledge, was associated with overall better practice (p = 0.03). Also, respondents stated that they are dispensing protective equipment items such as masks (87%), gloves (60%), and sanitizers (77%) in small quantities due to limited availability. Conclusion: Our findings revealed an adequate level of knowledge and good practice towards COVID-19 among Lebanese community pharmacists. Their fears of contracting the virus and compromising the safety of those around them are justified. However, their supply of protective equipment is limited.",

The COVID-19 typically spreads from person-to-person by respiratory droplets produced while coughing or sneezing; transmission also occurs through contaminated surfaces. The global impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918-1919 H1N1 influenza pandemic [5] . Sequentially, several global interventions were proposed and implemented to flatten the spread curve and avoid overwhelming healthcare facilities. Travel restrictions, closing schools, colleges, bars, and restaurants, banning crowded events, and social distancing were all part of the global lockdown strategy [6] .",

A high percentage of up to 90% was found on the basic knowledge questions related to preventive measures, tests, and quarantine duration, indicating that most respondents are knowledgeable about COVID-19 general information. This finding was expected since this survey was conducted in mid-March, around one month following the announcement of the first COVID-19 case in Lebanon [18] and after several authorities diffused information regarding COVID-19, communicated to the general population through mass media. These results can further be explained by the sample characteristics that included young pharmacists, fresh graduates, and senior pharmacy students, who have better access to social media platforms than their elderly counterparts. Our results are similar to those of Zhong et al. who found an overall knowledge rate of 90% among Chinese residents [19] . Similarly, Huynh et al. showed that healthcare workers, particularly pharmacists, had a high level of knowledge about the COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam [20] . However, a lower knowledge (up to 70%) was found for more delicate and less addressed questions in the media: a significant percentage of pharmacists do not have the correct information related to the risk of attending funerals, pets contact, number of PCR tests before releasing a person from quarantine, and currently available treatments; this could be attributed to the short period allocated for reading about COVID-19 updates (< 1 h up to 2 h per day) and the limited availability of information about these subjects at the time of data collection and may imply that pharmacists need to allocate more time reading and learning new information about this pandemic.",

Advice about pets should also be clear since some people in Lebanon are needlessly abandoning their pets [21] or do not disinfect them properly before they enter the home. Moreover, the respondents did not know about the usefulness of vitamin C supplementation [22] or the relative contraindication of NSAIDs and steroids to treat COVID-19, despite clear recommendations by health authorities to avoid them until the controversy over their use is solved [23] .

Thus, most participants relied on credible resources to raise awareness in the community; however, a significant number still relied on television, Facebook, and even family and friends to get information. In the same line, Huynh et al. found that healthcare workers are more interested in social media to gather knowledge on an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19 than the official website of the Ministry of Health [20] . Moreover, the Lebanese community pharmacists requested the authorities to provide them with additional information, training, and clear recommendations on COVID-19 protection measures outside the hospital setting. This issue should be a primary concern for the Lebanese government and relevant authorities to consider and provide several choices of learning materials and platforms, aiming to update the data on this epidemic and communicate information to pharmacists who lack knowledge or are not current on issues relating to COVID-19. Well-informed pharmacists are expected to protect themselves better and provide more appropriate advice to their patients. It is suggested that the adapted documents prepared by our team be diffused to all Lebanese pharmacists (Available at www. inspe ct-lb. org/ covid-19infor mation). Finally, our results revealed no significant relationship between overall knowledge and practices, explained by the somewhat homogeneous knowledge and practice of pharmacists, the modest sample size, or information bias (practices affected by social desirability).",

However, in the long term, this might be risky. Indeed, the majority of pharmacists had justified attitudes of exhaustion and fear of getting the virus or passing it on to family members, consistent with the findings of studies conducted in Vietnam and Taiwan [20, 26] . It is paramount to implement occupational safety measures and reinforce the trust of healthcare workers in the system. These measures would mitigate the potential decline of pharmacists' availability and productivity (due to anxiety and exhaustion) and the possible increase in infections [26] .",

A poor practice worth noting is coming to work despite not feeling well, as reported by a group of pharmacists; also, pharmacy owners seemed to adopt better practices than employees. As for patients' services, appropriate practices were noted, with pharmacists reluctant to decide even for patients panicking without any other suggestive history and referring to physicians and MOPH when unnecessary. Moreover, pharmacists referred to laboratory testing without compelling indication, knowing that Lebanon has a shortage of testing kits; therefore, misinterpretation of results might be deleterious for patients' health. Furthermore, pharmacists reported a limitation of protective equipment provision, which could jeopardize both patients' and pharmacists' health. Public health authorities should remain vigilant regarding the physical and mental health of the healthcare workers and workplace conditions. Given the underlying economic difficulties and the delays in protective equipment supplies, under-resourced and overworked pharmacists might face the real possibility of catching the infection in a rapidly developing pandemic: the result can be detrimental to the community and the nation. Appropriate knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards coronavirus containment and better protection will ease concerns both for pharmacists and the patients they serve while contributing to breaking the cycle of virus spread in the community. Therefore, public health authorities are urged to maintain implementing and monitoring the containment of COVID-19 and promote measures to protect healthcare workers in general, pharmacists and pharmacy workers in particular, as recommended by the FIP [27] .",

Given the new and evolving knowledge of the subject matter, some of the valid responses provided in the study are no longer correct/ accurate. Additionally, during that time, new information from various health entities was released daily, which could have impacted the answers and the accuracy of the findings/conclusions of the study. Furthermore, the sample was not random, collected by the snowball method over a limited period to quickly get an idea of the knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19, in the current pandemic. Also, it is difficult to generalize our results to all Lebanese community pharmacists, since our sample consisted of more females and young pharmacists, comfortable in English, with easy access to social media: a selection bias is thus suspected, and our results may represent the best-case scenario of pharmacists' information and practices. Pharmacists who did not participate might have poor access to social media and preventive information, particularly those intended for healthcare professionals. Although the questionnaire was piloted and adjusted before adopting the final version, it was developed on Google forms and made available online, thus restricting the participation of older pharmacists and those with little computer literacy and poor internet access. Nevertheless, the online questionnaire led to wide accessibility among pharmacists all over Lebanon; the anonymity of the questionnaire would also lead to a lower information bias, although a better measurement would be expected with validated scales. Based on the above, future studies conducted on a larger sample and using validated measurement scales would help the competent authorities design appropriately tailored interventions at the national level.",
