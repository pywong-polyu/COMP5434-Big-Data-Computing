            "text": "The goal of this study was to develop a quantitative detection system for severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), targeting the nucleocapsid protein (NP), to determine the presence and degree of infection in suspected individuals. Because the NP is the viral protein shed during infection and its template mRNA is the most abundant subgenomic RNA, it is a suitable candidate for developing antibodies for diagnostic applications. In this study, we have prepared full-length SARS-CoV NP expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Full-length NP was used for the preparation of mouse monoclonal antibody and chicken polyclonal IgY antibodies for the development of heterosandwich ELISA for early diag-nostics of SARS-suspected individuals. The sensitivity of the developed heterosandwich ELISA can detect the viral antigen at 18.5 pg/mL of recombinant NP. This study describes ultrasensitive ELISA using 19B6 monoclonal antibody as the capture antibody and IgY as the detecting antibody against the most abundant SARS-CoV NP antigens. One of the most important findings was the use of inexpensive polyclonal IgY antibody to increase the sensitivity of the detection system for SARS-CoV at the picogram level. Furthermore, the immunoassay of SARS-CoV NP antigen developed could be an effective and sensitive method of diagnosing SARS-suspected individuals during a future SARS-CoV outbreak.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has caused serious worldwide epidemics. Because it is highly contagious, potentially life-threatening, and spreads rapidly, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization continue to closely monitor the SARS situation to strictly control its spread. Because it is an airborne disease, and is easily transmitted from person to person, several measures have been taken to prevent the recurrence of another SARS outbreak. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002 and 2003 , there is growing demand for diagnostic tools for early, accurate, and safe laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV. Thus, the development and evaluation of specific and early detection of SARS-CoV may contribute to its risk management in the future. The 3 major diagnostic methods currently available are (i) viral RNA detection using real-time reverse-transcription PCR (Yam et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2004) , (ii) antibody detection Li et al., 2005) , and (iii) antigen detection (Che et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005) . The most predominant SARS-CoV-derived protein throughout the infection is the nucleocapsid protein (NP) due to the comparatively high levels of mRNA expressed upon infection (Hiscox et al., 1995) . The NP is also reported to be high in humans infected with SARS-CoV. The NP of SARS-CoV exhibits low homology with other members of the coronavirus family (Marra et al., 2003) . This unique feature makes it a suitable candidate for developing a monoclonal antibody (mAb) for ultrasensitive SARS diagnostics. It has also been demonstrated that there is a significant amount of circulating shed NP antigen in serum samples from infected patients ranging from 100 pg/mL to 3.2 ng/mL. Detection of the NP antigen by ELISA was peaked at d 6 to 10 with 71% of patients being positive for the antigen (Che et al., 2004) . It has also been reported that the NP was detectable from SARS-CoV-infected patients in other body fluids, such as nasopharyngeal aspirate, urine, and fecal samples, collected between d 2 to 33 after the onset of symptoms Lau et al., 2004) .",

During the first 10 d after disease onset, the NP was detected in 90% of the patients compared with the detection of IgG and RNA (Li et al., 2005) . The detection rate of the NP between d 11 to 15 of the disease was significantly higher than those of anti-SARS-CoV IgG and RNA. Hence, there is a need for the development of sensitive and highly specific diagnostic kits that can be used in the field. Traditionally, polyclonal antibodies (pAb) and mAb are used for various clinical diagnostic applications. Highly pathogenic strains of bacteria and viruses can be detected by exploiting the pAb technique for its higher sensitivity due to its ability to bind to multiple epitopes.",

Avian pAb raised against different targets produces chicken IgY in abundant amounts compared with the amount in mammalian and rodent species. Chicken IgY can also be obtained by noninvasive methods by the collection of antibodies in the egg yolks of hens hyperimmunized with the specific antigen. Chicken IgY is structurally similar to mammalian IgG in its affinity, but its molecular weight (~180 kDa) is comparatively higher than IgG (~150 kDa). This is due to its additional heavy-chain constant domain and carbohydrate chains. It has been demonstrated in the literature that IgY has been used in several applications, which includes quantitation of tumor biomarkers (Xiao et al., 2008) as immunotherapeutic agents against Candida albicans (Ibrahim et al., 2008) , and detection of E. coli O157 (Sunwoo et al., 2006) and Salmonella (Terzolo et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2002) .",

The IgY titer estimated by indirect ELISA indicated a primary response characterized by slight increase in its activity. Following a booster injection, a rapid secondary response was shown with high SARS-CoV NP specific IgY activity at a peak of 8 wk. As a result, a high antigen-binding specificity of anti-SARS-CoV NP IgY could be obtained from the egg yolks collected from immunized eggs during the immunization period of 6 to 10 wk. The WSF of the egg yolk was purified and analyzed for purity and specificity to the NP antigen. The crude egg yolk IgY WSF showed only 38% purity (data not shown), indicating that the rest of the fraction was contaminated with alpha and gamma livetins, lipoproteins, and fatty acid molecules. The crude IgY WSF from the immunized hens were further purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and subsequently by Sephacryl S-300 gel chromatography. The purified IgY was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, which revealed that the purity of IgY was greater than 95% (Figure 2A ). The specificity of the immune IgY was determined by Western blotting, which demonstrated that IgY strongly binds to the NP in the Western blot ( Figure 2C ).

The NP is the most predominant virus derived protein throughout the infection, because the NP mRNA levels are amplified 3 to 10 times higher at 12 h postinfection (Hiscox et al., 1995) compared with other structural genes. This feature makes it a suitable candidate for developing a diagnostic kit in suspected individuals. In many viral diseases, virus shedding is greatest during the early symptomatic phase. The detection of viral RNA could be done by real-time, reverse-transcription PCR because it is very sensitive but is expensive and can cause false positives from cross-contamination. Whereas the whole process of extraction of mRNA from different specimens can be labor intensive and relies on special technical expertise (Tan et al., 2004) , an ELISA assay is an accurate and sensitive detection system, leading to early therapeutic diagnosis.",

            "text": "In this study, we developed heterosanwich ELISA with the use of both mouse mAb and chicken IgY for the achievement of a highly sensitive detection system for SARS-CoV infection, targeting the NP antigen. The chicken was used to generate the antibody employed in this study, because it has been reported that the avian maternal antibodies are transferred from serum to egg yolk to confer passive immunity to their offspring in the form of an IgY antibody. This process of accumulating antibodies in the egg yolk by transfer of IgG from serum to egg yolk has been exploited, which resulted in increased use of chicken egg yolk for production of antibodies to various antigens, such as viral antigens (Piela et al., 1984) and bacteria . In addition, the high amount of chicken IgY generated within a short period of time is an advantage to develop significant antigen-specific IgY compared with mammalian serum antibodies (Schade et al., 1994) . It was also shown that IgY was relatively stable under different conditions, including heat, pressure, alkalinity, acidity (> pH 3.5), and in the presence of proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin and chymotrypsin (Shimizu et al., 1992) . Therefore, the ability to produce high amounts of antigen-specific IgY with reasonably high stability makes production of IgY against various viral antigens a viable option to be used in diagnostics (Erhard et al., 2000) , antibiotic-alternative therapy (Carlander et al., 2000) , and therapeutics (Schade et al., 2007) .",

In this study, we targeted the development of quantitative detection for NP antigen by heterosandwich ELISA for clinical laboratory purposes. Recent ELISA studies using pAb have reported the sensitivity of recombinant NP spiked in human sera to be 50 pg/mL (Che et al., 2004) . The use of IgY in this study together with mAb against NP antigen, gave a sensitivity of 18 pg/mL, which was 3 times more sensitive than the literature value mentioned earlier.",

In this study, we have significantly lowered the detection limit to the picogram level, which should allow detection of the NP antigen before the onset of symptoms by using a combination of IgY and mAb. The match of both of the antibodies was appropriate for the development of an effective immunological diagnostic tool, because pAb are capable of binding to many epitopes on the antigen that is beneficial for high sensitivity but has inherent specificity limitations. Hence, the availability of suitable highly specific mAb is essential.",

The effective and sensitive assay could be translated to other infectious diseases and essentially replace other detection system sources of the expensive polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies.
