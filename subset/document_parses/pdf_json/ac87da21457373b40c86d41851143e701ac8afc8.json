The patients were categorized into the \"I-ASV success\" group and \"I-ASV failure\" group (those receiving mechanical ventilation with I-ASV along with any other mode). Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with successful I-ASV management. Results: Of the 189 patients, 135 (71.4%) were categorized into the I-ASV success group. In the I-ASV success group, the reasons for ICU admission included post-elective surgery (94.1%), post-emergent surgery (81.5%), and other medical reasons (55.6%).

In addition, Lellouche et al. [5] reported the safety of I-ASV for maintaining an optimal range of respiration in post-cardiac surgery patients. A randomized controlled trial that aimed to compare the efficacy of I-ASV with conventional ventilation methods in critically ill patients [7] found I-ASV to be a safe and effective option in terms of tidal volume, respiratory rate, SpO 2 , and E T CO 2 .

Initially in the first year, we actually used I-ASV mainly for relatively low APACHE II score, such as post-operative patients. With the accumulation of the experience of using I-ASV, we gradually used I-ASV for more severe patients like ARDS patients. Considering the learning curve to learn how I-ASV work, and even if it appears simple at first sight, we think that medical stuff knowledge and experience with I-ASV are the key to success of the management with this mode. In addition, when compared to other conventional ventilation methods, I-ASV is expected to reduce the burdens on medical staff members (e.g., physicians and nurses) because of the automation. Although there is little evidence regarding the reduction in medical staff workloads, I-ASV might be a better choice for the majority of mechanically ventilated patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "I-ASV may be difficult to manage in some cases because of the strong respiratory effort required in patients with moderate to severe hypoxemia and respiratory/ metabolic acidosis. A strong respiratory effort frequently requires high minute ventilation. As I-ASV has a setting limitation of 200% of 100 mL/predictable body weight, ventilated patients who require high minute ventilation might find I-ASV to be challenging. Moreover, ventilation with I-ASV during a high inspiratory flow rate becomes difficult due to asynchrony. In such cases, it is important to switch to an appropriate ventilation mode rather than continue with I-ASV. In this study, there were a few cases in which the trigger for spontaneous inspiration was suppressed by changing to PCV. Furthermore, in such situations, the use of narcotics such as morphine, sedatives, or muscle relaxants should be considered. Our study had several limitations. First, this was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. The number of the patients were relatively small. These may limit the power of the study. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings. Second, there was a selection bias due to the specific choice of G5. In our ICU, G5 is preferred in cases of hypoxemia and severe organ dysfunction rather than in cases involving post-elective surgery, and this preference could have influenced the success rate of I-ASV. If the number of post-elective surgery patients exceeded the number of patients with hypoxemia and severe organ dysfunction, it could have increased the success rate of I-ASV. Third, we did not correct ventilatory parameters such as the tidal volume, driving pressure, and PEEP. Therefore, we are unable to conclude whether I-ASV was superior to other conventional ventilator modes in this study. We are currently conducting a prospective study (UMIN000034417) to evaluate the usefulness of I-ASV and mechanical power compared to other conventional ventilation modes. Fourth, we did not record the types of asynchronies in detail. Hence, further studies are required to evaluate the types of asynchronies that increase the difficulty of respiratory distress management with I-ASV. Fifth, we did not have objective parameters for high respiratory efforts, like esophageal pressure. Sixth, we did not collect the type of sedative drugs and doses. Because the optimal suppression of the respiratory drive with sedatives may directly relates to the success of I-ASV, and because asynchronies, which we found in this study associated with I-ASV success, can occur in either the situation of over-sedation or under-sedation. Further studies are needed to evaluate about this issue. Finally, since the proficiency of medical staff with I-ASV mode varies, our results might differ from those of other high-volume centers.
