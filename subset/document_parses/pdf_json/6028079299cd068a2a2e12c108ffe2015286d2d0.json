Owing to widespread uncertainty and disagreement about the appropriate roles for medical students during a pandemic, student participation in clinical care has varied across institutions. Some schools forbid any patient interaction, whereas others have recruited students for hospital-based roles or even graduated medical students early so that they can serve as frontline clinicians (1) (2) (3) . The American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) has instructed medical schools to suspend student clerkships and has recommended that \"unless there is a critical health care workforce need locally, we strongly suggest that medical students not be involved in any direct patient care activities\" (4, 5) . We disagree with the AAMC that medical student involvement should be reserved for critical health care personnel shortages. Rather, medical schools should offer students clinical opportunities that would benefit patient care and potentially help to prevent workforce shortages.",

However, students are also clinicians who care for patients. They interview patients, call consults, respond to pages, communicate with families, write notes, assist with procedures, and help with care coordination and discharge planning.",

During the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918, medical students at the University of Pennsylvania cared for patients in the capacity of physicians (7) . In a 1952 polio epidemic in Denmark, groups of medical students were tasked with manually ventilating patients (8) . In the current pandemic, medical schools in the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom are graduating medical students early on the condition that they serve as frontline clinicians (3, 9) . The health care system should not wait until it reaches a breaking point to invite medical students to serve. Medical students are adept at many clinical roles. Allowing them to serve may improve patient care long before the health care system reaches a personnel crisis, and in some cases may even help prevent such crises from occurring. In this article, we suggest several roles for medical students to play in offsetting the burdens caused by COVID-19.",

In the absence of medical students, these patients would need to be covered by house officers, potentially exacerbating the personnel shortage about which the AAMC is concerned.

In addition, the risks incurred from student involvement may be lower than the risks to retired clinician volunteers, who are more susceptible to complications of COVID-19 owing to their age (10) .
