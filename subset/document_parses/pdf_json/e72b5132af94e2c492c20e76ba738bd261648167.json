It is known that coronavirus reinfection is common, sometimes even within a given cold and flu season [1] [2] [3] . However, until recently, there has never been such widespread deployment of viral nucleic acid detection and sequencing, so the natural length of time for shedding a given virus's nucleic acids is not well known, nor do we know how or whether this would vary between an asymptomatic or a symptomatic case.",

It is also unknown how long an individual is infectious versus shedding viral nucleic acid fragments in the absence of infectious virus particles. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted this current lack of information in their guidance entitled, Criteria for Investigating Suspected SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection, updated in October of 2020 [4] .",

He denied a history of smoking or asthma. The participant self-quarantined at home for 14 days without exposure to a sick contact prior to arrival and had a negative RT-PCR test as well as no detectable IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 upon enrollment into the study (at day 0) on June 17, 2020. However, he did have a positive RT-PCR to SARS-CoV-2 upon routine sampling on day 7 as part of the prospective study. At this time, he reported no symptoms. RT-PCR testing at study day 14 was negative and he continued to be asymptomatic. He did not follow up as scheduled with study personnel, but on day 46, he reported to medical personnel with rhinorrhea, nausea, and diarrhea. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing as part of the study was positive at that time. His RT-PCR result remained positive on study day 49 and although his diarrhea and nausea had resolved, he had a fever and reported myalgia, fatigue, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, headache, loss of taste, and abdominal pain. IgG antibody levels in serum to SARS-CoV-2 were negative at days 7 and 14, and remained negative at days 46 and 49, indicating the absence of the development of a long-lasting humoral immune response after the first infection at day 7. IgM antibodies were negative at days 7, 14, and 46, and were detected by the first time at day 49 (titer 450) as a response to the second infection (day 46). After study day 49, the participant did not follow up for the next six weeks, and therefore, it is unknown how long he remained RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 or how long his symptoms persisted. His only other follow-up was at study day 91, by which time all symptoms had resolved and his RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, but presented high IgG (titer 12150) and IgM (titer 1350) antibody levels.

Despite multiple library preparation and sequencing attempts in both laboratories, the day 7 data contained overall many more variations, most of which were present at relatively low concordance, characteristics not uncommon to samples with low viral load. SNV profiles for this sample were compared to other samples sequenced at the same time and no conclusive provenance of sample bleed-through could be traced. Specifically, of the 53 SNVs unique to the day 7 sample as compared to days 46 and 49, thirty SNVs were present at less than 10% frequency (Table 2) . Five SNVs were unique to day 46, but all were present at less than 5% frequency and all were in ORF1ab. Four out of five of those were nonsynonymous SNVs in the portion of ORF1ab that encodes for nsp16 and in close proximity to each other; the other was a silent mutation in the portion of ORF1ab that encodes nsp2 (Table 3) . Twenty-five SNVs were unique to the day 49 sample, and all of these were present at less than consensus level frequency, with 13 of 25 present at less than 10% frequency.

            "text": "Generally speaking, high-throughput viral amplicon sequencing is much more sensitive than unbiased metagenomic sequencing, due to multiple rounds of viral genome amplification with specific primers prior to sequencing library construction and deep sequencing, and thus, amplicon sequencing is often robust enough to generate viral genome sequences directly from complex clinical samples such as serum even with relatively high Ct values, such as Ct = 29 [5] . Therefore, sequencing was attempted on all available samples from the patient, including two time points that were negative by the diagnostic RT-PCR assay that was used (days 0 and 14), three time points that were positive (days 7, 46, and 49), and one that had not been tested by RT-PCR (day 15). Not surprisingly, samples with lower Ct values (an indicator of higher viral load) performed better than the sample with the higher Ct values (day 7), although this day 7 sample was only just slightly over what is viewed as a good Ct cutoff for sequencing (a Ct value of 28 as per Jacot et al. [6] ). The day 14 sample, which was negative by diagnostic RT-PCR, yielded a partial genome sequence, which could be consistent with the process of clearance of the infection seven days post the initial RT-PCR-positive result and fragments of viral genomic material still in circulation. Given the above-mentioned sensitivity of viral amplicon sequencing, it is not impossible to detect partial viral genetic sequences from RT-PCR-negative time points. The RT-PCR assays only characterize the presence/absence of specific targets within three specific genes, and the results can, therefore, be easily affected by antigenic drift and shift as well as other means of missing targets, such as deletions or partial degradation of nucleic acids. By contrast, there are many more targets available over the entire virus genome for the many pairs of viral amplicon sequencing primers to bind. In other words, when titer is low and/or viral genetic material is incomplete, reliance on only three targets might be less sensitive to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA than detection based on, essentially, any part of the entire genome (220 and 98 amplicon targets for YouSeq and ARTICv2, respectively). In fact, successful SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing from an RT-PCR-negative time point has been previously reported in at least one case [7] .",

While this scenario is not common, several reports have shown various percentages of lack of seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy immunocompetent adults [8] [9] [10] . Younger age among adults and high Ct values, consistent with the participant's age and the high Ct values at the day 7 infection, has been associated with a higher probability of not developing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [9] . A robust humoral immune response was developed after the second infection (day 46), which was characterized by higher viral load and presence of symptoms. The second infection was detected for the first time at day 46, when the participant first reported symptoms (Figure 1) . Antibody responses take a few days to be established and detected, and IgM responses are often detected earlier than IgG responses [11, 12] . Here, the IgM response was detected for the first time at day 49 (3 days after second infection), and the IgG response was not detectable at day 49, likely because it was still too low to be detected. However, the next available time point at day 91 showed presence of IgG antibodies, indicating that the second infection had promoted production of IgG antibodies, although its levels were not detectable during the first 3 days post first RT-PCR positive time points. The dynamics of the antibody response after the second infection are in line with previous reports [11, 12] . Our results here suggest that serological responses to asymptomatic or mild infections bear further investigation in order to aid our understanding of how previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 may or may not protect against future infection.",

In this guidance, the CDC proposed using two types of criteria to investigate reinfections-1) investigative criteria aimed at identifying cases with a higher index of suspicion for reinfection and 2) viral genetic data from paired samples. In addition to proposing two types of criteria, the CDC went further to provide specific recommendations for quality of sequencing data and the degree of difference(s) detected in genetic data, based on SNVs, lineage calls, and the viral mutation rate.

Those criteria state that SNV analysis alone is not sufficient to declare reinfection rather than long-term infection and that distinct lineages of virus is better evidence. The CDC recommends paired respiratory specimens from the individual be sequenced; in this case, due to CHARM's study design, we had more than two samples to assay genetically. The CDC advises that high-fidelity sequencing platforms (Q score per read >30) be used for consensus sequence generation and that amplicon primer sequences be removed from the genome assembly, both of which were done in this study. CDC also recommends a genome coverage >100/per base position, Q score of consensus >30 with 99% of the genome covered, and 1000\u00d7 average genome coverage for analysis of minor variation. Although all the samples were relatively deeply sequenced, whereas only the day 46 sample ultimately met the criteria of genome coverage >100/per base position, both the day 7 and day 46 samples met the criteria of Q score of consensus >30 with 99% of the genome covered, and both the day 46 and day 49 samples met the criteria of 1000\u00d7 average genome coverage for analysis of minor variation. Additionally, although the day 14 sample resulted in only roughly two thirds of the virus genome being covered, we were able to use those data in a limited capacity as well. The CDC advises that if low fidelity sequencing platforms (Q score per read <30) are used, verification of SNVs via alternate sequencing method is conducted.

The higher proportion of low frequency unique mutations on day 7 supports an isolated case of early infection. Most of the SNVs in the day 46 dataset are shared with day 49. The proportion of high frequency SNVs is higher in the day 49 dataset than in the earlier time points, possibly suggesting viral adaptation over time. However, taken as a whole with both the circumstances of the individual and the genetic data encompassing SNVs and differing lineages, this case appears most consistent with reinfection. The caveat is that the day 7 sample produced data of lesser quality than would be optimal.",

            "text": "This case, for which we sequenced more than just paired samples, demonstrates the current challenges that are inherent to the investigation and adds to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections. The relative risk of reinfection has been estimated from prospective RT-PCR and serological studies to be about one-fifth of those never infected [16, 17] . This case demonstrates the possibility of reinfection even within a short timeframe while exposed to a high-risk congregant setting, such as basic training, associated with an absence of detectable serological response from the first infection. This case highlights that although an individual experienced natural infection, protective immunity cannot be assumed, and we demonstrate here that symptomatic reinfection within five weeks is possible. Continued public health education and vigilance is required as the medical and scientific communities collect data that will help provide a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity.",

The study protocol was approved by the Naval Medical Research Center Institutional Review Board in compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing protection of human subjects. All participants provided written informed consent for participation. On day 0, mid-turbinate nares swabs collected in virus transport media (VTM) were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-RT-PCR), with additional swabs assessed at study days 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56 for all participants using the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA).

Briefly, Illumina reads were quality trimmed and filtered to Q30 and minimum length of 50 bp using bbduk. Paired reads were merged using bbmerge with default settings [22] . Trimmed, filtered, and merged reads were aligned to the Wuhan reference genome (NCBI GenBank accession NC_045512.2/MN908947.3) using bbmap, v38.79, with local alignment and maximum insertion/deletion of 500 bp [23] . Primers were trimmed from sequences using align_trim from ARTIC workflow/pipeline, v 1.0.0 [24] . Once a high quality consensus genome was obtained, Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) were determined using SAMtools mpileup [25] and iVar (intrahost variant analysis of replicates) [26] , using a minimum frequency of 0.3 and a minimum read depth of 10. In addition, low frequency SNVs were identified using a minimum frequency of 0.02, minimum alternate allele read depth of 15, and Phred score \u2265 Q30 and visualized using the ggplot2 package in R (v3.6.3).

At that genome position, which in part differentiates B.1.340 from B.1.1, the day 14 genome was only covered at 4\u00d7 depth (too low for consensus genome calling by iVar). Extraction of the consensus sequence without any coverage threshold revealed AAC in those positions, which is consistent with B.1.1, similar to the day 46 and day 49 samples. SNVs characteristic to B.1.340 and not B.1.1 were present in the day 7 genome, including C1059T (ORF1ab: T265I), A4197G (ORF1ab: E1311G), G25563T (ORF3a: Q57H), and A28715T (N:T148S). The day 14 consensus genome did not have G25563T (ORF3a: Q57H) and the other positions did not have adequate coverage for consensus calling by iVar, but extraction of the of the consensus sequence without any coverage threshold revealed the reference alleles at those positions, consistent with B.1.1.
