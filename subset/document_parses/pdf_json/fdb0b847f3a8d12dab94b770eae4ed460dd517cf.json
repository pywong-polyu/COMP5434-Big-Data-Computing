            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 continuously proceeds despite the application 19 of a variety of vaccines. It is still urgent to find effective ways to treat Recent studies indicate that NRP1, an important receptor of the natural peptide tuftsin, 21 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, tuftsin is a natural human molecule 22 released from IgG. Here, we found 91 overlapping genes between tuftsin targets and 23 COVID-19-associated genes. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that tuftsin could also 24 target ACE2 and exert some immune-related functions to treat COVID-19. Using 25 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, we confirmed that tuftsin can bind ACE2 26 and NRP1 directly. Moreover, tuftsin effectively impairs the binding of SARS-CoV-2 27 S1 to ACE2. Thus, tuftsin is an attractive drug against COVID-19. And tuftsin as 28 natural immunostimulating peptide in human, we speculate that tuftsin may has crucial 29 roles in asymptomatic carriers or mild cases of COVID-19. 30 31 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 33 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in high morbidity and mortality 1,2 . It is known 34 that the spike (S) protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the 35 core mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infecting host cells. Through persistent efforts, 36 COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for human use in most countries. However, 37 the quantity of neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccines still needs to be verified in 38 humans. At present, another hopeful intervention is neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 39 (mAbs) 3 . Unfortunately, producing safe and effective mAbs is complicated, and the 40 duration of effective protection remains to be determined 4,5 . Moreover, continuous 41 mutations of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic may lead to escape from antibody 42 recognition and reduce the neutralizing activity of mAbs 6 . Hence, discovering a broad-43 2 spectrum and effective method for treating COVIV-19 is urgent. 44 45",

Tuftsin, a natural phagocytosis-stimulating peptide, was found by Victor 49 Najjar et al. in 1970 11 . Tuftsin is released from the Fc fragment of IgG by an 50 endocarboxy-peptidase in the spleen and a leukokininase on the outer membrane of 51 neutrophilic leukocytes 11, 12 . Furthermore, tuftsin is a tetrapeptide that consists of Thr-52 Lys-Pro-Arg, located at amino acid residues 289 to 292 of the heavy chain of IgG. 53 Tuftsin has a broad spectrum of activities mainly associated with immune system 54 functions and exerts effects on phagocytic cells, especially macrophages. These 55 functions of Tuftsin briefly include cell phagocytosis, motility, immunogenic response, 56 and bactericidal and tumoricidal activities 13, 14 . It was reported that tuftsin activity is 57 inversely correlated with splenectomy function and is significantly lower in patients 58 with AIDS, cirrhosis, intestinal failure and some infectious diseases 12,15,16 . Moreover, 59 it was demonstrated that tuftsin has stability and low toxicity in vitro and in vivo 14,17,18 . ",

Thus, 154 molecular docking was performed to determine the potential binding sites and binding 155 affinity between tuftsin and the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and NRP1. First, we 156 defined the interaction interface of SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD with ACE2 as the active sites 157 of ACE2. These interface sites in ACE2 include Q24, M82, N330, and R393, which are 158 mainly located in the N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 20 . Then, the docking 159 region was a sphere containing the defined ACE2 active sites (Fig. S1A) . The results 160 showed that the affinity of tuftsin and ACE2 was -6.9 kcal/mol, demonstrating that they 161 could combine spontaneously ( Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, tuftsin could form strong 162 hydrogen bonds to Ser47 and Asp67, carbon hydrogen bonds to His345, Asp67 and 163 Asn51, and salt bridges to Asp67 of ACE2 ( Fig. 2A) . It is worth mentioning that the 164 binding sites were adjacent to the interactional sites of S1-RBD and ACE2, indicating 165 that tuftsin could inhibit S1 binding to ACE2 by covering their binding sites. 166 Meanwhile, the b1b2 domain of NRP1 was prepared, as previous studies showed that 167 the extracellular b1b2 domain of NRP1 mediates binding to CendR peptides 21 . Then, 168 the active sites of NRP1 b1b2 were defined according to the interactional sites of S1-169 RBD and NRP1 b1b2, including D320, E348, Y353 and so on 7 . The docking region 170 was a sphere containing the defined NRP1 b1b2 active sites (Fig. S1B) . The docking 171 results showed that tuftsin and NRP1 b1b2 have a high binding affinity of -8.1 kcal/mol. 172 to Pro398, which are near the interactional sites of S1-RBD and NRP1 b1b2. Moreover, 175 the binding region of tuftsin and NRP1 overlapped with the binding area of NRP1 and 176 S1-RBD in space (Fig. 2B) . Collectively, these results demonstrated that tuftsin could 177 bind ACE2 and NRP1 and inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 S1 binding of ACE2 and NRP1 by 178 covering their interactional sites. Tuftsin impairs the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 to ACE2 198 An SPR-based competition assay was employed to determine whether tuftsin could 199 affect the binding of S1 protein with ACE2. We first determined the binding affinity of 200 the S1 protein with ACE2 by SPR assay, which unsurprisingly showed a high affinity.",

Then, a series of gradient concentrations of tuftsin 203 solutions containing equal concentrations of ACE2 were injected over the immobilized 204 SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein for comparison. We observed that 9 \u03bcmol/L tuftsin had a mild 205 inhibitory effect. It is worth noting that the addition of 156 \u03bcmol/L tuftsin significantly 206 attenuated the response signal by approximately two-thirds compared to that of ACE2 207 alone over the immobilized S1. Notably, a substantial decrease in the response signal 208 was observed with increasing concentrations of tuftsin. The response single was close 209 to zero when the added concentration of tuftsin was 625 \u03bcmol/L. This result indicates 210 that the interaction between S1 and ACE2 was almost completely blocked in the 211 presence of 625 \u03bcmol/L tuftsin (Fig. 4) . The experiment was repeated three times 6 independently. In conclusion, the competition binding experiment revealed that tuftsin 213 effectively impairs the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 to ACE2 in a dose-dependent 214 manner.",

The results showed that tuftsin can 187 bind ACE2 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 460 \u03bcmol/L, according 188 to the obtained association and dissociation rates (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the KD fitting 189 curves of tuftsin and ACE2 became gentle with higher concentrations of tuftsin, 190 indicating that the interaction of tuftsin and ACE2 is specific. (Fig. 3A).
