Currently, the corona COVID-19 is affecting 216 countries and territories around the world, and the numbers of new cases and deaths are increasing rapidly. On July 14, 2020, more than 13 340 000 confirmed cases and more than 578 000 deaths have been reported worldwide. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 infections exceeded 273 800 and 2280, respectively [2] . This rapid increase of the infection rate has overwhelmed and negatively affected all healthcare systems. Additionally, most countries have taken several preventive and lockdown measures to combat the ability of coronavirus to spread [2, 3] . The important measures taken by the kingdom were suspension of the seasonal minor Umrah pilgrimage for national and international worshippers, and closure of mosques all over the country. Additionally, a partial curfew on March 23, and then a full curfew on 6 April 2020 to 21 June 2020 have been established between cities.",

Regarding the endourology surgical practice, several researchers have proposed different clinical algorithms, recommendations, and triages to categorize urinary stones treatment according to priority and urgency to interfere [6e9]. The European Association of Urology Section of Urolithiasis (EULIS) collaborative research working group conducted a survey including 60 participants from 20 different countries whose main area of expertise was stone urinary disease. Almost half of the respondents changed their elective surgical treatment approach by 90%e100% after COVID-19; more than 85% of them reported a decrease of more than 50% in the workload of outpatient clinic; and 90% tended to change their treatment strategy for positive COVID-19 patients by drainage of the collecting system followed by an elective intervention later on [7] .",

Cystoscopy records included several procedures such as injection therapies, JJ-stent insertion, removal or exchange, diagnostic cystoscopy, visual internal urethrotomy (VIU), and retrograde pyelography.

            "text": "Recently, several researchers published recommendations to help prioritize urological procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic [5e9, 15, 16] . A recent systematic review of 14 urology guidelines and recommendations for standard of patients' care during the COVID-19 pandemic has been published and differences among the guidelines were minimal. According to nine guidelines that addressed endourology surgical practice, obstructed infected kidneys should be immediately decompressed, whereas non- obstructing urinary stones and stent removal should be rescheduled [16] . [5] . Others framed their recommendations for urological surgery triage based on the rationale of proceed or delay surgery [9] . In addition, several triage systems have been introduced based on recommended surgical priority tiers [6, 8] . Metzler et al. [6] categorized the urgency for prioritization of urinary stone procedures into five groups from 0 to 4. Cases with life-or organ-threatening conditions such as obstructing ureteral stone in a solitary kidney, with infection, intractable symptoms, or bilateral obstructing ureteral stones, were defined as group 0-emergent, and must be immediately resolved in <24 h, either with drainage or treatment. In the contrary, cases with non-obstructing asymptomatic renal stones and majority of stones requiring PNL, were defined as group 4-postpone and should receive no treatment [6] . Of note, the delay in management of obstructed infected kidney can lead to severe septic complications and increase the workload on emergency services. Up to 15% of these patients need (intensive care unit) ICU admission, and the mortality rate may reach up to 10% [17] . Notably, the number of elective endourology surgical procedures decreased by 84.1%d120 procedures during the full curfew period compared to that in April 2019. Among them, the majority (85%) were day surgery or outpatient procedures such as URS, RIRS, and cystoscopy. Only three (2.5%) PCNL procedures were performed, as we preferred to choose less invasive procedures in the management of renal stones (e.g. RIRS or JJ-stenting), to make the hospital stay short and reduce the patients' risk of contracting COVID-19 during their hospital stay. Metzler et al. [6] introduced a new stone care triage during COVID-19 at the University of Washington. They recommended that most renal stones requiring PNL to be postponed and PCNL may be indicated if there are recurrent infections, indwelling nephrostomy tube with tube-related complications, or chronic renal deterioration. Interestingly, we performed one SWL and 51 URS/RIRS procedures during the curfew time, with a reduction of 98.5% and 78% compared to those in April 2019, respectively. In the time of COVID-19 and if we decide to treat an elective case, we preferred to choose the treatment with a high stone-free rate and less retreatment rate, for example, if a patient had a small renal stone that could be treated by either SWL or RIRS. Although SWL seems an ideal option for patients and may use less PPE for a single procedure compared to RIRS, and RIRS procedure was preferred in our hospitals, due to its higher stone-free rate compared to SWL, and thus lower the need for auxiliary treatments and hospital readmissions during COVID-19 pandemic [18] .",

As most urologists, we believe that the elective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and urethral stricture diseases have low priority during COVID-19 pandemic and not considered an emergency unless the patient has develop acute urinary retention with inability to pass a urethral catheterize. Recently, Stensland et al. [9] recommended that all prostatic procedures be delayed, and urinary obstruction can be treated via a urethral or suprapubic catheter using local anesthesia. Similarly, Goldman and Haber [8] from Cleveland clinic classified the management of urinary outlet obstruction into tiers (0e4) according to surgical priority. If a patient has a urinary retention and unable to pass catheter, it is considered tier 0 (i.e. emergency intervention is needed). While if a patient has BPH on self-catheter or self-voiding, it is considered tier 4 (i.e. intervention is not essential) [8] .",

This might be explained by the decrease in number of referred patients from other cities due to the full curfew between cities, as well as, our careful selection of the emergency cases based on high priority to intervene. During the curfew period, more than half of the emergency procedures were related to urolithiasis treatment. Generally, our decision to schedule patients for stone surgical intervention was based on several parameters, including stone size and site, renal function parameters, severity of symptoms, duration of obstruction, collecting system drainage (i.e. presence of JJ-stent or stent or NPT), and other related factors (e.g. solitary kidney). The common indications of interventions were ureteral obstruction associated with infection and/or elevated renal function, and calcular anuria. We preferred to choose the least invasive intervention for the treatment of these urgent cases by offering active stones treatment in only 12.5%, and the remaining of cases (87.5%) were treated temporarily by drainage of the collecting system using JJ-stent or NPT insertion. A recent survey discussed the practice patterns of expert endourologists for the treatment of urolithiasis following the COVID-19 pandemic, and 90% of them tended to change their treatment strategy for positive COVID-19 patients by drainage of the collecting system followed by an elective intervention [7] .",
