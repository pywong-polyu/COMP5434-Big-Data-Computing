DC-SIGN (dendritic cell [DC]-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 [ICAM3]-grabbing nonintegrin, encoded by CD209) is an important C-type lectin expressed on DCs that can bind pseudovirus transfected by the SARS spike gene [8, 9] . L-SIGN (liver/lymph node-specific ICAM3 grabbing nonintegrin, encoded by CLEC4M) is a homologue of DC-SIGN and is also a binding receptor for SARS-CoV infection [10] . Interestingly, DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, and FCER2 ICAM3 genes are all mapped on 19p13.3, within 71 kb of each other, and belong to the C-type lectin family [11] , whereas ICAM3 is the natural ligand for both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN [12, 13] . ICAM3, being expressed constitutively on T cells and other leukocytes, is a potent signalling molecule and a major ligand in the initiation of T cell-mediated immune responses [14, 15] . In addition to the recognition of peptide/MHCs on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as DC [16] , by the T cell receptors on the T cell surface, the interaction of adhesion molecules between the APCs and T cells are also critical for activating antigen-specific T cells [17] . The binding between ICAM3 and its ligands DC-SIGN or leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 [18] provides transient engagement of naive T cells with DCs, which then allows the T cells to sample large numbers of MHC molecules for the presence of specific peptides [19] . This initial cell-to-cell engagement step is critical for induction of T cell responses, which in turn play a central role in the immunoregulation of infectious diseases. It is noteworthy that circulating forms of ICAM3 have been used as a parameter to monitor disease progression, particularly in HIV-infected patients [20] .

Subsequently, we further recruited 508 patients with SARS from SARS follow-up outpatient clinics in the 3 previously mentioned hospitals and 3 others, namely, Queen Mary Hospital, Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, and Prince of Wales Hospital. All 817 patients with SARS were confirmed by serologic analysis and/or reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Their clinical data were retrospectively obtained from Hospital Authority, Hong Kong, with permission from all attending clinicians of the respective hospitals. These included age; sex; length of hospital stay; treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) and duration of ICU treatment; whether patients required assisted ventilation, steroid treatment, pulse steroids, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG); and final outcome in terms of survival and death. Because most of the patients were recruited from the SARS follow-up clinics after discharge, the proportion of deaths was small and could not be used as a measure of outcome. Results of hematological and biochemical laboratory investigations on admission were also retrieved. These included hemoglobin level, absolute lymphocyte count, platelet count, WBC count, and biochemical indices of alanine aminotranseferase, albumin, globulin, creatinine kinase, LDH, urea, sodium, potassium, and serum creatinine. Controls. Three control groups were recruited for this study. For our initial analysis, we recruited unaffected health care workers (HCWs) who had worked in SARS wards, who had worked in SARS ICU or cohort wards for patients with suspected SARS, and/or who had performed high-risk procedures. All 307 who had volunteered for the study remained disease free and were confirmed to be seronegative for SARS at the end of the outbreak. A simple self-administered questionnaire documented the type of wards they had worked in, the duration of work, and whether they had performed highrisk procedures such as ambu-bagging, nasopharyngeal suction, tracheal intubation, endotracheal suction, disposal of excreta, chest physiotherapy, and feeding of highly dependent patients. Subsequently, 2 further groups of controls were also recruited: outpatient control (OPC) subjects consisting of 290 individuals randomly recruited from the general outpatient clinics at least 2 months after the SARS outbreak with no clinical history or signs or symptoms of inflammation or infection and household contact control (HHC) subjects consisting of 309 household members of patients with SARS who remained unaffected and confirmed to be seronegative at the end of the outbreak. All HHC subjects recruited were asked to state their relationship with the patient(s) with SARS as well as with other family members in the household.

Although the protein structure of ICAM3 is not yet disclosed, it is postulated to be similar to that of ICAM1 [26] , whose structure has been demonstrated [27] . The ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP is located at the junction of domain 1 and 2 and the interchange of an acidic aspartic acid to a small neutral glycine at this junction is likely to affect the structuring of ICAM3 and subsequent dimer formation. Because DC-SIGN/ICAM3 receptor-ligand pair is crucial for antigen-presenting cells-for example, for DCs to form immunological synapse with naive T cells-the association of the ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP with LDH levels and WBC counts found in our study suggest that the SNP may affect the interaction of T cells with DCs, thereby modulating T cell response in the immunopathogenesis of SARS. We therefore postulate that this conformational change may affect the binding capacity of the receptor, thus affecting lymphocyte activation and the initiation of immune response. Further experiments are required to examine this possibility. The results of this study suggest that, although FCER2 and ICAM3 SNPs are not associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection, the ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP is associated with LDH levels and lower WBC counts in patients with SARS on admission. These findings are in keeping with the role of ICAM3 in T cell activation and the immune response. Association with susceptibility to SARS infection, on the other hand, would more likely to be found with binding receptors of the virus, such as L-SIGN, as reported by our group [21] . The absence of significant association of ICAM3 Asp143Gly with other clinical parameters is likely related to the fact that the patients with SARS recruited for our study came from 6 different hospitals throughout Hong Kong.

An increase in LDH levels in the acute phase of SARS infection has been postulated to be possibly related to immune hyperactivity [30] . High peak LDH levels have been reported to be an independent predictor of adverse outcome [31] [32] [33] [34] . Thus patients with SARS who are homozygous for CC genotype of the ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP are associated with a 4-fold chance of higher LDH levels on admission and poorer prognosis. Although the SARS outbreak appears to have been contained, the molecular determinants and pathogenesis of SARS remain unclear. Functional studies to investigate the role of ICAM3 Asp143Gly polymorphism in influencing the initiation of immune response to SARS-CoV infection will contribute toward a better understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 454, "end": 458, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 459, "end": 462, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 595, "end": 599,
