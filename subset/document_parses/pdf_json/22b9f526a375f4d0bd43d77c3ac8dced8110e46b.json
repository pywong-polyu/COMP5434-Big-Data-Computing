The immune response via cellular immunity creates superior resistance to viral mutations, which are currently the greatest threat to the global vaccination campaign. Furthermore, we also propose a safer, more facile and physiologically appropriate immunization method using either intra-nasal or oral administration. The underlying technology is an adaptation of synthetic long peptides (SLPs) previously used in cancer immunotherapy. SLPs comprising HLA class I and class II epitopes are used to stimulate antigen cross-presentation and canonical class II presentation by dendritic cells. The result is a cytotoxic T cell-mediated prompt and specific immune response against the virus-infected epithelia and a rapid and robust virus clearance. Peptides isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients were screened for the best HLA population coverage and were tested for toxicity and allergenicity. 3D peptide folding followed by molecular docking studies provided positive results, suggesting a favourable antigen presentation.",

Ng et al. isolated in 2016 memory T cells 11 years after the infection [5] , while le Bert et al. in 2020 discovered a more than 17 years viral-specific cellular immune response. [1] Analysis of the cellular and immune response from COVID-19 convalescent patients revealed that those with mild COVID-19 presented a vigorous T-cell mediated response months after SARS-CoV2 infection and a low to undetectable titre of antibodies. [6] In contrast, severe COVID-19 presented an early phase lymphocytopenia followed by intense cytokine release and high antibody titres, due to poor viral clearance. [7] In the study performed by Sekine et al, 28% of healthy individuals presented cross-reactive memory T-cells against SARS-CoV2. [6] These findings confirm the bipolar role of T cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis -a higher number of lymphocytes during the early phase of infection assures a rapid and efficient antiviral response, whereas an early lymphocytopenia, followed by a subsequent immune hyperactivation leads to a poorer prognosis.",

By targeting the pathogen right at the entry site, the viral replication decreases substantially and the risk of evolution to more severe disease forms is mitigated. [8, 9] In present, vaccination platforms range from live attenuated formulas to the newly introduced mRNA and viral vector-based platforms. Peptide-based vaccination provide a promising alternative due to its high specificity, biological activity and tissue penetration as well as low production costs.

A proportion of peptides will be processed in the endosomal pathway and expressed with the HLA class II molecule, while others enter the vacuolar pathway to be cross-presented with the HLA class I molecule.

As a result, the immunogenic peptide repertoire is increased, providing a more specific immune response. [12] By expanding the peptide repertoire, SLPs can also function as immune response enhancers. Coppola et al. showed that administration of synthetic long peptides derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis Latency Antigen Rv1733c, a protein expressed in dormant bacteria, led to an improved bacterial clearance in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice. [13] Due to their high data processing and analysis capacities, in silico methods can be a useful tool for characterizing diverse immunological events and speeding up the process of vaccine design. Immunoinformatic and computational biology approaches were already used for designing vaccines against infectious agents such as Helicobacter pylori [14] , Vibrio cholerae [15] , Plasmodium species [16] or yellow fever virus.

[12] Allergenicity screening Allergenicity testing was performed using AllerCatPro, a webserver which compares the query structure with FASTA sequences and 3D structures from an extensive database of allergens. In this manner, both linear and discontinuous allergenic epitopes are detected. [23] Toxicity screening Toxicity was assessed using ToxinPred webserver (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/), a support vector machine algorithm that separates non-toxic peptides from the toxic peptides based on a training dataset from SwissProt, TrEMBL and other protein databases. [10] Three-dimensional structure prediction Rosetta ab initio was used to predict the three-dimensional conformations for each synthetic long peptide. For a query peptide/ protein, Rosetta ab initio approximates its secondary and tertiary structure by using libraries of 3-mer and 9-mer secondary structures. Generation of 3mer and 9-mer libraries is performed using Robetta by searching the most probable 3-mer and 9-mer conformations in already solved structures.",

[25, 26] The antiviral innate immune receptors TLR2 and TLR4 (Toll-like receptor) were used for this assay. By binding to Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, the subsequent cytokine release can trigger the internalization of the SLPs. Toll-like receptor three dimensional structures were downloaded from the PDB database with the PDB ids 6NIG [27] and 3FXI [28] respectively. The initial step for HADDOCK 2.4 molecular docking is it0 in which both the ligand and the receptor are treated as rigid objects in the tridimensional space. The algorithm searches for the most geometrically favourable surface for the ligand to bind to the receptor. The second step (it1) is a flexible docking in which the torsion angles from the active residues of both the ligand and the receptor are modified to produce strong physical intermolecular bonds (hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions etc.). The last step (itw) exploits the capacity of the ligand to displace the water molecules surrounding the active site once bound to the receptor. This refining process adjusts the torsion angles so that the SASA (solvent accessible surface area) is minimized. Further structure refinement was performed using HADDOCK 2.4 to reduce the RMSD, restraints violation energy and HADDOCK score minimization. Gibbs free energies and dissociation constants were calculated using PRODIGY web server. [29, 30] Results:",

ANN-based algorithms such as AlphaFold can replace wet lab protein structure solving in the future. Toll-like receptors are pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in innate immune system antigen recognition. TLRs are horse-shoe-shaped transmembrane proteins which may be localized on the plasmalemma (recognizing extracellular pathogens) or inside the cytoplasm, attached to vesicles (recognizing intracellular microorganisms). TLR dimerization assures a higher recognition repertoire comprising fungal, bacterial or viral proteins. Recent studies demonstrated the involvement of TLR1, 2 and 6 in COVID-19-related cytokine storm by targeting the envelope protein. [31] Additionally, TLR4 was shown to be involved in an antibacterial-like early immune response by interacting with the SARS-CoV2 spike protein. [33] High-affinity interaction between TLR2/ 4 and the predicted synthetic long peptide pool suggests high immunogenicity and increased cytokine release, leading to subsequent internalization and antigen processing inside the dendritic cells. High similarities between the Gibbs free energies and dissociation constants result in an even distribution of the SLPs at the injection site and an equal binding probability to TLRs.
