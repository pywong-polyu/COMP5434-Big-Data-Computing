            "text": "Aeromedical evacuation (AE) has a long and storied history that dates to the early part of the 20th century. 1 The Air Force's AE system has been fundamental in transporting war-injured patients since World War II. 2 The AE system provides en route care and transportation to patients while flying to and from medical facilities. Currently, the AE system is composed of 4 active duty AE squadrons, 9 Air National Guard squadrons, and 18 Air Force Reserve AE squadrons. 3 The AE system has revolutionized battlefield medicine; AE continues to advance, evolve, and adapt to meet emerging transport needs in new conflicts, medicine, and flight. 2 Recently, AE made headlines and history by conducting the first operational mission using the Transport Isolation System (TIS) to transport patients positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 4 The TIS is an infectious disease containment unit that can be used to provide medical care to patients while in-flight. 5 The TIS was originally developed in support of the Ebola outbreak in Africa; during the outbreak, the Department of Defense ordered 25 of the isolation units for the military. 6 It passed it is safe to fly testing in December 2014. 5 The unit is designed to minimize and protect the aircrew, medical attendants, and the aircraft from exposure to infectious and/or contagious diseases. 5 Initial training on the TIS takes 4 days and includes training on TIS familiarization, personal protective equipment, infection control procedures, donning and doffing protocols, practicing patient loading and unloading procedures, and patient transport and care. 5, 7 The training can also include simulated patients, simulated patient care, and simulated in-flight transport. 7 The basic version of the TIS system has 2 isolation modules (each one weighing 1,455 lb) and 1 antechamber module (weighing 1,285 lb), all of which are under negative pressure ( Figure 1) . 5, 8 The modules are placed on aircraft pallets and can be used on C-17, C-130H, and C-130J aircraft ( Figure 2) . 5, 8 These pallets have been retrofitted with watertight enclosures and high-efficiency particulate air filtration systems, all intake and outtake air is high-efficiency particulate air filtered, which is designed to contain infectious pathogens. 5, 8 The antechamber provides a safe space for the AE crew to don and doff personal protective equipment before and after patient care. 5 Each TIS system can accommodate 4 ambulatory or 2 litter patients; C-17s have the capability to transport 2 TIS systems at a time. 5 The full medical support team for a TIS includes an AE crew (usually 2 nurses and 3 AE technicians), a critical care air transport team, infectious disease physicians and technicians, and TIS operators. 9 On April 8, 2020, a warning order was issued by the US Transportation Command that a TIS-trained AE crew would be needed for a mission within 24 hours. 9 On April 10, 2020, the Air Mobility Command's newly released COVID-19 patient movement plan was followed, and the first operational flight was performed using the TIS. 9 The mission took place on a C-17 and safely transported 3 US government contractors who had tested positive for COVID-19 from Afghanistan to Ramstein Air Base, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. 9 On July 17, 2020, the TIS was used to fly a COVID-19 patient from the Indo-Pacific region to Travis Air Force Base, Fairfield, CA. 10 This was the first TIS mission in support of the US Indo-Pacific Command area. 10 However, this marked the 18th employment of the TIS for COVID-19 patients since its first operational use on April 10, 2020. 10 These historic flights highlight part of the US military's rapid response to meet the challenges of COVID-19. Having the AE capability of safely flying and caring for patients with infectious and contagious diseases is a significant accomplishment. The TIS has proven to be successful operationally and will be ready to meet the challenges presented by any future high-consequence infectious diseases. ",
