It was considered that if the correlations between the scales were observed below 0.30, it would indicate some divergence or independence, and the values between 0.30 and 0.60 would be an indicator of nomological validity (Hambleton, 2006) . The possibility of convergence, correlations higher than 0.60, was excluded because this is only possible when comparing scores of scales measuring the same construct (Borsboom et al., 2004) .

Moreover, the convergence of the 8-item Spanish version of Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale with another scale adapted for negative attitude to COVID-19 vaccination remains to be studied. In the same way, it should be considered that emerging university adults represented the sample. This particularity is not a problem because psychometric evaluation studies do not require a representative sample (Keszei et al., 2010; Terwee et al., 2007) . These considerations should not discourage using a scale since the instrument's validity depends more on the measurement's needs or objectives (Borsboom et al., 2004) .
