            "text": "behaviors during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were evaluated. Sixty nursing staff from three medical/ surgical wards in a large military hospital were recruited for a survey and microbiological sampling of high-touch surfaces (stethoscope, personal electronic device, common access card, and hospital ID badge) and portable medical equipment (wheelchairs and mobile commodes). Surveys included hand hygiene estimates, frequency/method of cleaning items of interest, perception of UV-C, and factors influencing the use of enhanced disinfection tools. Surveys and microbiological samples were performed prior to and after the installation of a rapid, automated ultraviolet disinfection enclosure for staff use. Both time points preceded the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States. A final survey/ sampling time point was carried out eight months after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants' hand hygiene frequency did not increase throughout the study, with > 80% reporting a minimum of 4 hand hygiene events per patient hour. The cleaning frequency of high-touch surfaces (non-clinical) but not portable medical equipment increased after installation of a UV-C disinfection tool and was sustained eight months into the COVID-19 pandemic. While a modest decrease in bacterial burden was observed after UV-C intervention, a more significant reduction was observed across all surfaces during pandemic time sampling, though no detectable decrease in pathogenic contamination was observed at either time point. Motivators of UV-C use included fear of SARS-CoV-2 contamination and transmission, ease of device use, and access to rapid, automated disinfection tools while deterrents reported included technical concerns, lack of time, and preference for other disinfection methods. Automated, rapid-cycle UV-C disinfection can be efficacious for high-touch surfaces not currently governed by infection prevention and control guidelines. The introduction of enhanced disinfection tools like UV-C can enhance the overall cleaning frequency and is correlated with mild decreases in bacterial burden of high-touch surfaces, this is enhanced during periods of heightened infection threat. Evidence from this study offers insights into the factors which prompt healthcare workers to internalize/dismiss enhanced infection prevention procedures.",

Reduction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by employment of social distancing, universal masking, and in-home sheltering have been the preeminent strategy for disease mitigation. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 includes contamination of eyes, mouth, and nose by hands exposed to viruscolonized fomites. Importantly, the virus has been shown to remain active on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days at 30 \u00b0C, necessitating enhanced cleaning procedures, particularly on high touch surfaces 1 . Coronaviruses contain lipid envelopes which can be broken down by most disinfectants. Specifically, 78-95% alcohol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.21% sodium hypochlorite can inactivate the virus within 1 min 2 . While ultraviolet germicidal disinfection (UV-C) has demonstrated efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, efficacy is dependent on a variety of factors including surface type, virus titre, virus medium, and inoculum size 3 .",

In this study, we evaluated environmental hygiene behaviors including disinfection frequency and hand hygiene by comparing self-reported responses before, at the onset of, and eight months into the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. As a secondary measure of environmental hygiene, we sampled the bacterial bioburden on four high-touch, non-medical surfaces that are frequently handled by nursing staff at the same time points, using detection of three common hospital pathogens as indicators of other communicable disease.",

Further, the cleaning frequency of the high-touch surfaces of interest and the preferred cleaning methods for these items were solicited uniformly throughout all three timepoints. Answers for cleaning frequency were arranged in multiple choice on a scale ranging from rarely/never, monthly, weekly, daily, or more than once daily. Preferred cleaning method was also arranged in multiple choice, using the common hospital cleaning reagents such as Cavicide (quaternary ammonium), dry wipes, alcohol-based wipe, UV-C, or others with a write in-option. This format was used to determine UV-C frequency throughout the study period, however, direct evaluation of the user's experience with the CleanSlate UV was included in the post-intervention survey. Moreover, a multiple choice question was added to determine the motivators/deterrents of UV-C device use at the post-SARS-CoV-2 timepoint.

However, the patient load of staff did increase for 36% of respondents while staying the same for the majority (55%). The greatest drivers of UV-C disinfection of high touch surfaces during the post-pandemic sampling period (8 months after nationwide lockdown measures were instated) revealed that risk of infection transmission and ease of use of the device were the two greatest factors (91% of respondents for each). Availability of the technology and increased vigilance of environmental hygiene were the next most prevalent influences, according to 77 and 64% of respondents, respectively. The greatest deterrent to the use of the UV-C device was technical issues related to device operation www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (36%). This was largely driven by a hardware issue that caused frequent arching electricity and bulb burnout on Unit 3 specifically. Despite this issue, which was eventually corrected, bulb replacement was continuously performed to minimize machine downtime. Aside from that technical issue, the largest deterrent of machine use was lack of time (32%) and preference for other cleaning agents (27%). These changes are outlined in Table 2 .",

Additionally, we sought to better understand the drivers and deterrents of infection prevention behaviors of nursing staff. We describe that in a population with generally high performance of hand hygiene, further infection prevention initiatives such as ultraviolet tools and educational campaigns have minimal impact. While hand hygiene reports in healthcare settings have generally increased after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 8 , that was not the case in our population. This may be due to the different methods of hand hygiene quantification (the Roshan study observed hand hygiene compliance as defined by observation of hand hygiene performed divided by hand hygiene opportunity presented (i.e. before and after entering a patient's room) between our studies. The Roshan study also reported hospitalwide rates of compliance compared to our paired-sampling approach which took place strictly in a mild-acuity medical/surgical section. Though a smaller sample was achieved, this method allowed us to more precisely characterize changes in staff behavior with control of interpersonal variability. This longitudinal study revealed that environmental cleaning practices were improved after the addition of an ultraviolet disinfection tool but only for items lacking existing disinfection guidelines. Despite this, no further increases in cleaning practices (for the items of interest in this study) were detected eight months after the initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, though the initial increase was maintained. One study of cleaning practices among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic reported high rates of environmental cleaning (~ 90%) 9 . It should be noted that environmental cleaning in that study was monitored by an infection prevention and control team (introducing observation bias) and focused entirely on terminal disinfection tasks which are heavily protocolized in contrast to the more voluntary cleaning/disinfection practices in our study. Another consideration for our results may be the phasing out of the educational component of the intervention after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent national lockdown in the United States.",

This included the bacterial burden on nursing staff 's hands, stethoscopes, IDs, and access cards (though not PEDs). This suggests that even after accounting for the microbiological impact of ultraviolet disinfection, the COVID-19 pandemic brought about behavioral changes which contributed to a cleaner environment. These may include factors including but not limited to decreased transport of inpatients, decreased presence of visitors and nonessential staff, enhanced disinfection of clinical surfaces due to SARS-CoV-2 guidelines, and limited cross-contact between staff due to social distancing and mask wearing.",

It is unclear at this point whether the lack of intervention/coronavirus impact on common hospital pathogens in our study was truly due to low prevalence in our population or a methodological limitation such as too small of a sample.",

This is in agreement with previous surveys of staff attitudes and beliefs toward ultraviolet disinfection in clinical settings 11, 12 . To date, however, little has been published regarding the motivators and deterrents of end-users toward ultraviolet disinfection tools. We investigated these along with the scope of our initial interest in ultraviolet disinfection technology however, in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, UV disinfection may serve as a proxy for several enhanced disinfection protocols/ tools and the psycho-socialbiological factors that guide internalization of infection prevention practices. Here we learned that risk of infection transmission as well as ease of use of the tool overwhelmingly contributed as a motivating influence for use. Other prominent influences included the availability of disinfection technology and enhanced vigilance of environmental hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the biggest deterrents of UV disinfection included technical issues with the device (as mentioned previously this was largely driven by early internal issues with one particular UV enclosure on Unit 3). Technical issues notwithstanding, the other major factors hindering wider device use were lack of time and established preference for traditional cleaning methods (i.e. alcohol wipes, quaternary ammonium wipes). To our knowledge, this is the first survey of motivators/deterrents of voluntary, rapid UV disinfection technologies among nursing staff. This study thus provides insights for consideration prior to the implementation of staff directed supplementary disinfection tools and protocols. As expected, fear of infection transmission and heightened vigilance of environmental hygiene during the onset of SARS-CoV2 played influential roles in the internalization of UV as an enhanced infection prevention method. This echoes the findings of recent surveys of healthcare workers which documented as high as 31% of participants reporting anxiety, 11% fear, and 6% pessimism about the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 13 www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

While UV intervention prior to the outbreak significantly increased overall cleaning frequency on a number of high touch surfaces, items with existing disinfection guidelines (stethoscopes, wheelchairs, commodes) were unaffected. Interestingly the enhanced frequency of cleaning persisted on two of the three affected high touch surfaces (CAC cards and hospital IDs) as far as eight months into the COVID-19 pandemic. This corresponded with significant and persistent reductions in overall bacterial contamination of the surfaces, though rates of common, hospital multi-drug resistant organisms were not affected by either the UV intervention or the outbreak. While nearly two thirds of staff report highly favorable attitudes toward the impact of ultraviolet disinfection on environmental hygiene and patient safety, major use limitations were noted, specifically lack of time and preference for other cleaning agents. Another consideration for electronic based tools for enhanced infection prevention include the ease of use and possibility of technical malfunctions which may negatively influence users' perception and utilization, as occurred in one unit in this study. Finally, we confirm in a US population of healthcare workers that fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission were prominent motivators for increased vigilance of environmental hygiene and increased use of UV disinfection.",
