Because most patients with joint pain choose to visit the outpatient unit first, outpatient visits are often studied as an important indicator of healthcare-seeking behaviour. Local weather conditions, such as rainfall, have been found to be closely associated with outpatient visits for joint and back pain in a large patient population [17] . However, the effect of weather on AS outpatient visits has not been adequately considered. This time-series study aimed to assess the associations between shortterm weather conditions and AS outpatient visits to a hospital in Hefei, China. Changes in the number of AS outpatient visits associated with temperature and relative humidity from 2014 to 2019 were quantitatively assessed, and the impact of gender and age on these effects was also examined.",

Patient data included gender, age, residential address, date of visit, diagnosis, and electronic medical record. The diagnostic classification of AS was according to the modified New York criteria [18] . In order to determine the valid outpatient records, we applied the following exclusion criteria: (1) scheduled and regular outpatient visits; (2) follow-up visits; (3) patients who did not take medicine according to the doctor's advice; (4) patients whose residential addresses were not in Hefei; (5) patients who lacked demographic information (e.g. age, sex); or (6) patients without condition exacerbation. Finally, we included the following outpatient records: (1) patients with condition exacerbation, without therapeutic schedule change; (2) patients with condition exacerbation, and increasing of drug doses or the initiation of a new drug for AS; (3) patients with condition exacerbation, and hospitalisation after visits. The whole data selection process was shown in Supplementary Figures S1 . Locations of the hospital and patient residences are given in Fig. 1 .",

As the daily count of outpatients approximately followed a Poisson distribution, we estimated the shortterm association between meteorological factors and outpatient visits by conducting a quasi-Poisson regression analysis using a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) [19] , where Y t represents the observed count of AS outpatient visits at day t; \u03b1 is the intercept, l is the lag days, TEM t,l is the cross-basis function for mean temperature, and ns(Time t , 8 \u00d7 6) represents a natural cubic spline with 8 degrees of freedom (df ) per year for the time taken to control for long-term and seasonality trends.

For example, a questionnaire survey among 394 rheumatic patients in Romania suggested that most people reported an intensification in pain when the weather deteriorated, and this was significant with an increase in humidity or decrease in temperature [25] . A retrospective cohort study concluded that rainfall exacerbated the joint pain of patients with rheumatoid arthritis to the extent that some were re-admitted to the hospital [24] . However, the questionnaire surveys and hospital admission numbers enable only a small proportion of populations affected by weather conditions to be detected because only people with severe disease or specific conditions tend to be included [26] . According to the 2019 China Health Statistics Yearbook, hospital outpatient and emergency visits accounted for nearly 95% of the total number of hospital visits, while hospital admissions only accounted for 2.4%. It is also notable that the number of patients hospitalised may not vary appreciably from day to day because people in China prefer to be admitted to high-level hospitals, so approximating a saturation for inpatient beds [27] . Therefore, we investigated outpatient and emergency visits instead of hospital admissions, which yield high levels of coverage by including cases with less severe diseases or conditions [26] .",

Another related study indicated that ambient temperature and high relative humidity can increase the expression of VEGF and IL-1 in articular cartilage, which might influence the promotion, pathological course, and severity of AS in patients [29] . We found a significant increase in the number of patients attending the hospital on the second and seventh days after the onset of high humidity.

Therefore, patients that are severely affected wait to see a doctor on the following day, and patients with less pain choose to make an appointment for outpatient service one week later. It has also been reported that significantly more people attend emergency departments on fair weather days (warm, dry, and sunny) than on bad weather days (cool, rainy, and dull) [30] , which is consistent with our interpretation. However, it remains unclear why outpatient visits decreased on the fourth . 3 Bi-dimensional exposure-lag-response surfaces between each meteorological variable and AS outpatient visits day following the event. We speculate that the hospital patient population is relatively fixed and that most patients may not re-visit a doctor in the short term after treatment. As a result, the number of AS outpatient visits is expected to decrease significantly after the peak. However, this remains inconclusive and requires further investigation considering wider populations. The gender and age stratifying analysis showed that the behaviour of only male and young patients (< 65 years) was consistent with this result, as they may be more vulnerable to damp environments because they are more likely to be outdoors [31] . In contrast with previous studies, we found no significant relationship between low temperature and AS outpatient visits. However, 6 to 7 days after a high temperature event, the number of elderly patients increased sharply. Most people in China have air conditioning; therefore, low temperatures do not have a significant impact on people. However, air conditioning can cause the environment to become cold in summer, which could exacerbate symptoms in elderly patients. Fernandes et al. [32] provided evidence that such a change in temperature could increase blood flow and affect the sensitivity of arthritis patients to pain. In this respect, elderly people over the age of 65 are more vulnerable and sensitive [33] .",

Another limitation is that we lacked the clinical data associated with disease activity and could only use the exclusion criteria and identified outpatient record categories to determine the valid outpatient records.
