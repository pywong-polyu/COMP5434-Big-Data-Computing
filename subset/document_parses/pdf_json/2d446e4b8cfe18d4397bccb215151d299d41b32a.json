The threat of NCDs is expected to rise with the ageing population (population aged 65 or above), which is projected to account for a quarter of the population by 2070. 3 Concurrently, the prevalence of NCD multimorbidity, defined as the presence of two or more NCDs, is expected to rise rapidly in many LMICs, as both life expectancy and exposure to risk factors increase. 4 Indonesia has started recognising the burden of NCDs due to its substantial contribution to the top causes of death and disability-adjusted life years. 5 However, current Indonesia health programmes remain limited to curative services, focusing on single chronic disease as opposed to assessing and mitigating the impact of multimorbidity on the individual, health system and wider society. The growing burden of multimorbidity in LMICs was highlighted in the United Nations High-Level Meetings on NCDs in 2011, 2014 and 2018. 6 LMICs typically have low levels of government expenditure for health and inadequate health insurance coverage, which often results in higher levels of out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) and risk of impoverishing patients with chronic health conditions. 7 8 The economic burden of multimorbidity is further compounded by the fact that multiple healthcare specialists typically manage multimorbid patients in LMICs. 9 This leads to inefficiencies with numerous different hospital visits, polypharmacy and suboptimal disease management. 9 10 While the Indonesian health system is mainly funded by the government, it only spends around 2% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health, which is significantly lower than other LMICs with comparable income level. 11 Approximately half of all health spending is covered by the public sector and one-third comes from OOP payment. 12 While the primary healthcare (PHC) centres are designed as gatekeepers for primary prevention for NCDs, studies have found limited capacity of PHC in proper management of NCDs. [13] [14] [15] There is also high public funding allocations to curative services at the hospital-level, 16 with limited investment in preventive and promotive health services. 12 Further, the poor and those living in limited-resource regions have generally lower hospital utilisation due to geographical barriers and high transportation costs. 17 18 Low overall government health spending, coupled with limited investment in PHC and the high burden of NCDs may further increase the high OOPE in Indonesia and inequitable access to care. 5 The Indonesian national health insurance programme expansion in 2014 was designed to achieve universal coverage by 2019. 19 However, as of August 2020, the insurance coverage was only at 85.5%, 20 leaving around 40 million people remained uncovered. Furthermore, the insurance programme has been in funding deficit since its inception and recent studies identified that it may not be financially sustainable. 1 2 Further, NCDs were responsible for around 60% of total spending of the insurance programme. Therefore, addressing NCDs through preventive and promotive programmes is pertinent to strengthen the Indonesian health system and the sustainability of its health insurance programme.",

For hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, the diagnoses were confirmed through a physical examination conducted by trained nurses, that is, blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. All IFLS respondents aged 15 years and older had their blood pressure recorded three times on alternate arms using Omron self-inflating sphygmomanometers by trained nurses. 24 25 In our analysis, a respondent was categorised as having hypertension if the mean measurement of systolic blood pressure was \u2265140 mm Hg and/or mean diastolic blood pressure was \u226590 mm Hg or the respondent selfreported having been diagnosed with hypertension. 26 We also included hypercholesterolaemia, defined as total blood cholesterol value \u2265240 mg/dL, as morbidity. 27 It is important to note that different measurements of hypercholesterolaemia were used in Wave 4 and 5.

Such policies would be in line with the current programme of the Ministry of Health in Indonesia to reorient public PHC to provide more promotive and preventive health services, such as through the implementation of Chronic Diseases Management Programme (Prolanis) in PHC. 12 39 However, the participation in this programme remains low due to the poor access to PHC facilities, especially in non-Java-Bali regions. Engaging the private sector, which makes up 60% of health facilities in Indonesia, is warranted to expand the coverage of NCDs promotive and prevention activities. 40 Furthermore, the development of digital health solution and telehealth for NCDs prevention and control should be included in the national plan. 41 Although most countries and international health organisations have recognised the importance of multimorbidity, 42 most health policies and programmes still focus on single diseases, including in Indonesia. Therefore, the health systems need to shift from single-disease models to new financing methods and service delivery to more effectively manage multimorbidity. 43 44 At the PHC level, this can be done through improved prevention and treatment of multimorbidity, underpinned by multidisciplinary teams led by general practitioners. 42 There is also a need to strengthen the coordination of patient management between primary and secondary care.

            "text": "healthcare delivery in Indonesia remains fragmented and hospital-centred, with little coordination among healthcare providers across different tiers of the system. 45 Furthermore, under the current national health insurance scheme, the hospital reimbursement system that uses case-based groups has created significant gaps between Open access reimbursable costs and actual hospital expenses. 46 The reimbursement system, which is mainly based on primary diagnosis, limits the hospital's capacity and willingness to treat complicated cases such as those with multimorbidity. 47 Thus, while clinical guideline for single NCD still has a prominent role, it also important for LMICs to develop a clinical guideline for multimorbidity, along with payment systems that would ensure quality health services at both primary and secondary levels of care for patients with multimorbidity. 9 40 It is also worth noting that Indonesia is still facing the double burden of infectious and chronic diseases. Therefore, multimorbidity care delivery model needs to pay attention to the management of NCDs alongside infectious diseases. There are several limitations to our study. First, the IFLS-5 was conducted between 2014 and 2015, which may not be able to capture the current prevalence of multimorbidity in Indonesia. Despite this limitation, IFLS is the only longitudinal survey available in Indonesia that is useful to produce more accurate estimates compared with using a cross-sectional dataset (eg, the National Socioeconomic Survey). Second, our findings should be interpreted with caution since the assessment of NCDs was mostly based on self-reporting. This may cause misreporting of the true diagnoses and prevalence of multimorbidity. The health service use and OOPE were also based on self-reporting and may be prone to recall bias. 48 The use of self-reported diagnoses limits our assessment of the actual severity of the diseases, which may vary across socioeconomic status. Future studies should consider using different datasets (such as clinical dataset from the hospital) and applying clinical metrics such as Charlson index, which could more objectively capture disease severity and predict the health outcomes. 49 Third, the IFLS sample did not include eastern Indonesia. There is a need to extend the multimorbidity assessment to the remaining regions. Finally, this research intentionally focused on the older population due to a significantly higher burden of NCDs in this population group. Future research should use cohort data to follow patients over a more extended time period to examine the impact of multimorbidity and its effects in younger population groups in LMICs. 22 CONCLUSION Multimorbidity poses substantial costs to individuals, households, health system and the wider society in Indonesia, which has an increasingly ageing population. Policymakers and employers in Indonesia should carefully design and invest in targeted public health and workplace interventions at the individual and population level to avert the adverse health and economic consequences of NCD multimorbidity.",
