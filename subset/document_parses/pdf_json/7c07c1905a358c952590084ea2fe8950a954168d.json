These events 37 are essential for networking and developing collaborations, especially for early-career researchers 38 (ECRs; students and pre-tenure postgraduates) who use meetings as an opportunity to plan their next 39 career step (Oester et al., 2017) . Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting travel bans and 40 restrictions, many in-person meetings since March 2020 were canceled, rescheduled, or changed to an 41 online format, allowing scientists to present their research and interact with members of their respective 42 communities virtually (Stefanoudis et al., 2021) . 43 Online-only meetings have a number of advantages, for instance: (i) enhanced accessibility by allowing 44 attendance during periods of fieldwork or teaching (Bartlett et al., 2021) , (ii) reduced carbon footprint 45 (Burtscher et al., 2020; Tao et al., 2021) , and (iii) lower participation costs with potentially reduced 46 registration fees and no travel and accommodation costs. These advantages have greatly improved 47 inclusivity for researchers and students from developing countries and with limited financial means 48 (Chou and Camerlink, 2021; Wu et al., 2022) and were the reasons why a large online international 49 conference on photonics was held just before the COVID-19 pandemic (Reshef et al., 2020) . Thanks 50 to these advantages, many online conferences showed higher registration rates compared to previous 51 in-person meetings (e.g., Castelvecchi, 2020; Stefanoudis et al., 2021) . Online conferences, however, 52 have a number of drawbacks, including: (i) fewer interactions among participants, especially if 53",

Indeed, they allow for a wider participation by giving more flexibility to 436 participants to choose an attendance type that suits their needs best. Furthermore, online-only 437 conferences cannot fully replace in-person formal and informal interactions. Although hybrid events 438 require additional work and are currently more expensive in comparison to online-only events for 439 online participants, we think that with early planning, sufficient sponsors, and technological advances, 440 hybrid events represent the most inclusive way to hold international conferences. 441",
