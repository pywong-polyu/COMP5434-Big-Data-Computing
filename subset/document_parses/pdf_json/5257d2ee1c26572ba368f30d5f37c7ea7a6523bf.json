Here, we present the heretofore cryptic mutational history and spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from an analysis of thousands of high-quality genomes. We report the likely most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, reconstructed through a novel application and advancement of computational methods initially developed to infer the mutational history of tumor cells in a patient. This progenitor genome differs from genomes of the first coronaviruses sampled in China by three variants, implying that none of the earliest patients represent the index case or gave rise to all the human infections. However, multiple coronavirus infections in China and the USA harbored the progenitor genetic fingerprint in January 2020 and later, suggesting that the progenitor was spreading worldwide months before and after the first reported cases of COVID-19 in China. Mutations of the progenitor and its offshoots have produced many dominant coronavirus strains, which have spread episodically over time. Fingerprinting based on common mutations reveals that the same coronavirus lineage has dominated North America for most of the pandemic in 2020. There have been multiple replacements of predominant coronavirus strains in Europe and Asia and the continued presence of multiple high-frequency strains in Asia and North America. We have developed a continually updating dashboard of global evolution and spatiotemporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 spread (http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/).",

Sophisticated investigations have shown that traditional molecular phylogenetic analyses do not produce reliable evolutionary inferences about the early history of SARS-CoV-2 due to low sequence divergence, a limited number of phylogenetically informative sites, and the ubiquity of sequencing errors Mavian et al. 2020; Turakhia et al. 2020) . In particular, the root of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny remains elusive (Morel et al. 2020; Pipes et al. 2020 ) because the closely-related non-human coronavirus (outgroups) are more than 1,100 base differences from human SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as compared to fewer than 30 differences between human SARS-CoV-2 genomes' sequenced early on (December 2019 and January 2020) Castells et al. 2020; G\u00f3mez-Carballa et al. 2020; Lai et al. 2020; Mavian et al. 2020; Morel et al. 2020; Pipes et al. 2020; Wenzel 2020) . Without a reliable root of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny, the most recent ancestor sequence cannot be accurately reconstructed, and it is not possible to assess the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 that existed at the time of its first outbreak.",

MOA does not infer phylogeny as an intermediate step and is often used to build the evolutionary history of tumor cells that evolve clonally and without recombination. This approach is suitable for analyzing SARS-CoV-2 genomes because of their quasi-species evolutionary behavior (clonal) and the lack of evidence of significant recombination within human outbreaks , both of which preserve the collinearity of variants in genomes. While reports of recombination among circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes have begun to appear (Jackson et al. 2020) , the fraction of circulating recombinant strains is likely very small and geographically limited and will not affect analyses conducted on sequences sampled in 2020. Recombination also poses difficulties to phylogenetic methods since a single tree is no longer suitable for describing evolutionary relationships. This feature permits effective use of shared co-occurrence of variants in genomes and the frequencies of individual variants for inferring the mutational history, notwithstanding the presence of sequencing errors and other artifacts (Kim and Simon 2014; Jahn et al. 2016 ) (see Materials and Methods).",

Second, SARS-CoV-2 genomes may not satisfy the perfect phylogeny assumption of MOA analysis because some genomic positions have likely experienced multiple and recurrent mutations Martin et al. 2021 ). So, we used shared co-occurrence of variants among genomes to assess the impact of the violation of the perfect phylogeny assumption and select mutation orientations and histories in the maximum likelihood approach. We also devised a bootstrap procedure to place confidence limits on the inferred mutation order in which bootstrap replicate datasets are generated by sampling genomes with replacement.",

The MRCA genome was the progenitor of all SARS-CoV-2 infections globally, henceforth proCoV2, and was likely carried by the first detectable case of human transmission in the COVID-19 pandemic (index case). A comparison of proCoV2 with Wuhan-1 genomes revealed three differences in 49 positions analyzed, which was also true for other reference genomes (Fig. 1c ). This suggests that the Wuhan-1 (EPI_ISL 402123) and the other earliest sampled genomes are derived coronavirus strains that arose from proCoV2 after the divergence of \u03bd and \u03b1 lineages (Fig. 2) . According to the mutational history, the Wuhan-1 strain evolved by three successive \u03b1 mutations (two synonymous and one nonsynonymous) in proCoV2 (\u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13). This progression is statistically supported (BCL = 100%), which is made possible by the presence of 896 intermediate genomes containing one or two \u03b1 variants in the 29KG dataset. Importantly, three closely related non-human coronavirus genomes (bats and pangolin) all have the same base at these positions as does the proCoV2 genome, suggesting that the ancestral genome did not contain \u03b1 variants.",

This means that the progenitor coronavirus spread and mutated in the human population for months after the first reported COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, comparisons of the protein sequences encoded by the proCoV2 genome revealed 131 other genomic matches, which contained only synonymous differences from proCoV2. A majority (89 genomes) of these matches were from coronaviruses sampled in China and other Asian countries (Fig. 1d ). The first sequence was sampled 12 days after Wuhan-1. Multiple matches were found in all sampled continents and detected as late as April 2020 in Europe.

            "text": "The presence of such diversity has been acknowledged and analyzed, e.g., Pekar et al. (2021) , but variants present in this diverse population were not identified. Our analyses clearly show that the ancestors of the Wuhan-1 genome gave rise to a diversity of Wuhan-1's sibling coronavirus lineages (\u03b13a -\u03b13j; Fig. 1 and 3 ). These sibling coronavirus lineages were detected in China in January 2020 (\u03b13b and \u03b13f) and February 2020 in Asia (\u03b13c -\u03b13e) and Europe (\u03b13a, \u03b13g -\u03b13j) ( Table 1) . Thousands of genomes in the 29KG dataset belong to siblings and ancestors of Wuhan-1 (Table 1, Fig. 3 ; yellow box). However, the paucity of genomes sampled in 2019 makes it impossible to establish the date and location of origin precisely, but some must have originated before the first detection of the outbreak. Notably, the evolution of \u03b13 was preceded by the evolution of \u03b12 and \u03b11 lineages, with \u03b11 spawning multiple offshoots first detected in Europe in February 2020 (\u03b11a -\u03b11d). The \u03bd lineage, detected in the USA in February 2020, is an even earlier descendant of proCoV2 and is a sibling of the \u03b1 lineage (Table 1, Fig. 3 ). These lineages may not have been detected earlier because of the lack of sequencing in 2019, and it is likely that some originated early and spread around the world, whereas others evolved from proCoV2 or its early descendant in different parts of the world. Again, thousands of these coronavirus genomes were found throughout the world ( Fig. 3; yellow box) . None of these genomes contained the widely-studied Spike protein mutant (D614G), a \u03b2 mutation that occurred in the genomes carrying all three \u03b1 variants and was first seen in late January 2020. Therefore, the proCoV2 (MRCA) and a large diversity of its early descendants were all able to spread in the global human population. Our tMRCA is one month older than the date for the MRCA of genomes presented by Pekar et al. (2021) because their analysis is restricted to the ancestry of the coronaviruses sampled from China only that resulted in the exclusion of the \u03bd lineage from their analysis. The potential for not sampling such lineages is well appreciated in Pekar et al. (2021) . This exclusion and the use of sampling times in strict clock phylogenetic analyses would naturally lead to analyses leaning close to the earliest sampling times of SARS-CoV-2 (December 2019). Anyway, if we assume that proCoV2 was the index case, i.e., then the date of zoonosis (tIndex) would be late October to mid-November 2019. This range overlaps with Pekar et al.'s (2021) index date falling between mid-October and mid-November 2019. However, it likely that the actual tIndex is much earlier than tMRCA because proCoV2 likely increased in frequency over time before reaching a human host, and it is possible that one of its ancestors first infected a human. Based on an approximately one-month difference between MRCA and Index dates in Pekar et al. (2021) , it is tempting to speculate that tIndex could have been as early as September 2019 for our SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. This speculation requires more extensive analysis and confirmation in the future.",

Variants in \u03b6 and \u03b7 groups also showed episodic accumulation of mutations, e.g., the count of genomes containing three \u03b6 mutations (\u03b61 -\u03b63; 2,955 genomes) was much larger than those with a subset of these variants (148 genomes). The episodic nature of mutational spread for 84 variants in the 68KG is statistically significant (P < 10 -8 ), i.e., clusters of mutations together have become common variants (see Materials and Methods).",

Each fingerprint represents a genome type containing all the variants on the path from that tip node up to the progenitor proCoV2. These fingerprints can classify genomes and track spatiotemporal patterns of dominant lineages (see Materials and Methods). We use a shorthand to refer to each barcode in which only the major variant type is used. For example, \u03b1 fingerprint refers to genomes that one or more of the \u03b1 variants and no other major variants, and \u03b1\u03b2 fingerprint refers to genomes that contain at least one \u03b1, at least one \u03b2 variant, and no other major variants. This nomenclature is intuitive and provides a way to glean evolutionary information from the coronavirus lineage's name. In the 68KG dataset (October 12, 2020 GISAID snapshot), global frequencies of major proCoV2 fingerprints were \u03b1\u03b2\u03b5 (32.1%), \u03b1\u03b2\uf067\u03b4 (17.7%), \u03b1\u03b2 (16.7%), \u03b1\u03b2\u03b5\u03b7 (9.9%), \u03b1\u03b2 (9.8%), \u03b1\u03b2\uf067 (6.8%), \u03b1\u03b2\u03b6 (4.5%), and \u03bd (2.4%).

Gene ORF7b was removed because it was too short for alignment and comparisons.

Thresholds were 0.5% for the S gene, 0.1% for ORF1a and ORF1b genes, and 1% for all other genes.

We used a maximum likelihood method, SCITE (Jahn et al. 2016) , and variant co-occurrence analyses for reconstructing the order of mutations corresponding to 49 common variants (frequency > 1%) observed in this dataset (see flowchart in Supplementary Figure   S2 ). MOA has demonstrated high accuracy for analyzing tumor cell genomes that reproduce clonally, have frequent sequencing errors, and exhibit limited sequence divergence (Jahn et al. 2016; Miura et al. 2018 ). In MOA, higher frequency variants are expected to have arisen earlier than low-frequency variants in clonally reproducing populations (Kim and Simon 2014; Jahn et al. 2016) . We used the highest frequency variants to anchor the analysis and the shared co-occurrence of variants among genomes to order mutations while allowing probabilistically for sequencing errors and pooled sequencing of genomes (Jahn et al. 2016) . MOA is different from traditional phylogenetic approaches where positions are treated independently, i.e., the shared co-occurrence of variants is not directly utilized in the inference procedure. Notably, both traditional phylogenetic and mutation order analyses are expected to produce concordant patterns when sequencing errors and other artifacts are minimized. However, sequencing errors and limited mutational input during the coronavirus history adversely impact traditional methods, as does the fact that the closest coronaviruses useable as outgroups have more than a thousand base differences from SARS-CoV-2 genomes that only differ in a handful of bases from each other (Mavian et al. 2020; Morel et al. 2020; Pipes et al. 2020) .",

To designate mutation orientations for applying MOA in SARS-CoV-2 analysis, we devised a simple approach in which we began by comparing nucleotides at the 49 genomic positions among three closely related genomes (bat RaTG13, bat RmYN02, and pangolin MT121216.1) (Boni et al. 2020) . We chose the consensus base to be the initial reference base, such that SARS-CoV-2 genome bases were coded to be \"0\" whenever they were the same as the consensus base at their respective positions. All other bases were assigned a \"1.\" There were 39 positions in which all three outgroup genomes were identical to each other and 9 in which two of the outgroups showed the same base. In the remaining position (28657), all three outgroups differed, so we selected the base found in the gene with the highest sequence similarity to the human SARS-CoV-2 NCBI reference genome (NC_045512) because SARS-CoV-2's ancestor likely experienced genomic recombination before its zoonotic transfer into humans Xiaojun Li et al. 2020; MacLean et al. 2021) . At one position, both major and minor bases in humans were different from the consensus base in the outgroups, so we assigned the mutant status to the minority base (U; vf = 29.8%). All missing and ambiguous bases were coded to be ignored (missing data) in all the analyses. These initially assigned mutation orientations were tested in a subsequent investigation of variants' co-occurrence index (COI). COI for a given variant (y) is the number of genomes that contain y and its directly preceding mutation (x) in the mutation history, divided by the number of genomes that contain y. When COI was lower than 70%, we reversed each position's mutation orientation individually and selected the mutation orientation that produced mutation histories with the highest COI (see below).",

This timeline puts the presence of proCoV2 in late-October 2019, which is consistent with the report of a fragment of spike protein identical to Wuhan-1 in early December in Italy, among other evidenceGiovanetti et al. 2020;Xingguang Li et al. 2020;Amendola et al. 2021). The sequenced segment of the spike protein is short (409 bases), and it does not span positions in which 49 major early variants were observed, which means that the Italian Spike protein fragment can only confirm the existence of proCoV2 before the first coronavirus detection in China.",

This includes all small and medium-sized phylogenetic groups (up to 488 genomes) and two large groups(A.1 with 1,377 genomes and B.1.2 with 749 genomes). One large group, B.1.1, predominately connects with \u03b53 node (79%, 4,832 genomes), but some of its members belong to \u03b53 offshoots because they contain respective diagnostic mutations. For group B.1.1.1, two other \u03b53 offshoots are mixed up almost equally. Three other large differences between mutational fingerprint-based classification and phylogeny-based grouping are seen for A, B, B1.1, and B.2 groups. These differences are likely because the location of the root and the earliest branching order of coronavirus lineages are problematic in phylogeny-based classifications",

The null hypothesis was rejected for both 29KG and 64KG analysis at P << 0.01, suggesting significant temporally clustering in both 29KG dataset and 64KG datasets. Because many mutations were first sampled on December 24, 2019, we only included one mutation for that day to avoid biasing the test.We also tested the null hypothesis of the same molecular evolutionary patterns within the SARS-CoV-2 population and between species (i.e., Human SARS-CoV-2 and Bat RaTG13) by usinga McDonald-Kreitman test (McDonald and Kreitman 1991). The numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphisms with a frequency greater than 1% were 32 and 17, compared with the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous fixed differences (170 and 958, respectively) inferred between proCoV2 and bat RaTG13 sequences. The McDonald-Kreitman test rejected the null overwhelmingly in a 2\u00d72 contingency table analysis (P 0.01).
