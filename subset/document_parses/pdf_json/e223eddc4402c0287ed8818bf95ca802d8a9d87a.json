            "text": "To develop better analytical approaches for future global pandemics, it is widely recognized that sensing materials are necessary that enable molecular recognition and sensor assay development on a much faster scale than currently possible. Previously developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) point-of-care devices are based on the specific molecular recognition using subunit protein antibodies and protein receptors that selectively capture the viral proteins. However, these necessarily involve complex and lengthy development and processing times and are notoriously prone to a loss of biological activity upon sensor immobilization and device interfacing, potentially limiting their use in applications at scale. Here, we report a synthetic strategy for nanoparticle corona interfaces that enables the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 proteins without any antibody and receptor design. Our nanosensor constructs consist of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)\ue0d5phospholipid heteropolymers adsorbed onto near-infrared (nIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that recognize the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 using unique threedimensional (3D) nanosensor interfaces. This results in rapid and label-free nIR fluorescence detection. This antibody-free nanosensor shows up to 50% sensor responses within 5 min of viral protein injections with limit of detection (LOD) values of 48 fM and 350 pM for N and S proteins, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate instrumentation based on a fiber-optic platform that interfaces the advantages of antibody-free molecular recognition and biofluid compatibility in human saliva conditions.",

            "text": "A rapid and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is critical for reducing the morbidity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 . 1 The current methodology in assessing the present infection of SARS-CoV-2 relies on two analytics: (i) nucleic acid-based tests (NATs), which detect the genetic material (RNA) from SARS-CoV-2 and (ii) serological tests, which detect the presence of antibodies (IgG and IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. 2 NAT primarily uses reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify and detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the patient. Since RT-PCR demonstrates superior sensitivity for viral RNA detection with a limit of detection (LOD) of a few viral RNA copies, the NAT is the preferred testing method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 positive cases to date. 3 However, this method is composed of highly complex processes, which require specialized equipment, trained personnel, and long turnaround time, limiting the high-throughput diagnosis of large populations and wide testing accessibility in rural regions. 4\u22126 Serological test, in general, is based on lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) platform, which is relatively easy, inexpensive, having a short turnaround time, and amenable to point-of-care diagnostic methodologies. 7 However, the sensitivity of the antigen test is generally not high enough to accurately screen the positive cases and provide past viral infections data. Thus, it is hard to identify the currently active cases. 7\u22129 Therefore, there has been a strong drive to find a next-generation viral testing technology for faster and simpler diagnostics of large populations, which can directly detect viral antigens in clinical samples without complicated sample preparation steps. In addition, even though NAT and LFA-based diagnostics have a lot of advantages, we could not have a wide deployment of these test kits until few months of the early phase of the pandemic due to complicated development processes, including sensor design, validation and implementation, and shortages of laboratory item. 10, 11 Thus, an accelerated point-of-care sensor development process should be developed for future viral targets.",

            "text": "Several potentially useful new analytics for rapid and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection have emerged for the diagnosis of COVID-19 against RT-PCR and serological tests, including field-effect transistor (FET) sensing devices, 12\u221214 electrochemical cell devices, 15\u221217 plasmonic resonance platform, 18\u221220 optical nanosensors, 21\u221223 and chemiresistors. 24 These analytic tools showed sensitive and rapid detection performances based on simple sensor signal readout without complex sample processing and specialized equipment. However, all of these methods are based on specific and complex surface chemistry design of substrate and transducers using subunit protein antibody and protein receptors such as DNA/RNA aptamers and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to selectively capture the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. 25\u221227 These antibody or protein receptor functionalizations are expensive, fragile, prone to loss of biological activity with external treatment such as immobilization and device interfacing, and exhibit significant batch-dependent variations. 28, 29 In addition, they involve multiple processing steps of fabrications, including incubation, protein synthesis, and washing steps that require a significant amount of time to perform, limiting their use in widespread applications. 30 Herein, we address this challenge using corona phase molecular recognition (CoPhMoRe) that enables the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins without the need for antibody or enzymatic receptor incorporation. Our recognition motif consists of specifically selected poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)\ue0d5phospholipid heteropolymers adsorbed onto and structured by an underlying single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), whereby a unique three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticle interface recognized nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus, resulting in rapid and label-free modulation of SWCNT near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence. The presence of the N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust and rapid nanosensor fluorescence changes up to 50 and 40% within 5 min of analyte injections, and LOD vaues were measured to be 48 fM and 350 pM, respectively. We also characterize the nanosensor stability in 100% human saliva condition and demonstrate that the N protein sensing ability is completely preserved. Finally, an on-site diagnosis system is demonstrated with a fiber-optic (optode) benchtop platform that interfaces the advantages of antibody-free molecular recognition virus sensors on a 3D sensing tip.",

            "text": "SWCNTs synthesized by the high-pressure carbon monoxide (HiPCO) process were suspended with a specifically designed library of 11 PEG-phospholipid polymers capable of forming corona phases at the SWCNT surface ( Figure 1a ). PEGphospholipid polymers are chosen for corona formation since previous studies have shown that PEG-phospholipid-wrapped SWCNTs were capable of detecting proteins in complex biofluid conditions. 31 In addition, the chain length of PEG can be easily tuned to form a wide range of the binding pocket, and they are commercially available; thus, the preparation of polymer library is not time consuming. The accessible surface area of the PEG-phospholipid-wrapped SWCNT was measured by titration using a quenchable fluorescent riboflavin Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article probe, following a recently developed molecular probe adsorption (MPA) technique (detailed procedure in Supporting Information Note 1). 32 The results show that DSPE-PEG5000 Amine formed the largest surface covering corona on SWCNT, and 16:0 PEG1000 PE formed the smallest surface coverage corona ( Figure 1b) . The resulting colloidal solutions of nanosensors are characterized by ultraviolet\u2212 visible\u2212nIR (UV\u2212vis\u2212nIR) absorption spectroscopy. Figure  1c shows the UV\u2212vis\u2212nIR absorption spectrum for the PEGphospholipid corona phase, where the distinct and sharp peaks of E 11 and E 22 transitions indicate the successful isolation and suspension of individual SWCNT. nIR fluorescent emission spectra ( Figure 1d ) under 785 nm laser excitation demonstrate that nanosensors are mainly composed of (6, 5), (7, 6) , and (9, 4) nanotube chirality. The nIR fluorescence response of PEG-phospholipid/ SWCNT nanosensors was measured during SARS-CoV-2 N and S protein addition, schematically represented in Figure 2a . The N and S proteins can be recognized by specific 3D corona phase configurations of the PEG-phospholipid polymers imposed by the nanoparticle interfaces enabling rapid modulation of underlying nIR fluorescence intensity of the nanotube. 31, 33 In this way, the corona phase (PEGphospholipid) acts as the receptor coupled directly to the fluorescent nanotube, which acts as the nonselective transducer. Note that specific recognition between the PEG and phospholipid independently of the nanotube surface is not expected. The combined polymer/nanotube construct is labeled CoPhMoRe. The unit compositions of the polymers were varied to produce structurally diverse corona phases to sample a range of free volumes and chemical interactions with the analyte, influencing the dynamic binding/unbinding of viral proteins. 34 In total, we explored 44 unique corona phases in this work based on 11 PEG-phospholipid polymer backbones. The responses of the resulting fluorescent emission of this library were recorded following a 1 h incubation with each viral protein target at 10 \u03bcg/mL in distinct buffer conditions. An identical concentration of strongly adsorbing bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as an interferent to address both issues of nonspecific binding and the stability of the sensor. The resulting bar graph chart of molecular binding shows distinct fluorescence responses ((I \u2212 I 0 )/I 0 ) with varying polymer compositions ( Figure 2b ). Here, I 0 and I represent the integrated nIR intensity of nanosensors at t = 0 and after viral proteins injection, respectively. Each nanosensor shows a unique turn-on or turn-off response to N proteins, S proteins, and BSA, with response intensity changes from \u221270 to 212%. Most of the sensors demonstrate quenching or turnoff responses to N protein and intensity gains or turn-on responses to S protein. The 18:0 PEG1000 PE/SWCNT (henceforth labeled nanosensor ii) and 14:0 PEG2000 PE/ SWCNT (nanosensor vi) show the most obvious and clearly distinguishable responses to N protein and S proteins, respectively, with strong 50 to 70% decreases in fluorescence intensity. Importantly, BSA appears to induce almost no response for these corona phase complexes. Thus, for the purposes of this work, nanosensor ii and nanosensor vi can be considered specific sensors for N protein and S proteins, respectively. Fluorescent emission spectra demonstrate that nanosensor ii and nanosensor vi show significant nIR intensity decreases only to their specific protein targets ( Figure S2a ). Time-series emission spectra show that intensities of both nanosensors do not change after 60 min of buffer incubation; however, they drastically change within 5 min of the addition of viral proteins ( Figure S2b ). More specifically, the normalized change in the fluorescence of the 1125 nm emission peak corresponding to (7, 6) chirality SWCNT instantaneously decreased by 57 and 45% within 5 min ( Figure  S3 ) for nanosensor ii and nanosensor vi, respectively. The fluorescent response of nanosensor ii to N protein was show an instantaneous and continuous decrease in nIR signal on the order of 5\u221270%, depending on protein concentrations. Nanosensor kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the maximum sensor response for 60 min to each analyte concentration series using the cooperative binding model of the Hill equation. 35 For a first-order reversible reaction, the relationship between the analyte (A) and available docking sites (\u03b8) for viral proteins can be described as follows.",

Fitting the data in Figure 3a ,b with eq 3 (R 2 = 0.998 and 0.980) results in a proportionality factor \u03b1 = 61.91 and 0.683, with \u03b2 = 3.14 and \u22120.005, K d = 1/K A = 0.840 and 0.213 nM, and n = 1.176 and 1.120 for N and S proteins respectively, indicating positive cooperativity in good agreement with previous work (n > 1) (Figure 3c,d) . 19 The K d value of N and S protein nanosensors are lower than previously reported CoPhMoRe sensing, which suggests the influence of the larger molecular size of viral proteins, with more binding Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article sites involved, and hence polyvalent interactions. The limit of detection value in this mode is 49 fM and 350 pM for N and S proteins, respectively; this value was calculated by adding the nanosensor response from the addition of only buffer as the noise level to three times of the signal. Our SARS-CoV-2 nanosensor compatibility in biofluids was assessed by testing the response to viral proteins in 1 and 100% human saliva (details in Table S1 ). For the N protein nanosensor, small sensor responses with 3.5 and 6.3% intensity change were observed with 1 and 100% saliva, respectively (left, Figure 4a ). However, significantly larger responses to N protein in 100% saliva were observed with 45.4% change, demonstrating that N protein detection appears to be independent of background saliva effects. SARS-CoV-2 patients show N protein concentration range from 10 to 10 4 pg/mL in their saliva during symptoms of day 1\u22127. 36 Since detecting range of our nanosensor vi (LOD value of 2.4 pg/ mL) sufficiently covers this clinical range, we expect that the CoPhMoRe nanosensor can diagnose the positive cases with a real saliva sample. For the S protein nanosensor, on the other hand, the sensor responses to the analyte were clearly diminished in saliva conditions with almost similar changes for the control \u2212S protein saliva and +S protein saliva samples (right, Figure 4a ). The attenuation of the highly glycosylated S protein nanosensor response seems to arise from the decreased baseline of the fluorescence with saliva background. 37, 38 One hypothesis for future exploration is that the salivary glycoprotein can adsorb onto the S protein nanosensor surface and reduce the baseline fluorescence intensity and block viral protein binding. The N protein, on the other hand, is phosphorylated, and the analyte-nanosensor interaction is not affected by glycoproteins present in saliva. 39 The nIR fluorescence spectra demonstrate that our N protein nanosensor shows almost identical responses in buffer and the 100% human saliva condition (Figure 4b ). This suggests that the PEG-phospholipid nanosensor passivation, built into this construct, enables at least partial reduction of nanosensor biofouling. 21 To demonstrate a form of the sensor compatible with diagnosis in a non-laboratory setting, we interfaced the nanosensors in this work into a Lab-on-Fiber system using a fiber-optic-based benchtop instrument to produce a sensor optode. All components, including the optode fiber, laser, nanosensors, nIR detectors, monitor, controller, and test solutions, can be compactly integrated onto a mobile cart (for example, left, Figure 4c ). The optode fiber is flexible, lightweight, and robust enough such that the tip can be applied to samples for diagnosis with an ease not found with conventional analytical tools. 40 We designed and fabricated 3D miniaturized sensor tips as interfaces that hold the SARS-CoV-2 nanosensor media and viral protein components stably onto the fiber optics using 3D printing and a developed template (Objet30 Prime, Stratasys Ltd). The sensing tip is engineered at a high resolution (mm-scale) in a specific 3D Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article architecture such that viral proteins can be sensitively detected even with low volumes of biofluid extraction (currently <10 \u03bcL). The printed 3D sensing tip was successfully integrated with the optode fiber by screwing onto an SMA (SubMiniature version A) connector and supported by an 8 mm cover glass slide for the Lab-on-Fiber SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis system (left, Figure 4c ). Figure 4d shows the real-time fluorescence response of the completed, fully-integrated optode fiber to SARS-CoV-2 N protein in buffer (top graph) and in 100% human saliva condition (bottom graph). A 5 \u03bcL viral protein solution was directly dropped onto the 3D printed sensing tip of the optode fiber, and the resulting sensor response was directly measured using the benchtop instrument. The optode fiber itself generates no response to pure buffer spiked with BSA but the expected rapid and sizable turn-off response to N protein in buffer with a 71.3% change in intensity. For the 100% saliva condition, the optode fiber appears to show a background quenching response to pure saliva (labeled \u2212SARS-CoV-2) with a 30% change, the origins of which are unclear at this time. However, saliva plus analyte (labeled +SARS-CoV-2) demonstrates a response of 85.7%, easily above the background and statistically significant. A response time (\u03c4 90 ) of 5.1 min was achieved based on the time to reach 90% of the nIR level at infinity. Overall, the platform appears rapid enough for SARS-CoV-2 detection with small biofluid volume additions and short response time such that nonlaboratory operation is possible. We are also interested in the development timeline and workflow necessary to generate a sensor for viral detection, starting from identification of the new viral target itself to deployable hardware ready for screening of the population.",

This sensor development depends on the design and selection of the proper corona phase. Thus, in cases where no commercial polymer or chemistry shows satisfactory sensitivity and/or selectivity toward the target analytes, the development timeline may be extended. We argue that it is a unique feature of this type of molecular recognition scheme making rapid design and testing possible, unhindered by the development time and supply chain requirements of a conventional antibody or enzymatic receptor. CoPhMoRe is also compatible with fully automated fluorescence screening hardware that connects seamlessly to a benchtop optics platform. This rapid development workflow holds several potential advantages for future viral targets. Based on this, we expect that our CoPhMoRe platform can be readily applied to a potential future pandemic with unknown viruses (Figure 5b ). If a new virus target begins to circulate, this workflow can generate a corona interface library and synthesize recognition candidates within a few days. Computational analysis can be used to Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article predict selectivity and sensitivity performance in advance of experimental validation. Then, the optimized nanosensor with selective recognition for the unknown viral target can be interfaced directly to the existing benchtop platform shown in Figure 4c . Thus, the sensor produced from the CoPhMoRebased sensor screening platform is potentially ready for field deployment in advance of a future pandemic. In addition, based on the sensing and diagnosis data, we can also construct the database of CoPhMoRe sensor library onto a variety of viruses. In this way, the workflow allows for a potential feedback loop for continual sensor development targeting new, emerging viruses, leveraging numerical modeling.",

Furthermore, the N protein sensor is shown to maintain functionality even in 100% human saliva.

The print was executed using \"high quality\" settings and VeroClear (PN: OBJ-04055, Stratasys) material with a minimum layer thickness of 16 \u03bcm. The prints were washed from the support material using an electric power washer (supplied by Stratasys). The resolution of 3D printer is X-axis: 600 dpi; Y-axis: 600 dpi; Z-axis: 1600 dpi; and accuracy is 0.1 mm (0.0039\u2033).",
