The issues and potential strategies comprise the following: (1) helping policymakers to generate business continuity plans, (2) maintaining the use of evidence-based interventions for people with SUDs, (3) being prepared for adequate medication supplies, (4) integrating harm reduction programs with other treatment modalities, and (5) having specific considerations for vulnerable groups such as immigrants and refugees.",

Lack of capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from COVID-19-related health consequences are related to individual vulnerability (3) .

PWSUDs are at a higher risk of psychiatric problems such as mixed affective states (7) ; vice versa, polysubstance use and alcohol use disorder are common among patients with bipolar disorders (8) . Moreover, PWSUDs experience underlying diseases that constitute risk factors for COVID-19 infection or can be exacerbated by it; for instance, long-term use of substances may cause cardiovascular problems (9) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10) . Such comorbidities may exacerbate superimposed COVID-19 symptoms and lead to higher mortality rates (11) . Poor immune system functioning is also prevalent in PWSUDs because of chronic alcohol and drug use and bloodborne or sexually transmitted illnesses (12) , poor nutritional status (13), and socioeconomic factors (14) . Among PWSUDs, people who inject drugs (PWIDs) are at exceptionally high risk of COVID-19, as well as overdoses, unsafe injections, and risky sex (15) .",

Our findings showed that 88% of respondents reported continuity of other necessary medical and psychiatric care compared to <60% who reported the existence of business continuity/contingency plans and enough availability and accessibility of treatment and harm reduction services for PWSUDs. These findings suggest that policymakers and health authorities in each country could have possibly made more appropriate decisions in order to protect at-risk and marginalized PWSUDs including those who may be homeless, have HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, or multiple and complex morbidities.

The responses obtained were intentionally based around personal opinions of addiction medicine experts to help understand the \"state of things in real life\" rather than objective epidemiological data, which would have been considerably delayed. Therefore, ethical approval has not been taken from each of the countries that participated in the survey. The limited number of respondents makes this information non-representative and possibly biased. In other words, the survey results might be subject to bias and not demonstrate a true reflection of addiction services in their countries. Hence, the findings (opinions) have a high chance of subjective biasing. Sampling bias is another limitation, and indeed due to sampling methodology, the participants were not necessarily oriented to all domains of the questionnaire. Given the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, the paper aims to alert and inform colleagues around the world and facilitate collaboration.

In our study, addiction medicine professionals reported that most of their countries did not provide early guidelines or protocols to tailor their services to the pandemic. It is important to consider that respondents in only one-third of low-income countries reported the availability of such guidelines compared to respondents in half of the high-income countries. Another survey (41) conducted in four high-income regions (New South Wales, Ireland, Scotland, New York State, and British Columbia) found that special guidelines in response to the new situation and assurance of continuity of the services were available very soon after the start of lockdown, which is consistent with our findings that high-income countries had a more timely response in this domain. In the absence of guidelines and protocols, clinicians and service providers may not effectively balance various competing ethical and professional issues when they are making clinical and operational decisions when many things may be happening that could potentially be conflicting in nature (e.g., maintaining stability but reducing therapeutic contacts). Guidelines also allow stakeholders to improvise and identify innovative ways through evidence-based solutions to decrease the dual burden of substance use and COVID-19 infection (42) . International organizations such as the WHO and United Nations Office of Drug Control (UNODC) and other related groups such as the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM), International Society of Substance Use Professionals (ISSUP), and World Federation Against Drugs (WFAD) should provide adequate support to raise policymakers' knowledge in the area of addiction medicine on how to establish business continuity committees during initial stages of pandemics in order to make advanced care planning decisions through effective leadership.",

Eighty-one percent of participating countries reported limitations in usage of any mobile and other outreach services due to lockdown policies for homeless PWSUDs, with respondents from 57% of participating countries reporting limitations in their harm reduction overdose services during the initial period of the pandemic. This was compounded with reported problems with the distribution of take-home naloxone as reported by respondents from 57% of participating countries. Finally, respondents from 54.8% of participating countries reported that there had been shortages at needle and syringe programs and/or of condom distribution. International organizations with regional and local government structures should create contingencies around adequate supplies of medications such as methadone and Buprenorphine.
