Statistical Analysis 143 We generated descriptive statistics to characterize our study population and responses to 144 survey questions. We also stratified respondents with respect to COVID-19 infection status 145 based on reported test status and symptomology. We compared COVID-19+ individuals that 146 were identified via the survey and via the EHR by demographics and severity (overnight 147 hospitalization and death). We investigated case status and hospitalization misclassification in 148 both the survey and EHR by comparing those who were discordant in the survey and EHR. We 149 calculated differences between groups using chi-square and t-test statistics for categorical and 150 continuous measures, respectively. As expected, due to very large sample size in the study, most 151 comparisons were statistically significant at a two-sided alpha < 0.05. Therefore, we focus results 152 and interpretation on effect sizes and corresponding standard error of the estimate. ",
