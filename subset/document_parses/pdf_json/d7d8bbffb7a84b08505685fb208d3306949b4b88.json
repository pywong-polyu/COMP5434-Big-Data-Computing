Moreover, 58.7% of patients had neurocognitive impairment in at least one function. Rates of positive screening for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were 29.6%, 26.8% and 25.1%, respectively. In addition, 39.1% of the patients had psychiatric morbidity. Low QoL for physical and mental components was detected in 44.1% and 39.1% of patients respectively.

In a national surveillance study with voluntary case notification, Varatharaj et al reported that 31% of patients had an altered mental status including neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive symptoms in the acute phase [12] . To the authors' knowledge, there are no previous studies in COVID-19 simultaneously evaluating neurocognitive function, psychiatric symptoms (including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] ) and quality of life (QoL) following the acute phase in survivors. To date, most of the studies focus on the mental health of the general population although it has been scarcely studied in COVID-19 survivors [13] .",

In a small study of COVID-19, one third of ICU survivors were found to have a dysexecutive syndrome [27] . In this regard, follow-up studies in other coronavirus outbreaks in the postacute stage may be informative. In a recent review of 40 such studies after resolution of acute infection, Rogers et al [5] reported substantial rates of memory impairment (44%). Our findings show a considerable prevalence for neurocognitive impairment (58.7%), immediate verbal memory/learning (38%), delayed verbal memory (11.8%), semantic verbal fluency (34.6%) and executive function (6.1%) in a mild-to-severe cohort. Previous studies have found similar neurocognitive outcomes in critically ill cohorts [19] . In our study, delirium and having concurrent psychiatric morbidity were linked to neurocognitive impairment. Delirium is a recognized risk factor for cognitive decline and reveals acute neurological damage that can persist over time [16, 17, 21] . Furthermore, psychiatric disorders with coexisting psychiatric morbidity such as PTSD and depression are associated with neurocognitive impairment [28] . Screening for delirium and psychiatric morbidity may be useful to identify vulnerable subjects. No other convincing associations were found in the analysis, such as severity, levels of systemic inflammation, thrombosis-related biomarkers, metabolic disorders, respiratory support or oxygenation. There was also no association with age, although it should be noted that the neurocognitive tests were age-adjusted. Additional factors or mechanisms not explored in this study may further explain neurocognitive decline, such as potential neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2, endothelial injury, blood-brain barrier disruption or neuroinflammation [29] .",

Therefore, no study has used neuropsychological tests to objectively establish cognitive deficits. All the selected tests were previously validated in the Spanish general population and widely used in other diseases. These tests included cut-off points for cognitive impairment or psychiatric screening. Moreover, confounding variables such as age and educational level were controlled in the case of cognitive performance. The study was performed in a wellcharacterized cohort and the high percentage of eligible patients who completed the assessment adds internal validation. Finally, very elderly patients and those with previous cognitive impairment or major psychiatric disorders were excluded. Further research on these more vulnerable patients is needed in the postacute phase and in the long term.",

These data have important clinical consequences and hence implications for health policies aimed to mitigate a wave of mental ill health following the current pandemic. Public health prevention, early detection, neurocognitive remediation and treatment of psychiatric symptoms should be prioritized in COVID-19 survivors which may ultimately lead to an improvement in QoL and daily functioning.",
