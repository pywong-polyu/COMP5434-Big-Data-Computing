Therefore, the FDA cleared CE marked NOWH RSV ELISA, the NucliSENSH EasyQ RSV A+B NASBA, and a literature based inhouse RT-PCR protocol were compared for their relative sensitivities. Thereby, NASBA turned out to be the most sensitive method with a total number of 80 RSV positive samples out of a cohort of 251 nasopharyngeal washings from patients suffering from clinical symptoms, followed by the inhouse RT-PCR (62/251) and ELISA (52/251). Thus, NASBA may serve as a rapid and highly sensitive alternative for RSV diagnostics.",

            "text": "Despite an increasing number of newly detected respiratory pathogen the human Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains the single most prevalent etiologic agent in pediatric viral respiratory tract infection [1, 2, 3] . RSV is responsible for the majority of episodes of acute wheezing triggered by infection [4] , bronchiolitis [5] and pneumonia [6] predominantly during the first 24 months of life. An estimated percentage of about 1-2% of all RSV-infected children require hospital care. The RSV-related hospitalization rate and the risk of severe complications are increased in prematurely born infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) [7] and in children with hemodynamically relevant congenital heart disease (CHD) [8, 9] , other forms of chronic lung disease or severe neuromuscular impairment [2] . Forster and coworkers estimated (95% confidence interval) a total of 26,524 (23,812-29,432) RSV-related hospitalizations per year in children under 3 years of age in Germany (i.e. 38% of all pediatric hospitalizations for viral lower respiratory tract infection) [10] . The same group calculated J2.772 as median total costs per hospitalised RSV-Infection [11, 12, 13] . Others recently calculated even higher costs [14] . Specific therapeutic agents with proven efficacy against RSV are still not available [1, 5] . Meticulous hand hygiene after patient contact together with other barrier precautions and rapid laboratory diagnostic are considered to be of utmost importance for the prevention of nosocomial transmission [16, 17] . Rapid laboratory detection of RSV is mainly performed by ELISA [17, 18] or by the use of nucleic acid amplification and detection methods. The latter methodology includes a high number of RT-PCR protocols, but for reasons of quality assurance in quality management systems the need for standardized nucleic acid amplification procedures with quality marks like the CE mark increases more and more. Recently, the NucliSENS EasyQ RSV A/B (bioMerieux, N\u00fcrtingen, Germany), a CE-labeled Nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) based kit for the rapid detection of RSV, became available. In search for options to optimize the rapid laboratory diagnostics of RSV we have compared this NASBA method with a published RT-PCR protocol and a rapid ELISA, the latter both used in our routine procedures for the detection of RSV.",

Thereby, the absolute assay specifity turned out to be $95%. For the NOWH RSV ELISA Cruz et al. [22] determined that the sensitivity was 81% and specificity 93.2%. Moreover, with our in house RT-PCR we have not yet any false positive as all detections were confirmed by sequencing (Simon, Schildgen et al., unpublished data) . It is commonly known that antibody based methods ELISA like for detection of RSV in clinical samples is less sensitive than nucleic acid amplification techniques [23] . However, the rapid results are of high importance for clinicians in order to initiate therapy and/ or isolation of the patients in order to avoid nosocomial outbreaks. In this earlier study which solely compared rapid ELISA methods, the NOWH RSV ELISA was found to be the most sensitive at least for the cohort of pediatric patients [17] with hands on time of about 10 to 20 min. However, taken into account the higher relative sensitivity and the acceptable predictive values accompanied by short hands on time and final results in nearly of 90 min, the NucliSENSH EasyQ NASBA may serve alternative method as it is both a fast but also a highly sensitive method. It thus should be taken into account whenever rapid and sensitive RSV diagnostics are required, such as in clinical setting involving high risk patients for which nosocomial outbreaks may be a fatal event.
