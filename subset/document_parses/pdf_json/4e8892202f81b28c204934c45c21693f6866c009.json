            "text": "At the end of February 2020, Italy faced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 , which spread quickly across most of Europe. After a decrease in detected cases in the summer, Europe faced the emergence of a second wave of COVID-19. In this context, the Italian government established a partial lockdown based on a new tiered system, classifying some areas with the highest rates of COVID-19 as high-risk red zones and maintaining preventive measures such as wearing a mask and social distancing. Previous studies on compliance with preventive measures during past epidemics and pandemics (e.g., Ebola virus disease, cholera, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, equine influenza, and Zika virus) found that factors related to compliance were knowledge of the disease [1, 2] , perceived effectiveness of the preventive measures [1, 3, 4] , social influence [1] , perception of risk [5] , concern for self and loved ones, and perceived severity compared to other epidemics [3, 6, 7] . Different studies have investigated the general population, e.g., [8] , psychiatric population, e.g., [9, 10] , and family patterns, e.g., [11] . However, few studies have investigated adolescents and young adults with ages ranging from a minimum of 15 to a maximum of 22, who may constitute a target group with possible lower compliance to public health measures, particularly with physical distancing measures [12] . However, adolescents had to face new stressors such as the fear of being infected; worrying about their parents' work (i.e., financial situation); death; restrictions on their privacy; sudden separation from schoolmates, friends, and teachers [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

The likelihood of being infected and experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms is underestimated by young people, although the spread of COVID-19 might depend on their behaviors.

Participants were asked to respond to questions indicating \"how often the situation described has occurred in the last seven days.\" All subscales are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (almost always).

Indeed, higher perceived selfefficacy to take preventive measures is associated with greater perceived severity of the COVID-19 disease. These data agree with the literature as risk perception is significantly related to COVID-19 severity and coronavirus self-efficacy [54] ; furthermore, this result seems to agree with evidence suggesting young people are less vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 [44] . These differences could be explained by previous knowledge of COVID-19's consequences in the CE group. The NCE group did not have direct experience with COVID-19 and therefore did not know what to expect. The NCE group perceives itself to be more effective at avoiding COVID infection as it has not yet had any experience and feels \"protected\" from the risk of infection. The results just discussed are also in line with further scientific literature. Indeed, people who believe that they are more vulnerable perceive a higher risk of infection and fear the virus and are also more likely to adopt preventive behaviors. This suggests that developing people's ability to cope with the impact of COVID-19 may increase the adoption of preventive behaviors. These findings suggest that risk perception, along with other factors, may influence the levels of individuals' preventive behaviors [1] .",

Therefore, we assumed that the CE group could consider COVID-19 infection as less serious and be more bothered by mandatory avoidance behaviors. This is confirmed by a strong positive correlation found in the CE group between the item \"How badly do you feel about wearing a mask and not being able to see the full expression on other people's faces\" and the depression dimension of the DASS-21 and strong negative correlations with the COVID-19 contagion prevention item and appropriate COVID-19 coping behaviors (i.e., \"Wash your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based solution\" and \"Avoid gatherings of large groups of people\"). Thus, we can hypothesize that since CE individuals consider COVID-19 to be less severe, they may experience more discomfort in strictly adhering to protective measures and that having direct experience with the disease may have generated a false perception of invulnerability.",

            "text": "With respect to the COVID-19 Prevention, Recognition and Home-Management Selfefficacy Scale, the older adolescent CE group had higher means for symptom recognition and home management of COVID-19. These data are quite clear; indeed, those who experienced COVID-19 felt more capable of recognizing the symptoms of infection (e.g., fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, etc.) and in the home management of those infected with COVID-19 including the following: avoiding all contact with other family members, sleeping alone and staying in a dedicated room, limiting movement in house's spaces in order to avoid meeting other people, periodically measuring oxygen saturation, taking medication to control symptoms, etc. Such differences could be explained by the information that is available to an individual on COVID-19. The NCE group has less information (only the information generally acquired from media), so they may feel less effective at handling the consequences of COVID-19. Although the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) states that self-efficacy is considered a robust predictor of various health-related behaviors [55, 56] , no significant differences were found between the CE and NCE groups in appropriate COVID-19 behaviors as measured by different survey items (e.g., \"Always keep a distance of at least three feet between myself and others\"). This can be explained by the coping-appraisal process (i.e., one of the three processes of PMT), which suggests coping as the sum of evaluations of the effectiveness and self-efficacy of responses minus any physical or psychological \"costs\" of adopting the recommended preventive response. Thus, our results, having been collected during the second wave, may reflect the habit of implementing certain types of protective behaviors regardless of having had experience with COVID-19.",

Self-efficacy seems to influence people's perception of themselves and may often be inconsistent with reality, resulting in a self-image that is too positive or too negative. Stress is related to low self-efficacy, that is, beliefs about the inability to master new or challenging tasks, perform a particular behavior, or exercise control over events [57, 58] . In the present study, people's self-efficacy in the prevention, detection of symptoms, and home management of COVID-19, when they had not experienced COVID-19, may have triggered a pattern in which perceived inefficacy is closely related to stress and depression. In fact, self-efficacy is an important dispositional resource that mitigates threat appraisals, state anxiety, and cortisol secretion [59] .",
