The Web of Science core collection database was retrieved for coronavirus articles published from 1 January 2000 to 17 March 2020. Duplicates and discrete papers were excluded. Analysis parameters including time, regions, impact factors, and citation times were processed through professional software. A total of 9043 coronavirus articles originated from 123 countries and were published in 1202 journals. The USA contributed most articles (3101) followed by China (2230). The research was published in specialized journals including the Journal of Virology. Universities were the main institutions of science progress. High-impact articles covered fields of basic science and clinical medicine. There were two sharp increases in research yields after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks.

It has aroused international public concern and has become a major medical issue [4, 5] . Within the past two decades, coronavirus infection has broken out recurrently and triggered three widespread epidemics: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China in 2002 [6] , the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [7] , and now, COVID-19. Pathogens of the above diseases are species in the genus of Betacoronavirus belonging to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales [8] . Collaborative research from epidemiology and etiology, including identifying pathogens, tracking sources, and clinical prevention and treatment including vaccines and antivirus medicine discovery, are urgent [9, 10] . Bibliometrics based on the mapping knowledge domain as a tool to evaluate the research outputs' characteristics has been widely adopted, and analysis results are capable of providing a comprehensive assessment of the quality and quantity of scientific yields [11, 12] .

The threshold of term usage was set to 10 before processing. Different clusters are shown in colorful spheres and lines (Figure 4a) , while a density map exhibits the research areas (Figure 4b) . The front size and color depth of a term reflect its usage density and connections [26] . In Figure 4a , the terms \"coronavirus\", \"MERS-CoV\", \"SARS\", and \"SARS-CoV\", which belong to the blue cluster, interact with the terms \"prevalence\" and \"evolution\" in the green cluster, \"disease\" and \"diagnosis\" in the yellow cluster, \"mice\" and \"central nervous system\" in the purple cluster, and \"mouse-hepatitis-virus\" and \"expression\" in the red cluster. In Figure 4b , the density of the term \"coronavirus\" is the highest, followed by \"infection\", \"SARS\", and \"expression\", which reflect the using frequency in articles. The terms \"vaccine\" and \"antiviral agents\" are of low frequency. Guided by cluster and density map combination, articles containing the above terms were extracted from the local database for exploration of the research hotspots and frontiers. Over the past two decades, research focused on coronavirus mainly includes five clusters. (1) The core cluster is the blue one, and concentrates on the biological and virologic characteristics of coronavirus, including essential factors of infection and transmission routes during the outbreaks of SARS and MERS, as well as clinical features. Infection probably spreads through an air-borne route and through close contact. Cases of infection could involve symptoms such as fever, cough, and consolidation of the lung [27] . (2) The red cluster: Some types of coronavirus spread among animals and humans. Laboratory contamination and particularly animal-to-human transmission could be brought by mouse hepatitis-virus (MHV), a kind of coronavirus that can cause infection of the central nervous system and suppress the immune system by influencing immunoglobulin excretion from the B cells of Peyer's Patch, some immune responses of which resemble pneumonia-associated coronavirus [28] . (3) The yellow cluster: Primary infection of coronavirus in mammals and birds is confined to the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal system. Seven different known strains of coronaviruses are capable of infecting humans, in which SARS-CoV, as a publicized human coronavirus, has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections involving bronchiolitis and pneumonia [29] . (4) The purple cluster: The entrance into human body of SARS-CoV depends on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, while the spike protein functions as the adaptor. Interferon-gamma participate in the immune-response acting as an antiviral agent. Medicine could be discovered according to these features [30, 31] . (5) The green cluster: The evolution based on the mutation of coronavirus RNA caused different symptoms to human kind. High-fidelity whole genome sequencing could be a detection method of mutation besides diagnosis of infection. Population of coronavirus epidemics is mainly young children and the elders, who are in the status of hypo responsiveness [32, 33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 563, "end": 567, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1860, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2319, "end": 2323, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2736, "end": 2740, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3061, "end": 3065, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3066, "end": 3069, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3423, "end": 3427, "text": "[32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3428, "end": 3431, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 404, "end": 415, "text": "(Figure 4a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 466, "end": 477, "text": "(Figure 4b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 573, "end": 582, "text": "Figure 4a", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 931, "end": 940, "text": "Figure 4b", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Terms Analysis and Mapping"}, {"text": ", and the infection spread and situation worsened and became a Public Health Emergency of International Concern soon thereafter [34] .

Scientific research cannot be considered to promote the advancement of knowledge unless they are published through peer review and editor checks [35] .
