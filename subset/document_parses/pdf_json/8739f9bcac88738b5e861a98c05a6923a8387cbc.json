It aimed to investigate the characteristics and effectiveness of teacher feedback on online business English presentations and also to explore EFL learners' attitudes toward teacher feedback. The participants were one class of 24 sophomores majoring in Business English. By analyzing data from transcriptions of teacher feedback on presentation rehearsals, assessment scores, questionnaires, and students' self-reflective journals, the study found that teacher feedback was focused on both content-and delivery-related components, but new sub-components were added to delivery-related teacher feedback, such as technology use, timing, and teamwork. It also proved the positive effect of teacher feedback on improving students' oral presentation quality in various aspects. Additionally, it was found the participants held quite positive attitudes toward teacher feedback. However, some issues also arose in an online learning context. Therefore, pedagogical implications were provided based on the research findings and in response to the challenges of online education.",

They also enable students to participate fully in their learning, demonstrate their ability to communicate, and help them prepare for their future work (Morley, 2001) . Many scholars have conducted research that centered on self-and peer assessment of oral presentations (e.g. Campbell et al., 2001; Cheng & Warren, 2005) and comparing the effectiveness of peer feedback and teacher feedback (e.g. Murillo-Zamorano & Montanero, 2018) . It was found that teacher feedback could bridge the gap between students' actual and desired performance (De Grez et al., 2012; Ko, 2019) and positively affect students' cognition, behavior and attitude towards presenting (Van Ginkel et al., 2017b) . Some other studies proved that a multimedia-based instructional intervention with embedded practice activities and evaluation feedback could enhance the students' oral presentation skills, despite that different dimensions were not affected equally by the multimodal system (De Grez et al., 2009; Ochoa & Dominguez, 2020; Van Ginkel et al., 2020) .",

As a consequence, feedback provided by teachers, regarded as essential moderator or facilitator in online learning process, has been attached more importance (Xin & Feenberg, 2006) .",

Wang et al. (2017) explored a Chinese EFL teacher's feedback on students' oral presentations. They found the teacher gave comments mainly on pronunciation, content, logical thinking, and PowerPoint design, but ignored such aspects as eye contact and vocal delivery. They also found that the teacher used the 'praise-criticism-suggestion' pattern to give feedback. Although the study only interviewed one teacher and lacked the analysis of the students' performance and corresponding teacher feedback, it explored the specific aspects that teacher feedback of oral presentations focused on. Regarding online presentations, it would be interesting to explore how teacher feedback could be modified to adapt to an online learning environment.",

Moreover, few studies have targeted the training of business English oral presentations, which require a combination of presentation skills and business knowledge. In addition, there is a lack of research making qualitative comparison of the EFL students' performance in giving online oral presentations before and after receiving teacher feedback, so as to examine the effectiveness of teacher feedback for improving students' online oral presentation ability. Furthermore, little research has been conducted to examine EFL students' attitudes toward online teacher feedback. The students' attitudes represent their preference for instructional interventions. When students express positive attitudes, their participation may increase, thus leading to greater progress in language learning .",

Before the formal assessment, the four assessors were trained by the researchers in terms of assessment criteria. A trial presentation was rated independently by four assessors to make sure they reached a consensus on the interpretation of the assessment criteria and scoring scales. Then all the presentations were rated by the assessors, who were not aware whether they rated a group's rehearsal or live oral presentation and were not told about the research purposes. To further reduce assessor effect, the assessors were divided into two pairs: one pair scored the rehearsals of Groups 1-3 and the live presentations of Groups 4-6; while the other scored vice versa. The average score given by a pair of assessors was the final score for each presentation. The inter-rater reliability coefficient score (Cronbach alpha: 0.882 for the first pair; 0.874 for the second) showed a high degree of consistency among the assessors.

The present study was an attempt to probe into the role of teacher feedback in an online learning context. The study revealed the Characteristics and Effectiveness of Teacher Feedback on Online Business English Oral Presentations characteristics of teacher feedback on EFL students' online business English presentations, and proved the positive effect of teacher feedback on improving students' oral presentation abilities in various aspects. Additionally, it was found that the participants held quite positive attitudes toward teacher feedback and agreed on the effectiveness of teacher feedback for improving their online oral presentation abilities. Similar to previous studies (e.g. De Grez et al., 2012; Van Ginkel et al., 2017a) , teacher feedback of the study was also focused on both content and delivery-related components. For content-related teacher feedback, it was closely connected with the business-relevant presentation materials, which followed the requirements of Bloom's Taxonomy (Krathwohl, 2002) . However, unlike face-toface presentations in classrooms, some new sub-components were added to delivery-related teacher feedback, such as technology use (e.g. controlling of PowerPoint sharing; making use of the camera), teamwork, and timing to ensure a smooth process of the online presentations. We agree that it is also important for teachers to provide detailed online feedback specifically relevant to pre-defined assessment criteria (Shute, 2008) and target the students' actual performance relative to the assessment sub-criteria of the task (Van Ginkel et al., 2015) .",

The scores rose in both content-and delivery-related aspects. Their improvement was likely attributed to the following reasons. First, detailed constructive teacher feedback was provided to each group, thus affording the students plenty of opportunity to reflect on and revise their presentations. According to Phye and Sanders (1994) , specific feedback has been proven to be more effective than general advice. In the students' reflective journals, quite a number of students mentioned that they revised their online presentations based on the teacher's specific feedback, which helped increase the quality of their presentations. Second, teacher feedback was given in an online conferencing session, where the students received immediate feedback that facilitated mutual communication between the teacher and students. Many studies have already suggested that immediate feedback has a greater impact on learning than delayed feedback (Epstein & Brosvic, 2002) . In addition, the students could also gain insights from their peers' presentations and teacher comments in live class, and then apply what they had learned to their own performance.",

The first issue is concerned with the delivery-related performance, such as the application of visual aids, technology use, presentation skills and manner of speaking. Although great efforts were made to improve the quality of the above-mentioned sub-scales, the mean scores were still lower than those of content-related sub-components. De Grez et al. (2009, p. 30 ) also found that the ''impact of the instructional intervention was especially useful for the 'content' factor, and performance indicators, such as eye contact and vocal delivery, proved harder to be influenced and/or changed during this short instructional intervention''. It is thus suggested that more systematic training on sub-scales be provided to the students to help enhance their delivery-related performance in online education. Apart from delivery, in content-related components, more problems were detected in terms of evaluation, which requires learners to give objective judgment and critical comments. However, the mean score of evaluation did not increase much, probably due to the fact that evaluation was the most difficult part of business oral presentations and needed more professional training.",

A more detailed analysis of online oral presentations can be made to further investigate the role of teacher feedback, and also compare the different attributes of online and offline oral presentations. Additionally, the study mainly focused on teacher feedback in online education during the COVID-19 pandemic where no other method of instruction was possible.
