The participants in this study included 251 Iranian students from Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). Structural equation modeling using AMOS 20.0 was used to analyze the data. The results indicated that there were significant relationships between optimism, dimensions of psychological well-being, and resilience among Iranian students of UPM. The study findings presented that self-efficacy mediated the relationship between dimensions of psychological well-being (environmental mastery, autonomy, selfacceptance, positive relations with others, personal growth, and purpose in life) and resilience among Iranian students of UPM. Furthermore, self-efficacy was not observed to mediate the influence of optimism on resilience among Iranian students of UPM. The study's findings help to understand the interrelationship between self-efficacy, various dimensions of psychological well-being, and resilience. Consequently, counselors, psychologists, and instructors can develop and plan valuable strategies to enhance students' psychological factors.",

According to a study conducted by Talebloo and Baki (2013) among Universiti Putra Malaysia students from Iran, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, faced various challenges during their studies. Furthermore, the Iranian Students' Association in UPM (ISAM) has stated that Iranian students at Universiti Putra Malaysia face numerous problems and challenges. The main concerns of the students stem from financial issues, communication problems, and academic difficulties. In this regard, international students need to experience a period of adjustment to various educational and social situations. Therefore, students must understand the importance of adjustment and its related factors (Misra et al., 2003) . In this respect, Mesidor and Sly (2016) indicated that the level of self-efficacy among international students was significantly related to students' psychological adjustment.",

Confidence in taking control over an individual's behavior, social environment, and motivation can reflect self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977) . Self-efficacy is a universal psychological need that controls an individual's cognition, emotions, and decisions related to psychological well-being (Komarraju and Nadler, 2013) . Consequently, self-efficacy is critical in stress management, influencing the stressor assessment, and the option and implementation of methods to deal with them (Villada et al., 2017) . As a result, people who have high self-efficacy see potentially challenging situations as opportunities rather than risks (Liu and Li, 2018) . Compared to people who have poor self-efficacy, they are more likely to use highly adaptive coping mechanisms (Chang and Edwards, 2015; Zhao et al., 2015) . Hence, self-efficacy is an essential personal resource for university students to prevent stressors and promote adaptive adjustment to this formative stage (Morton et al., 2014; Denovan and Macaskill, 2017) .",

Moreover, resilience characteristics are essential to effectively cope with change, and the best predictor of adjustment to the new environment among international students (Wang, 2017) . In this regard, Tusaie and Dyer (2004) expressed that resilient students could cope with the difficulties inherent in moving to a university in a foreign country, and succeed academically. Moreover, numerous researches suggest that resilience can be reinforce because it is not a \"hard-wired\" personality trait; instead, it is the consequence of the advancement of protective factors (Zimmerman and Arunkumar, 1994) . Many, empirical studies reveal that resilience varies across individuals, and may highly depend on many other psychological factors, such as optimism and psychological well-being (Poyrazli et al., 2004; Rosenthal et al., 2007; Yusoff and Chelliah, 2010; Sagone and De Caroli, 2014) .",

Although some models of self-efficacy and resiliency have been proposed, none of these models combined all these factors in a single study, and it is not known how this model fits the data in Asian countries.

The spiritual cluster of resiliency mainly involves cognitive competencies or belief structures. The variables are as follows: purpose in life, belief in uniqueness or oneself, independence, optimism, determination, and perseverance (Richardson et al., 1990) . According to Kumpfer (2002) , optimism is a cognitive factor, and highly resilient people apply optimistic characteristics to construct positive outcomes for themselves and others (Campbell et al., 1976; Murphy and Moriarty, 1976; Parker et al., 1990; Luthar and Zigler, 1991; Werner and Smith, 1992) . A self-efficacy cycle comprises several successes developed by creating small steps with an excellent chance for success. Increasingly resilient youths are partial toward an \"optimistic bias\" and \"latch on to any excuse for hope and faith in recovery\" (Murphy, 1987) . Other cognitive traits or processes that affect stimulate resilient people to positive success are believers in themselves and their specialness or uniqueness (Gordon and Song, 1994) . Gordon and Song (1994) stated that achieving success despite all difficulties was related to autonomous selfdirectedness in resilient people. The authors described such individuals as autonomous/maverick selves who could resist social pressures and prefer to participate in goal-directed activities. The existential meaning and having a goal in life help resilient people pass through difficulties and become survivors because they have faith in achieving their goals (Richardson et al., 1990) .",

Bandura (1986) improved the thinking concerning human functions to agree with the dominant role played by vicarious, cognitive, self-reflective, and self-regulatory processes in human change and adaptation. Based on this theoretical view, human functioning observes as an active interaction of environmental, behavioral, and personal effects. Among all the thoughts that stand at the very essence of social cognitive theory, and influence human functioning are self-efficacy beliefs: the judgment of individuals on their competencies to form and carry out actions to achieve a task. If individuals consider that their activities can yield the consequences they wish, they require little motivation to perform or deal with hardships. According to Bandura's SCT, human functioning depends on an active interaction of environmental, behavioral, and personal effects. Self-efficacy beliefs affect the individuals' choices and the sequences of acts that they follow. Furthermore, self-efficacy beliefs assist in regulating the extent of efforts individuals will exert to complete a task, the duration with which individuals face difficulties, and how they will confront the adverse circumstances. The highest sense of efficacy arises from the more significant effort, mastery, perseverance, motivation, and resilience (Bandura, 1989) .",

Ryff and Singer (2003) believed that maintaining mental and physical health, and the ability to recover faster from stressors characterize resilient individuals.

Building upon the psychological perspective (Bandura, 1986; Kumpfer, 2002) , the research focuses on the role of self-efficacy, as mediator. Cervone (2004) proposed a new cognitive model of personality; in the model, self-efficacy represents knowledge about one's abilities, which results in the appraisal of the future as positive (optimism), subsequently leading to good mental health. Karademas (2006) pointed out that high self-efficacy enhanced optimism and, subsequently, leads to better mental health; thus, optimism has been found to play a mediating role in the relationship between self-efficacy and depression (Karademas, 2006; Pu et al., 2016) . Furthermore, the previous rationale and available literature showing that optimism contributes to self-efficacy (Karademas, 2006; Lee et al., 2006; Pu et al., 2016) , and self-efficacy contributes to resilience (Speight, 2009; Keye and Pidgeon, 2013) . High self-efficacy is related to better well-being, and low self-efficacy is related to lower well-being levels (Caprara, 2002; Bandura et al., 2003) . Significantly, positive relationships between psychological well-being and self-efficacy have also been reported (Bahadori Khosroshahi and Hashemi Nosrat Abad, 2012) . Similarly, a significant positive relationship between academic self-efficacy and psychological well-being has also been observed (Asghari et al., 2014; Priesack and Alcock, 2015) . Koller and Hicks (2016) found that mental health professionals in Australia would show higher psychological capital levels (self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience). Moreover, they reported that this group showed higher psychological well-being levels (autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, relationship to others, purpose in life, self-acceptance).",

This result is in line with Bandura's (1977) findings, which show that mastery experience is the essential determinant of self-efficacy. One of the inseparable components of the autonomy of students is their self-efficacy beliefs. Bandura (1982) declared that learners' self-efficacy determined their performance since it affected their thoughts and motivation. Mojoudi and Tabatabaei (2014) revealed a relatively high correlation between upper intermediate students' self-efficacy and autonomy, suggesting that boosting upper intermediate student's self-efficacy will result in a considerable upturn in their autonomy.",

As shown in Table 2 , the results indicated that the AVE for all variables exceeded the cut-off value of 0.05 -psychological well-being (0.734), optimism (0.524), and resilience (0.542) -thus, indicating that the constructs explained (Hair, 2010) . Furthermore, construct reliability was assessed to confirm the measures' internal consistency through composite reliability (CR). A CR value of 0.7 and above proved that this study's measures possessed satisfactory internal consistency reliability. The results of composite reliability showed that all constructs had achieved the standard criterion of psychological well-being (0.892), optimism (0.868), and resilience (0.892), indicating high consistency reliability of the instrument. Besides that, Fornell and Larcker (1981) approach was used to assess the constructs' discriminant validity. Discriminant validity ensures that a construct is genuinely distinct from other constructs in the model. The square root of AVE was compared with the correlations of latent variables. As a rule of thumb, AVE's square must be greater than the correlation value of any other construct in the model (Fornell and Larcker, 1981) .

Table 5 indicates that the direct model (linking all dimensions of psychological well-being to resilience) showed a statistically significant effect (\u03b2 = 0.549, p < 0.000). Moreover, the full mediation model (linking all dimensions of psychological well-being to resilience through self-efficacy) had a significant effect (\u03b2 = 0.421, p < 0.000). The indirect impact of environmental mastery, autonomy, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, personal growth, and purpose in life on resilience was also significant. Furthermore, the direct model (linking optimism to resilience) was not statistically significant (\u03b2 = 0.238, p < 0.000). According to Table 5 , zero is not within the range of lower and upper bounds. Therefore, based on the decision criteria, self-efficacy mediated the influence of environmental mastery, autonomy, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, personal growth, and purpose in life on resilience.

The results showed a significant relationship between optimism, components of psychological well-being, and resilience, supporting hypotheses 1 and 2. The findings are in line with some other studies that observe the relationship between optimism, components of physiological well-being, and resilience (Agarwal and Malhotra, 2019; Bano and Pervaiz, 2020; Maheshwari and Jutta, 2020) . It seems there is an interactive relationship between optimism, psychological well-being, and resilience. As the findings illustrate, students having a positive attitude are more likely to control their surroundings, and greater faith in their ability to respond to and resolve obstacles. In other words, positive attitudes about life and future improve resilience or the willingness to deal with hardship and difficult circumstances.",

This study has conducted a comprehensive review based on the theory and constructs that are less explored in this topic's research theory. The result have led to the development of a new model of variables that contribute to resilience with the mediating role of self-efficacy among Iranian students. The model provides complete knowledge of the topic while simplifying the understanding of the situation for both researchers and practitioners. This research is a systematic attempt to contribute to a deeper understanding of these theories, although there is still room to improve and add more knowledge to this stream. Practically, the research on self-efficacy and resilience has revealed that there has been a tendency for the psychology discipline to neglect crucial human adaptation and development. It instead focuses on potential; this approach should change. Hopefully, the findings of this study provide an overview of the challenges faced by Iranian students, and support them accordingly. The notion of self-efficacy and resilience has significant implications in educational psychology in five main domains: assessment, intervention, consultation, research, and training. Since self-efficacy and resilience, and their related factors can be learned and taught as a skill, the authorities in charge of international students in universities and organizations are responsible for regulating the policies to enhance students' ability to deal with the challenges. Therefore, related informative workshops and seminars should improve students' knowledge and understanding concerning self-efficacy, resilience, and relevant factors. In this respect, there are various projects and strategies available to develop, nurture and teach skills. For instance, self-efficacy training for international students (SETIS) is based on social cognitive theory, which is adequate in describing this phenomenon and recommending strategies to improve students' self-efficacy. The implementation of SETIS meets a standard procedure for performing successful training, including a need assessment and a post-training assessment. Moreover, a training program called the Road to Resilience developed by American Psychological Association trains students to build resilience or \"strengthen the mental muscle that everyone has, \" using \"bounce back\" strategies. These may include: have a friend and be a friend, set new goals and plan to reach them, take charge of your behavior, look on the bright side, and believe in yourself.",

(1) Mastery Experience: the way students perceive and analyze obtained outcomes, as well as how these interpretations were used to update and establish self-beliefs of competence. (2) Vicarious Experiences of observing others: seeing or hearing similar individuals achieve success encourages students to feel that if others can do it, so can they. (3) Modeling Experiences: those are the people students look up to, respect, and aspire to be like. Their deeds, values, and accomplishments teach and persuade students to do the same. (4) Emotional and Physical Experiences: self-efficacy is strongly affected by student's mental Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org and physical states. Positive experiences and happiness make students feel good about themselves. In contrast, negative experiences and tension make students feel insecure. Students should be aware of the strategies to enhance their self-efficacy and apply them in their lifestyle and attitude. This study demonstrates the self-efficacy and resilience pattern to help alleviate some of the students' challenges and social-emotional adjustment. The awareness can encourage students to successfully deal with unfamiliar situations throughout not only their education, but also their life.",
