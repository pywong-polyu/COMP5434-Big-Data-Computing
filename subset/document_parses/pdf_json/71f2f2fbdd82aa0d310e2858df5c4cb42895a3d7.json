We minimize the contact of patients by increasing the period of surgical activity, scheduling the patients' arrival in a specific time, and admitting the patients to the operating room with intervals of 45 minutes, instead of being prepared in groups. Furthermore, routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-COV-2 was implemented as part of the preoperative evaluation.",

The main outcome measure was the rate of reduction in urgent and elective surgeries performed. Priority was given to patients with retinal disease, glaucoma, pediatric patients, and patients with corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) ( 20/200) in binocular or CDVA ( 20/60) in monocular patients.",

Preoperative PCR testing for all patients who undergo CPS in conjunction with strict hospital protocols might allow tackling the cataract surgery backlog. ",
