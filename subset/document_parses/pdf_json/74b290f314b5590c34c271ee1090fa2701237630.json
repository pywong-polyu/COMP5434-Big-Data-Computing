Here, we systematically explored the transcriptional regulators of inflammatory cytokines involved in the COVID-19 CRS to identify candidate transcription factors (TFs) for therapeutic targeting using approved drugs. We integrated a resource of TF-cytokine gene interactions with single-cell RNA-seq expression data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells of COVID-19 patients. We found 581 significantly correlated interactions, between 95 TFs and 16 cytokines upregulated in the COVID-19 patients, that may contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. Among these, we identified 19 TFs that are targets of FDA approved drugs. We investigated the potential therapeutic effect of 10 drugs and 25 drugs combinations on inflammatory cytokine production, which revealed two drugs that inhibited cytokine production and numerous combinations that show synergistic efficacy in downregulating cytokine production. Further studies of these candidate repurposable drugs could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat the CRS in COVID-19 patients.",

Most COVID-19 cases are either asymptomatic or cause only mild disease (Gandhi et al., 2020) .

            "text": "There is an urgent need for therapies to treat the CRS in COVID-19 patients. While government agencies and private companies have accelerated procedures to develop and distribute COVID-19 vaccines, it will take a year or longer for the population to be vaccinated. Additionally, a significant portion of the population may not get vaccinated due to reduced compliance and limited access to vaccines, or may not mount a proper protective response (e.g., immunodeficient patients). Furthermore, whether the vaccines generate a long-lasting protective response in all patients is still unknown. Since drug development and approval may take years, drug repurposing of already approved drugs is an efficient approach to identify alternative therapeutic options. At present, three repurposed drugs, remdesivir, dexamethasone, and baricitinib (in combination with remdesivir), have been found to benefit COVID-19 patients in large, controlled, randomized, clinical trials (Beigel et al., 2020; Kalil et al., 2020; Horby et al., 2021) . Dexamethasone, which acts as an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, also known as NR3C1) transcription factor (TF), is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid (Cronstein et al., 1992) . Indeed, corticosteroids have been shown to suppress CRS (Lee et al., 2014) , and NR3C1 has been shown to transcriptionally downregulate many inflammatory cytokines overexpressed in COVID-19 patients, such as CCL2, IL1B, and IL6 Sasse et al., 2016) . Baricitinib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, acts as a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor . The JAKsignal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway leads to the transcription of inflammatory cytokines, thus inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines. Despite the efficacy of these drugs in reducing COVID-19 mortality, the effect-size is modest, suggesting the need for additional drugs or combinations to treat the CRS in COVID-19 patients. Although antibodies are well-proven strategies to block cytokine activity, approved antibodies are available for only nine cytokines [DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2018) ], specifically TNF and various interleukins (ILs). However, the COVID-19 CRS primarily manifests in overproduction of chemokines (i.e., CCLs and CXCLs) (Liao et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Thus, as cytokines are highly transcriptionally regulated, there is great potential in exploring other transcriptional regulators of inflammatory cytokines involved in the COVID-19 CRS that can be targeted with approved drugs.",

To identify TF-cytokine pairs correlated in expression, we integrated a published resource of 2,260 empirically tested TF-cytokine gene interactions (CytReg v2) (Santoso et al., 2020) with publicly available scRNA-seq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from nine COVID-19 patients (GSE145926) (Liao et al., 2020) and four healthy controls (GSE145926 and GSE128033) (Morse et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2020) . Unsupervised clustering analysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed distinct clusters of ciliated epithelial cells, secretory epithelial cells, natural killer cells, neutrophils, macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, and plasma cells, identified by signature genes (Supplementary Figures S1A,B ). For each cell type, we identified cytokines that were significantly (Padj < 0.05) upregulated in the COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (Supplementary Table S1 ), and then determined the TFs in CytReg v2 reported to functionally regulate or bind to the transcriptional control regions of these cytokines. To prioritize TFs that may have a role in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 CRS, we generated gene regulatory networks for TFcytokine interactions that are significantly correlated across single cells in each cell type (Supplementary Table S2 ) in the COVID-19 patient BALF samples.",

Strikingly, 567 (97.6%) interactions displayed a positive correlation, suggesting that the cytokine upregulation is primarily mediated through activation by transcriptional activators rather than through de-repression by transcriptional repressors. The transcriptional activation could be a result of activated signaling pathways impinging on the TFs or increased TF expression. Indeed, 89 (93.7%) TFs were significantly upregulated in at least one cell type in the COVID-19 patients, many of which are known to be activated by signaling pathways in inflammation. Consistent with this, TFs in 336 of 395 (85.1%) positively correlated interactions that have a regulatory function reported in CytReg v2 were reported to activate expression of the target cytokine gene in various inflammatory contexts (Santoso et al., 2020) .

IRFs and STATs play prominent roles in viral infection by regulating interferon (IFN) production and response pathways and potentiating the expression of antiviral genes including inflammatory cytokine genes (Tamura et al., 2008; Park and Iwasaki, 2020) . Indeed, dysregulation of the IFN pathways either by inborn errors or the generation of autoantibodies against type I IFNs has been associated with COVID-19 severity Zhang et al., 2020) . However, the robust interferon response observed in many severe COVID-19 patients also likely contributes to the CRS (Israelow et al., 2020; Lee and Shin, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Thus, the upregulation of IRF2, IRF7, and STAT, in all cell types may be driving the amplification of IFN response pathways and thereby the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to COVID-19 CRS pathogenesis. Consistent with this, inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling with baricitinib significantly improved recovery time and survival rates among patients with severe COVID-19, likely by suppressing the CRS Stebbing et al., 2021) .",

Similar to NF-\u03baB TFs, AP-1 TFs (FOS and JUN) are critical regulators of inflammatory cytokine genes such as CCL2 and IL6 (Akira et al., 1993; Martin et al., 1997) , which are expressed at high levels in COVID-19 patients (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Merad and Martin, 2020) .

Since TLR7/TLR8 recognize single-stranded RNA from viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and TLR4, a receptor that recognizes various endogenous and exogenous proteins which was predicted to strongly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (Choudhury and Mukherjee, 2020) , activation of these TLR signaling pathways can partially mimic the inflammatory response in COVID-19. We found two drugs, dimethyl fumarate and T5224, that inhibited the production of CCL2, CXCL8, and IL6 ( Figures 2C-D) . This confirms that targeting TF hubs has the potential to concomitantly limit the production of multiple cytokines upregulated in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, testing all pairwise drug combinations revealed 11 combinations that synergistically reduced the production of at least one cytokine in either stimulated conditions in all PBMC donors ( Figures 2C-D) . In particular, the combination of dexamethasone with sulfasalazine or T5224 most consistently produced a synergistic effect in reducing cytokine production across the PBMC donors. This may be attributed to these drugs targeting TFs in parallel inflammatory pathways. Collectively, we identified multiple candidate repurposable drugs for the potential treatment of COVID-19 CRS.

To explore the therapeutic potential of targeting NRs to reduce the expression of cytokines elevated in COVID-19 patients, we first identified cytokines that were significantly upregulated (Padj < 0.05, fold change \u22652) in the BALFs of moderate ( Figure 3A ) and severe ( Figure 3B ) COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (Liao et al., 2020) .

Indeed, TF targets of some of these drugs, for example NR3C1 and VDR, have been reported to directly regulate CCL2, CXCL8, and IL6 expression in other stimulated contexts (Masood et al., 2000; Kadiyala et al., 2016; Sasse et al., 2016) . We found that dexamethasone and mometasone, both of which target NR3C1, most potently reduced the production of CXCL8 and IL6 ( Figures 4C-D) . Additionally, testing all pairwise combinations revealed that all 10 drug combinations either additively or synergistically reduced the production of CCL2 and CXCL8 in all PBMC samples stimulated with R848 ( Figure 4C) . Generally, across the PBMC samples, combinations of dexamethasone with rosiglitazone and mometasone with ercalcitriol most consistently produced a synergistic effect in reducing cytokine production, while combinations of dexamethasone or mometasone with ercalcitriol most potently reduced cytokine production. Overall, these findings suggest there may be potential therapeutic benefits of repurposing these NR drugs to suppress the CRS in COVID-19 patients. Further studies are required to determine the clinical benefits of these drug candidates.",

In particular, synergistic combinations allow the use of lower doses to achieve the same effect as the individual drugs, which may reduce adverse reactions. Notably, nearly all drugs we tested achieved a similar or stronger suppression of cytokine production when used at a 10-fold lower dose in combination than when used individually. This includes the combination of dexamethasone with ercalcitriol (active metabolite of vitamin D). Thus, in the debate of whether vitamin D supplementation has beneficial Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 673485 effects in the treatment of COVID-19, at least from the perspective of treating the CRS, vitamin D may enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone. Aside from having well-known anti-inflammatory properties, some of the drugs tested also have reported antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. Dimethyl fumarate, mometasone, calcitriol, and sulfasalazine, potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro in Vero E6 cells (Han et al., 2020; Matsuyama et al., 2020; Mok et al., 2020; Olagnier et al., 2020) . The antiviral activities of Glycyrrhizin have been extensively studied in the context of other human viruses and most notably, the drug was found to potently suppress replication of two clinical isolates of SARSassociated coronavirus in Vero cells (Cinatl et al., 2003) , and preliminarily, neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the viral main protease (van de Sand et al., 2021) . Further, Carvedilol and Acetaminophen have been reported to decrease the expression of ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2, respectively (Zarubin et al., 2020; Skayem and Ayoub, 2020) , both of which are required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells . Hence, drug combinations that simultaneously exert both antiinflammatory and antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 may have the greatest potential to be effective in treating COVID-19.",

As more scRNA-seq data from COVID-19 patients become available (Ren et al., 2021) , analyzing additional datasets could validate our findings. Importantly, although all the drugs investigated in this study are FDA approved, careful evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and risk-benefit balance of these drugs in animal models and COVID-19 patients is necessary as outcomes of drug interactions could drastically differ between in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials. Nonetheless, the candidate drugs show promise for further investigation in downregulating the CRS in COVID-19 patients. More broadly, the findings reported here may also be applicable to CRS resulting from other viral infections, bacterial infections, sepsis, and CAR-T therapies.",

Purified PBMCs were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (100X) and plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml and 0.1 ml/well.

The data in Figure 2 were obtained from frozen PBMCs and the data in Figure 4 were obtained from fresh PBMCs. Fresh and frozen PBMCs were tested by trypan blue viability assay and only used when the viability was >90%. PBMCs were pretreated with Acetaminophen (MiliporeSigma), Dexamethasone (MiliporeSigma), Ercalcitriol (Tocris), Mometasone (Tocris), or Rosiglitazone (Tocris), at the various concentrations for 30 min, and then stimulated with R848 (1 \u00b5M) or LPS (100 ng/ml) for 20 h. The supernatants were collected and the amounts of CCL2, CXCL8, and IL6, were quantified by ELISA. Fresh and frozen PBMCs, from PBMC donor 1, untreated and treated with the various drugs exhibited similar cytokine levels (data not shown). Each experimental condition was tested in four biological replicates or PBMC donors, and each experimental condition was performed in two technical replicates for each PBMC donor. The average of the replicates was used to determine cytokine expression.",

Thus, a CDI 1.0 indicates an additive interaction, a CDI < 1.0 indicates a synergistic interaction, and a CDI > 1.0 indicates an antagonistic interaction.

While antibodies are well-proven strategies to block cytokine activity, approved antibodies are available for only a few cytokines. Targeting the transcriptional regulators of cytokines involved in the CRS provides an alternative strategy that also allows for the concomitant downregulation of multiple cytokines. In the present study, we explored drugs that target transcriptional factors of cytokine genes overexpressed in COVID-19 patients. We identified two drugs that individually potently suppressed cytokine production, and 25 drug combinations that could synergistically suppress cytokine production. Altogether, our findings provide several promising candidate drugs and targets with potential therapeutic effects for controlling the CRS in COVID-19.",

The search criteria included Omics Category: Transcriptomics, Module Category: Nuclear receptors-all families, Biosample Category: Human-all physiological systems, FDR Significance Cut-off: 0.05. The search results were downloaded as a table reporting the fold change for cytokine gene expression in experimental vs. control conditions.Only experiments involving small molecule NR drugs were further explored in our analysis. If there were multiple experiments for a drug-cytokine interaction, only interactions wherein at least 80% of the experiments resulted in cytokine gene expression changing in the same direction were included in our analysis. Finally, for each drugcytokine interaction, we calculated the median fold change in cytokine gene expression across the experiments and depicted the data in a heatmap.",
