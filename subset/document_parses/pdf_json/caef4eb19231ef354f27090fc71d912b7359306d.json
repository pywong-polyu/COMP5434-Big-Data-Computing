            "text": "Introduction: To address cardiovascular (CV) complications and their relationship to clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 196 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective single-center cohort study from September 10, 2020, to December 10, 2020, with a median age of 65 years (IQR, 52-77). Follow-up continued for 3 months after hospital discharge. Results: CV complication was observed in 54 (27.6%) patients, with arrhythmia being the most prevalent (14.8%) followed by myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and deep vein thrombosis in 15 (7.7%), 12 (6.1%), 10 (5.1%), 8 (4.1%), and 4 (2%) patients, respectively. The proportion of patients with elevated high-sensitivity troponin I, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was greater in the CV complication group. Severe forms of COVID-19 comprised nearly two-thirds (64.3%) of our study population and constituted a significantly higher share of the CV complication group members (75.9% vs 59.9%; P = 0.036). Intensive care unit admission (64.8% vs 44.4%; P = 0.011) and stay (5.5 days vs 0 day; P = 0.032) were notably higher in patients with CV complications. Among 196 patients, 50 died during hospitalization and 10 died after discharge, yielding all-cause mortality of 30.8%. However, there were no between-group differences concerning mortality. Age, heart failure, cancer/autoimmune disease, disease severity, interferon beta-1a, and arrhythmia were the independent predictors of all-cause mortality during and after hospitalization. Conclusion: CV complications occurred widely among COVID-19 patients. Moreover, arrhythmia, as the most common complication, was associated with increased mortality.",

COVID-19 is known by its pulmonary manifestation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is considered as the main cause of mortality. However, soon after, a growing body of literature directed attention to cardiac involvement. Underlying cardiac disease or hypertension is shown to be the major risk factor of poor prognosis. [1] [2] [3] Recent reports have indicated that a considerable portion of patients experience a cardiac injury, ranging from 7.2% to 22 .2%, which is linked to higher mortality. 3 Nevertheless, previous studies have exclusively focused on the cardiac injury defined as a raised cardiac marker without a definitive diagnosis. To our knowledge, the present retrospective cohort study is the first study to comprehensively address cardiovascular (CV) complications and related outcomes in COVID-19 patients.",

The study recruiting period was from September to December 2020, and 196 patients participated in this study. We enrolled adult patients admitted to our hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and a consultation requested from the cardiology department. A confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 is defined as a positive result of the Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test for a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Reasons for requesting a consultation were raise of cardiac markers, dyspnea, electrocardiography (ECG) changes, chest pain, and underlying cardiovascular diseases in 53 (27%), 34 (17.4%), 19 (9.7%), 13 (6.6%), and 4 (2%) cases, respectively. Also, the reason of consultation was not mentioned in 73 (37.3%) cases. All decisions for requiring consultations in the current study were made by a single attending infectious disease specialist and were provided by a single cardiologist. The decision for whether or not to request a consultation from a cardiologist was based on developing signs and symptoms related to the CV system, alterations in cardiac markers, ECG findings, and, eventually, the clinical judgment of the attending physician. Patients who left the hospital against medical advice or had incomplete data were excluded.",

Indications for echocardiography have been defined by the Iranian Society of Echocardiography as following: shock, new arrhythmia, cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion observed in computed tomography, elevated cardiac markers, significant changes in ECG, generalized edema, and new clinical alterations unexplainable by COVID-19. All transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) assessments were performed by a single cardiologist, who was provided with personal protective gear according to national guidelines. The dedicated ultrasound machine for COVID-19 patients was a General Electric Vivid 7. A Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging was performed for patients with high suspicion of myocarditis. Cardiac biomarkers and ECG findings were collected on the same day of TTE.",

We have only considered patients with new-onset cardiovascular structural and/or functional abnormality during their hospital course in the CV complication group. New echocardiographic changes during hospitalization had been distinguished from preexisting abnormalities by the cardiologist. In all cases, we distinguished preexisting and existing abnormalities by reviewing the patient's medical records including the latest ECG or echocardiography related to the time before hospitalization. CV complication category included ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) defined as an elevation in cardiac biomarkers and ST-segment with the further establishment of angiography results, other acute coronary syndromes (ACS), new-onset arrhythmia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), and myocarditis. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) was defined by signs and/or symptoms of HF with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226550% and normal ventricular size along with evidence of abnormal LV filling and elevated filling pressures based on imaging or laboratory findings. 4 Criteria for diagnosis of a clinical case of myocarditis were signs and/or symptoms with changes in cardiac biomarkers or echocardiographic findings suggestive for myocardial inflammation in case of absence of coronary involvement using invasive or noninvasive imaging methods. Reference is cited at the end in the manuscript. 5 Non-CV complications included ARDS, acute kidney injury (AKI) as per Berlin and Improving Global Outcomes definitions, respectively, and sepsis. Patients with a respiratory rate of \u2265 30 breaths/min, resting fingertip oxyhemoglobin saturation \u226493%, shock, and those who required ICU admission or inotropic administration were defined as severe cases according to the national guideline for the management of COVID-19 patients (version 9) released by the National Ministry of Health of Iran. Our primary outcome of interest was the overall all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes of interest were ICU admission, hospital stay, need for invasive and/or non-invasive ventilation, and readmission. Patients who showed improved clinical signs and symptoms with normal body temperature and resolved radiographic features with two consecutive negative results of RT-PCR for COVID-19 fulfilled the discharge criteria and left the hospital. The follow-up period for out-of-hospital mortality, complications, and readmissions was three months after hospital discharge.",

However, the literature fails to specify the type and prevalence of injuries. 3, 7, 8 The study of Shi et al showed that 19.7% of 416 patients experienced a cardiac injury, which held a direct correlation with higher severity and an independent association with mortality (adjusted HR 4.26). 7 Another study with 187 patients reported a heightened in-hospital mortality rate in cases with high Troponin-T levels (37.5%) compared to those with a normal level (7.62%). This difference was even more profound when a high Troponin-T level was accompanied by an underlying CV condition (69.44%). 6 Wang et al found a higher proportion of myocardial injury in severe patients (22.2% vs 7.2%) and confirmed We used a univariate Cox regression analysis to assess possible factors associated with higher mortality. Age, history of heart failure, history of cancer/autoimmune disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, in-hospital treatment with inotropic, atazanavir, heparin, and interferon beta 1-a, antibiotic therapy, and severity were significant factors with a p-value < 0.1 that further entered in the multivariate analysis. its relationship with all-cause mortality. 3 We also observed a notable increase in the rate of elevated Troponin-I and NT-proBNP in patients with CV complications, which, per se, indicates a higher prevalence of acute cardiac injury in this group. In line with previous reports, severity, ICU admission and stay were significantly higher in patients with CV complications than those without. However, contrary to most reports, there were no significant between-group differences for mortality. COVID-19 is a systemic disease mostly manifested with pulmonary symptoms. Yet, several mechanistic pathways contribute to a wide range of CV involvements. Inflammation is the primary recognized mechanism. After activation of pulmonary macrophages, a large number of cytokines are released, which enter into the circulatory flow. As such, both inner and adoptive immune systems get activated, leading to the infiltration of mononuclear cells into the myocardium. 9 In this regard, multiple reports have shown acute myocarditis as a serious complication of COVID-19; nevertheless, the prevalence has remained uncertain. [10] [11] [12] Consistently, we found 15 cases of myocarditis and higher levels of ESR and CRP in patients with CV complications.",

Moreover, the disruption of myocardial circulation is boosted by the dysfunction of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (ACE2) on pericytes, which play an important role in maintaining endothelial function. 16 thereby leading to common ischemic and/or thrombotic events seen in COVID-19. 13 Similarly, ischemic/thrombotic events (17.3%) are the most frequent complication occurring in our study when we consider MI, ACS, CVA, and DVT as a single subgroup.",

The study of Szekely et al examined 100 consecutive patients with COVID-19 with complete echocardiography within 24 hours of admission, finding that the most common pathology was RV dysfunction (39%), while LV diastolic and systolic dysfunctions were present in 16% and 10% of cases, respectively. LV diastolic and RV dysfunctions were impaired in the majority of patients, and only RV dysfunction was linked to higher Troponin levels. 17 Another study investigated 1,216 patients from 69 countries, reporting that 55% of cases had an abnormal echocardiogram and that the rate of LV dysfunctions (39%) was greater than that of RV dysfunctions (33%). However similar to the previous study, only RV dysfunctions were independently associated with increased levels of cardiac markers and higher disease severity. 18 In contrast, we observed that LV diastolic dysfunction was significantly more common in patients with CV complications while the difference regarding RV dysfunction was not remarkable. The contradiction between earlier reports and the present study can be explained by our higher prevalence of severe cases and the different pool of patients (patients with suspicioned CV complications). We presume that newonset LV dysfunctions during the clinical course may be a more specific predictor of CV complications, while RV dysfunctions is caused by pulmonary hypertension due to more severe lung infections and may be linked to increased release of cardiac markers as a result of increased right atrial wall pressure. However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.",

            "text": "Drawing upon the findings of Dweck et al. 's study, where performing echocardiography in COVID-19 led to changes in management and level of care in 33% of the cases, including ICU admission and hemodynamic support, we may justify the comparable mortality rate between the two groups of our study by the higher level of care, including ICU admission and stay, received by patients with CV complications. 18 Our results cast new light on arrhythmia as an independent risk factor for death. Although studies that specifically aim to investigate arrhythmia in COVID-19 are lacking, there is limited evidence showing the association of arrhythmia with cardiac injury and disease severity. 3, 6 In the study of Wang et al arrhythmia was the second serious complication after ARDS, and its rate was increased in patients admitted in ICU (44.4%) compared to those in a general ward (16.7%). 3 Also, a cohort study with 393 COVID-19 patients reports a higher rate of atrial arrhythmias among individuals with invasive mechanical ventilation (17.7%) versus those with non-invasive ventilation (1.9%). 19 Similarly, an analysis on 115 cases (69 in the ICU and 46 in the general ward) observed new-onset atrial tachyarrhythmia in 16.5% of the study population, all admitted in the ICU. 20 Systemic and myocardial inflammation, metabolic disturbances, ischemic events, and overactivation of the sympathetic system can be potential underlying mechanisms that contribute to the incidence of arrhythmia. Even after discharge, cardiac injury may cause scar formation in the myocardium and subsequent conduction disorders, leading to the incidence of out-of-hospital arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death as proved by the study of Baldi et al in Italy who showed an increase (52%) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests compared to the same timeframe before the pandemic. 21 There are conflicting results upon administration of Interferon in COVID-19 patients. As a biological antiviral agent, Interferon beta 1-a is now a leading candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 patients due to its beneficial effects seen in multiple reports and clinical trials. 22, 23 On the other hand, some reports have failed to show any association between Interferon use and improved clinical outcomes. Alternatively, some reports mention increased mortality and delayed recovery upon late administration of Interferon-alpha, while its early administration was accompanied by improved outcomes. 24, 25 In our study, inhospital treatment with Interferon beta-1a was a strong predictor of all-cause mortality. The clinical course in COVID-19 consists of two phases: 1-early viral replication phase and 2-late cytokine release phase. From this standpoint and according to the results of previous reports, it seems that Interferon-based treatment is effective when administered in an early phase and for less severe patients. Unfortunately, the timing of administration was not evaluated in our study. However, there were more severe cases in our study population. Our study had some limitations. First, the study design was retrospective. Second, we only included patients whose attending physician had requested for cardiology consultation. Although both the attending physician and the cardiologist remained unchanged during the study period, the decision for whether to request a consultation or not is a potential bias. Future investigations with larger sample sizes and on consecutive patients are recommended to further confirm the results of our study.",
