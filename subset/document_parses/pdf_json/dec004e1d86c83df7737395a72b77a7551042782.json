Although a few studies have assessed these topics in a laboratory setting, little is known about the magnitude of discomfort and the level of exertion experienced by workers while they deliver health care to patients for prolonged periods. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of discomfort and level of exertion experienced by health care workers while wearing respiratory protection for periods up to 8 hr when performing their typical occupational duties. This project was a multiple cross-over field trial of 27 health care workers, aged 24-65, performing their typical, hospital-based occupational duties. Each participant served as his/her own control and wore one of seven respirators or a medical mask for 8 hr (or as long as tolerable) with interposed doffing periods every 2 hr. Self-perceived discomfort and exertion were quantified before each doffing: self-perceived level of discomfort using a visual analog scale, and self-perceived level of exertion using a Borg scale. Overall, and as would be expected, discomfort increased over time with continual respirator use over an 8-hr period. Interestingly, exertion increased only marginally over the same time period. The relatively low level of exertion associated with eight respiratory protective devices, including models commonly used in the U.S. health care workplace, is not likely to substantially influence workers' tolerability or occupational productivity. However, the magnitude of discomfort does appear to increase significantly over time with prolonged wear. These results suggest that respirator-related discomfort, but not exertion, negatively influences respirator tolerance over prolonged periods. Discomfort may also interfere with the occupational duties of workers.",

            "text": "T here is widespread debate about the best and most appropriate types of respiratory protection that health care workers (HCWs) should don during influenza and other infectious disease outbreaks. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Recent reports (1, 6) of HCWs' experiences when responding to disease outbreaks have suggested that some respirators may not be well tolerated, especially among workers who are not accustomed to wearing them for extended periods. Problems with respirator tolerability have been attributed to overall discomfort; (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) diminished visual, (8, 11, 12) vocal, (11, 12) or auditory (11) acuity; excessive humidity (7) or heat; (7, 10, 12, 13) headaches, (6, 14) facial pressure; (7) skin irritation or itchiness; (6, 7, 12, 13) excessive fatigue or exertion; (6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13) malodorousness; (7, 10) anxiety or claustrophobia; (6, 13, 15, 16) and other interferences with occupational duties. (10, (17) (18) (19) However, few studies have formally field tested the tolerability of respirators commonly worn by HCWs (1) who may be called on to wear respiratory protection in extreme scenarios for the duration of their work shifts during a largescale infectious disease outbreak. (5, 20, 21) The likelihood of U.S. health care workers tolerating respirators for 8 or more hours per day over the days and weeks of an evolving outbreak is unknown.",

(20) (21) (22) (23) (24) During an outbreak, one way to decrease costs and extend the usable period of respirators might be to cover each disposable respirator with a medical mask that would be discarded after close patient contact. (22) However, this approach has the potential to affect the seal to the face and might alter respirator discomfort or exertion necessary to breathe through the device. (25) Another way to decrease costs is to use reusable respirators. An improved understanding of the factors affecting tolerability in extreme respirator use scenarios could provide evidence-based recommendations about respirator selection and use.",

Each health care worker had three scheduled breaks from wearing the devices throughout the day: 15 min at the 2-hr and 6-hr mark, and 30 min at the 4-hr mark. Subjects were asked to rate their selfperceived discomfort using a 1-10 visual analog scale (26) and exertion levels using a Borg exertion scale (27) at donning, after 30 min and each subsequent 120 (\u00b1 15) min, and at doffing.

In all models, we controlled for effects of gender, age, and physical activity. Standard model diagnostics were used to assess model adequacy. To account for the Type I error inflation, we used the Bonferroni stepdown method to adjust p-values, shown to be more powerful than the classic Bonferroni adjustment while maintaining strong control of the family-wise Type I error.

Concerns about global shortages (32) of disposable filtering facepiece respirators during periods of peak demand have helped make this a pressing topic. For participating HCWs, the level of self-perceived discomfort increased over time and across respirators. While this finding hardly seems unexpected, the fact that discomfort increases with prolonged respirator use has not been quantified in this fashion and reported in peer-reviewed literature, to our knowledge. As previously reported, (21) we found that approximately half the subjects in our study, HCWs who were accustomed to wearing respirators for brief periods, were not willing to wear most respirators or a medical mask for the 8-hr work shift even with interposed break periods. Facial heat, (7, 10, 12, 13, 21) pain, (6, 14, 21) and pressure (7, 21) are among the most common complaints associated with discomfort. Placing an MM over an N95 with and without an exhalation valve did not significantly change the discomfort associated with these models.",

Therefore, strategies to primarily reduce discomfort-specifically the heat, pressure, and pain complaints-may be best suited to increase respirator tolerability and compliance. Among commonly used and relatively inexpensive respirator models, an N95 with an exhalation valve was the most comfortable after 8 hr. The medical mask was mildly more comfortable; however, the MM is primarily meant to prevent the spread of contaminants by the wearer instead of protecting the wearer from outside contaminants. (22) Study limitations include the small sample size, locations limited to one hospital system, and a setting that simulated only a pandemic scenario. Health care workers caring for patients with contagious life-threatening illnesses during a pandemic may be willing to tolerate respirators for longer periods than observed in our study, although subjects were asked to imagine themselves in such a setting. It is important to note that infection control procedures and appropriate processes for disinfecting, charging, and maintaining respirators would need to be considered if HCWs were to use respirators for extended wear periods, with use between patients, and with respirator re-use. Likewise, appropriate hand hygiene and contact precautions should always be observed. A participation bias may have led to higher tolerance levels among the study subjects than would be expected in the U.S. health care work force. The most common reason for HCWs declining to participate was unwillingness to wear the respirator equipment for prolonged periods.",
