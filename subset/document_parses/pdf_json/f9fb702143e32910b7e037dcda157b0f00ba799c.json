Severe COVID-19 patients usually progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct, coagulation dysfunction, multiple organ failure, and even death in a short period after onset. Currently, there is still a lack of clinically effective drugs for such patients. The high secretory activity, the immune-modulatory effect, and the homing ability make MSCs and in particular AD-MSCs both a potential tool for the anti-viral drug-delivery in the virus microenvironment and potential cellular therapy. AD-MSCs as the most important exponent of MSCs are expected to reduce the risk of complications and death of patients due to their strong anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory capabilities, which can improve microenvironment, promote neovascularization and enhance tissue repair capabilities. In this literature review, the role of regenerative strategies through MSCs, AD-MSCs, and adipocyte-secreted exosomal microRNAs (A-SE-miRs) as a potential antiviral therapy was reported, comparing the results found with current research progress on drugs and vaccines in COVID-19 disease.",

The SVF provides a rich source of AD-MSCs that can be easily isolated from human adipose tissue (HAT). Generally, each mL of HAT offers 100,000-300,000 SVFs of which 1%-3% is constituted by AD-MSCs (1,000-9,000 AD-MSCs/mL) representing a potential source of antiviral drugs in Coronavirus disease patients as previously suggested by Gentile et al. [2] . The SVFs and related AD-MSCs were used for many years in regenerative medicine without however any focus on their potential anti-viral roles. The anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities of SVFs and AD-MSCs make them consider also, a potential cellular therapy in COVID-19 as already displayed by the use of MSCs in seven COVID-19 patients [3] . These effects were confirmed by the increased peripheral lymphocytes amount, the decline in the C-reactive protein, and waning of over-activated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells) into the blood of COVID-19 patients, by mean 4.5 days later the MSCs intravenous infusion [3] . Moreover, 10 x RNA-sequencing analysis displayed that infused MSCs were negative for angiotensin I converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which confirmed that these cells were free from COVID-19 infection. The possible implications of MSCs as anti-viral therapy have been cited by also the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [3] .",

Some scholars claimed that Remdesivir (RDV), as an antiviral drug of nucleoside analogs, can add virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through competitive inhibition of natural nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to prevent virus RNA synthesis and thus inhibit virus replication (Table  1 ). RDV has shown good anti-MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 activities in vitro studies and animal models, indicating that RDV can be used as a potential anti-COVID-19 drug, but its safety and effectiveness still need to be verified by phase II and phase III clinical trials [7, 16] . Pharmaceutical companies and epidemic prevention agencies all over the world have begun to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, but because the vaccine must have sufficient scientific basis and sufficient safety, its research and development cycle may take months to years. Based on the drug research and development experience of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, searching for new potential drugs from past drugs has become the current main strategy due to its low research cost and short research and development cycle. At present, the recombinant protein vaccine has just been approved to start clinical trials, the inactivated vaccine is in the stage of establishing animal infection models, the nucleic acid vaccine has carried out clinical trials (NCT04283461) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ct2/show/NCT04283461), and the recombinant virus vector vaccine has started adenovirus vector vaccine clinical trials (NCT04313127) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ct2/show/NCT04313127) and two other lentivirus vector vaccine clinical trials (NCT04299724 https:// clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04299724), NCT042 76896 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04276896) ( Table 1 ).

MSCs can produce a direct anti-viral effect by secreting antibacterial peptides and proteins (AMPs), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), IL-17 and other molecules, and unlike somatic cells that produce interferon during virus invasion and then activate hundreds of genes that resist virus infection, MSCs can continuously activate a large number of anti-virus genes independent of interferon, such as IFITM gene, which can encode protein structures that prevent viruses from invading cells [19] (Table 1) . Additionally, MSCs can also exert an indirect antiviral effect by regulating the dynamic coordination of pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory elements of the patient's immune system and promoting the activity of phagocytes [20] (Table 1) . Researchers have also confirmed the immune-regulation and antibacterial and antiviral values of MSCs in vitro sepsis model, ARDS model, and alveolar epithelial fibrosis model [21, 22] . So far MSCs have been found to secrete at least four AMPs: antibacterial peptide LL-37 (Cathelicidin LL-37), human defensin-2 (Human defensin-2), hepcidin, and lipocalin-2. These AMPs mediate the cell-killing process by cell killing, inhibiting the synthesis of essential proteins, DNA and RNA of infected cells, and interacting with certain targets in infected cells, and play an active regulatory role in the infection and inflammatory progress of patients with COVID-19 [20] .",

Huang et al. [6] were the first to report the clinical situation of patients in China. Arentz et al. [7] analyzed 21 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington State, USA. The initial symptoms were chest tightness and shortness of breath (76%), high fever (52%), cough (48%), and most patients (86%, n=18) had basic chronic diseases when they were admitted to hospital, mostly kidney diseases and heart failure. 81% (n=17) patients need to be transferred to ICU within 24 hours after admission. All 15 patients with ARDS need to receive mechanical ventilation assisted respiratory therapy, of which 8 (53%) patients progress to severe ARDS within 72 hours. The medical staff around the world soon realized that there was currently no specific treatment for COVID-19. The treatment strategy for severe patients was to prevent and treat complications on the basis of symptomatic treatment while actively treating basic diseases and preventing secondary infection.",

Another study showed that the intracellular TMPRSS2 has the ability of specific recognition and binding with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which plays an important role in the process of virus infection and transmission, ending in the inflammatory cytokine storm [12] . Commonly, the inflammatory stage is triggered by a pathogen resulting in the molecules patterns (pathogen-associated molecular patterns -PAMPs-) release, that ligates and activate NOD-like receptors (NLRs), toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) or other receptors on endothelial cells, mast cells, macrophages and interstitial fibroblasts [18] . The receptors activation induces the discharge of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (GFs) triggering neutrophils and monocytes recruitment [18] . The monocytes/macrophages (MM) during the passage from inflammatory (M1) to healing stage (M2) produce a big number of cytokines and GFs that promoting the multiple cell types proliferation involved in tissue repair [18] . As preliminary reported by Leng et al [3] , not seems to be clear the reason for continuing cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, without the transition between the inflammatory to the healing stage. For this reason, it appears necessary to act inducing this transition since inflammatory to the healing stage via MSCs, AD-MSCs, and their A-SE-miRs.",
