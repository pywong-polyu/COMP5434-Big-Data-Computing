            "text": "Coronavirus with intact infectivity attached to PPE surfaces pose significant threat to the spread of COVID-19. We tested the hypothesis that an electroceutical fabric, generating weak potential difference of 0.5 V, disrupts the infectivity of coronavirus upon contact by destabilizing the electrokinetic properties of the virion. Porcine respiratory coronavirus AR310 particles (10 5 ) were placed in direct contact with the fabric for 1 or 5 min. Following one minute of contact, zeta potential of the porcine coronavirus was significantly lowered indicating destabilization of its electrokinetic properties. Size-distribution plot showed appearance of aggregation of the virus. Testing of the cytopathic effects of the virus showed eradication of infectivity as quantitatively assessed by PI-calcein and MTT cell viability tests. This work provides the rationale to consider the studied electroceutical fabric, or other materials with comparable property, as material of choice for the development of PPE in the fight against COVID-19.",

            "text": "The basic reproductive number of an infection, denoted as R o , gauges the number of susceptible individual(s) that an infectious host can spread their disease 1 . Respiratory infections are known to spread through direct routes of aerosolization such as sneezing, coughing and other contact gestures 2,3 . In addition, indirect modes of transmission play a significant role in determining R o . SARS-CoV-2 remains viable for an extended period of time. The CDC reported presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on various surfaces on the Diamond Princess ship 17 days after all symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 passengers had vacated 4,5 . In a laboratory-based experimental study, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable for at least three hours in aerosols and up to 72 h on fomites such as stainless steel 6 . Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to safeguard healthcare providers against COVID-19 7 . However, use of these PPE itself poses significant threat as doffing of contaminated PPE carrying viable viral particles is likely to infect the person and potentially spread infection 8 . Although CDC has recommended strict doffing procedures to reduce risk of nosocomial infections, contaminated PPE poses an imminent serious risk for healthcare professionals 9-12 . Infectivity of a viral particle is dependent on its stability. Multiple biophysical factors determine the stability of coronaviruses 13 . For instance, nonspecific electrostatic interactions influence capsid assembly of enveloped RNA viruses in which positively charged capsid proteins package the negatively charged RNA. In positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as the coronaviruses, this thermodynamically spontaneous assembly is mediated by arginine rich motifs. A large number of ss-RNA-viruses follow a general law of packaging, based on electrostatic forces without an explicit dependence on the sequence specificity 14 . The overall positive charge of the capsid limits viral genome length 15,16 . However, coronaviruses express an exoribonuclease associated with nonstructural protein 14 which allows them to inherit longer genomes when compared to other RNA viruses 17 . Destabilization of coronavirus outside the host system is therefore of paramount importance in abating the spread of infection. We have co-developed a wireless electroceutical fabric for use as wound care dressing [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . This dressing, upon contact with bodily fluids or other aqueous wetting media, generates weak electric field which OPEN is effective in managing biofilm infection and improving wound healing 18, 20, 21, 23 . The dressing is currently FDA cleared and in clinical trial (NCT04079998). In this work we sought to investigate the effectiveness of the said electroceutical fabric for its ability to curb coronavirus infectivity.",

            "text": "Characterization of the electroceutical fabric. The electroceutical fabric tested is made up of polyester fabric printed with alternating circular regions of Ag and Zn dots (Fig. 1b) . The Ag dots (\u00f8 2 mm) and Zn dots (\u00f8 1 mm) were printed on the fabric in proximity of about 1 mm to each other. The fabric was first characterized by measurements of the surface contact potential of a two-dimensional area covering 2 Ag dots and 2 Zn dots, with reference to the potential of the unprinted polyester fabric (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1) . The electroceutical fabric only generate measurable electric potentials when moist such as EMEM media. Two-dimensional contact surface potential map demonstrates Ag spots as positive while Zn spots were highly negative (Fig. 1c) . The average potential of Ag spots and Zn spots were calculated to be + 60 mV and \u2212 650 mV, respectively suggesting that printed metal patterns on fabric can generate stable electrical potential. Finite element modeling (FEM) simulations (Fig. 1d) showed that electric fields project to a significant degree above the fabric with field strength dropping to 5 V/m around 3 mm above the fabric surface (Fig. 1e) , with the majority of the electric field accumulated at the Zn dots (Fig. 1f) . Ag and Zn were spotted on another textile which was also appropriate for the preparation of stretchable facemasks (Fig. 2a) . Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) displayed the deposition of Ag particles and Zn on the fibers of the polyester fabric of stretchable facemasks (Fig. 2b) . SEM of the fabric used for such mask showed a different weaving pattern (Fig. 2b) .

A gold-coated probe tip mounted on a 3-axis linear actuator system was raster scanned over the sample area and recorded the contact potential at each probed position with reference to the unprinted fabrics. The potential was read by a high precision voltameter, followed by data analysis and finite element modeling (FEM) simulation. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Fig. 2 ). The only peak that was present other than C and O was that of Au used for coating the fabrics for SEM imaging ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). Proximity of Ag and Zn on polyester fabric forms a redox couple and is capable of driving electrochemistry when wet in an aqueous ionized environment including any body fluid (Fig. 1 ). Three ionized aqueous media were used to test potential difference between adjacent Ag and Zn deposits. NaCl solution (0.85% w/v), cell culture medium and tap water (of practical value to end users of PPE) were tested at room temperature. The potential difference between the two electrodes rapidly increased and achieved a steady state after the first 15 s (Fig. 3 ). The potential difference between adjacent Ag and Zn dots was also sustained in presence of different body fluids ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

Cells treated with f e -recovered CoV particles appeared as healthy as the uninfected cells ( Fig. 5a ; Supplementary Fig. 5ai ). Objective assessment of cell viability was performed using calcein/PI fluorescence assay. Only live cells with intracellular esterase activity hydrolyze the acetoxymethyl ester in non-fluorescent Calcein AM converting it into green fluorescent Calcein. Dead cells or cells with damaged or compromised cell membranes include PI stain, which is otherwise impermeant to live cells. Fold-change increase in PI/Calcein signal as shown indicates loss of cell viability in response to infection. Infection of cells with CoV caused marked loss of cell viability (Fig. 5b) . Such cytopathic effect of CoV was completely absent once the virus was exposed to f e (Fig. 5d , e). The sham fabric did not afford such protection (Fig. 5c, e) . The cytopathic effects of CoV and the protective effects of f e (versus f s ) was corroborated by the standard MTT assay commonly used for testing cell viability (Fig. 5f ). The cytopathic effects of CoV were primarily due to increase generation of H 2 O 2 in the ST cells that were abrogated when the virus particles were exposed to f e ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ). The protective effects of f e were further supported by cellular respirometry www.nature.com/scientificreports/ assay that showed increased basal respiration, maximum respiration and ATP production in cells exposed to CoV recovered from f e (Supplementary Fig. 5c -e) .",

            "text": "Previous work from our laboratory has established the effectiveness of electroceutical principles as an alternative to pharmacological approaches in managing planktonic microbial pathogens and complex polymicrobial biofilms 18, 20, 21, 23, 24 . Viruses are known to rely on electrostatic interactions for optimal virion assembly and attachment 13, 25 . For instance, structural proteins in coronaviruses, negatively charged amino acid residues in the nucleocapsid facilitates assembly with the membrane protein 26 . Additionally, the coronavirus envelope protein is known to generate ion conductive pores across membranes which are voltage dependent 27 . Leveraging these viral characteristics to achieve viral inactivation remains largely unexplored and has been attempted in this work. Electroceuticals have generated renewed interest in the health care industry 28 . The fabric tested in this work consists of only silver and zinc dots on polyester fabric that forms a redox couple [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Zeta potential of a particle determines its electrostatic interactions in particle dispersions and, as such, is an important determinant of the stability of viral particles 29 . Contact of CoV with the electroceutical fabric studied rapidly lowered the zeta potential demonstrating a direct effect of the fabric on the electrokinetic properties of the viral particle. Any change of zeta potential towards zero is viewed as increase in electrical instability of the particle. The observation that in contact with the electroceutical fabric eliminates infectivity of the virus leads to the hypothesis that the observed lowering of zeta potential may have caused defects in the structural integrity of the virus. Study of changes in the capsid-RNA structure following exposure to the weak electric field generated by the fabric is thus warranted.",

Zeta potential and nanosight tracking analysis of the purified coronavirus following contact with and retrieval from the electroceutical fabric. (a) Absolute quantification of viral particles recovered from the fabric after treatment with f e . A two-fold and four-fold reduction in the recovered viral number was observed after 1-and 5-min treatment, respectively. (b) Viral particle number was quantified using NTA. One hundred microliters of the purified CoV were spotted on 1.5 cm discs of electroceutical fabric and recovered using incomplete EMEM, after 1 or 5 min of contact with the fabric. (c-e) Changes in viral zeta potential and affiliated parameters after contact with the fabric for 1 min or 5 min. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports/ was utilized to estimate absolute viral particle number and size distribution in not only pure CoV but also in CoV recovered from the fabric. Observed changes in particle number and size distribution support the aforementioned hypothesis that exposure to the weak electric field causes damaging structural alterations to the virions. Cells in culture routinely display a small fraction of dead or dying cells. Cytopathic effects of viral infection are tested to examine whether exposure to the infectious particle adds to the basal cell death burden of the culture. Longterm observations, i.e. days versus hours, ensure the recording of the eventual fate of the affected cells. Reporting of short-term data alone, while sometimes may be encouraging with respect to effect of the intervention, may simply reflect results representing postponement of death from the insult and not a true rescue. In CPE studies of this work, cell rounding, and sloughing were evident in day 4 post-infection. During this time, cells treated with virus pre-exposed to the electroceutical fabric closely resembled cells that were unchallenged by exposure to the virus. In standard cell culture, the growth medium is changed every other day to wash off floating dead cells and to replenish nutrition. Under conditions of infection by virus, such frequent change of cell culture medium is not made. Cells grow in the same spent media until day 7 post-infection. Maintenance of cells without any change in culture media for seven days is expected to marginally increase basal cell death burden as shown.",

The phiX174 is widely used as a model organism because of it being a standardized test. However, it is important to note that unlike SAR-CoV-2 which is a RNA virus, phiX174 bacteriophage is a DNA virus with numerous contrasting physical, chemical as well as biological properties. Furthermore, this bacteriophage is much smaller in size than SAR-CoV-2. The non-enveloped icosahedral morphology of phiX174 are aerosolized with a mean particle size of 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m 31 . This is in direct contrast with the coronaviruses that cause diseases in animals and humans which are ~ 100 nm in diameter and are aerosolized as respiratory droplets with sizes > 5 \u00b5m 32, 33 . Importantly, phiX174 cannot infect mammalian cells. It infects and forms visible plaques on a lawn of Escherichia coli (Migula) Castellani and Chalmers strains. In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, this work studies the coronavirus and tests cytopathic effects on mammalian cells. Testing methods such as AATCC TM100 recommends a textile contact time of 24 h for both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.

Lowering of zeta potential of the CoV particles following exposure to the electroceutical fabric constitutes direct evidence supporting the contention that electrokinetic stability of the viral particle is weakened. Additional studies are necessary to characterize specific structural changes in response to exposure to the electroceutical fabric, and to connect such changes to loss of infectivity.
