Most veterans with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia want a greater role in treatment decisions, but there are no interventions targeted for this population. A skills-based intervention is promising because it is well-aligned with the recovery model, uses similar mechanisms as other evidence-based interventions in this population, and generalizes across decisional contexts while empowering veterans to decide when to initiate collaborative decision-making. Collaborative Decision Skills Training (CDST) was developed in a civilian serious mental illness sample and may fill this gap but needs to undergo a systematic adaptation process to ensure fit for veterans.",

This model continues to monitor and intervene on symptomatic outcomes but focuses on personally prioritized functional outcomes and wellbeing. One outcome of recovery-oriented services is enhanced sense of personal recovery, a patient's endorsement of hope, optimism, social connectedness, personal meaning, and empowerment [2] .This model of care is a particularly good fit for veterans with serious mental illnesses, given high rates of long-term functional disability and low rates of full symptom remission [3, 4] . The Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee, a federal committee intended to improve care for people with SMI, prioritizes using recoveryoriented care to optimize quality of care and improve functional outcomes [5] . Changes in rehabilitation programming for veterans with SMI are beginning to reflect this priority, for example by integrating peer services into Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers (PRRCs). However, much work is needed to effectively develop and implement recovery-oriented care for veterans with SMI in the Veteran's Affairs (VA) system [6] . A key gap in current recovery-oriented care is interventions and other processes that facilitate empowering and person-centered processes within the treatment process itself, including effective interaction with providers and meaningful involvement in treatment decision-making.",

The new collaborative decision-making model places equal power and responsibility over the decision with each person involved. It seeks to empower the patient during the process, in keeping with the recovery model. \"Collaboration\" makes it clear that this model is about a reciprocal exchange of ideas, a process where both the patient and provider (and potentially, other stakeholders) have a meaningful say. The collaboration decision-making process prioritizes the patient's needs, values, and culture along with best evidence and clinical judgment by actively integrating these through collaboration, actualizing the evidencebased practice model.",

            "text": "A range of interventions targeting shared decisionmaking have been developed, although none have been developed specifically for veterans with SMI. These interventions are most frequently decision support tools or decision aids, which are provider-or clinic-based interventions intended to facilitate decision-making around specific decisions [21] . Some of these interventions are effective in improving treatment engagement and satisfaction, social functioning, quality of life, and clinical outcomes [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, there are limitations to these approaches. First, these types of interventions target a single decision, limiting their reach. Second, these interventions rely on the provider or clinic for access or initiation with each decision-making process, undermining patient empowerment. This is especially concerning because even providers who endorse shared decisionmaking are less likely to use shared decision-making principles if they view the patient as too symptomatic [19] . In general, physicians rarely initiate shared decision-making processes but often react positively to patient initiation of shared decision-making [29, 30] . When patients initiate the decision-making process, treatment decisions are more likely to reflect patient preference [15] . Finally, while some types of decisions are well-suited to a decision aid (i.e., when there are two or three concrete, easy to distinguish choices), many treatment decisions are more complicated and options may vary widely by individual, and therefore less wellsuited to be resolved using a decision aid (e.g., where to live, who to choose as a guardian or fiduciary). Decision contexts also vary, particularly for people with SMI, who often have a range of providers and other people (e.g., family members) contributing to treatment and treatment decision-making. For example, in VA Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers (PRRCs), veterans with SMI have interdisciplinary teams which may include a psychiatrist or other prescriber, an individual therapist, a recovery coach, group therapists, a vocational therapist, a recreational therapist, a peer support specialist, and a chaplain. An innovative and comprehensive approach, CommonGround, has shown promise for adults with SMI, but barriers at multiple levels obstruct successful implementation [31, 32] . Combined with high rates of turnover in many clinical settings, targeting veterans rather than providers may be a more feasible and sustainable approach.",

E.T. conceptualized and wrote the manual with mentorship from W.S. and Eric A. Evans. The theoretical model of CDST and its outcomes are depicted in Fig. 1 . A skills training intervention was chosen because patient initiation of collaborative decision-making usually results in a positive response from providers, indicating that training patients in skills needed to initiate these interactions is a viable strategy. Additionally, other skills training interventions are effective and generalizable to functional outcomes among people with SMI [35] . Finally, skills training is a particularly feasible option due to its ease of implementation, e.g., requiring few financial or technical resources, building on existing provider competencies. Skills training may increase the effectiveness of existing provider-based tools, like decision aids, because some patients may not currently be able to fully utilize these tools due to lack of knowledge, skill, or confidence in engaging in collaborative decision-making [36] . This approach also has the promise to expand use of collaborative decision-making across types of decisions and providers. CDST is intended to enable patients to initiate collaborative decision-making with any treatment team member regarding any decision and define their own preferred role in decision-making, unlike most SDM interventions, which target specific decisions or providers. Therefore, the primary targeted outcome of CDST is increased collaborative decisionmaking behaviors, a valued outcome in itself by stakeholders, and also associated with downstream outcomes including improved treatment engagement and satisfaction, better treatment outcomes, and better quality of life.",

For example, this might include the vignettes and role-plays, which were developed in tandem with the patients and providers in the original civilian service environment.

We will use steps 3 through 5 to guide our adaptation process. These steps include (3) plan adaptations based on fit assessments, (4) make adaptations and plans for implementation, and (5) group, picking appropriate role-plays given group member needs, and approved service delivery variations (e.g., number of meetings per week). Adapting to changing contexts, like meeting virtually to accommodate COVID-19, could also be addressed in the Service Delivery Manual. The existing CDST Clinical Manual from the pilot study will be modified during aim 1 based on findings from this project to increase fit for the new setting and population. The new CDST Service Delivery Manual will be developed during aim 1 and honed during aim 1 and aim 2 study activities. The goal of applying the abbreviated IM Adapt process in this study is to assess possible adaptation needs and meet those needs while maintaining fidelity to the intervention. IM Adapt protects the \"active ingredients\" of CDST and further adapts it, making it relevant to veterans and feasible in VA PRRCs. This will result in a Clinician Manual that is optimized to VA settings without loss of \"active ingredients\" and a Service Delivery Manual that enhances VA PRRC clinicians' ability to deliver CDST effectively within their own service contexts.

This will inform initial development of themes. After initial development of themes, the entire transcript will be evaluated to determine quotes that inform an existing or new theme. Themes may be modified, added, or removed during the analysis process as the transcription is better understood.

Effect sizes will be calculated for each measure by determining change in scores between baseline and post-intervention, and between baseline and 3-month follow-up. Cohen's d effect size calculation and 95% confidence intervals [64] will be used for this purpose. In general, the purpose of these calculations is to verify that the direction of the effects is as expected, i.e., that CDST is associated with improvements in targeted areas. Although we will report the size of the effects and anticipate that some may be of medium to large size, given the large effects found in the civilian pilot [34] , we are simultaneously aware that due to the small sample size, the confidence intervals may be large, requiring a larger sample for a precise estimate of effect size. Therefore, the primary goal will be to characterize direction of the effects rather than magnitude. Additionally, given the small sample size, we will also explore outliers using Cook's distance. If we identify one or more outliers for a given effect, we will attempt to identify potential causes for the outlier effect by examining the outlier participants' data in full context, including their qualitative data. This examination may also help us understand variables to consider for stratification during future larger trials.",

The VA recognizes the importance of both, and has made considerable strides to deliver recovery-oriented, evidence-based care to veterans with SMI. Increased collaborative decision-making is one area that remains to be improved, and there are, at present, no existing interventions tailored specifically for this population. CDST is an excellent candidate for this gap due to its development for civilians with SMI and its recovery-oriented focus that prioritizes patient empowerment and the development of generalizable knowledge and skills that patients can choose to use in any decision-making context with any treatment team member. This protocol will identify adaptations needed for CDST to appropriately fit the VA PRRC context and the needs and priorities of the veteran population, and conduct the first open trial of CDST (or indeed, any collaborative decision-making intervention) among veterans with SMI. This protocol will integrate FRAME and periodic reflections to track adaptations and uses RE-AIM to organize outcome domains. Mixed methods will be used to assess the open trial results. Results will be disseminated broadly, including to VA clinicians, veterans, and other stakeholders, as well as to scientific journals and the public. There are methodological limitations to note. The adaptation process will focus specifically on the local VA PRRC and the veterans served by that PRRC. This VA and its service population may differ from other VAs in meaningful ways, and other VAs and PRRCs may find that the adaptations and Service Delivery Manual completed during this study does not fully capture all of their adaptation needs. Future studies that integrate other sites may be necessary to ensure that all adaptation needs are covered prior to all-VA implementation of the resulting CDST manual. This protocol describes a small open trial with no comparison group. While the study will yield useful information about feasibility and initial evidence of effectiveness, a larger trial with a comparison group will be necessary to fully understand the impact of CDST. These limitations are expected given the scope of this stage of the research. Other changes could potentially be made to the protocol as the study unfolds. For example, as of submission of this paper, data collection is set to begin in summer 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first stage of the study, the ART, will be completely virtual. The second stage may also need to be translated to virtual data collection depending on the progression of the pandemic to protect the safety of the participants and staff. The research staff will continue to follow both VA Research and VA PRRC guidelines. Key questions for the ART will include if and how to adapt CDST for video/phone groups instead of in-person. Other groups in this clinic have been delivered this way, so the ART's perceptions of ways to do this successfully will be prioritized in decisions about how to proceed with the open trial. Any changes made will be documented and reported to relevant parties potentially including ethics boards, trial registries, funding groups, and journals.",

Once adapted, CDST will fill an existing gap in care. The results of this study will inform feasibility and potential to improve collaborative decisionmaking and associated targeted outcomes including treatment engagement, satisfaction, and rehabilitation goal attainment for veterans with SMI. Additionally, these data will also increase the field's understanding of perceptions of collaborative decision-making among veterans with SMI and VA clinicians, and result in a practical Service Delivery Manual that may be used by clinicians and administrators in VA PRRCs. Future studies may build upon the findings of this study in multiple ways, including a larger trial of CDST. Additionally, understanding typical decision-making processes, perceptions of those processes, and their relationships to key outcomes in VA PRRCs may elucidate other potential intervention pathways to improve collaborative decision-making specifically, and quality of care broadly, in these settings. Continued pursuit of interventions and system processes with high implementation feasibility that facilitate collaborative decision-making is key to improving quality of life and quality of care for veterans with SMI.
