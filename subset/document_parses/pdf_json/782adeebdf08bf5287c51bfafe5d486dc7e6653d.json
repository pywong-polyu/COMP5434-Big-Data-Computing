Amidst the millions of individuals affected directly by the pandemic, pronounced sex differences in the susceptibility and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence has highlighted the potential importance of autoimmune activation in modulating not only the acute response but also recovery trajectories following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Given that immune-inflammatory activity can be sex-biased in the setting of severe COVID-19 illness, we deliberately examined sexspecific autoimmune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of extreme clinical disease.",

The moderate frequency associated AABs included MOV10, CHGA, CHD4, HIST1H4A, ACE2, IFNA6, LYZ, RNF41. Importantly, both MOV10 and IFNA6 have been reported in patients infected with COVID-19 (5, 9) .

Interestingly, AABs to DBT have been associated with lung cancer (10). Importantly, a number of AABs can be classified as implicated more frequently with systemic disease traits (i.e., multi-organ or multi-system) which may be particularly relevant to the more non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, fever, rashes, cold or allergy-type symptoms, weight loss, and muscular weakness.

Early studies reported that while men and women have similar prevalence, men with COVID-19 are at greater risk for worse outcomes and death independent of age (12, 13). Consistent with these findings, conventional inflammatory markers are founded to be more substantially elevated in men compared to women who are hospitalized for COVID-19 (14) . Accordingly, males in our study had a greater than 1.5-fold odds of AABs reactivity after adjusting for age. For classic autoimmune disease, clinical prevalence and incidence of autoimmune diseases tends to follow a male versus female pattern based on pathology. Male-predominant autoimmune diseases usually manifest clinically (i.e., show signs and symptoms of clinical disease) prior to age 50 and are characterized by acute inflammation and a Th1-type response, whereas autoimmune All rights reserved.

By contrast, males are now recognized as more vulnerable to the immune-modulated effects of active SARS-CoV-2 infection likely due to multiple mechanisms (e.g. lower immune cell expression of TLR7, lower observed antibody response, and lower interleukin mediated tissue resilience and tissue repair activity)(17) -and our results demonstrate the persistence of detectable downstream autoimmune sequelae.

Importantly, variations in the AAB titers found in the HCWs were different than those seen in healthy control subjects. In the latter group, the most dominant AAB was for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, also known as colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), well-known to be a regulator of monocyte/macrophage differentiation.

Whether examined subjectively or objectively, symptomatology can vary not only between but also within individuals over time.

Our primary study cohort was derived from a diverse and unselected population of adults employed in a multisite healthcare delivery system located in Los Angeles County, including individuals with direct patient contact and others with non-patient-oriented work functions. All HCW participants provided detailed survey data on medical history, including prior COVID-19 exposures and infection in addition to COVID-19-related symptoms and exposures (19). For the current study, we included all participants (n=177) who had confirmed evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on presence of positive anti-nucleocapsid IgG serology results (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois) (19). For all participants, EDTA plasma specimens were transported for assays within 1 hour of phlebotomy to the Cedars-Sinai Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Our secondary cohorts included healthy controls (n=53) who provided pre-pandemic serum samples obtained from the Bavarian Red Cross (Wiesentheid, Germany) with ethical approval from the Bayerische Landesaerztekammer (Study No. 01/09). We also studied a classic autoimmune disease comparator cohort (n=6) of SLE patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE (20) and had prepandemic serum samples collected by BioIVT (West Sussex, United Kingdom). Autoantibody Assays. We utilized a panel of 91 protein antigens and cytokines in a multiplexed bead-based assay using Luminex FlexMAP 3D technology (21) The selected analytical targets can be grouped into different functional protein families or belong to immune-relevant biological pathways (22). Each antigen was covalently coupled to a distinct magnetic bead region (Luminex Corp, Austin, Texas) by carbodiimide. For each coupling reaction, up to 97 \u00b5g antigen and 4 \u00d7 105 MagPlex\u2122 beads per color were used",

The beads were analyzed in a FlexMap3D instrument (Luminex Corporation, Austin, Texas). The IgG reactivity values were given as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and antigens fulfilling the minimum bead count criterion (>10 beads measured per bead ID) were exported for data analysis. In addition, triplicates of a COVID-19 positive reference sample (comprised of three HCWs) were run on each plate to calculate median intra-plate coefficient of variation (CV) and median inter-plate CV. The dynamic range was determined using blank samples and a control bead coupled to BSA (control_BSA) for the lower and huIgG (control_huIgGhi) for the upper MFI range. Log MFI of each AAB across all of our study samples (including 177HCWs, 6 SLEs and 53 HCs) were standardized, by first subtracting the mean, and then dividing by the standard deviation.",
