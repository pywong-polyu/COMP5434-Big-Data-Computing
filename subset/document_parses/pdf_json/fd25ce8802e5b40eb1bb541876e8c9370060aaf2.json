Evidence suggests that azithromycin has antiviral activity in bronchial epithelial cells, together with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. 1, 2 The association of azithromycin with improved outcome in patients with other viral pneumonias, and in those with acute lung injury admitted in intensive care, has also been reported. 2 The possible beneficial effect of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19 and bacterial superinfection has been considered as well. 1 It is an economical drug that can be used in the early stages of COVID-19. However, the possible QT prolongation and cardiotoxicity associated with azithromycin are a concern. [1] [2] [3] [4] A number of individual studies have investigated the effect of azithromycin on different clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19. The reviews where these articles are summarized are either narrative, they focus on the effect of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine, or are restricted to studies with a particular design. Therefore, the evidence on the actual beneficial or harmful effects of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19 remains disperse and difficult to apply in clinical settings. 1 This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the evidence on the beneficial and adverse effects of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19.",

In two studies, it was specified that patients did not received hydroxychloroquine, neither in the intervention arm, nor in the comparison one. 30, 33 Two studies reported that patients in both arms had received hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir. 19, 24 Finally, one study reported that patients in both arms had been treated with hydroxychloroquine and steroids. 22 Death was the outcome in 13 studies, length of hospital admission in 6 studies, need for ICU care in 4 studies and need for admission in 2 studies. Other secondary outcomes were also reported in individual studies. Tables 1 and 2 present the outcomes reported in each study. All RCTs were considered of good quality. While one of them had a substantially smaller sample size, its results on mortality were consistent with the ones reported in larger studies. 19 All observational studies were also considered to have good quality. In one of them, only available as an abstract, the quality was difficult to assess. 29 However, while this study reported results consistent with the ones presented in the other papers, no numerical results were presented; therefore, it was not included in the meta-analysis (Tables S1 and S2, available as Supplementary data at JAC Online).",

There is also no evidence of azithromycin being associated with any serious adverse events, including cardiovascular disease. This systematic review has some limitations. Only one person extracted most of the data (L.A.). Even so, all data were checked for accuracy on repeated occasions and all analyses were conducted several times and checked by a senior statistician (S.A.). It is also possible that some publications may have been missed. The use of standard care, provided in addition to azithromycin in the intervention arm, and on its own in the comparison arm, was not described in some studies. It is not clear how differences in standard care across the studies may have affected the results. Even in studies where other drugs are mentioned, clinicians use numerous pharmacological, and not pharmacological, interventions that are not possible to account for, and this limitation affects all reviews of clinical studies. Some RCTs adjusted the treatment effect for confounders, but not all did so. In those adjusted however, there was no considerable difference between the unadjusted and adjusted estimates, likely due to the balanced characteristics of the compared groups, achieved by randomization.",
