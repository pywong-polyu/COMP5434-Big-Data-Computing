Despite the literature describing inequities in healthcare, very little published research exists on the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer patients and family members in hospice care. Methods: A quantitative comparative descriptive design explored the difference in end-of-life experiences between a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer and non-lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer cohort. One hundred and twenty-two family members of individuals who have died while under hospice care in the past 5 years completed the Quality of Dying and Death Version 3.2a Family Member/Friend After-Death Self-Administered Questionnaire. Results: Comparison of the experiences of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer cohort (n = 56) and non-LGBTQ cohort (n = 66) yielded varying results, with the LGBTQ cohort experiencing lower quality end of life in some Quality of Dying and Death measures and no statistically significant difference from the non-LGBTQ cohort in others. Discussion: The findings from this study in combination with previously published works on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer health support the position that hospice providers must take concrete steps to ensure that professional caregivers and office staff are qualified to meet the needs of this marginalized population.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] While there have been recent gains in visibility of LGBTQ people, discrimination in health care persists. 11 These issues have engendered distrust and avoidance of healthcare providers by many members of the LGBTQ community, 1, 2, [4] [5] [6] [7] 9, 10, 12, 13 and inequities in health have led to the designation of the community as a health disparity population by the National Institutes of Health. 14 Increasing barriers to access of care as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will only compound inequities for the LGBTQ community. 15, 16 Specific issues in end-of-life or palliative care for the LGBTQ population include stigma and associated stress, considerations in support systems (such as chosen families), advance care planning, and isolation. 12, 13, 17, 18 Providers must be knowledgeable about these issues and be intentional in their assessment and interventions. Staff who claim to treat patients without regard to their sexual orientation or gender identity, while well-meaning, may neglect to assess for the needs and concerns of the individual regarding end-of-life care, including the need to include the patient's family of choice in decision-making. 19 As Acquaviva 9 notes, \"(b)eing inclusive is not the same as treating everyone the same\" (p. xvi). End-of-life or palliative care for LGBTQ people must be inclusive; without inclusivity, a high-quality end-of-life experience is unlikely.",

Most research on LGBTQ end-of-life issues has centered on the fears of individuals regarding future care needs, not the experiences and perceptions of actual care received. 13 Very little information has been published regarding the actual experiences of LGBTQ people in hospice care, or comparing LGBTQ experiences to the non-LGBTQ population. 12 Recent work by Stein and colleagues 23 gathered information from more than 800 hospice and palliative care providers across multiple healthcare professions. Over half reported that lesbian, gay, or bisexual patients would encounter discrimination from providers; the percentage was even higher for transgender patients. Many had directly observed discrimination by providers toward LGBTQ patients and family members. Stein and colleagues' work is an important piece in understanding LGBTQ hospice experiences, but additional perspectives are needed. This study aimed to provide more information to address the research gap 12 by examining end-of-life experiences from the perspective of family members, and comparing the experiences of LGBTQ people and non-LGBTQ people in hospice care. Obtaining information comparing LGBTQ experiences with non-LGBTQ experiences provides understanding of what disparities between groups exist; this is crucial to ensuring justice in healthcare.",

This type of nonexperimental design is useful when it is not possible to alter the independent variable; 31 however, the nature of non-experimental research poses some threats to validity. Non-experimental designs do not allow random assignment to groups, which can be useful in controlling for extraneous variables that may impact study results. Random sampling was deemed too difficult to locate a sufficient number of individuals, as the study was seeking a minority within a minority. The absence of random sampling leads to selection bias as an internal threat to validity and difficulty generalizing the results to a wider population, a threat to external validity. 32 This study was submitted to the University of Indianapolis Institutional Review Board by the author. Once approval was obtained from the University of Indianapolis, the author sought approval from the Catholic University of America. The author received permission for a waiver of signed informed consent to minimize the link between individual participants and the study. The informed consent document noted emotional distress was a possible outcome of participation in the study, and provided information regarding mental health services, including national hotline numbers. Due to the anonymous nature of the study, follow-up with participants to assess for emotional distress was not feasible.",
