They can display significant stability and solubility, a wide range of sizes, and are useful as protein display particles for biotechnology applications. However, cTRPs also demonstrate inefficient selfassembly from smaller subunits. In this study, we describe a new generation of cTRPs, with longer repeats and increased interaction surfaces, which enhanced the self-assembly of two significantly different sizes of homotrimeric constructs. Finally, we demonstrated functionalization of these constructs with (1) a hexameric array of peptide-binding SH2 domains, and (2) a trimeric array of anti-SARS CoV-2 VHH domains. The latter proved capable of subnanomolar binding affinities towards the viral receptor binding domain and potent viral neutralization function.",

The discipline of protein engineering has been greatly facilitated by at least three significant recent advances: the development of accurate computational algorithms for de novo structural design, an enhanced ability to construct and screen large protein libraries, and increasingly efficient and affordable deep sequencing approaches. Whether they are created via de novo computational design or laboratory selections (or a combination of those two approaches), engineered proteins are now being used for a wide variety of biotechnology applications, including those that can benefit from new ligand binding proteins [2] [3] [4] , novel immunological regulators 5 or targeted protein therapeutics 6, 7 .",

They are particularly amenable to de novo design via purely computational approaches, due to their highly modular architectures 8, 9 . Multiple types of computationally designed tandem repeat proteins (using either naturally existing or computationally designed motifs and topologies) have been described that form either extended linear shapes (in which the N-and C-termini are at opposite ends of the protein chain) 12 or closed circular shapes (in which the N-and C-termini contact with one another and thereby complete a closed protein ring) 5, 13, 14 .

For example, a designed cTRP that was intended to form a homotrimer (corresponding to noncovalently assembled cTRP composed of three subunits that contain three repeats each) was instead found to inefficiently form a tetramer, indicating that the structural contacts between repeats and subunits was inadequate to enforce a desired stoichiometric assemblage pattern 13 . Similarly, a series of cTRP subunits designed to self-assemble into a 24-repeat assemblage failed to assemble altogether, indicating that the structural contacts between repeats and subunits were inadequate to drive efficient assembly, a deficiency that was addressed through the incorporation of disulfide 'staples' across each subunit interface 5 .",

In this study, we describe the de novo design of thick cTRPs ('tcTRPs') with repeats composed of longer helical bundles that form a new underlying repeat topology and demonstrate their solution and assembly behaviors, their structural features via X-ray crystallography and CryoEM, and their ability to be functionalized with additional folded protein domains.",

We previously developed an approach to geometryguided repeat protein design that was described in 13, 15, 16 and is implemented in the Rosetta molecular modeling package 17, 18 . Key features include symmetry of backbone and side-chain conformations extended across all repeats (allowing computational complexity to scale with repeat length rather than protein length); a pseudo-energy term that favors the desired inter-repeat geometry; clustering and resampling stages that allow intensified exploration of promising topologies; and an in silico validation step that assesses sequence-structure compatibility by attempting to re-predict the designed structure given only the designed sequence. When applying this approach to the design of closed tandem repeat proteins with increased thickness ('tcTRPs' or 'thick(er) circular tandem repeat proteins'), we identified designs with repeats corresponding to right-handed helical bundles as displaying favorable predicted folding energetics for their designed backbone topologies, and well-formed energy funnels when subjecting their sequences to unbiased fold predictions in Rosetta. We ultimately selected a small number of individual designs corresponding to two different tcTRP sizes and symmetries (containing 9 repeats and 24 repeats, respectively) to examine and validate using biophysical and structural approaches.",

The differences in the design of repeat sequences, structures, and packing between the tcTRP9 and tcTRP24 models are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The sequences of individual repeats from the two designs are similar to one another: each corresponds to a repeated 57 residue sequence that forms an anti-parallel two-helix bundle, with overall 37% sequence identity (50% similarity). The identities and similarities at individual residues between repeats in the two designed proteins are found both at surface-exposed positions and at interfacial positions that contribute to packing within individual repeats. The overall rmsd for all alpha carbons within comparable repeats in the two constructs is approximately 1.5 \u00c5 (dark and light blue, respectively in Fig. 3b-d) , indicating that the backbone architecture of repeats from the two designs is quite similar. However, superposition of a single repeat from tcTRP9 and tcTRP24 and examination of the deviation in the positions of adjacent downstream repeats (red and salmon respectively in Fig. 3c, d) illustrates that the differences in the size and curvature between the two constructs are facilitated by altered packing angles between sequential repeats (resulting in differences in the positions of the immediately adjacent, downstream repeats of over 4 \u00c5 rmsd).",

We therefore attempted to promote the closed toroidal form of this construct by incorporating a pair of cysteine residues at neighboring positions across each subunit interface so that a disulfide staple might lock the protein into the desired closed topology, as described previously 5, 19 . Based on the tcTRP24 8 design, an alanine at position 5 and an isoleucine at position 7 (respectively located within the N-and C-terminal repeats of each subunit) were mutated to cysteine residues, with the intention of installing potential disulfide bonds within each interface of the intended tcTRP24 8 trimeric particle ('tcTRP24 8 SS'). This construct was again well-expressed in E. coli and purified using the same three-column protocol including a terminal size exclusion chromatography (SEC) step. Like the original tcTCRP24 8 construct, the protein again eluted over a range of volume and corresponding masses extending from approximately 150 to > 670 kDa. However, the peak corresponding to the mass of the desired trimer appeared to be greater in relative height (Fig. 5b , 'tcTRP24 8 SS Run #1').",

However, collection of the late-arriving fractions corresponding to the predicted mass of the intended homotrimer and a second run over the same column now results in a single uniform peak corresponding to the intended mass of the designed homotrimeric construct. c Negative stain EM image of tcTRP24 8 (left) and of tcTRP24 8 SS ('Run #2'; right). The original construct (lacking disulfide staples; left panel) displays a mixture of correctly sized trimeric particles (small rings on the micrograph) and long extended fibers. The resized stapled construct (right panel) displays a uniform distribution of tcTRP particles. Subsequent CryoEM analyses of this construct (Supplementary Figs.

The three-strong features extending from equivalent positions around the tcTRP particle correspond to N-terminal poly-histidine affinity tags and linkers extending from the N-terminus of each protein subunit (an unbiased feature that further validated the trimeric assemblage of the particle).

Each of those protein families, which have respectively evolved to bind double-stranded DNA, single-stranded RNA, and peptide targets in a sequence and/or structure-specific manner, are composed of underlying repeats of approximately 34 residues. In carrying out their functions, they display significant plasticity corresponding to interdomain dynamic flexibility, differing amounts of sequence divergence between repeats within individual protein factors, and different ligand-binding mechanisms that generally depend on the identity of residues at canonical positions within each repeat 27 . Binding of fluorescently labeled Tir10 phosphotyrosyl peptide (corresponding to the physiological binding target for the Nck SH2 domain) was measured in solution using fluorescence polarization. Binding activity was measured using isolated SH2 domain (blue), and tcTRP24 8 -SH2 2 (a tcTRP trimer containing two copies of fused SH2 domains per subunit, i.e., six copies total; black). A control experiment was also conducted using the free 'naked' tcTRP24 8 (gray) that contained no functional protein domains. The protein concentration is normalized to account for the ratio of SH2 domains per molecule (6 SH2 domains per tcTRP 8 _SH2 2 versus 1 per free SH2). Both constructs display saturable binding and an approximate K D of 1\u22123 micromolar. All binding experiments were conducted in triplicate using independent aliquots of each protein.

Surface Plasmon Resonance ('Biacore') was used to measure the binding to captured biotinylated phosphotyrosyl peptide as described in Methods. The length and helical content of the repeats that were incorporated in our first generation of cTRPs 5, 13 were similar to those found in the naturally occurring repeat proteins listed above, while otherwise exploring geometric constraints and folding topologies (including the requirement of a closed circular architecture) that were unique from those observed in nature or found in previously solved structures. The additional structural requirement for a closed circular architecture imposed the need for heightened accuracy in the design of contacts that lead to precise rotational symmetry, such that the toroidal organization of the folded particle is realized in the correct packing and register between N-and C-terminal repeats at each protein interface.",

This appears to have been true, at least in part: the assembly of a trimer containing nine repeats (from subunits containing three repeats each) is enhanced both energetically and sterically relative to the original, comparable design and analysis of a corresponding 9-repeat trimer 13 . Additionally, whereas prior assembly a 24repeat cTRP construct from smaller subunits was inefficient 5 , the newly designed tcTRP24 8 construct displayed enhanced assembly (as indicated by size exclusion chromatography analyses that indicated all subunits were incorporated into larger particles). However, assembly of that construct was accompanied by the formation of undesired, higher-order fibrils (Fig. 5c , left) that we believe are likely promoted by 'off-register' packing between subunits, leading to a translational component (i.e., a spiral screw-axis) that confounds designed strict rotational symmetry and provides a partially exposed surface at one interface that can act as a nucleation site for subunit addition and continued extension of the protein complex. The introduction of a disulfide staple at the designed interface (which was previously required simply to promote assembly of otherwise disassociated subunits) 5 was helpful in promoting and trapping desired circularized constructs, which could then be isolated as stable particles for further analyses (Fig. 5c, right) . Future studies will examine this behavior, and the computational improvements necessary to prevent this behavior, further.",

Eight constructs were tested, corresponding to various linkers that fuse the VHH domain to the N-or C-terminal ends of each subunit, in either case generating a trimeric array of VHH domains arranged on one side of the tcTRP9x 3 scaffold. The ability of each construct to bind the SARS CoV2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) was measured using two approaches (Biolayer interferometry and ELISA); the ability of the same constructs to inhibit cell infection was measured using a pseudoviral neutralization assay. b Purification of individual constructs from E. coli. Yields ranged from~15 to~80 mg/L. c The relative ability of each construct to bind to the SARS-Cov2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was measured using an ELISA analysis, leading to EC 50 values (Supplementary Table S2) ranging from a low of 0.4 nM (construct 681) to 12 nM (construct 680). All binding experiments were conducted in triplicate using independent aliquots of each protein. Data shown as mean and s.d. for n = 3 measurements. d The relative ability of each construct to bind to the SARS-Cov2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was measured using Biolayer interferometry (BLI). The rate of association and dissociation are calculated from concentration-dependent responses. The rate of association (k a ) is plotted on the Y-axis as inverse molar second (1/MS), and the rate of dissociation (k dis ) is plotted on the X-axis as inverse second. Corresponding equilibrium binding constants (K D ) are plotted on a diagonal axis as nano molar concentrations. See also Supplementary Fig. S5. e The relative ability of each construct to achieve 50% inhibition of infection of 293T-Ace2 cells using a pseudoviral neutralization assay with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentiviruses was measured. The IC 50 values (Supplementary Table S2) ranged from 0.78 nM (construct 681) to 5.5 nM (construct 680). All experiments were conducted in triplicate using independent aliquots of each protein.

Twelve hours after seeding, five-fold antibody dilutions, starting at 50 \u00b5g/mL, were prepared. Control, virus only and cell only samples were prepared as previously reported. 60 \u00b5L of the titered virus was added and mixed with antibody dilutions and virus only wells. The mix was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 100 \u00b5L of the mix from each well was added to the corresponding well on 293-ACE2 seeded plates. Polybrene (Sigma Aldrich, P4707) was added to each well at a final concentration of 5 \u00b5g/mL. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 h post infection. Virus neutralization was assessed by measuring luminescence. While incubating, Bright-Glo Luciferase reagents (Promega, E2610) were thawed, equilibrated at room temperature, and prepared following the manufacturer's recommendation. 100 \u00b5L of growth media was removed from each well and 30 \u00b5L per well of luciferase reagent added. Plates were incubated for 2 min at room temperature in the dark and luminescence was measured using an M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Luminescence RLUs from virus only wells were normalized as 100% infectivity and RLUs from cells only were normalized as 0% infectivity. Infectivity and IC50 were calculated using Four Parameter Logistic Regression on GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).",
