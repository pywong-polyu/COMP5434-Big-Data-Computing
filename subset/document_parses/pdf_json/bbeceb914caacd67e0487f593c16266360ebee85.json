This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence, prevalence, and variants of IBV in broilers, layers, and broiler breeders farms of Gallus gallus species in Eastern Spain. Thus, 29, 16, and 14 flocks of broilers, layers and broiler breeders, respectively were analyzed. To assess seroprevalence, sera samples were analyzed by ELISA. Tracheal swabs and tissue samples were tested by PCR to know the prevalence and detect specific variants. An IBV seroprevalence of 100% was detected in the 3 productive orientations. According to PCR results, a prevalence of 38% in broilers, 44% in layers and 43% in broiler breeders was obtained. The variant-specific RT-PCR analysis showed that 4/91, Massachusetts, QX, Italy-02 and D274 strains were present in commercial flocks in eastern Spain, being 4/91 the most prevalent in all the productive orientations. In layers 100% of QX prevalence, 14% of Italy 02 and 14% of D274 was detected. Regarding broilers, a prevalence of 18% of Massachusetts strain was also detected. In contrast, in broiler breeders farms only 4/91 strain was found.",

The process of quick molecular evolution is due to the capacity of antigenic variation by mutation or recombination events allowing the adaptation to changes under selection pressure (Kusters et al., 1990) . Due to this variability, a lack of protection on the applied vaccine protocols could occur, so identifying the present strains genotype in farms is necessary to optimize control programs and the epidemiological knowledge of this pathogen. Nowadays, some different techniques are used routinely to control of IBV exposure that can detect antibody responses in sera samples like ELISA (2018) . Moreover, many reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) based techniques have been developed to identify IBV and some IBV genotypes. These molecular methods are highly sensitive and specific compared with other diagnostic methods (Alhatami et al., 2020) .",

For broilers, 14 serum samples from live birds were collected. Tissue samples of trachea and kidney were collected at each sample time from 5 broilers, with a total of 10 samples per flock (5 tracheas and 5 kidneys).

IBV has been diagnosed in Spain since the early seventies by virus isolation and serological techniques (Dolz et al., 2008) . The present study was conducted to monitoring the seroprevalence and prevalence of IBV in poultry industry in eastern Spain. The seroprevalence observed in our study in all the productive orientations (100%) is closed to that reported in Ethiopia (94%) and Nigeria (84%) (Hutton et al., 2017; Bhuiyan et al., 2018) . Moreover, the seroprevalence found in our study seems higher compared to that found by other researchers in Algeria (78.25%) (Barberis et al., 2018) , Pakistan (67%) (Ahmed et al., 2007) , and France (61%) (Auvigne et al., 2013) . The seroprevalence observed in this study may be due to higher vaccination level (Jackwood and deWit, 2013) . Also, the samples were collected at advanced ages in all the flocks being consistent with the results observed by Javed et al. (1991) and Barberis et al. (2018) who reported that the seroprevalence of IBV increased with age because of the log period of exposure to field viruses. Concerning prevalence, we found a 44% in layers, 43% in broiler breeders and 38% in broilers. In previous years, Worthington et al. (2008) showed similar rates (57%) to our research of commercial poultry in Spain. However, Giner et al. (2017) reported higher rates (78.4\u221294.4%) between 2012 and 2016. Other researchers as Andreopoulou et al., in 2019, detected higher rates (83.96%) of IBV in layer and broilers flocks in Greece. Similarly, in a study conducted by Roussan et al. (2009) in Jordanian, overall of 92.9% of commercial flocks were positive for IBV in PCR test.",
