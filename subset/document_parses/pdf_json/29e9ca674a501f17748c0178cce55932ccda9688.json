            "text": "Multiple efforts to model the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been launched in support of public health response at the national, state, and county levels. While the pandemic is global, the dynamics of this infectious disease varies with geography, local policies, and local variations in demographics. An underlying assumption of most infectious disease compartment modeling is that of a well mixed population at the resolution of the areas being modeled. The implicit need to model at fine spatial resolution is impeded by the quality of ground truth data for fine scale administrative subdivisions. To understand the trade-offs and benefits of such modeling as a function of scale, we compare the predictive performance of a SARS-CoV-2 modeling at the county, county cluster, and state level for the entire United States. Our results demonstrate that accurate prediction at the county level requires hyper-local modeling with county resolution. State level modeling does not accurately predict community spread in smaller sub-regions because state populations are not well mixed, resulting in large prediction errors. As an important use case, leveraging high resolution modeling with public health data and admissions data from Hillsborough County Florida, we performed weekly forecasts of both hospital admission and ICU bed demand for the county. The repeated forecasts between March and August 2020 were used to develop accurate resource allocation plans for Tampa General Hospital.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus reveals the important contributions that can be made by accurate mathematical modeling of infectious disease. A variety of modeling approaches can be used to predict the course of an infection in a population. While the pandemic is global, the under- 5 lying disease dynamics (and the epidemiological parameters themselves) varies with specific local policies, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), variations in demographics, healthcare infrastructure, etc. To realize the full potential of any modeling effort, forecasts and predictions must be accurate and meaningful to public health officials and governing authorities at a resolution relevant to 10 their areas of responsibility 1 . In most cases, this requires predictions be made at a hyper-local level. Models can only be used to guide closing or opening of business, predict and allocate Intensive Care Units (ICU) resources, and establish social distancing guidance if their predictions are meaningful at a scale relevant to these businesses, hospitals, and communities. 15 In practice, the ability to model at high resolution is limited by the granularity and accuracy of ground truth data, as well as the underlying modeling assumptions 2,3 . Precision of public health SARS-CoV-2 case reports, including incidence and death 4 , is impeded by multiple noise sources 5 . Clinical encounters may take place adjacent to or outside a patients residential district, testing 20 capacity, public health reporting practice, and many other factors may vary dramatically even between nearby districts. Some of these noise sources may be reduced by clustering administrative divisions or modeling at lower resolution, but this approach may violate an assumption used by most compartmental models, that the population being modeled is well mixed 6 . 25 In this paper, we compare the predictive performance of a SARS-CoV-2 model as a function of spatial scale, applying the model to county, county cluster, and state level divisions. For this purpose, we selected an epidemiological compartment model, as opposed to a regression model, to investigate changes in important disease parameters obtained at each resolution, and to avoid an approach 30 where important parameters are under determined. Predictive power and scaling behavior are expected to depend on model selection. An open source model and modeling framework were chosen so others can reproduce the results and test future extensions that may improve model performance. To evaluate the performance of the selected model we also compare the accuracy to other models 35 with predictions publicly available through the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 7, 8 . These other models include both epidemiological compartment models, regression models, and hybrid approaches. Our results reveal that, for the United States, even for fairly small states, different counties make dominant contributions to daily incidence at different times. The mean 40 average percentage error (MAPE) in predicted incidence can be 30% higher for modeling at the state level compared to aggregating model results at the scale of counties or clusters of counties. Furthermore, county level predictions made by partitioning state level predictions (for a model performing well at the state level) are 3x worse for predicted incidence and 20x worse for predicted deaths relative to the same model at the county level. These results demonstrate that modeling resolution must be guided by the requirements of the consumer of the predictions. State level modeling strongly violates the assumption of well mixed populations and will lead to inaccurate predictions at a county level even while performing well at the state level. In order to test the performance of 50 the COVID-19 models at the county level, IBM partnered with Tampa General Hospital (TGH) to forecast COVID-19 incidences within Hillsborough County. Hillsborough County accounts for a large portion of the Tampa Florida population. Tampa General Hospital (TGH) is the only Level 1 Trauma Center within the Tampa region. As COVID cases rose in early March, TGH has 55 treated an average of 20.4 percent of the Hillsborough COVID-19 cases with a max distribution of 45.0 percent of all COVID-19 cases in Hillsborough County. The forecasting models would become imperative to ensure adequate strategic planning for hospital capacity, staffing, and supplies as the virus spread.",

This data is further curated; for instance, the post-processing ensures that the number of confirmed cases is a monotonically increasing curve. 65 The data is refreshed every day around 9AM PST to reflect updates of the previous day. More information on the reference data 10, 11, 12 , and on the CDC challenge models 7 used for model comparison is available in the supplement. 16 . A number of models for SARS-CoV-2 from multiple authors were evaluated 17, 18, 19 . For this study we use the model shown in figure 1 , which includes transmission from both asymptomatic (A), pre-symptomatic (C), and 75 infectious individuals (I). Moreover, we capture infectious individuals who experience a worsening of symptoms (W ) before either dying of the disease (D) or recovering (R). This model is a simple extension to the SACIR model available on the Eclipse site. Model parameters and initial conditions were selected by a combination of liter-80 ature references, grid search, and data-driven estimation through a Nelder-Mead AI simplex algorithm available in the STEM framework. The flow diagram of figure 1 translates into a system of ODE's reported in the supplemental Eq. 2. The definition of each compartment, all model parameters, literature values, and methods of parameter estimation are discussed in the supplement. The basic 85 epidemiological model was used to forecast at three spatial resolutions (counties, county clusters, and states). Definition of county clusters is described in the supplement.",

Since public health reporting usually takes place after a clinical encounter, the transition between the pre-symptomatic compartment (C) and the infectious compartment (I) was used to log daily incidence (red arrow, figure 1 ). Here we introduce a pre-symptomatic compartment C in place of the usual exposed 95 compartment E based on documented evidence for replication-competent virus obtained from patients before the onset of symptoms 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 . Thus, we describe the rate of individuals leaving the C compartment as a symptom appearance rate as opposed to an incubation rate. The processes are similar in that they both would contribute to a period of latency between exposure and 100 clinical encounter. We chose the nomenclature to indicate that individuals in the C compartment contribute to the disease force of infection. The steady state solution to the differential equations 2 shown in the supplement provides the following expression for the basic reproductive number, R 0 as a function of the epidemiological parameters. Background birth and death rates 105 are omitted. Individuals in the W compartment do not contribute to the force of infection.",

From figure 5a it is clear that modeling at either county or county-cluster resolution lowers the mean absolute percent predictive error by 30% for each of the four future weeks. County and county cluster resolutions yield comparable results. All three resolutions provide comparable predictive 210 accuracy for cumulative deaths (figure 5c) at least in the first two weeks. State level prediction accuracy of cumulative deaths degrades slightly faster after two week. Figures 5b and 5d test the complementary hypothesis. If larger regions are truly well mixed, then prediction at at higher resolution could be obtained by simply 215 dividing or distributing predictions made for larger regions by the fraction of population in each sub-region. Figures 5b and 5d show the average MAPE for three methods to predict incidence or deaths at the county level. In each of the two figures, the red curve shows the average MAPE for county level predictions obtained by dividing the state level model output to obtain county 220 level predictions. The blue curve represents county level predictions obtained by dividing county cluster level model output. The green curve is simply the average MAPE from modeling at the county level itself (not aggregated by state as in figures 5a and 5c). From the data in figures 5b and 5d, we list in Table 1 the ratio of MAPE 225 in prediction of county incidence or deaths based on state or county-cluster regions relative to modeling at the county level. The error ratios decrease with time (prediction week) as the MAPE increases for all resolutions over time. Looking at predictions one week into the future, county level predictions based on state level modeling have \u223c3.3x higher error for predicted incidence and over 230 20x higher higher error for predicted deaths. Modeling counties at the countycluster level, compared to county level, results in 1.8x higher error for predicted incidence and over 8x higher higher error for predicted deaths.

The goal of this paper is not to identify a best model or paradigm, but to explore the question of modeling resolution 260 itself. Figures 4a and 4b compare the predictive power of models at several spatial resolutions. Modeling at a spatial scale corresponding to administrative divisions of states may have advantages in terms of reduced computational complexity and cost. While public health reports by county, lowering spatial resolution allows 265 aggregation of inherently noisy data which contributes to computational complexity and cost.

            "text": "The copyright holder for this this version posted November 18, 2020. ; Figure 3 and associated data in the supplement demonstrates -from raw data alone -that different sub-regions within states make dominant contributions 270 to aggregate state level incidence and deaths at different times. Figure 5 and Table 1 show that the statistical error (MAPE) in predicted incidence at the state level is 30% higher for modeling states compared to modeling at the level or counties or clusters of counties. Furthermore, testing the well mixed population assumption, the same figures reveal that county level predictions made 275 by partitioning state level predictions (for a model performing well at the state level) are 3x worse for predicted incidence and 20x worse for predicted deaths relative to the same model at the county level. Figures 5a and 5c do indicate the possibility of diminishing returns as average MAPE in predicted incidence and deaths has similar (or even slightly lower) error at county-cluster resolution 280 than at county resolution. Aggregating data to county clusters does provide noise reduction. Some of this noise is associated with artifacts of public health case reporting where incidence may be reported based on clinical location as opposed to patient residence. In other cases reporting location may be skewed by local public health practices. This is evidenced by public health data made 285 available early in the pandemic where reported case counts and deaths were zero in Bronx, NY, while the epidemic grew exponentially in all adjacent boroughs 25 . Local reporting bias suggests that the optimal trade-off between noise reduction and spatial resolution may vary locally and even change over time as public health systems become more efficient over the course of an extended 290 pandemic. Whatever decision one makes in optimizing modeling performance, the measure of success must be based on the accuracy achieved at the spatial resolution required by the consumers of the data. In the case of TGH Hillsborough, modeling at the county level the statistical error was < 6% (figure 6). Had the county prediction been based on state level modeling, the uncertainty 295 would have increased by a factor of \u223c3.3x to almost 20% (see Table 1 ), greatly reducing confidence in the forecast. With relative accuracy from the model performance, TGH was able to consume the COVID forecasting model in two primary ways. In mid-June, as COVID-19 cases began a rapid rise in Hillsborough County, TGH leadership faced a 300 difficult decision on whether or not to begin canceling operations to make capacity for the surging COVID-19 cases. As demonstrated in figure 6 , the model accuracy improved in June between actual vs forecast, and predicted a peak incidence on 7/20/2020 and peak ICU on 7/26/2020. TGH then used the Hillsborough COVID model projections to define a TGH specific hospital capacity 305 forecast and to inform leadership that TGH would have enough capacity to handle the surge. As other health systems were canceling operations, based on information the models presented, TGH leadership decided to continue surgical procedures allowing for continuity in patient care and financial stability of the health system. With the data monitored 2-3x a week, TGH was able 310 to strategically allocate resources, supplies, and staff to accommodate for the surge. The model was directionally reliable enough to generate and execute on this strategic COVID capacity plan. Note, the forecasts made in late July should not be taken as predictive of the likelihood future epidemic waves will 12 .

With regard to the second point, an example of the former (i.e., inter-county affinity) would be 455 suburban regions and satellite township centred around large or economically major cities while for the latter (i.e., inter-county affinity) it would be large rural counties which usually tend to be self contained.

            "text": "An important variable in the SACIR model is the case reporting rate, \u03be. This parameter partitions new incidence across two paths; symptomatic infectious and asymptomatic infectious. The name suggests that asymptomatic cases are not reported whereas symptomatic cases are. However, the true fraction of reported cases is affected by a convolution of factors (including, but not only, the 480 rate of asymptomatic infection). These includes cases that were truly asymptomatic, cases with symptoms so mild as to not result in an clinical encounter, and/or the efficiency of reporting process itself. For seasonal influenza the fraction of cases registered by public health has been reported to be as low as 3% in some jurisdictions 29 . The asymptomatic fraction of SARS-CoV-2 has been 485 reported to be in a very wide range of 15-90% 52,55,27,43 . The reporting parameter is also affected by the underlying assumption that the population in a region being modeled is well mixed. If one constructs a model where a very large region, hence where the density of people is low, is treated as one well mixed node, this is a source of prediction error. Consider, for example, a patch 490 model where a large country (Admin level 0) is treated as one well mixed region. The model puts the entire population of that country in one patch. But, if the actual epidemic is concentrated in one sub-region or city, that scenario has a built in error. Since the entire population is not well mixed, the denominator in the mass action terms, that is, the parameter N in Eqs. 2, should be the 495 population of the affected province or city -not the whole country. In treating reference data from a single city as if it represents an entire country, simplex solver will compensate by decreasing the case reporting rate to an unrealistically low value. Therefore, derived parameter values can be influenced by artifacts related to spatial resolution. The A compartment (see figure 1 ) includes all 500 non-reported incidence. The symptom appearance rate (see Table 4 ) contributes a latency between infection and reporting (similar to incubation rate in an SEIR model) with presymptomatic individuals also contributing to the force of infection.

Moreover, it also describes the fraction of patients whose symptoms become more severe after the clinical infectious period, 510 and is a proxy for demand of clinical intensive care units (ICUs). Individuals in this compartment do not contribute the force of infection, as they are assumed to be clinically isolated in an ICU. Background birth and death rates are assumed to be zero.

As R 0 is a ratio of transmission rate to recovery rate(s), (please refer to Equation 1), we need to vary only one of these two parameters to avoid over fitting. We chose to vary the transmission rate and set the recovery rate(s) based on literature estimates. Please also recall that in our approach, the transmission 525 rate is time sensitive in the sense that we have multiple transmission rate to account for the different interventions. However, the recovery rate(s) are the same for the entire time period, as it is the characteristics of the disease and there has not been a significant change in the treatment regimen. A recent paper 40 has estimated that the recovery time of the asymptomatic individuals is 530 roughly the same as that of those who exhibit symptoms, which is about 14-20 days. However, in our case, the infected individuals are split into two categories, compartment I and compartment W , where the latter represents patients with advanced stage of illness. Consequently, we split the recovery rates into three, asymptomatic recovery rate (\u03b3 a ), recovery rate for I (\u03b3 i ) and, recovery rate for 535 W (\u03b3 w ). \u03b3 a was set based to be 16 days, close to the midpoint region of the range provide in 40 . \u03b3 i was set to be on the lower extreme of the range -14 days, and \u03b3 w was set to the upper limit of the range -20 days 45 . It is important to highlight that since we vary the transmission rate over a range of continuous values, and as there are multiple transmission rates to fit the different portions 540 of the data, the impact of the choice of recovery rates is mitigated so long as it in the clinically valid range. The transmission rates were allowed to vary from 0.02 to 0.85, which we determined through experiments covered all the ranges possible based on the data we had at the time of the experiment. Immunity loss rate was fixed based on 545 an estimated 10 months period of infection 38 . As mentioned earlier, Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm was used to fit the variable parameters and the algorithm was run multiple times with reinitializations until a convergence in the parameter values was obtained across two runs.
