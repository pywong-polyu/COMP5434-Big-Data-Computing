            "text": "Artificial neural networks perform state-of-the-art in an ever-growing number of tasks, and nowadays they are used to solve an incredibly large variety of tasks. There are problems, like the presence of biases in the training data, which question the generalization capability of these models. In this work we propose EnD, a regularization strategy whose aim is to prevent deep models from learning unwanted biases. In particular, we insert an \"information bottleneck\" at a certain point of the deep neural network, where we disentangle the information about the bias, still letting the useful information for the training task forward-propagating in the rest of the model. One big advantage of EnD is that we do not require additional training complexity (like decoders or extra layers in the model), since it is a regularizer directly applied on the trained model. Our experiments show that EnD effectively improves the generalization on unbiased test sets, and it can be effectively applied on real-case scenarios, like removing hidden biases in the COVID-19 detection from radiographic images.",

            "text": "In the last two decades artificial neural network models (ANNs) received huge interest from the research community. Nowadays, complex and even ill-posed problems can be tackled provided that one can train a deep enough ANN model with a large enough dataset. Furthermore, they aim to become a powerful tool helping us take a variety of decisions: for example, AI is currently used for scouting and hiring people [17] . These ANNs are trained to process a desired output from some inputs. We have no clear idea how the information is effectively processed inside. Recently, AI trustworthiness has been recognized as major prerequisite for people and societies to use and accept such systems [14, 33] . In April 2019, the High-Level Expert Group This work has been accepted as a conference paper for the 2021 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2021). on AI of the European Commission defined the three main aspects of trustworthy AI [14] : it should be lawful, ethical and robust. Providing a warranty on this topic is currently a matter of study and discussion. Focusing on the concept of robustness for AI, Attenberg et al. discussed the problem of finding the so-called \"unknown unknowns\" [3] in data. These unknown unknowns relate to the case when the deep model elaborates information in an unintended way, but shows high confidence on its predictions. Such behavior affected many recent works proposing AI-based solutions on the COVID detection from radiographic images. Unfortunately, the available datasets at the beginning of the pandemic were heavily biased. This often resulted in models predicting COVID diagnosis with a high confidence, thanks to the presence of unwanted biases, for example by detecting the presence of catheters or medical devices for positive patients, their age (at the beginning of the pandemic, most ill patients were elderly people), or even by recognizing the origin of the data itself (when negative cases were augmented borrowing samples from other datasets) [2, 25, 26] . In this work we propose a regularization strategy which Entangles the deep features extracted by patterns belonging to the same target class and Disentangles the biased features: we name it EnD, and with it we wish to put an end to the bias propagation in any deep model. We assume we know data might have some bias (like in the case of COVID, the origin of data) but we ignore what it translates into (we do not have a prior knowledge on whether the bias is the presence of some color, a specific feature in the image or anything else). EnD regularizes the output of some layer \u0393 within the deep model in order to create an \"information bottleneck\" where the regularizer: tracted in favor of the unbiased ones. Compared to other de-biasing techniques, we have no training overhead: we do not train extra models to perform gradient inversion on the biased information or involve the use of GaNs, or even de-bias the input data. EnD works directly on the target model, and is minimized via standard back-propagation. In general, directly tackling the problem of mutual information's minimization is hard, given both its nondifferentiability and the computational complexity involved. Nonetheless, previous works have already shown that adding further constraints to the learning problem could be effective [28] as, typically, the trained ANN models are over-sized and allows a large number of solutions to the same learning task [27] . Our experiments show that EnD effectively favors the choice of unbiased features over the biased ones at training time, yielding competitive generalization capabilities compared to models trained with other un-biasing techniques. The rest of the work is structured as follows. In Sec. 2 we review some works close to our problem. Then, in Sec. 3 we introduce EnD in detail providing intuitions on its effect. Sec. 4 shows some empirical results and finally, in Sec. 5, the conclusions are drawn.",

            "text": "In this section we review state-of-the-art techniques designed to prevent models from learning biases. The techniques can be grouped into (but not limited to) three main approaches: direct data de-biasing from the source, use of GANs/ensembling towards data de-biasing and direct learning the de-biasing within the trained model. De-biasing from data source It is known that datasets are typically affected by biases. In their work, Torralba and Efros [30] showed how biases affect some of the most commonly used datasets, drawing considerations on the generalization performance and classification capability of the trained ANN models. Following a similar approach, Tommasi et al. [29] conducted experiments reporting differences between a number of datasets and verifying how final performances vary when applying different de-biasing strategies in order to balance data. Working at the dataset level is in general a critical aspect, and greatly helps in understanding the data and its structure [8] . The concept of removing bias by using data borrowed by different sources has been explored in a practical and empirical context by Gupta et al. [11] . In particular, they have designed a debiasing strategy to minimize the effects of imperfect execution and calibration errors by reducing the effect of unbalanced data, showing improvements in the generalization of the final model. Adversarial and ensembling approaches. Having an explicit formulation for the bias contribution in the loss term is typically hard. One possible approach is to use additional models to learn the biases in data and use them to condition the primary model so that it avoids them. Kim et al. use adversarial learning and gradient inversion to eliminate the information related to the biases in the model [16] . Another possibility is to use the gray-level co-occurence matrix to extract unbiased features and to train the model, as proposed by Wang et al. with HEX [32] . Alvi et al. propose the BlindEye [1] technique, where they train a classifier on the extracted deep features to retrieve information from biases: then, they force the \"bias classifier\" to be no longer able to retrieve bias-related information, modifying the deep features accordingly. Bahng et al. [4] develop an ensembling-based technique, called ReBias. It consists in solving a min-max problem where the target is to promote the independence between the network prediction and all biased predictions. Identifying the \"known unknowns\" [3] and optimize on those using a neural networks ensemble is the approach proposed by Nam et al. with their LfF [21] . A similar approach is followed by Clark et al. in their LearnedMixin [6] . De-biasing within the deep model. Dataset de-biasing helps in the learning process, as training is performed with no biases; however, with such an approach we typically have no direct control on the information we are removing from the dataset itself, or we are including an extremelyhigh computational complexity like when training GANs. A context in which, on the contrary, we can have direct access to these biases is presented by Hendricks et al. [13] . In such a work it was possible to explicitly introduce a corrective loss term (coherent with the formulation introduced by Vinyals et al. [31] ) with the aim to help the ANN model to focus on the correct features. Similarly, Cadene et al. propose RUBi [5] where they use logit re-weighting to lower the bias impact in the learning process, and Sagawa et al., with Group-DRO [23] , avoid bias overfitting by defining prior data sub-groups and controlling their generalization. EnD belongs to this class of approaches, since we directly regularize the trained model, with no additional parameters to be learned. In Sec. 3 we are going to describe in detail the approach we take in order to EnD bias propagation in the trained model.",

We encode the biases as three different colors (green, orange and blue), while the target class is represented by the arrows marker (triangle, square and circle). Typically, training a deep model without taking biases into account produces feature representations shown in Fig. 2a : here, the loss on the target classes is minimized (three distinct groups are formed depending on the arrow marker), but it is driven by a heavy bias (the colors of the arrows). The purpose of EnD is to disentangle the representations belonging to the same bias class (color) and to entangle the representations with the same target class (the arrow's marker). Fig. 2b represents the effect of EnD on the deep representations: while the disentangling term un-groups the biased example's representations, i.e. makes corresponding vectors almost orthogonal, the entangling one promotes correlations between samples having the same target.",

This dataset is constructed from the MNIST dataset [18] by injecting a color into the images background, as shown in Figure 3 . Each digit is associated with one of ten pre-defined colors. To assign the color bias to an image of a given target class, the pre-defined color is selected with a probability \u03c1, and any other color is chosen with a probability (1 \u2212 \u03c1). To vary the level of difficulty in the dataset, the authors select \u03c1 \u2208 {0.990, 0.995, 0.997, 0.999}. Higher values of \u03c1 correspond to higher correlation between target class and bias class (color). Two testing datasets are constructed with the same criterion: biased, with \u03c1 = 1.0, and unbiased, with \u03c1 = 0.1. Given the low correlation between color and digit class in the unbiased test set, models must learn to classify shapes instead of colors in order to reach a high accuracy. Setup. We use the network architecture proposed by Bahng et al. [4] , consisting of four convolutional layers with 7\u00d77 kernels. The EnD regularization term is applied on the average pooling layer, before the fully connected classifier of the network. Results. Results are shown in Table 1 . EnD's results are averaged across three different runs for each value of \u03c1. For all values of \u03c1 we report the accuracy obtained by EnD on the unbiased evaluation set, compared with other debiasing algorithms. EnD successfully mitigates bias propagation. The improvement obtained with EnD with respect to the baseline model is noticeable, especially in the higher levels of difficulty. We observe an increase of accuracy across all values of \u03c1. Notably, for \u03c1 = 0.999 the vanilla model reaches 10.4% accuracy, meaning that the background color is used as the only cue for classifying the digits, whereas employing EnD yields an accuracy of 52.30%. Figure 4 shows the effect of EnD, using Grad-CAM [24] to highlight the important regions of the input image for the model prediction. We observe that the vanilla model (Figure 4a ) focuses on the background, while the EnD-regularized model (Figure 4b ) correctly learns to focus on the digit shape. Comparison with other techniques. We observe that EnD yields the highest results among all of the compared debiasing algorithms. Such gap is especially higher in the most difficult settings for \u03c1 \u2208 {0.999, 0.997} where many algorithms are unable to generalize to the unbiased set, especially HEX [32] and LearnedMixin [6] . Some of the compared algorithms even show a collapse in accuracy compared to the vanilla baseline in certain cases (HEX for most values of \u03c1, LearnedMixin and ReBias for \u03c1 = 0.990). Ablation study. We also perform an ablation study of EnD to analyze how each of the EnD's terms affect the performance of the trained model. For a fixed \u03c1 = 0.997, we evaluate only the contribution of the disentangling term R \u22a5 and disable the entangling term R by setting \u03b2 = 0. We then perform the opposite evaluation by setting \u03b1 = 0, to only take into account the entangling term. The results are shown in Table 2 . We observe that both the regularization terms contribute to boost the model's generalization capability. As expected, the best results are achieved when both of them are jointly applied. The entangling term yields a higher increase in performance compared to the disentangling one, however it is in general not always applicable, for example when, given some i-th sample y i ,",

We find that the ideal case for EnD is when both of the terms can be used in the learning process, leading to better generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we observe a similar pattern in the learning process when employing the full EnD regularization for different values of \u03c1. Figure 5 shows the learning curves for \u03c1 = 0.995. We notice how models tend to quickly learn the color bias in the first few epochs, as the accuracy on the biased test set is close to 100% (Figure 5a) . However, once the value of the loss (in this case, we have used the cross-entropy loss, Figure 5c ) falls below a certain threshold, the contribution R of the EnD term becomes predominant (Figure 5d ). In this phase, which we call kick-in region, the optimization process begin to rapidly minimize R, stopping the model from relying on the biasrelated features. This can be observed in the rapid increase of the accuracy on the unbiased test set (Figure 5b) , whereas the biased accuracy momentarily drops as the models shift their focus from the background color to the digit shape.",

Besides the perfomance evaluation on the test set, when training on EB1 we also tested the model's performance on EB2, and viceversa. This allows us to better evaluate the bias features' influence on the model prediction. We notice how the baseline model is heavily biased towards age when predicting gender, and towards gender when predicting age. This can be observed on the performance achieved on the EB2 and EB1 sets, both for gender and age prediction. When employing our regularization term, we observe an increase across all of the obtained results: in particular, when training on EB2 for age prediction, we notice an increase from 48.91% to 74.25% on the EB1 set. We also report reference results of other debiasing algorithms, specifically BlindEye [1] and the adversarial approach proposed by Kim et al. [16] . In general, EnD obtains the best results among all the other debiasing algorithms we compared to. [7, 20, 26] shows that merging CXRs coming from different sources poses bias issues, since differences in acquisition techniques given by the scan machines or composition of the population sample might be used by the deep model to distinguish the provenance of the data itself, even when pre-processing techniques are employed. For CORDA, we notice that data coming from Citt\u00e1 della Salute e della Scienza contain a majority of positive samples, while data coming from San Luigi Gonzaga have a majority of negative samples. Hence, if distinguishing features are embedded in the scans, then the networks might learn to discriminate the source of the data, instead of actually classifying between COVID positives and negatives. To build the test sets, we use 30% of CORDA-CDSS and 30% of CORDA-SLG. The remaining data are then merged and used as training set. Testing on the two distinguished sets allows us to assess whether the prediction of the models are biased towards the origin of the data.",

On the other hand, on CORDA-SLG (which contains mostly negative samples) we notice a lower TPR compared to the sensibly higher TNR. Employing EnD helps in improving the results in this case too. While maintaining a similar TPR on CORDA-CDSS and TNR on CORDA-SLG, we obtain an improvement of the TNR 59.26%\u219276.30% and of the TPR 52.14%\u219268.37% on CORDA-CDSS and CORDA-SLG, respectively. This also results in an increased balanced accuracy (BA) on both of the test sets.

Differently from other de-biasing techniques, we do not introduce any additional parameters to be learned and we do not modify the input data: the model itself is naturally driven into choosing deep features which are unbiased, without introducing additional priors to the data. Our experiments show the effectiveness of EnD when compared to other state-ofthe-art techniques, excelling in the cases of heavily-biased data (like \u03c1 = 0.999 for Biased MNIST or IMDB). As an application case, we have also tested the effect of EnD on the COVID diagnosis from CXR images, where the bias is given by the data source and it is not straightforward to detect. In this case we have observed an overall improvement of the performance on the test set as well, showing that our technique may be employed to build more reliable models even in more sensitive tasks.",
