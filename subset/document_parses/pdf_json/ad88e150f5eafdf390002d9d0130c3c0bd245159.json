In 2020, the year of the 75th anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ITER, the world's largest fusion experiment, began its machine assembly, and next year, the DEMO (fusion power) stage of ITER planning is formally due to begin. With several countries now engaged in the design of DEMO-phase machines, we stress that a \"burning plasma\" self-sustaining fusion reaction event will be a critical juncture similar in status to the Trinity Test. In response, urging the need for US geopolitical engagement, we call for a \"Global Commission for Urgent Action on Fusion Energy,\" to be backed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and International Energy Agency (IEA), along the lines of the existing IEA \"Global Commission for Urgent Action on Energy Efficiency.\" We see the Commission serving a similar, this time international, role to the 1946 \"Acheson-Lilienthal\" report for fission and involving a global External Independent Review of the state-of-the art of fusion energy technologies. We suggest major \"soft power\" co-chairs from the Global West and North and from the Global South, thereby providing a geopolitical pivot which can unlock tens of billions of dollars in funding for multiple technology pathways, create a global regime to safeguard Intellectual Property, accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to a \"Future Fusion Economy,\" and prevent the geopolitical polarization of fusion energy.",

That said, in the year of the 75th anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ITER, the world's largest fusion experiment, began its machine assembly (ITER 2020a), thus placing fusion energy within long-range military planning. The leader of at least one great world power is now publicly stressing that fusion energy should be used for peaceful purposes, a tacit admission of the alternative: the weaponization of fusion (Franceschini et al. 2013) . As the DEMO (fusion energy) planning phase of ITER begins in the coming decade, and as the private sector and venture capital prepare to take over the baton from public sector against the background of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 (Holroyd 2020), we warn that a \"burning plasma\" event represents a \"critical juncture\" of the like the world has not seen since the Trinity Test.",

A fusion \"burning plasma\" (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2019) is of the same level of import not only because of the potential for militarization but also because of its potential commercial impact and contribution to managing climate change.",

The urgency of this new perspective derives by reason of the fact that Industry 4.0 is only at the initial stage of its development and that the main achievements are occurring now, roughly as predicted, in the 2020-2025 timeframe (Lorenz et al. 2015) . Furthermore, the normative dimensions (responsible/irresponsible, ethical/unethical) and policies that define global governance of Industry 4.0 are lacking a holistic vision that takes into account the real impact of such issues. Industry 5.0 aims to provide that vision and fusion energy will likely benefit from harmonizing and maximizing human-machine interaction, whether in optimizing test shots for a prototype fusion reactor (Strugatsky 2020) or human-robot service and maintenance systems for reactor construction and cores (The Agility Effect 2016; Kidambi 2017), as well as from a common human vision of what fusion energy can offer industry and society, including facilitating humanity's expansion into space (e.g., Cohen et al. 2019) .",

The discussions on Industry 4.0 and society have tended to focus on either a dystopian fearful future shaped by the IoT where robots (\"CoBots\") with AI replace humans, or a future that will invariably be benevolent and prosperous for all with the introduction of the Industry 4.0. Both visions subscribe, however, to technological determinism (evolution in organizational behavior, acceptance of robots in the workplace, evolution in organizational structures and workflows, evolution in work ethics, discrimination against robots or people, privacy and trust in a human-robot collaborative work environment, education and training, redesign of workplaces for robots) (Demir et al. 2019) , and as if the emergence of Industry 4.0 and its societal shaping and impacts are preordained and inevitable, they do not yet acknowledge the need to broaden the understanding of Industry 4.0 outcomes and its multiple possible futures in society (\u00d6zdemir and Hekim 2018; Paschek et al. 2019; Pereira et al. 2020 ). On the push of technological pervasiveness, Industry 4.0 extends its impact to the whole society, which can be considered a larger ecosystem. In fact, if on the one hand the digitization process concerned more specifically a series of measures attributable to the optimization of industrial production processes (supply chain management, manufacturing and production in smart factories), on the other, the digital transformation implies a reorganization of the sociocultural paradigms centered on the most disparate technological innovations (Nambisan et al. 2019) .",

In addition, both China and the US are nuclear, and an escalating Sino-US military conflict is thus theorized to be constrained by Mutually Assured Destruction.

Seven years after fission generated commercial electricity, the world's first fission-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Enterprise, came into service in 1961.

Basic market principles for an innovative industry require the development of the demand side, i.e., growing a customer base, including education in the product. Developing a customer base in the Global South is complicated due to the lower level of innovation in the majority of these countries, bar some exceptions, like Singapore. However, a G77-brokered commission would give Global South countries, which control over three trillion dollars via primarily fossil fuel sovereign wealth funds, a realistic insight into the prospects of fusion power plants within this century.",

By involving the G77, civil society, and environmental groups in the External Independent Report, we adopt the quintuple helix innovation framework, an extension of innovation economics that has already been applied to global warming (Carayannis et al. 2012) . The quintuple helix builds on the traditional interaction of academic, the public sector, and private industry by adding the public, here the global public and international civil society, who would also be consulted, together with socioecological interactions with the natural environment, here, the climate. Depending on the findings, the status and credibility of the fusion private sector could be enhanced, and they could earn the support of the global \"Green Lobby.\"",
