We systematically reviewed databases until August 15, 2020 and among initial 851 articles, 30 articles entered this study (20 case reports, 4 cohorts, and 6 controlled clinical trials). The types of reactions included AGEP, morbiliform drug eruptions, vasculitis, DRESS syndrome, urticarial vasculitis, and so on. The treatments have been used before side effects occur, included: antimalarial, anti-viral, antibiotics, tocilizumab, enoxaparin and and so on. In pandemic, we found 0.004% to 4.15% of definite drug-induced mucocutaneous reactions. The interval between drug usage and the eruption varied about few hours to 1 month; tightly dependent to the type of drug and hydroxychloroqine seems to be the drug with highest mean interval. Antivirals, antimalarials, azithromycin, and tocilizumab are most responsive drugs for adverse drug reactions, but antivirals especially in combination with antimalarial drugs are in the first step. Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes or urticarial eruptions, which mostly may manage by steroids during few days. In the setting of HCQ, specific reactions like AGEP should be considered. Lopinavir/ritonavir is the most prevalent used drug among antivirals with the highest skin adverse reaction; ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce cutaneous drug reactions but favipiravir has no or less adverse effects.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] In Tables 2, 4 cohort studies are shown. In cohort studies based on the drugs have been used the overall rate of mucocutaneous dermatologic eruptions ranged from 0.004% to 4.15%. Antivirals, antimalarials, azithromycin, and tocilizumab were most responsive drugs for adverse reactions. It seems that antivirals especially in combination with antimalarial drugs may have the highest rate of skin reactions. Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes or urticarial eruptions. Pruritus, bullous rashes and skin dyspigmentations were other observed dermatologic adverse effects of drugs used for management of COVID-19. 24-28 Table 5 shows cohort studies reported dermatologic rashes in the setting of COVID-19 but with uncertainty about exact origin; means that exactly say about they were virus-related or drug-related. 28 The reported mucocutaneous reaction rate in these series of studies was about 5.7% to 45.5%, and the drugs were suspected as the cause of these drug reactions were mainly antimalarials, antivirals, azithromycin, systemic steroids, and tocilizumab with different prevalence distributions in various studies. Antimalarials, antivirals, azithromycin were the most prevalent drugs used for therapy and morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular, purpuric, EM-like and PR-like eruptions were the most observed mucocutaneous reactions of these drugs. 28 In Tables 3 and 4 controlled clinical trial studies have been shown which were 5 articles with 2 arms [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] and 1 article with 3 arms. 34 It seems that favipiravir has no or less skin adverse reactions in comparison with lopinavir/ritonavir. Remdisivir could induce mucocutaneous rash but the most probable cause of skin reactions between antivirals is related to lopinavir/ritonavir (21%). Ruxolitinib is another drug may cause mucocutaneous reactions (10%). Interferon-alfa my decrease rate of dermatologic reactions of antivirals such as ribavirin or lopinavir/ritonavir based on what we observed in combination therapy regimens. Logically it should be notified that the rate of dermatologic adverse effects among anivirals may relate to their frequency of usage and since lopinavir/ritonavir at the time of data gathering of this systematic review was the most prevalent used antiviral; so it is not unexpected to see the most dermatologic reactions among antivirals by this drug. the form of vasculitis 2 days after administration of amoxicillin, ibuprofen, metamizole, intravenous prednisolone and antihistamine. 8 The skin biopsy confirmed drug-induced vasculitis. The patient was treated with high dose systemic steroid and complete remission was achieved 9 days after treatment. According to case reports studies drug dependent skin manifestations may occur a few hours to a month after taking the drug and usually last less than a week. The interval between drug usage and the eruption varies about few hours to 1 month and it is tightly dependent on the type of drug was used; hydroxychloroquine seems to be the drug with highest mean interval.

Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes and urticarial eruptions which mostly may manage by steroids during few days. In the setting of HCQ, specific reactions like AGEP should be considered. lopinavir/ritonavir is the most prevalent used drug with the highest skin adverse reaction among antivirals; ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce cutaneous drug reactions but favipiravir has no or less adverse effects. It should be notified that logically the rate of dermatologic adverse effect among antivirals is related to their frequency of usage, too. Although very rare, we may encounter challenging sever or potentially life threatening mucocutaneous adverse drug reaction. Knowing more about the probable druginduced mucocutaneous presentations of COVID-19, is really of great value for better management of encountered cases.",

The most important drug categories for new coronavirus are: Antimalarials (Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine), Azithromycin, Antivirals (Remdesivir, Oseltamivir/Favipiravir/Umifenovir, Ribavirin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, sofosbuvir, nitazoxanide), biologic or chemical targeted therapies (janus kinase inhibitors, TNF-a inhibitors, Tocilizumab, Anakinra, Checkpoints inhibitors, Camostat mesylate), Classic Immunomodulators (Colchicine, Interferons, Corticosteroids, IVIG) and the Vaccines. Among these drugs, some affect virus itself, some affect virus-associated cytokine storm, immune dysregulation and organ failures and some (eg, Azithromycin) other than their anti-inflammatory characteristics, may positively affect on concomitant complications like possible bacterial infection. 1 Naturally, every drug or drug category has its own adverse effects including mucocutaneous drug reactions that some of them are more prevalent, popular or serious.

Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes and urticarial eruptions which mostly may manage by steroids during few days. Pruritus, bullous rashes, skin dyspigmentations, purpuric, EMlike and PR-like eruptions are other probable observed dermatologic adverse effects of drugs in COVID pandemic. Based on the best we know, lopinavir/ritonavir is the most prevalent used drug with the highest skin adverse reaction among antivirals, ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce mucocutaneous drug reactions (about 10%). It seems that favipiravir has no or less skin adverse reactions in comparison with lopinavir/ritonavir. Ruxolitinib is another drug may cause mucocutaneous reactions (10%).
