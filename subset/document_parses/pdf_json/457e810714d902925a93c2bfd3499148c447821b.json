Alternatively, elevated cardiac biomarkers may merely act as a proxy for the severity of ARDS. Previous human and animal studies have shown an increase in BNP levels in response to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction [39] [40] [41] . BNP is also thought to have a pulmonary vasorelaxant effect that may be part of the natural compensatory response.",

Demonstration of a low pulmonary artery wedge pressure via invasive measurement is no longer a pre-requisite in diagnosing ARDS [2] . Hence, it is possible that subclinical left heart failure may be under-recognised in this population and cardiac biomarkers may be a reflection of this. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the prognostic value of biomarkers of both myocardial stretch (brain natriuretic peptides) and cardiac injury (cardiac troponins) in patients with ARDS. There are a number of important limitations to the study. Firstly, there is considerable heterogeneity between the studies in the meta-analyses. These heterogeneities persisted in subgroup analyses. There was also evidence of publication bias and the influence of some of the smaller studies may have inflated the OR associated with high levels of BNP and NT-proBNP. We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis using a fixedeffects model ( Figure S1 ), which weights the findings according to sample size. In this analysis, the association with higher mortality persisted, albeit at a somewhat lower OR (OR 3.16; CI 2.55-3.92). Secondly, most studies included retrospectively determined cut-points either through the use of median values or by ROC analysis. These cut-points have not been prospectively validated and varied between studies. Thirdly, the large confidence intervals, especially for studies assessing BNP and Troponin-T, reflect the lack of precision in the findings and could lead to a failure to identify statistically significant clinically important associations. The funnel plots also suggest some publication bias. Finally, several studies included in our review did not contain sufficient information to be included in the meta-analysis, which could introduce bias to our findings. However, the findings of our systematic review are consistent with our meta-analysis.",
