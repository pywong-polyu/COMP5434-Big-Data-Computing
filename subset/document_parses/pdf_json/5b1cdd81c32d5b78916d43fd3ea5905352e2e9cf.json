            "text": "Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are very sensitive and specific methods, but they mainly rely on centralized laboratories and therefore are not suitable for point-of-care testing. Here, we present a 3D microfluidic paper-based electrochemical NAAT. These devices use off-the-shelf gold plasma-coated threads to integrate electroanalytical readouts using ex situ self-assembled monolayer formation on the threads prior to assembling into the paper device. They further include a sandwich hybridization assay with sample incubation, rinsing, and detection steps all integrated using movable stacks of filter papers to allow time-sequenced reactions. The devices use glass fiber substrates for storing recombinase polymerase amplification reagents and conducting the isothermal amplification. We used the paper-based device for the detection of the toxic microalgae Ostreopsis cf. ovata. The NAAT, completed in 95 min, attained a limit of detection of 0.06 pM target synthetic DNA and was able to detect 1 ng/\u03bcL O. cf. ovata genomic DNA with negligible cross-reactivity from a closely related microalgae species. We think that the integration of thread electrodes within paper-based devices paves the way for digital one-time use NAATs and numerous other advanced electroanalytical paper-or textile-based devices.",

            "text": "N ucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are highly sensitive and specific molecular techniques that identify particular sequences in a genetic material. Current NAAT diagnostics rely mainly on centralized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests performed by trained personnel in laboratories. The integration of NAATs into point-of-care (POC) devices can be ground-breaking and allow detection at the site and at scale, enabling rapid and appropriate decisions not only in public health but also in food safety and environmental monitoring. 1\u22125 Microfluidic paper analytical devices (\u03bcPADs) have gained interest for NAAT POC devices because they have the potential to be disposable and portable. The use of various papers and other substrates provides properties necessary for the different steps of NAAT assays such as fluid transport through capillary forces, which eliminates the need for external pumps, filtration, adsorption, and reagent storage in the porous network of papers. 6\u221210 \u03bcPADs also allow 3D microfluidic systems using multiple layers to integrate advanced functions. 11\u221214 PCR, the gold standard DNA amplification method, requires thermocyclers to conduct a series of high-temperature cycles for several hours and is therefore not easy to integrate into POC paper-based devices. For this reason, isothermal amplification methods that operate at a constant temperature are considered more suitable options for paper-based NAATs. 8, 15 Among several isothermal amplification methods, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) emerges as an attractive method as it works at a low temperature of 37\u221242\u00b0C and it completes amplification in a short time of 10\u221230 min. 16 Besides these advantages, conducting RPA in porous matrices facilitates further integration with \u03bcPADs. 17, 18 To read out the results of isothermal reactions in paperbased devices, previous works have mainly relied on colorimetric methods, 19\u221223 which suffer from low sensitivity, are semiquantitative, and require human operators or optical instruments. 24 To enable quantification, miniaturization, and integration, few paper-based NAATs have been combined with electronic readout using redox molecules in solution that bind to dsDNA. 25, 26 These devices however are not sequencespecific, compromising their sensitivity. Electrochemical DNA hybridization biosensors can overcome these issues. They have a high sensitivity and specificity because they are based on hybridization events to generate signals in close contact with a DNA-modified transducer. 27, 28 A number of DNA-immobilized biosensors have to date been presented for isothermal techniques in general and RPA specifically, exploiting different detection configurations like labeled capture probes, 29, 30 labeled amplified products, 31 or labeled reporter probes, 32, 33 as well as solid-phase strategies. 34\u221237 Despite the outstanding advantages of these electroanalytical biosensors, no such device has so far been integrated in \u03bcPADs for isothermal NAATs.",

Off-the-shelf gold plasma-coated threads are highly flexible and conductive fiber electrodes that do not require any cleaning step before SAM modification, making them suitable for mass-produced electrodes as we recently reported. 29, 52 Here, we report a multilayer paper-based electrochemical DNA sensor with integrated electrodes in the form of gold threads.

(C) Operation: (1) The sample of RPA product-HRP conjugates is added to the top of the device and hybridized with the capture probe on the gold thread; (2) The 1st blocking layer is manually removed; (3) Following a washing step with Milli-Q water, the capture/glass fiber/2nd blocking layers are simultaneously removed, bringing the sample to the three-electrode sensor layer; and (4) The TMB + H 2 O 2 enzymatic substrate is added, and chronoamperometric measurements are carried out. operation, and sensitivity compared with existing electrochemical \u03bcPADs and shows strong potential for digital singleuse POC testing.",

We also demonstrated that the freeze-dried master mix in glass fiber was stable for 1 week at \u221220\u00b0C, seen by the bright and specific band in Figure 2B (well 7) using 10 pM target synthetic DNA. These results demonstrate the utility of glass fiber as a readyto-use substrate containing all the reagents necessary for RPA Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article at the desired concentration, with the potential to be fully integrated within paper devices. Threads as Electrodes for DNA Sensing: Tube-and Paper-Based Detection Systems. Previously, we have reported the formation of SAMs on gold plasma-coated polyester multifilament threads and their use as electrodes. 29, 52 The formation of SAMs on these threads required no prior cleaning steps of the gold thread electrodes, making these materials ideal for SAM-based sensors to be fabricated at scale. In this study, we used the threads in combination with paper to endow \u03bcPADs, which to our knowledge has not been done before. We performed CVs of unmodified and capture probemodified gold threads in potassium ferricyanide to characterize the coverage of SAMs, as they inhibit the electron transfer at the interface between the redox molecules in the solution and the electrode surface, resulting in lower redox peaks in the CVs ( Figure 3A and Figures S1 and S2) . The threads provided a 1.1 mm 2 electrochemical effective surface area, which is reduced to 0.3 mm 2 after its functionalization, corresponding to 74% probe coverage. We calculated these electrochemical effective surface areas using the Randles\u2212Sevcik plots.",

Second, we compared Randles\u2212Sevcik plots for the capture probe-modified gold threads in the paper and tube devices in the presence of potassium ferricyanide. The electrochemical reaction in the paper-based system at the surface of the capture probemodified gold threads can be characterized by a faster electron transfer than in the tube system 56 ( Figure S4 ).

We also analyzed more complex samples containing genomic DNA that had been extracted from microalgal cultures. Positive samples containing target O. cf. ovata genomic DNA showed a significant statistical difference compared to samples containing nontarget O. cf. siamensis genomic DNA ( Figure 4A ). These results demonstrate the specificity of the biosensor, able to detect the target region in a complex matrix with no interferences from a close related microalgae species (i.e., O. cf. siamensis) from the same genus. In fact, since O. cf. ovata and O. cf. siamensis share similar gene sequences (even one of the primers is specific for both species, see Table 1 ), this suggests that the sensor will also be specific toward other nonclosely related species. The slightly higher signal observed in the nontarget samples compared to the blank samples ( Figure 4A ) has also been reported in previous studies. 32 Since the nontarget control is more realistic, we used this value to determine the LOD of our test from the calibration curve with target synthetic DNA added to the freeze-dried RPA reaction in glass fiber substrates (Figure 4B) , obtaining a concentration of 0.06 pM. Considering that one cell of O. cf. ovata has 2137 ribosomal DNA copies per cell, 57 our assay is able to detect as low as 85 microalgal cells per sample, without taking into account sample collection and DNA extraction steps. Therefore, the biosensor may enable quantifications of O. cf. ovata below the current alarm thresholds proposed for Ostreopsis cells (10,000\u221230,000 cells/L seawater). 58 The total operational time from sample to answer for the paper-based electrochemical sensor was 95 min and required four steps in total: (1) RPA (30 min); (2) Pre-incubation (30 min); (3) Incubation of the RPA product-HRP conjugates with the capture probe (30 min); and (4) Electrochemical detection (5 min). The 3D architecture of the paper device allowed us to simplify operation and bypass fluidic manipulation by the user for the washing steps of SHAs. It however still requires user intervention to transfer the enzymatic substrate to the paper device and two manual steps of valving with the blocking layers.",

The use of tailed primers results in dsDNA RPA products with ssDNA tails at each end; and (4) The substrate is pre-incubated for 30 min with a solution of the HRP-reporter probe. The RPA products diffuse from the paper to the solution and hybridize to the HRP-reporter probe through complementary tails, generating RPA product-HRP conjugates.
