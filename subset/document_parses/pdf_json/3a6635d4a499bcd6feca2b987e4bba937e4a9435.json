If the two-physician diagnosis (for the assigned cause of death) contradicts, a third physician reviewed the case, and the final assignment was made based on the agreement between any two of the three physicians. However, if the assigned cause of death by the third physician was not in agreement with any of the two-physician diagnoses, the cause for death was assigned on a panel discussion between them. In the situation where the three physicians could not reach an agreement, the cause of death was assigned as undetermined. The physicians were participating to review the process which was second-or third-year internal medicine residents of Addis Ababa University recruited to join the university after serving two or more years as a General Practitioner (GP) in any of the public hospitals. We provided them training and annual refreshments on the standard verbal autopsy method.",

CODs based on hospital diagnoses have been considered the gold standard in many studies [29, 30] . Hospital diagnoses, on the other hand, have limitations as a gold standard since the composition and distribution of hospital CODs may not be indicative of community mortality. Furthermore, in resource-constrained healthcare settings, when hospital diagnoses are available, they are of poor quality and are limited by insufficient clinical data and record keeping [31] [32] [33] . Moreover, hospital users and residential users may have varied abilities to notice, recall, and report indicators of sickness. Physician review was used as a reference standard in this study to investigate InterVA. For this study's population, physician review was the only option for COD assessment. This option, however, has drawbacks. Physicians' experiences, perceptions, and interpretations of local epidemiology might contribute to variations in COD data, making it difficult to make valid temporal and regional comparisons. Furthermore, they frequently make decisions based on open history and may not account for all indicators consistently. Our report showed that the use of the physician review has helped to find the most relevant facts relating to the cause of death by tuberculosis, but the choice had limitations. The physicians have considered the detailed information by going through the questionnaire, using their clinical skills and experiences in determining the cause of death. They might however be influenced by their own biases.",

The experience, observation, and interpretation of the physicians might also influence interpretations and reach a biased decision of cause of death. Otherwise, the study was conducted carefully and the data management and analysis were conducted in line with the standard and appropriate procedures and statistics methods.",
