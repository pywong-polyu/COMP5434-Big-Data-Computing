            "text": "Social-distancing directives to contain community transmission of the COVID-19 virus can be expected to affect sleep timing, duration or quality. Remote work or school may increase time available for sleep, with benefits for immune function and mental health, particularly in those individuals who obtain less sleep than age-adjusted recommendations. Young adults are thought to regularly carry significant sleep debt related in part to misalignment between endogenous circadian clock time and social time. We examined the impact of social-distancing measures on sleep in young adults by comparing sleep self-studies submitted by students enrolled in a university course during the 2020 summer session (entirely remote instruction, N = 80) with self-studies submitted by students enrolled in the same course during previous summer semesters (on-campus instruction, N = 452; cross-sectional study design). Self-studies included 2-8 week sleep diaries, two chronotype questionnaires, written reports, and sleep tracker (Fitbit) data from a subsample. Students in the 2020 remote instruction semester slept later, less efficiently, less at night and more in the day, but did not sleep more overall despite online, asynchronous classes and~44% fewer work days compared to students in previous summers. Subjectively, the net impact on sleep was judged as positive or negative in equal numbers of students, with students identifying as evening types significantly more likely to report a positive impact, and morning types a negative impact. Several features of the data suggest that the average amount of sleep reported by students in this summer course, historically and during the 2020 remote school semester, represents a homeostatic balance, rather than a chronic deficit. Regardless of the interpretation, the results provide additional evidence that social-distancing measures affect sleep in heterogeneous ways.",

All students submitted diaries. MEQ and MCTQ data were obtained from 441 students in the archive group, and 79 students in the 2020 group. For the 2020 semester, students were required to also use a sleep tracker or smartphone app of their choosing (free or for purchase) for comparison with diary data, and to submit a report that included a discussion of how social distancing measures, particularly remote work and school, might impact sleep generally and their own sleep specifically. The questionnaires were completed via an online web survey tool during the first few weeks of the semester (typically mid-to-late May). The diaries and sleep tracker data were collected during the middle of the semester, typically June to late July, and reports submitted at the end of July.",

The MCTQ asks for typical bedtime, sleep onset time, wakeup time, frequency of alarm use, nap time, nap duration, and time outdoors. Information is entered separately for \"work\" and \"free\" days. Free days were defined as days when participants were free to wake at their preferred time. Work days were defined as days when participants were required to wake for social obligations (including school). This might typically involve use of an alarm, but alarm use per se was not used to define work and free days. Sleep diary data were entered daily. Required diary entries included bedtime, estimated sleep-onset-latency (SOL), wakeafter-sleep-onset (WASO) if recalled, wake-up time and any daytime naps (time and duration). During the 2020 semester, time of first outdoor daylight exposure and estimated total time outdoors were also required. Optional measures included mealtimes, exercise, and caffeine intake. Students were instructed to record nocturnal sleep information in the morning, and daytime information at bedtime.",

            "text": "Sleep onset and wakeup times were used to calculate nocturnal sleep duration and midsleep time, defined as the midpoint between sleep onset and sleep end. Midsleep was calculated separately for work days (MSW) and free days (MSF), and separately for the MCTQ (MSW MCTQ ; MSF MCTQ ) and sleep diary (MSW Diary ; MSF Diary ). MSF is used as the primary phase reference point to estimate chronotype (phase of entrainment to local time) because it is assumed to more accurately reflect biological time rather than social time. It has been recommended that MSF be corrected for sleep debt that may accumulate on work days [28] . This is based on the reasonable assumption that changes in sleep timing on free-days may be partly due to homeostatic regulation of sleep duration, which introduces error into MSF as a measure of chronotype. The correction assumes that sleep debt accumulates linearly across the work week, and is compensated by a linear increase in sleep duration on free days. Both assumptions are debatable, given that compensation for lost sleep is a non-linear process [11] . Also, by contrast with the conventional '5 days on, 2 days off' work week, university students in Canada typically have irregular school and work schedules. There may be fewer constraints on napping during school days, and these may compensate for sleep debt prior to free days. With these considerations in mind, midsleep was examined without the sleep correction, unless stated otherwise and identified as MSFsc. For some analyses, sleep timing and duration were averaged across all days; midsleep time for all days correlates more strongly with physiological measures of circadian phase (e.g., dim-light-melatonin-onset, DLMO) than does MSF or MSFsc [29] .",

This has been conceptualized as 'social jetlag', with work and free days representing different social time zones [10] . Social jetlag was quantified as the difference between midsleep on work and free days (SJMS = MSF-MSW). Both signed and absolute values were examined. Misalignment can be expected to affect sleep duration on work days or free days, depending on chronotype. Differences in sleep duration between work and free days were therefore also calculated (SDF-SDW).",

Whether the lifestyle changes forced by social-distancing measures would be experienced as beneficial or detrimental to sleep was an open question. To gauge the students' experience, the reports were evaluated by the course instructor (R.E.M.) for elements that could be assigned a positive (+1) or negative (-1) value (null value (0) if absent). Positive elements were 1. more consistent bedtimes and wakeup times, 2. more time in bed (unless students explicitly stated that this was not a positive), 3. feeling more rested, 4. better subjective sleep quality, 5. sleep overall satisfactory. Negative elements were 1. less consistent bedtimes and waketimes, 2. less perceived sleep, 3. less rested, 4. problems falling or staying asleep, 5. excessive delay of sleep timing (if perceived as a problem). Other elements that contributed to the assessment included statements concerning insufficient daily sunlight exposure, insufficient exercise, and lack of structure, where these were felt to impact sleep.

The questions were therefore answered in a way that is more reflective of my pre-COVID-19 sleep habits. If I were commuting to work and school as normal and were still active with all of my volunteer commitments, my sleep log would likely be more similar to the MCTQ results\"). If this was generally true for many if not all students in 2020, then differences between MCTQ and sleep diary data may reflect in part the impact of social-distancing measures. For free days, the duration of the sleep period (sleep onset to sleep end) calculated from the MCTQ (SDF MCTQ ) exceeded the diary averages (SDF diary ) by 18 \u00b1 64 min in the archival group (N = 398 with free days and both MCTQ and diary data), and by 52 \u00b1 65 min in the 2020 group (N = 78), a significantly larger difference (between-groups t 473 = 3.341, p = .0009, Fig 5A) .

Self-reported sleep duration is overestimated in questionnaires compared to diaries [34, 35] . The archival group data suggests that in this student demographic, the overestimate is about 18-19 minutes. In the 2020 group, the discrepancy was 2.8 times larger on free days (34 minutes) and 1.9 times larger on work days (17 minutes). The differences may be larger in the 2020 group not due to greater misperception of sleep duration in the MCTQ, but because students were in fact sleeping less at night during the social-distancing semester compared to previous semesters. This interpretation is consistent with student statements that the MCTQ data fit better with sleep habits prior to the transition to remote classes.",

If in our sample the MCTQ represents 'presocial-distancing' sleep habits, then we might also see a negative correlation between sleep duration at 'baseline' (i.e., SD MCTQ ) and the amount by which sleep changed from baseline during the social-distancing semester (i.e., SD diary -SD MCTQ ). Consistent with this hypothesis, a negative correlation of very similar magnitude to Wright et al.

A negative correlation between SD MCTQ and SD diary -SD MCTQ was also evident in our archival sample, for free days (r = -.76, p < .0001; Fig 5E) and work days (r = -.76, not a typo, p < .0001; Fig 5F) . Students in the archival group were required to complete the MCTQ and MEQ twice, once at the beginning of the semester and once at the end, to assess the potential effect of keeping a sleep diary on questionnaire responses. Although there was no significant mean difference between the two time points for any variable (e.g., sleep duration, midsleep time or MEQ score), the standard deviations of the differences were of course not zero. Again, the change in sleep duration from time 1 to time 2 (SD MCTQ2-MCTQ1 ) correlated negatively with sleep duration at time 1 (SD MCTQ1 ), for work days ( Fig 5G) and free days (Fig 5H) . The association was also evident for midsleep time on work and free days, and for MEQ scores. Whether or not group mean TIB or sleep duration change when more time is available for sleep, the association between the value at time 1 and the change from time 1 to time 2, at the group level likely reflects statistical regression to the mean with repeated sampling.",

Two students reported no outdoor sunlight exposure for the entire duration of data collection (14 and 18 days, respectively). Information on time outdoors was not recorded in the archival sleep diaries, but based on MCTQ estimates, daylight exposure in the 2020 cohort was likely reduced by 50% or more, and likely occurred later in the day, given the fewer work days and asynchronous, on-line classes. This interpretation assumes that the MCTQ estimate of time outside in the 2020 group represents behavior during social-distancing, rather than prior to social-distancing, as suggested by the MCTQ sleep duration data. Both may be partially true, depending on the subjective salience of recent changes in time outdoors (decreased by 50%?) and sleep patterns (~30 min later bedtime).",

COVID-19 has acted more as an enabler to bad sleeping habits than anything else\"; \"the day is almost over by the time I get up\"). Sleep timing was described by equal numbers of students as either more regular (23.1%) or less regular, even \"chaotic\" (24.4%).",

Given that sleep is important for immune function and mental health [39, 40] , an important research agenda is to determine whether any effects of social-distancing on sleep are a harm or a benefit. Young adults are thought to regularly carry significant sleep debt related in part to misalignment between endogenous circadian clock time and social time [9, 10] . We would therefore expect average sleep duration to increase if more time is made available for sleep during a pandemic, due to less time spent commuting, at work, or at social events. Changes in sleep timing, sleep efficiency, and daytime napping might be expected as well, although it is not certain that the net effect would be beneficial in all individuals.",

            "text": "Our analyses of student sleep diaries and reports collected during the 2020 summer semester at Simon Fraser University are in partial agreement with other recent findings. The most commonly reported effect of social-distancing has been a shift to later bedtimes, e.g., [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Compared to students in previous summers, students in our 2020 summer group showed a significant delay in timing of the daily sleep-wake cycle. The magnitude of the shift averaged across all days (work and free) was~30 minutes, which is very similar to other reports based on MCTQ data (MSF later by 34 min, MSW later by 22 min) [14] and sleep diary data (midsleep later by~32 min, assuming 5 workdays and 2 weekend days) [25] . Our 2020 group also showed less variability in sleep timing, less cumulative social jetlag due to fewer work days, and reduced sleep efficiency due to increased WASO. These differences fit a coherent narrative. Fewer work days combined with on-line, asynchronous classes should reduce or eliminate morning commutes, thereby decreasing or delaying exposure to outdoor light, especially early in the day. Removal of constraints on sleeping late permits later bedtimes, extending the duration of exposure to artificial light at night. According to principles of circadian clock entrainment, decreased morning daylight combined with increased evening artificial light will favor a delay shift in the phase of entrainment, and therefore later bedtimes and wakeup times [27] . A reduced amplitude of the daily light-dark cycle (weaker zeitgeber) should also amplify the natural tendency of young adults toward an evening chronotype [41, 42] . Reduced constraints on daytime napping would also favor later bedtimes, more time awake in bed, and lower sleep efficiency. With fewer work days, by definition there would be less social jetlag, contributing to less variability in sleep time from day to day.",

This was offset by a trend for more daytime sleep, but average 24 h sleep time in the 2020 group was still a few minutes less than in the archival group. Similar findings of reduced nocturnal sleep, with or without increased daytime napping, have been reported in some survey studies of adults in the general population, e.g., [15] [16] [17] [19] [20] [21] . Notably, in our 2020 group, 23 students who reported no work days averaged the same amount of sleep as 55 students reporting a mix of work days (prior to which they slept less) and free days (prior to which they slept more).

Within a circadian cycle, naps appear to compensate for nocturnal sleep deficiencies, while across the week, free days appear to compensate for any sleep deficiencies on work days. Students during the 2020 summer semester had fewer work days, and fewer or no commutes to work and school, yet as a group they did not sleep more over periods of sleep tracking ranging from 14 to 56 days. This does not mean that students do not sustain periods of sleep restriction. What it does suggest is that at the group level, the average amount of sleep reported by these students over a period of 2 or more weeks, reflects a homeostatic system in balance; the data provide no evidence of a chronic sleep deficit that would be relieved by more time available for sleep. Young adults might be able to sleep more than they normally do (e.g., during forced bedrest in long nights in a laboratory), but when provided the opportunity in the home environment, this particular cohort, on average, did not.",

Other interpretations therefore bear careful consideration. One possibility is that sleep duration in the 2020 group failed to increase over previous years because with more flexibility and time available (less summer employment and no time spent commuting), students procrastinated on school work and then worked late to complete assignments. Even if freed from a social clock, sleep is nonetheless constrained by circadian clock alerting, which limits sleep in the biological day, e.g., [11, 43] . This surely describes the situation for at least some students. Sleep may not have increased in other individuals due to general stress associated with health concerns, social isolation or other responses to the pandemic.",

Only a few students reported that they did not feel well-rested during the self-study, and this may well have been due to other factors that affect daytime alertness and mood, such as reduced light exposure, exercise, or social interactions. Notably, these students did not average less sleep than the others. Very few students made a reference to stress; ennui appeared to be a more common state. The data provide no evidence that during COVID-19 social-distancing, many students wanted to sleep more, but were unable or could not find the time.",

            "text": "Our findings on sleep duration differ from those reported in at least two other studies of sleep during social-distancing in young adults. Participants in one study completed an on-line version of the MCTQ modified to include questions about habitual bedtimes and wakeup times both before and during social-restriction [14] . This memory-based, quasi-longitudinal approach revealed a net increase of~15 min/day of sleep during social-restriction (less during free days but more during work days). Participants in the other study were students in a university course who maintained a sleep diary for one week prior to 'stay-at-home' orders in late January 2020, and again 3 months later when 'stay-at-home' orders were in effect [25] . Time in bed increased by~26 min/night during the 'stay-at-home' week. Whether sleep duration increased commensurately with TIB in these two studies is unknown, but it might not have, if sleep was less efficient, as appeared to be the case in our 2020 group when compared to previous years. We also note that the tendency for presumed short sleepers (short time in bed) to increase TIB during social restriction, as reported in both of these studies, is not in itself evidence of sleep deficit; long sleepers changed TIB in the opposite direction. The negative correlation between a first measure of sleep duration (or midsleep time, or MEQ) and the difference between a second and first measure, is a characteristic of repeated sampling and measurement error (regression to the mean). In other respects, the results of these two studies align well with our study (later bedtimes, reduced variability of sleep timing, reduced social jetlag burden).",

A limitation of the study is that given its exploratory nature, a large number of analyses were conducted, increasing the risk of Type 1 error. Familywise error rate was controlled using Dunn's or Sidak's post hoc tests. A second limitation of the study is the lack of data from individual students prior to social distancing that would allow us to report quantitatively on change within-subjects, rather than infer change (or lack of change) based on cross-sectional comparison with prior years or within-subject MCTQ (with some confirmation from analysis of the students' written reports). Interpretation of the sleep duration data would also have benefited from more quantitative assessment of sleep quality (e.g., using the PSQI) and daytime functioning (e.g., sleepiness scales or regular tests of psychomotor vigilance). Generalizations from our study are limited by the narrow demographic of the study sample; mostly early 20's in age, mostly female (70%), and self-selected (they chose to take this course on sleep, a course that has always been scheduled in the afternoon rather than in the morning). A limitation of the published literature to date is the paucity of objective data from validated sleep trackers, e.g., Actiwatches or Fitbits [22] or ambulatory polysomnography (PSG). Retrospective questionnaires generally yield overestimates of sleep duration relative to daily diaries, which yield overestimates relative to actimetry and PSG. The COVID-19 pandemic may precipitate a permanent movement toward increased work and school from home, which may increase time available for sleep, and how this might affect sleep behavior, efficiency and architecture will be important to evaluate further.",

COVID-19 social-distancing measures in many respects represent the converse experiment, in which natural circadian time cues (primarily sunlight exposure) are degraded rather than enhanced. The changes observed in sleep timing during social distancing add to the evidence that the built environment in modern industrialized societies promotes a delayed phase of circadian clock entrainment, which under normal circumstances in many people is misaligned with the social clock. The impact of these changes, however, may be positive for some but not for others. Individuals complying with mandates to social-distance or quarantine may therefore benefit from public health advice on sleep hygiene and effects of natural and artificial light exposure on sleep timing to maximize the benefits of good sleep for immune function and mental health.",
