We leverage this model to quantify the quarantine strengths and analyze and compare the role of quarantine control policies employed to control the virus effective reproduction number [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] in the European, North American, South American and Asian continents. In a classical and commonly used model, known as SEIR, [20] [21] [22] the population is divided into the susceptible S, exposed E, infected I and recovered R groups, and their relative growths and competition are represented as a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. The simpler SIR model does not account for the exposed population E. These models cannot capture the large-scale effects of more granular interactions, such as the population's response to social distancing and quarantine policies. However, a major assumption of these models is that the rate of transitions between population states is fixed. In our approach, we relax this assumption by estimating the time-dependent quarantine effect on virus exposure as a neural network informs the infected variable I in the SIR model. This trained model thus decomposes the effects and the neural network encodes information about the quarantine strength function in the locale where the model is trained.",

To understand the nature of evolution of Q(t), we look at the time point when Q(t) approximately shows an inflection point, or a ramp up point.

Figure 2 shows the comparison of the model-estimated infected and recovered case counts with actual Covid-19 data for the highest affected European countries as of 1 June 2020, namely: Russia, UK, Spain and Italy, in that order. We find that irrespective of a small set of optimized parameters (note that the contact rate \u03b2 and the recovery rate \u03b3 are fixed, and not functions of time), a reasonably good match is seen in all four cases. recovery rates are assumed to be constant in our model, in the duration spanning the detection of the 500 th infected case and June 1 st , 2020. The average contact rate in Spain and Italy is seen to be higher than Russia and UK over the considered duration of 2 \u2212 3 months, possibly because Russia and UK were affected relatively late by the virus, which gave sufficient time for the enforcement strict social distancing protocols prior to widespread outbreak. For Spain and Italy, the quarantine efficiency and also the recovery rate are generally higher than for Russia and UK, possibly indicating more efficient testing, isolation and quarantine; and hospital practices in Spain and Italy. This agrees well with the ineffectiveness of testing, contact tracing and quarantine practices seen in UK. 35 Although the social distancing strength also varied with time, we do not focus on that aspect in the present study, and will be the subject of future studies. A higher quarantine efficiency combined with a higher recovery rate led Spain and Italy to bring down the Covid spread parameter (defined in (6)), C p from > 1 to < 1 in 16, 25 days. respectively, as compared to 32 days for UK and 42 days for Russia (figure 4). Figure 5 shows Q eff for the 23 highest affected European countries. We can see that Q eff in the western European regions is generally higher than eastern Europe. This can be attributed to the strong lockdown measures implemented in western countries like Spain, Italy, Germany, France after the rise of infections seen first in Italy and Spain. 36 Although countries like Switzerland and Turkey didn't enforce a strict lockdown as compared to their west European counterparts, they were generally successful in halting the infection count before reaching catastrophic proportions, due to strong testing and tracing protocols. 37, 38 Subsequently, these countries also managed to identify potentially infected individuals and prevented them from coming into contact with susceptibles, giving them a high Q eff score as seen in figure 5 . In contrast, our study also manages to identify countries like Sweden which had very limited lockdown measures; 39 with a low Q eff score as seen in figure 5 . This strengthens the validity of our model in diagnosing information about the effectiveness of quarantine and isolation protocols in different countries; which agree well with the actual protocols seen in these countries. Figure 6 shows reasonably good match between the model-estimated infected and recovered case counts with actual Covid-19 data for the highest affected North American states (including states from Mexico, the United States, and Canada) as of 1 June 2020, namely: New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California. Q(t) for New York and New Jersey show a ramp up point immediately in the week following the detection of the 500 th case in these regions, i.e. on 19 March for New York and on 24 March for New Jersey ( figure 7) . This matches well with the actual dates: 22 March in New York and 21 March in New Jersey when stay at home orders and isolation measures were enforced in these states. A relatively slower rise of Q(t) is seen for Illinois while California showing a ramp up post a week after detection of the 500 th case. Although no significant difference is seen in the mean contact and recovery rates between the different US states, the quarantine efficiency in New York and New Jersey is seen to be significantly higher than that of Illinois and California (figure 16b), indicating the effectiveness of the rapidly deployed quarantine interventions in New York and New Jersey. 40 Owing to the high quarantine efficiency in New York and New Jersey, these states were able to bring down the Covid spread parameter, C p to less than 1 in 19 days ( figure 8 ). On the other hand, although Illinois and California reached close to C p = 1 after the 30 day and 20 day mark respectively, C p still remained greater than 1 (figure 8), indicating that these states were still in the danger zone as of June 1, 2020. An important caveat to this result is the reporting of the recovered data.",

            "text": "Comparing with Europe, the recovery rates seen in North America are significantly lower (figures 16a,b) . It should be noted that accurate reporting of recovery rates is likely to play a major role in this apparent difference. In our study, the recovered data include individuals who cannot further transmit infection; and thus includes treated patients who are currently in a healthy state and also individuals who died due to the virus. Since quantification of deaths can be done in a robust manner, the death data is generally reported more accurately. However, there is no clear definition for quantifying the number of people who transitioned from infected to healthy. As a result, accurate and timely reporting of recovered data is seen to have a significant variation between countries, under reporting of the recovered data being a common practice. Since the effective reproduction number calculation depends on the recovered case count, accurate data regarding the recovered count is vital to assess whether the infection has been curtailed in a particular region or not. Thus, our results strongly indicate the need for each country to follow a particular metric for estimating the recovered count robustly, which is vital for data driven assessment of the pandemic spread. Figure 9a shows the quarantine efficiency for 20 major US states spanning the whole country. Figure 9b shows the comparison between a report published in the Wall Street Journal on May 21 highlighting USA states based on their lockdown conditions, 41 and the quarantine efficiency magnitude in our study. The size of the circles represent the magnitude of the quarantine efficiency. The blue color indicate the states for which the quarantine efficiency was greater than the mean quarantine efficiency across all US states, while those in red indicate the opposite. Our results indicate that the north-eastern and western states were much more responsive in implementing rapid quarantine measures in the month following early detection; as compared to the southern and central states. This matches the on-ground situation as indicated by a generally strong correlation is seen between the red circles in our study (states with lower quarantine efficiency) and the yellow regions seen in in the Wall Street Journal report 41 (states with reduced imposition of restrictions) and between the blue circles in our study (states with higher quarantine efficiency) and the blue regions seen in the Wall Street Journal report 41 (states with generally higher level of restrictions). This strengthens the validity of our approach in which the quarantine efficiency is recovered through a trained neural network rooted in fundamental epidemiological equations. Figure 10 shows reasonably good match between the model-estimated infected and recovered case count with actual Covid-19 data for the highest affected Asian countries as of 1 June 2020, namely: India, China and South Korea. Q(t) shows a rapid ramp up in China and South Korea ( figure 11 ) which agrees well with cusps in government interventions which took place in the weeks leading to and after the end of January 4 and February 42 for China and South Korea respectively. On the other hand, a slow build up of Q(t) is seen for India, with no significant ramp up. This is reflected in the quarantine efficiency comparison (figure 16c), which is much higher for China and South Korea compared to India. South Korea shows a significantly lower contact rate than its Asian counterparts, indicating strongly enforced and followed social distancing protocols. 43 No significant difference in the recovery rate is observed between the Asian countries. Owing to the high quarantine efficiency in China and a high quarantine efficiency coupled with strongly enforced social distancing in South Korea, these countries were able to bring down the Covid spread parameter C p from > 1 to < 1 in 21 and 13 days respectively, while it took 33 days in India ( figure 12 ). Figure 13 shows reasonably good match between the model-estimated infected and recovered case count with actual Covid-19 data for the highest affected South American countries as of 1 June 2020, namely: Brazil, Chile and Peru. For Brazil, Q(t) is seen to be approximately constant \u2248 0 initially with a ramp up around the 20 day mark; after which Q(t) is seen to stagnate (figure 14a). The key difference between the Covid progression in Brazil compared to other nations is that the infected and the recovered (recovered healthy + dead in our study) count is very close to one another as the disease progressed ( figure 13 ). Owing to this, as the disease progressed, the new infected people introduced in the population were balanced by the infected people removed from the population, either by being healthy or deceased. This higher recovery rate combined with a generally low quarantine efficiency and contact rate (figure 16d) manifests itself in the Covid spread parameter for Brazil to be < 1 for almost the entire duration of the disease progression (figure 15a). For Chile, Q(t) is almost constant for the entire duration considered (figure 14b). Thus, although government regulations were imposed swiftly following the initial detection of the virus, leading to a high initial magnitude of Q(t), the government imposition became subsequently relaxed. This maybe attributed to several political and social factors outside the scope of the present study. 44 Even for Chile, the infected and recovered count remain close to each other compared to other nations. A generally high quarantine magnitude coupled with a moderate recovery rate (figure 16d) leads to C p being < 1 for the entire duration of disease progression (figure 15b). In Peru, Q(t) shows a very slow build up (figure 14c) with a very low magnitude. Also, the recovered count is lower than the infected count compared to its South American counterparts (figure 13c). A low quarantine efficiency coupled with a low recovery rate (figure 16d) leads Peru to be in the danger zone (C p > 1) for 48 days post detection of the 500 th case (figure 15c).",

The iterations required for convergence varied based on the region considered and generally ranged from 40, 000 \u2212 100, 000.

For the second stage, we fix the optimal \u03b3, \u03b4 found in the first stage to optimize for the remaining parameters: W, \u03b2 based on the loss function defined just on the infected count as L(W, \u03b2) = log(I(t) + T (t)) \u2212 log(I data (t)) 2 .",
