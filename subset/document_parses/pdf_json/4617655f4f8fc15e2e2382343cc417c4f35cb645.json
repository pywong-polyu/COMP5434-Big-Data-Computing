Using quite different THz dielectric responses of intact tissues (either in vivo or freshly excised ex vivo) and frozen ones, 20 they highlighted an ability for intraoperative measurements of ice ball formation during tissue cryosurgery. Namely, THz pulsed spectroscopy was found to be able to detect the interface between intact and frozen tissues at a depth of hundreds of microns. Thereby, THz technology has potential for estimating the freezing depth of tissue in different areas of modern cryosurgery.",

The observed results of the rabbit cornea measurements in the THz range were verified by optical coherence tomography. They highlighted an ability for in vivo contactless estimation of the cornea hydration (and, thus, related pathologies) based on its THz reflectivity. In turn, in a paper by L. Ke et al., entitled \"Terahertz spectroscopy analysis of human corneal sublayers\" (URL: https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.26.4.043011), a method for sensing human corneal composition at different depths (with a focus on the epithelium and the stromal layer) was proposed, relying on high-sensitivity THz spectroscopy. Using novel approaches to collecting and processing data, the authors studied THz responses of human corneas at different edema stages. The observed results demonstrated that the epithelium layer of cornea acts as a barrier that maintains the hydration level of the stroma; while at the final stages of edema, the epithelium lost its barrier properties. The epithelium quality can be used to predict the level of corneal swelling.",

A systematic study of the IR spectra of insulin involving model insulin specimens was carried out by S. Delbeck and H.M. Heise, in their article \"Systematic stability testing of insulins as representative biopharmaceuticals by using ATR FTIR-spectroscopy with focus on quality assurance\" (URL: https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.26.4.043007). Insulin specimens were stored at different temperatures (i.e., 0\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, and 37\u00b0C) for up to three months, while their weekly IR spectroscopic measurements yielded monitoring of the hormonal secondary structural changes, which correlated negatively with the insulin bioactivity. The observed results revealed that IR spectroscopy holds potential for rapid and reliable analysis of the secondary structural changes within insulin molecules and, thus, is capable of insulin quality control. Finally, Y. Zhu and co-authors, in their article \"Dual short wavelength infrared transillumination/reflectance mode imaging for caries detection\" (URL: https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.26.4.043004), developed a system for simultaneous acquisition of both the short-wavelength infrared reflectance and occlusal transillumination images of lesions on tooth proximal and occlusal surfaces, which is aimed at differentiating between shallow and deep occlusal lesions.",
