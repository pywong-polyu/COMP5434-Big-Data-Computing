This study aimed to investigate the effects of teleworking using the Internet on married working women working in educational settings (advantages and disadvantages of teleworking). For this purpose, this study includes qualitative and quantitative parts with samples including 16 and 404 married women working in educational settings (i.e. school and university). In the qualitative part that interviews were conducted with 16 married women who were selected as experts in educational occupations, the findings showed that teleworking brings six major advantages for women. These six advantages are economic, psychological, health, family, organizational, and educational. Moreover, when the qualitative part was ended, the researchers prepared a questionnaire according to the findings and selected 404 married and working women in educational settings to rate advantages and disadvantages of teleworking during Covid-19 pandemic and according to qualitative results, teleworking has disadvantages such as role conflict, lack of face-to-face position, and reworking. The quantitative results showed that participants' feedback was positive in six advantages and two variables of family and psychological were the most important variables among teleworking advantages (p < .05). According to the findings of this study, it can be concluded that teleworking has a considerable effect on family cohesion and psychological security of women. Therefore, according to the current status of the society (covid-19), facilities should be considered for married women.",

The characteristics of this activity include reduced need for transportation and working based on fixed schedules (Sl\u00e1dek & Sigmund, 2021) . Jack M. Nilles (1998) was the first person who officially started investigations on teleworking and he is known as \"teleworking godfather\" in different books. He was a leader of a multidisciplinary team in 1973. The purpose of this team was to study issues related to the policies of the federal government in the field of \"creating compatibility between telecommunications and transportation\" and it was not expressed easily. As a result of clear modifications, \"telecommuting\" was selected. However, since this term had limited use, it was replaced by \"teleworking\" that represented vast uses (Kurland & Bailey, 1999) . Also, authors such as Toffler (1980) presented Electronic Cottage and in 1983, Williams used the term electronic renaissance. Kinsman (1987) published the first book entitled \"Teleworkers\" in which he predicted teleworking and flexible labor revolution.",

            "text": "The role of women as family supporters has a considerable effect on their teleworking experiences. The sense of responsibility of women towards family members, raising children, and social and family roles have influenced their values, behavior, and attitudes. Due to temporary autonomy and that they can reduce time pressure with planning, working women consider teleworking a positive opportunity to promote their life quality. However, life quality may not be desirable but teleworking is a personal choice (Hilbrecht et al., 2008) . Boca et al. (2020) in a study in Italy showed that working women who have 0 to 5 years old children face a challenging balance between work and family during Covid-19 pandemic. Achievement to this balance is more difficult for people who have a partner and work outside the house under emergency conditions. The results of a qualitative study by G\u00e1lvez et al. (2020) in Spain showed that women resorting to teleworking criticize the existing employment models in the market. Mokhtarian and Salomon (1994) stated that women take advantage of teleworking more than men and women choose part time work. In 2005, about 18% of European workers preferred part time work. In Belgium, 40% of women have part time works while this number for men is 7%. These numbers show that part time work is more important for women, because part time workers have better work-family balance. Gender stereotypes and social norms define work as the basis and foundation of masculine identity and raising children as a feminine role. Until the income gap between men and women continues and women's careers are considered low-paying and lowreward careers, for some women, the role of motherhood is an important self-fulfillment, satisfaction, and autonomy source. Lack of different accepted roles for men in the society is the reason that men prefer full time work and consider themselves as the main financial source of the family (Vandeweyer & Glorieux, 2008) . For Iran where more than half of those admitted to the entrance exam are women and its culture pays a special attention to the role of women in the house and training children, teleworking can be beneficial.",

However, in Iran, information technology infrastructures are not safe (Nozari et al., 2020) . Some of these infrastructures include lack of information security, lack of familiarity with communicative and educational problems of managers and staff, low internet access, high telecommunication costs, undesirable communicative services distribution in rural and local areas, high costs of hardware equipment, lack of access to the required knowledge in performing the duties, and expensive software systems (Fathian & Jahani, 2020) . Therefore, it can be said that in Iran, teleworking infrastructures are not provided desirably because technology has an important role in the development of teleworking and for this reason, technological infrastructures are needed. On the other hand, Belzunegui-Eraso and Erro-Garc\u00e9s (2020) considered ICT a major factor for teleworking. They analyzed technology appropriateness for specific work role. In this context, intensity of information technology is considered in teleworking processes. Increased use of technology and its advancements and communications have led to the development of teleworking (Messenger & Gschwind, 2016; Belzunegui-Eraso & Erro-Garc\u00e9s, 2020) . Moreover, extensive and constant use of different technologies, especially computers and microelectronics, facilitates teleworking development. The use of virtual system, telematics, and computer procedures provide the context for remote activities within an organization. Previous studies on the effect of ICT-mobile work on teleworking showed that there is a positive relationship between technologies and possibility to work outside the employer buildings) Vargas-Llave et al., 2020). Communication and information technology-based methods create flexible working contexts such as flextime that increase the autonomy of employees (Chung & Van der Horst, 2018) .",

This hazardous condition intensifies and becomes a more comprehensive issue for the future and it should be taken into consideration based on experiences and conditions of different cultures. Moreover, on the one hand, teleworking provides the possibility for constant organizational activities and on the other hand, teleworking ensures collective health of employees. Beck and Wynne (1992) have warned about the global consequences of different phenomena and the potential effects on the world. These aspects demand new thinking processes about global threats. However, to reduce these dangers at the global level, their management should be taken into consideration from local or regional perspectives. Accordingly, companies have imagined that teleworking can facilitate management of health crisis effect on production activities, especially during Covid-19 pandemic.",

Similar codes were classified and placed in more general classes and hidden content in data was determined. Some parts of interview texts with their codes and obtained classes were sent to a supervisor to validate the analysis.

In the current study, to estimate reliability of interview coding, test-retest method was used. Here, for the criterion of acceptability to improve scientific accuracy, validity, and reliability, the points made by Morse et al. (2002) are used that are sensitivity of the researcher in methodological coherence, sample appropriateness, finding repeatability, and use of feedback. Research quality is highly dependent on the skill and sensitivity of the researcher. Creativity, skill, sensitivity, and flexibility ensure reliability and validity. For example, in this study, data were analyzed constantly that led to questions that lengthened sampling to reach the required limit. For this reason, sampling continued until all results were repeated. Lack of sensitivity of the researcher during all research stages threatened its validity that its results will emerge in the final assessment criteria. Also, the findings were sent to experts to receive their opinions and comments. For validity, the results of analysis and coding were given to 7 people (including 4 participants) and 3 people outside the study and their views on the extracted codes, conceptual labels, and data content were received. After obtaining the components through interviews, the researchers converted them into a questionnaire that its face validity and content validity were confirmed by 7 professors of this field of study. In Table 3 , reliability of the questionnaire is examined using Cronbach's alpha and in Fig. 1 and Table 2 , construct validity using factor analysis is investigated. The researcher-made questionnaire includes 29 questions that its details with reliability values of variables are presented in Table 3 .

One of the components of family is taking care of children. Respondents stated that when they go to their workplace, they face many problems related to taking care of their children that forces them to employ a babysitter and pay almost half of their income. Those who had young and teenage children stated that they have more problems in taking care of their children, because younger children are more dependent on their mother and being away from them is very difficult and problematic. For this reason, during teleworking, mothers spend more time at home and can have more time to take care of their children and there is no need to par for babysitter employment. Moreover, they stated that due to fatigue and lack of sufficient time, in many occasions, they give fast foods to their children and this damages their eating habits, but this problem is solved during teleworking to a large extent. Another advantage of teleworking was its mental importance. Respondents stated that they experience a lot of stress to get prepared and go to their workplace. This stress was higher for mothers who had to spend longer distance because factors such as long distance, traffic, accidents, waking up late, and irregularity were stressful. During the Corona crisis, women were more stressed like most people, because they had to take care of themselves against the virus and due to using public transport system, this concern was more severe, but during teleworking, these mental problems were solved to a large extent and their stress levels were decreased. Another advantage of teleworking was its educational importance. Respondents stated that at the workplace, they do not have access to many technologies that have a great impact on education, but during teleworking and by using computer, mobile, and internet, they can improve their education and since students have access to mobiles, they can take advantage of technology. Moreover, they can create video clips and enhance their knowledge about their students and can store this information to send to students who were not present in the class.",

One of these influences is integration of the mentioned divisions according to time and place of working activities using information and communication infrastructures. This study aimed to investigate the consequences of teleworking through the Internet among married women working in educational settings. For this purpose, qualitative and quantitative methods were used. In answering the first question about the advantages of teleworking for working women in educational setting, in the qualitative section and through interviews with scholars, teachers, and university lecturers, it was found that teleworking through the Internet has educational, psychological, economic, health, family, and organizational advantages. Data analysis showed that family, psychological, educational, health, economic, and organizational variables are the most important ones for married women. Moreover, the results of the quantitative part showed that in the variable of family, items including taking care of children, better training, managing household affairs, spending more time with children, and spending more time with husband are the most important ones. Since the researchers in the qualitative part obtained 6 advantages for teleworking through the internet in the interview, these 6 factors are compared with other studies.",
