As per the latest information, 139,123 Indians have died due to suicide in the year 2019, with the highest number of cases from five states-Maharashtra (n = 18,916), West Bengal (n = 12,665), Tamil Nadu (n = 13,493), Madhya Pradesh (n = 12,457), and Karnataka (n = 11,288). 3 Suicide rates, causative factors, and patterns differ a lot between different states and union territories (UTs). Remarkable difference was observed also in terms of occupation, economic status, age, and educational level of an individual, which may not be unusual, considering India's cultural diversity. However, several caveats must be considered before utilizing the data for developing a national suicide prevention strategy.",

According to WHO estimates, among the 183 member states, only a little more than 1/3rd (80) provide high-quality suicide data. 5 A nationally representative mortality survey found that 3% of the total deaths were due to suicide. 6 This survey collected mortality data through a household Measures to Improve the Quality of National Suicide Data of India: The Way Forward S uicide-related mortality statistics varies across countries, as it is influenced by several risk factors. 1 India accounts for more than 1/4th of global suicides. 2 Behind every suicide death in India, there are more than 15 attempts for suicide and more than 200 people with suicidal ideation. 2 The recent National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data on \"Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India\" reports that the suicide rate has increased from 10.2 in 2018 to 10.4 in 2019. 3 There is a 3.4% rise in suicide compared to the previous year, which is alarming. Considering the urgent need for intervention, the Government of India has started a national helpline to improve access to mental health care, along with some other initiatives. 4 Also, there is an urgent need to develop some culturally appropriate interventions or strategies to reduce suicide rates. However, to create effective strategies and measure the change at the national or state level, we need comprehensive data on suicide. Quality data is a fundamental challenge across the globe, especially in low and A few Indian states and UTs have a lacuna in data collection and often send the data after publication of the volume. 7, 12 Further, the data is mostly dependent on public reports, that is, first information report (FIR) filed by police, and is more prone to bias. There is inter-state variation in the reliability and validity of data. Lack of coordination and collaboration between the states in terms of reporting data, too, attributes to such disparities. \u2022 Potential possibilities of underreporting and misclassifying suicides: In some states, only a small and variable proportion of suicide-related deaths are reported to NCRB. 12 This is due to inconsistent approach towards investigation of unnatural deaths, incomplete certification of the cause of death, non-registration of complaints by police (to present a false picture of a decline in suicides and crime), and non-interest of people (due to fear of harassment by the legal system) across states. 7 Due to fear of criminalizing suicides, many suicide cases are registered as accidental death (e.g., unintentional consumption of pesticide or insecticide instead of alcohol 16 This stigma in the religious discourse may be internalized by families and lead to both under-reporting or misreporting. \u2022 Attributing the cause of suicides to socioeconomic factors than mental health issues 3 : NCRB 2019 data reports that the significant causes of suicides are family problems (32.4%), illness (17.1%), marriagerelated issues (5.5%), and drug-abuse/ alcohol addiction (5.6%). It highlights the monocausal association between socioeconomic factors and suicides rather than the complex multifactorial realities of suicides. On the contrary, in Maharashtra and the northwest region, studies incorporating psychological autopsy as a method of assessment found that suicides were predominately associated with psychosocial stressors, psychiatric illness, previous suicide attempts, and alcohol use disorders. 17, 18 It indicates that NCRB data has limited value in developing comprehensive strategies for a national suicide prevention program. \u2022 Undetermined deaths: In many states, the cause of death remains undecided at the time of reporting, but these undetermined deaths affect the recording of suicide rates. 12 \u2022 No responsibility for the quality of data: NCRB mentions that they are not responsible for the authenticity of the information. Data is being furnished by states/UTs, which raises many questions for the quality of suicide data. 3, 8, 19 Despite these concerns, NCRB data provides valuable insight into the patterns of religious perspectives. Active involvement of leaders or prominent figures for creating awareness about suicides and efforts to reduce the stigma and discrimination around suicide can help.",

Taking the data at face value will warrant additional emphasis on suicide prevention efforts in Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Sikkim. In contrast, suicide in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, due to their low rates, will not get due attention. More accurate, reliable, and robust data, with a regular update, is needed to develop effective, scalable, and innovative strategies for suicide prevention in India. To improve the suicide registration, which is otherwise complicated, and multilevel procedures (medical or legal), there is an urgent need to develop the national suicide registry of India under the suicide prevention plan. Continuous, systematic, and sustainable data collection will help in suicide research and to formulate effective policy to achieve the sustainable development goal in 2030, that is, the one-third reduction in the suicide death rate. 3",

Further, each state government may send monthly data of attempted suicide and complete suicide (similar to maternal and child care services) from primary/ secondary/tertiary health care cen-ters, including medical colleges. Also, Panchayati Raj organizations, such as Gram Panchayat, can play a vital role in suicide data collection. This may help for the beginning of sensitization about suicide prevention strategies at the grass-roots level, which may generate a robust national suicide registry in the long term. \u2022 Multidisciplinary teams and training: To understand the complex socioeconomic factors and psychological and biological determinants of suicide, there is a need to establish multidisciplinary teams that include medical experts, psychologists, social workers, and legal experts, under the district mental health program. The team can be trained to record suicide cases using a well-designed case record form. 22 Further, efforts may be taken to link the data collection with interventions to reduce the stigma around suicide and improve mental health. Staff training can include clearing the confusion around different terminologies (e.g., suicide, parasuicide, extended suicide, selfharm, deliberate self-harm, non-suicidal self-injury), avoiding using language such as mental patient, using appropriate terms such as death due to or of suicide rather than committed suicide, and conducting the interview sensitively.",
