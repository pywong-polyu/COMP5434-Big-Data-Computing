Using computer simulation we studied the Susceptible -Infected -Recovered (SIR) process where in consequence of a force of habit that is manifested by the population mobility patterns, the recovered persons create the spatio-temporal patterns as the barriers to a virus transmission. The results show a spontaneous stopping of the virus spread without a need to infect the whole population, a nontrivial random noise of daily count of infected cases, and power laws of a cumulative count of infected cases. Outbreak evolution strongly depends on the initial conditions thus we concluded that the model has the features of chaotic systems that makes it difficult to predict its behaviors. *",

In particular, they focused on stochastic processes based on growth and preferential attachments including the Yule process, the Simon process, the Barab\u00e1si -Albert Model, and stochastic models based on geometric Brownian motion. Stroud et al. (14 ) introduced the power laws of some variables in the traditional homogeneous models, SIR and SEIR, to better model the real outbreaks.

Hurst considered this phenomenon to be important in problems of storage (16 ) . Mandelbrot found that the Hurst exponent H must be 0 \u2264 H \u2264 1. If H < 1 2 then a noise shows an anti-persistent fractional Brownian motion (17 ) . If H > 1 2 then the noise exhibits a long term persistence and nonperiodic cycles.

We observed a power law growth that should be directly linked to either a decrease of mobility or other measures to prevent the virus spread. If an outbreak grows, the exponents are 5.96 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 13.80. If the outbreak intenzity declines (an outbreak decay) then the exponents are\u22128.80 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 \u22125.93. Outbreak dynamics in China (Figure 1 (A)) is country specific. Daily counts of infected cases i(t) are low and persist to fluctuate, for a long time. This type of dynamics prevents the uncontrolled growth of outbreak size M. Rare character of the outbreak dynamics in China, i.e. these long term fluctuations of small daily counts of infected cases i(t), is impossible to explain using the traditional contagion models (5 -7 ). Rare time series of daily count of infected cases i(t) (Figure 1) are limited by the time windows of i(t). Similar rare fluctuations of i(t), but fluctuating around a higher value than in the China, were observed in Belgium (Figure 1 (C)) for a long time period, more than 100 days. Generally, fluctuations of daily count of infected cases (t) are typical for all countries, for example in the Czech Republic (Figure 1 (B)) and in Kenya (Figure 1 (D)) where the fluctuations of i(t) are superimposed on outbreak waves. We evaluated the Hurst exponent H of the fluctuations of i(t) for both experimental (Figure 1) and computational (Figures 2 and 3) time series (18 , 19 ) (Supplementary Materials). The Hurst exponents H, for experimental time series of daily count of infected cases i(t) (Figure 1), were found as: Figure 1 (A) 0.56 \u2264 H \u2264 0.59, Figure 1 (B) 0.28 \u2264 H \u2264 0.35, Figure 1 (C) 0.25 \u2264 H \u2264 0.44 and Figure 1 (D) 0.29 \u2264 H \u2264 0.33. In the time windows where the daily count of infected cases i(t) fluctuates around a certain value, we determined the Hurst exponents H: Figure 1 (B) H = 0.28, for time 300 \u2264 t \u2264 500, Figure 1 (C) H = 0.25, for time 350 \u2264 t\u2264 670, and Figure 1 (D) H = 0.32, for time 200 \u2264 t \u2264 670.",

If the probability of virus transmission p = 0.132, the duration of infection state T i = 14 are constant and the maximal path length l m decreases from l m = 25 to l m = 15, then the computer simulations (Figure 3 (A) show a decrease of the maximal count of infected cases M and a decrease of the outbreak wave duration T . The decrease of the maximal path length l m from l m = 25 to l m = 20, for parameters p = 0.132 and T i = 20, has opposite the effect on the maximal count of infected cases M and the outbreak duration T . In this case, the outbreak duration T decreases and the maximal count of infected cases M increases, but M < N ( (Figure 3 (B) ). The computer simulations, for the parameters p = 0.132, T i = 5 and 90 \u2264 l m \u2264 120, demonstrate the effects of the maximal path length l m on the outbreak evolution (Supplementary Materials (Figure S1)).

            "text": "However, we had to consider the human specific environmental and social conditions that can dramatically change the outbreak evolution (see the model in the Supplementary Materials). The fact that the individual mobility patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns(25 ) led us to implement in the model a quenched spatio-temporal mobility pattern. It is possible to identify individuals that have a high number of daily personal contacts. In the time of pandemic, social behaviors of these individuals are considered for the superspreading from an epidemiological point of view. They have a potential to infect a large number of their daily contacts(26 ). Superspreading skews a distribution of the reproductive numbers R(26 , 27 ). We implemented supersperading as a variable length of daily path m that is assigned to each individual, i.e. the node n i,j . The daily paths, m, follow a simple power law distribution(28 -31 ) (Supplementary Materials). A transmission of the virus from an individual to an individual we modeled as a branching process (12 ), where individuals can move every day along the predestined paths (Supplementary Materials), that are considered for the quenched mobility patterns (25 ). Recovered individuals are naturally concentrated in the spatio-temporal structures along these quenched mobility patterns. Thus the individuals create spatio-temporal barriers for the next infection contagion. We note that a transition of individuals from the infected to the recovered status represents a memory effect. In this way the evolution of the spatio-temporal distribution of recovered individuals slows down a virus spread, that can lead to spontaneous stop of virus contagion without a need to infect the whole population as it is necessary in the classical models (5 -7 ). Individual mobility patterns of the paths of the length m, where the lengths, m, follow a power law distribution, were introduced in the model to mimic the basic social and environmental human behaviors. The results of computer simulations show the spontaneous stopping of outbreak waves. The duration of outbreak T and maximal size of the outbreak M are random variables that span broad intervals. These quantities are independent of the population size N, M \u226a N. Such behaviors indicate the breaking of the scaling relationships near the outbreak threshold (15 ). We think that the percolation phenomenon should be one of the reasons for this broken scaling relationship. However, spontaneous stopping of the outbreak, i.e. M \u226a N, cannot be simply explained only by considering the percolation phenomenon (32 , 33 ), because the percolation processes are not obviously linked to the broad distributions of observable quantities. The broad range of observable values of M and T together with the spontaneous stopping of outbreak indicate that the outbreak growth process could rather resemble the avalanche dynamics a near the self-organized criticality (21 , 23 ), if a probability of an occurrence of the outbreak of size M will follow power law M \u2212\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is a scaling exponent. The proposed model, in contrast to the deterministic sandpile-like models (21 , 23 ), has no flux of any conserved quantity. Forest Fire Model (FFM) of Bak, Chen and Tang and Drossel and Schwabl (23 ), are stochastic models that are linked to percolation phenomenon (23 ). Natural forest fires were directly associated with the FFM (22 ). Our model has features of natural forest fires (22 , 23 ), where the time evolution of forest fires is determined by the previous forest fires. This important observation has been implemented in the model as a spatio-temporal memory effect. We unexpectedly found that the model produces the fluctuations of the daily count of infected cases i(t) that show the Hurst exponents 0.29 \u2264 H \u2264 0.95. A signature of chaotic behaviors (Figure S2 in the Supplementary Materials) has been observed. These features of the model could be useful to explain complexity either outbreak evolution or other similar natural systems. The strong effect of the initial conditions on the outbreak evolution enables us to understand the benefits of early mobility restrictions (34 , 35 ) to change the outbreak dynamic (Figure S2), in comparison with the effects of the intermediate measures that are applied late, that are less intensive, that take longer time (4 ). For example, in the Slovak Republic and in the Czech Republic (the member states of European Union), the first SARS-CoV-2 wave has never begun as a consequence of early and strong changes of the initial conditions of the outbreak growth for a short time. However, in the next SARS-CoV-2 outbreak waves the measures were weak and long (4 ) that led to the full development of the outbreak waves (34 ), a long term dissatisfaction in society and a dramatic increase of the deaths. After the first SARS-CoV-2 wave, the Slovak Republic reported 54 total deaths on 01. October 2020. However, one year later on 01. October 2021, before the third wave, 12660 total deaths were reported. In summary, we have investigated a computational model of virus contagion, in which a spatio-temporal memory effect was introduced. The model generates the time series of positive numbers that show the fluctuation from the anti-persistent to persistent behaviors. A summation of these numbers follows the power law with nontrivial exponents. We unexpectedly observed a signature of chaotic behavior. A phase diagram of the model is not known, thus it should be investigated in the future. The model is possible to use in the studies of other natural phenomena that show the time series of quantities with nontrivial Hurst exponents i.e. H = 0.5. The model could be easily updated to study actual challenging tasks like reinfection, waning immunity (1 ), dominance of virus variants in population (2 ) or other natural phenomena.",
