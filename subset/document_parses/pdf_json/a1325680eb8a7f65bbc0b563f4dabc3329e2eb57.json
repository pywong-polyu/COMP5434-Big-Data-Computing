Undergraduate students were guided to lead weekly sessions of clowning, storytelling, dancing, and cookingrelated activities for 3 months (from November/2020 to February/2021). Method: The mixed-method design of the study addresses the implementation and feasibility of the program. Data analysis considered both quantitativenumber of individuals who accepted the invitation to participate, voluntary dropouts, attendance-and qualitative data-participative observation and thematic analysis of evaluative conversations. An inclusive group of 34 older adults with stroke-induced cognitive impairments, dementia and individuals without any neurological conditions enrolled in the program based on social and racial equity principles. Feasibility and acceptability were addressed in terms of recruitment, implementation, remote evaluation, delivery of remote intervention, adherence, and attendance. Activities and participants' perceptions are described. Results: The initial period of the program achieved 83.7% of adherence and sustainability for additional 3 months. Preliminary results suggest feasibility and acceptability, considering formal and informal support in digital inclusion. Participatory observations describe that the structure of sessions and activities were well received. The analysis of participants' perceptions detects the thematic saliency of feelings of social connection and a sense of having learned with the group.",

Thus, art-based interventions may play a promising role. 10 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent physical distancing measures changed the routines of older adults with dementia and aphasia [11] [12] [13] including postponing and canceling group activities and care-related services. 13, 14 Due to social isolation, this population has been dealing with loneliness-a world without hugs, conversations, and laughter. 15 Thus, the social and healthcare consequences of the pandemic on lifestyle changes have significantly worsened cognitive and functional status, reducing overall physical activities, 16 increasing depression and anxiety, and impacting selfreported quality of life measures. 13, 17, 18 The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of telehealth technology 19 and has highlighted the importance of digital inclusion.",

According to the literature, telehealth technology can reduce the impact of social isolation, avoid the reduction in quality of life of people with cognitive impairments and reduce loneliness. 13, 14, 18 Loneliness is considered one of the main potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. 21 Rates of loneliness correlate with the number of diseases, as well as with the number of medications and depressive symptoms among older adults in Brazil. Additionally, loneliness is also associated with declines in motor function and systemic arterial hypertension in the Brazilian older adult population. 22 According to a study conducted with Brazilian older adults during the pandemic, individuals who reported interacting frequently outside home and individuals who felt that their virtual interactions were disconnected presented increased loneliness. Lonely Brazilian older adults could be at greater risk for COVID-19 because they would be less prone to comply with physical isolation recommendations. Therefore, healthcare providers should be aware of the importance of reducing feelings of loneliness through meaningful virtual interactions both for mental health reasons and as a preventive strategy that would facilitate the commitment to physical distancing during the pandemic. 23 In view of the negative impact of social isolation on the lives of older adults, especially those living with cognitive impairments, and the importance of online tools to promote safe therapeutic options that may attenuate loneliness during the pandemic, we developed an intergenerational remote program called Playful Living. The program was designed to engage socially diverse groups of older adults with undergraduate students from areas of arts and health.",

As shown elsewhere, artistic experiences offer a supportive context for people to communicate through multiple modalities without strict conversational rules. 38 We highlight the frequent initiatives of artistic performance from participants, who often spontaneously lead singing, clowning, dancing and puppetry informal presentations during group sessions of the Playful Living program.

The greatest limitation that the program faced was that these few participants lived in areas which were out of reach for the social care team connected to the program, so our social educators were not able to provide the inperson digital support.

This procedure allowed the prevention of bias and confirmation of observations by checking nonverbal signs of engagement and emotion during sessions. The evaluation of perceptions on the program was based on an open-ended question (How has the program been for you so far?) and participants were encouraged to elaborate their answers and talk about what they liked and did not like about Playful Living and which activities they thought were more useful or pleasurable. The recordings of the evaluative conversations were analyzed for each of the four groups of participants of the program thematic analysis. 35 The method presupposed a comprehensive reading of observational field notes and an attentive review of the recorded videos of each conversation circle, including transcriptions of participants' responses.

In all groups, the most frequent answers of participants were positive assertions on social connection, such as: (P5) \"I like to see everyone on the screen\" (P2). The feeling of learning from the experience was reported both by the older adults and undergraduate students. One indigenous older woman said she has learned a lot from the program and enjoyed being in contact with university students. This participant said she had only two years of education and learned how to read at the age of 30. After explaining her background, she said, \"I am very happy to learn from you\" (P1) P = participant. A student replied, \"We learn with you, and we leave sessions with a warm heart\" (E1) E = Student. In another group, a participant mentioned social engagement and learning, \"We sang, we cried.

She added, \"We work with joy, affection, creativity, and imagination.\"Following the dialog, participant P4 added, \"Young people, in addition to helping us, are learning with this project.\" This participant (P4) reflected on feelings of loneliness and aging, \"older adults are usually slower, people don't have much patience\u2026 family members often don't have time.\" Here in the Playful Living program, we have someone to talk to and to listen to.\" He also pondered, \"family members invite me to go for a walk, go to the beach, I apologize and say, I can't, I have an appointment, I'm in pain, I can't walk properly\u2026 these are my excuses for not getting in F I G U R E 3 Structure of the program's sessions and participatory observations of activities their way.\" He pointed out that in the Playful Living program he does not feel like a \"dead weight.\" 6 | DISCUSSION The study showed that the Playful Living program is feasible in terms of recruitment, retention, attrition, and acceptability for Brazilian vulnerable older adults with and without stroke and dementia induced cognitive impairments. In line with studies supporting successful inclusive conversations with people with aphasia and dementia, 36 participants who attended the program were able to participate in conversations using verbal and nonverbal strategies and rely on the support of their communicative partners. These results are in agreement with authors who consider that repositioning agency during interactions with older adults with cognitive impairments is crucial for their wellbeing during communication. When placed in a comfortable and horizontal environment that favors exchanges, the process of sharing is eased and voice is given to self expression. 37 The activities proposed in the program were inclusive, called for each participant's engagement and respected their processing time. This created confidence and instigated enjoyable moments for both young and older adults. As argued by authors interested in the use of digital technology to promote the interaction of younger adults with older adults living with dementia, creating meaningful and empathetic intergenerational engagement requires a thoughtful and sensitive approach towards older adults with cognitive impairments. 37 There is a change in communication, rather than a loss of ability to communicate. The impetus to understand this change must be placed on the communicative partners of older adults living with dementia. 37 The same can be said about the process of communicating with people living with aphasia. 36 Rather than expecting the person with diverse cognition to make up for cognitive deficits, future health professionals should be prepared to view communication differently and facilitate inclusive interactions. Playful artistic activities seem to favor this understanding and may help fight against the stigma faced by vulnerable older adults. 30 Embodied practices such as dancing and clowning can be especially didactic in promoting a change of perspectives about communication. 29-31 Such practices require communication beyond speech. They promote the experience of learning to be nonverbally affected by others and finding joy in sharing new and unexpected patterns of communication. 31 Many of the observations of the dynamics of interactions during the remote group activities of the Playful Living program were in line with literature on successful digital inclusion experiences of older adults.

On the other hand, participative observations and the review of recorded sessions confirmed the active participation and nonverbal signs of satisfaction during group activities. Overall, the results are largely positive, and the triangulation of objective quantitative attendance and qualitative data on the engagement of participants support the feasibility and acceptability evidence. 7 | CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study shows the feasibility and acceptability of offering remote playful activities for Brazilian vulnerable older adults, including those living with cognitive impairments. Moreover, the program's experience demonstrated how virtual settings can be humane and how interdisciplinary teams can establish meaningful interactions in this new environment. Participants embraced opportunities to express themselves creatively and to connect socially in a playful remote setting. Likewise, digital skills of undergraduate and graduate students were developed and their interest in relationships with cognitively diverse older adults was promoted.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe warmly acknowledge all the participants, family members, social educators, and team members of the Playful Living program.

In the current study, a considerable part of the drop-out and low-attendance results calls for attention on the need for providing in-person digital support to this population.

The Brazilian health information systems often fail to provide search mechanisms that offer analyses with racial stratification. When the race/colour field is present in instruments, many professionals fill out the 'ignored' category. This indicates that there is a lack of awareness of the importance of this data, which becomes a major barrier to fighting racism and promoting health equity in Brazil.51 Older black adults who suffered strokes have the highest mortality rates due to their lower socioeconomic conditions.2,52 The life expectancy of older black and brown adults is lower in Brazil, and, in addition, there are more single older black adults as well as a greater number of older black adults who do not have children.",
