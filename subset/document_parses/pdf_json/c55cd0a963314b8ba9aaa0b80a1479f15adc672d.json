This typology brings to the fore the pathdependent nature of policies and practices of exclusion/inclusion in the region, which impact on migrants' effective access to social and economic rights, while shaping the broader dynamics of migration governance in the region.",

In the second section, we outline the methodological approach and the limitations of the study. In the third section, we provide an overview of the legal, social and economic rights afforded to migrants and refugees in the seven countries before COVID-19. In the fourth section, we turn to the analysis of pandemic NCST initiatives in each country and the extent to which their design and implementation includes or excludes migrants and refugees. On these bases, we then propose a typology of social protection in relation to the assemblage of actors, modes of protection and the emerging subjectification of migrants during the pandemic. We conclude by highlighting the implications of these findings for the governance of mobility in Latin America during, and beyond, the pandemic.",

Almost all Latin American states have since designed different kinds of social protection strategies, mainly geared towards poverty reduction. Barrientos (2010) identifies three types of policy strategies depending on whether they focus on mitigating risks, attending needs, or are related to entitlements and rights. The United Nations Human Rights Council emphasises that \"human rights obligations relate not only to the final outcome of social protection programmes, which is to ensure the enjoyment of at least minimum essential levels of economic, social and cultural rights, but also to the process through which such programmes are designed and implemented\" (Sepulveda & Nyst, 2012: 11) .",

A first issue with social rights is that this category of rights has been understood as social benefits rather than true rights with real justiciability (De Lucas, 2002) . A second issue is the use of nationality or immigration status criteria to differentiate and stratify people, generating unequal conditions and uneven access to social rights (Asa & Ceriani, 2010) .",

The proliferation of new legal categories to face the challenges of increasingly complex mixed migration flows has created fragmentation (Crawley & Skleparis, 2018; Zetter, 2007) and has had consequences for access to rights (Morris, 2016) .

Thus, rather than a dichotomy between inclusion and exclusion, there may be a continuum of social policies that place migrants and refugees in different positions in the social stratification ladder. This stratification is linked to notions of (non) citizenship socially attributed to migrants, considering that crossing borders supposes the demarcation of different rights (Balibar, 2002) .",

Usually, humanitarian action is associated with the work of international and non-profit organisations, yet states are increasingly using the language of humanitarianism in the implementation of policies toward migrants and refugees, replacing a politics of rights and justice with an ethics of suffering and compassion (Fassin, 2012) . In doing so, humanitarianism tends to render the passive and suffering body, instead of the deserving citizen, as a sort of proof to justify state action and intervention (Ticktin, 2011) . In this vein, Dijstelbloem and van der Veer (2019) discuss the apparent contradictions of humanitarian border dynamics, characterised by the articulation of both care and control practices by multiple actors in response to growing mixed migration flows (Walters, 2011) . These simultaneous practices intensify the vulnerability of migrant and refugee populations in contexts where social protection mechanisms are limited. Yet, despite the multiplicity of actors in these humanitarian contexts and the increasing privatisation of social assistance, it is the state that ultimately has the sovereign power of granting social and economic rights (Jones et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "While these trends have been widely discussed in the European context (Ticktin, 2011), they are more recent in Latin America. The academic debates in the region have addressed the way in which some policies, while clothed in moral universals and humanitarian imperatives, are ultimately aimed at the management, control, and exclusion of mobile populations (Finn & Umpierrez de Reguero, 2020; Herrera & Berg, 2019; Ramirez, 2020; Stang et al., 2020) . Indeed, with the advent of the recent Venezuelan and Central American exodus, the idea of a humanitarian crisis emerged across the region, with several studies and some international organisations claiming that the recent massive migration has been a response to numerous human rights violations and severely deteriorated socioeconomic conditions threatening survival (Freier, 2018) . Against this background, terms such as \"migration in the context of crisis\" emerged to explain the drivers of this migration flow, alongside \"migration crisis\" discourses to justify the exceptionalist nature of the political-institutional responses adopted by many Latin American receiving countries (Freitez, 2019; Gandini et al., 2019; Zapata & Tapia, 2021) . However, as some migration scholars have argued, the idea of a migration crisis could become a magnifying lens to decipher existing trends towards a politics of humanitarianism (Cantat et al., 2019) , as well as a 'productive' word that the states can use to justify their actions (Mountz, 2020) . This is because the crisis narrative that we see taking a hold across the region is key to rendering the responses to mobility as something 'exceptional' , justifying humanitarian discourses and practices (Menjivar et al., 2019; Stang et al., 2020) . In this scenario, the growing role of international organisations such as the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the regional response to these crises is closely related to the idea of migration management, under the slogan of safe, orderly and regular migration, aimed to deal with states' sensibilities towards interference with their sovereignty (P\u00e9coud, 2018) .",

IOs included UN agencies, primarily, IOM and UNHCR, while CSOs included local, national and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs), religious and non-religious, as well as migrant-led organisations. Aware of the fact that in the federative states, local governments play a crucial role in the provision of some social and economic services, apart from seven major cities in the country-case studies, the fieldwork also included at least one border city in each country, for a total of 16 urban contexts analysed. Details on the number of interviews conducted and type of actors by country are included in the Appendix (Table 4) . 3 The interview schedule was organised in four sections and included questions related to (1) changes in migration and refugee policy and practice during the pandemic, (2) the conditions and access of migrants to health, housing, labour, and social protection during the pandemic, (3) attitudes towards migrant and refugee populations, and (4) changes in the modes of working and/or type of assistance provided by the different actors interviewed. Despite minor variations to address the specificities of each type of actor, we used the same interview schedule across all seven countries. Given the mobility restrictions imposed by COVID-19, the interviews were conducted online by audio/video conferencing, between June and September 2020. Interviews lasted between 40 min and 1 h, and informed consent was given by all participants. The study received approval by the ethics committees of two of the authors' higher education institutions. 4 The interviews were transcribed and coded into themes set in advance by the research team in a group discussion. The data was then inputted in a common systematization matrix, which enabled triangulation of responses by type of actor across the case studies. The narratives collected in the interviews are imbued throughout the analysis and interviewees have been cited in the paper where appropriate.",

Constitutions in these countries establish Source: Own elaboration based on review of Legal Regulatory Frameworks in each of the seven country case studies equal civil rights for all individuals. However, in countries with migration and/or refugee laws some of the basic social rights are limited to regular migrants. In the case of Chile, several articles of the Political Constitution are implicitly applicable to migrants, and even though irregular migrants are not included in this legal framework, the country has adopted specific decrees and regulations aiming to guarantee access to education and health, independently of residency status, as well as equal labour rights. In Peru for example, the Refugee Law, inter alia, guarantees labour rights for asylum seekers, and the Migration Law guarantees the right to health, education, and work for all migrants, including those with irregular status. At the same time, the law states that access to rights depends on specific norms issued by different Ministries, which undoubtedly constitutes a huge barrier to migrants' effective access. For its part, Colombia has given the first steps to resolve institutional gaps regarding migrants' rights through a multiplicity of temporary measures. 5 For instance, access to emergency health services and education is available to irregular Venezuelan migrants, while migrants with a Permiso Especial de Permanencia (PEP) [Special Stay Permit] have been granted access to health, education, and the labour market. In contrast, Mexican Migration and Refugee law guarantee access to educational and emergency health services to all migrants regardless of their status but limit economic and social inclusion to those with regular status, and allow family reunification only for refugees. In the cases of Colombia, Peru and Mexico, contingent circumstances such as the great inflows from, respectively, Venezuela in 2016 and the 2018 Central American Caravans, led to the creation of instruments to regularise (temporarily in some cases) immigrant populations in order to facilitate access to health, education and labour programmes (Gandini et al., 2019 (Gandini et al., , 2020a . Table 2 systematises the narratives by the three types of actors interviewed in the seven country case studies, with regards to programmes and actions to mitigate the social and economic effects of the pandemic among the migrant and refugee populations. We focus on NCST programmes and actions undertaken by governments, IOs and CSOs, including cash and in-kind benefits such as food vouchers, food baskets, and provision or guarantee of goods and/or services. Government programmes are limited to those that were maintained, expanded, or created during the pandemic. These include both Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programmes-such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia (PBF) [Family Grant] in Brazil and Asignaciones Familiares (AFAM) [Family Allowances] in Uruguay-and non-conditional new emergency transfers created to respond to the pandemic.",

However, there is a broad heterogeneity with regards to the degree of inclusion of migrant and refugee populations in both types of programmes. In most countries, access to NCSTs or state aid is conditioned to having an identity card, and in some of them, also being part of social programme registries-which may imply meeting certain income threshold criteria. However, the way in which these programmes have been implemented, especially with regards to compliance with the established requirements, largely determines migrants and refugees' effective access. At one end of this social inclusion spectrum are Brazil and Uruguay, which have the highest levels of inclusion. In both countries, the benefits of existing programmes-PBF in Brazil, and Asignaciones Familiares por Plan (Table 2 ). In both pre-existing and recent transfers, effective access to migrant and refugee populations is guaranteed.

However, due to the slowdown in immigration procedures in the context of the pandemic-a phenomenon common to the entire region-some migrants lacked the required documentation to apply for these programmes, as stated by our interviewees from CSOs. However, this obstacle was overcome by in-person delivery of the CEA and facilitating the acquisition of a national ID to the programmes' beneficiaries, as reported by interviewees from the national government in Montevideo and Rivera. The Uruguayan case exemplifies how bureaucraticadministrative requirements can be subordinate to guaranteeing effective access to rights. Thus, in these two countries, where there is full inclusion and clarity in the legal framework regarding the rights of migrants and refugees and an expanded social protection system, effective access to social protection is verified both in pre-existing and ad hoc programmes created to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.",

According to interviewees in Santiago and Arica, migrants with expired identity cards or those with irregular migration status face the greatest difficulties. 6 A study of the last Chilean National Socioeconomic Characterisation Survey (CASEN) shows that even for those migrants that managed to access government subsidies during the pandemic, the average amount they received was 58.3% below the average amount obtained by the Chilean nationals (Acu\u00f1a, 2021) .",

In turn, IOs and civil society have had a complementary role developing an emergency response aimed to address the basic needs of the vulnerable population. Similarly, Chile developed an emergency response led by the central government that, although in principle does not exclude the migrant population, in practice the eligibility criteria limits access to migrants and refugees who have a regularised status and meet certain criteria (see Table 2 ). IOs and CSOs have a complementary but crucial social protection role towards all migrants and refugees in the country, and in some cases even including national residents, as evidenced by our interviews with IOs and faith-based NGO representatives. A key aspect to these dynamics is the partnerships that UNHCR and IOM have established with some Chilean municipalities. For instance, as stated by our IOs interviewees, by July 2020, UNHCR had worked with the Municipality of Santiago to provide food and shelter and with the Municipality of Estaci\u00f3n Central, to provide 200 food baskets, 50 hygiene kits and 40 kits of diapers; while IOM has partnered with some private local businesses to directly deliver food baskets to migrants. The municipalities of Santiago and Arica have also been working closely with NGOs and migrantled organisations to cover the basic needs of the local migrant population and of those waiting to return to their countries of origin (see Vera Espinoza et al., 2020) .",

As in the case of Chile, in Peru we also found that local governments (Tumbes and Tacna) have partnered with IOM and UNHCR.

This is consistent (2) the militarisation of migration control, with the creation of the National Guard and; (3) an institutional reorganisation of migration governance that passed over the responsibility of migration controls from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Foreign Relations (Gandini 2020) . 12 Prior to the pandemic, Seguro Popular, a programme that provided temporary health coverage to those without insurance, including migrant and refugee populations, was abolished. As a result, 15 million people lost access to health services between 2018 and 2020 (CONEVAL 2021). The Instituto de Salud para el Bienestar (INSABI) [Institute of Health for Welfare] was created under the current administration. However, to date it does not have clear implementation rules. The shortcomings of both programmes, before and during the pandemic, mean that the provision of public health tends to be case-by-case and challenged on a daily basis at the local level, affecting migrants and refugees, who are commonly left with no coverage. During the pandemic, protocols regarding medical and mental health services for immigrant populations were published (Bautista-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2021) , but there is not enough evidence on how they were implemented.",

As the interviews in the seven countries revealed, these organisations have demonstrated a speed for response and organisation that far exceeds that of governments, through the retooling of their budgets and action plans to effectively respond to the pandemic.

It also allows for a better understanding of the articulation of actors in the provision of social protection, as well as the strategies and practices they deploy.

First, it brings to the fore how global discourses on humanitarian crises and the attendant regional articulation of a \"crisis within the crisis\" have contributed to the state's disengagement and the deterioration of effective policies of social protection for migrants and refugees in Latin America. That is to say that the socioeconomic mitigation measures put in place to deal with the sanitary-economic crisis are based on and further affirm notions of protection that are contingent and crisis-driven, with temporal limitations that often selectively exclude migrants based on legal status.",

            "text": "Second, we mobilise understandings about the key role of social rights as a basic condition for the effective integration of migrant and refugee populations within a framework of rights-based citizenship. Third, we have shown the complexities of the nature of policies and practices of migration governance in Latin America. The new legal categories and ad-hoc measures that emerged across the region in response to the displacement of Venezuelans and Central Americans, among other international mobilities, have contributed to either produce migrant irregularity or to reinforce practices of exclusion/inclusion that impact on migrants' effective access to social and economic rights. We discuss all these aspects in relation to migrant subjectification as either subjects of rights or humanitarian subjects. Our intention with this categorisation is by no means to produce yet another binary understanding of the migrant subject. Rather, our analysis sheds light on the diverse current assemblages of actors and the social inclusion/exclusion spectrum operating in the region, and how they are shaping migrants and refugees' lives in Latin America, through an enhanced understanding of their rights and effective access to social protection during the pandemic. In this way, we contribute to expanding a growing body of literature on social protection and migration governance in Latin America and on migrants' and refugees' integration, while paving the way to keep exploring the differentiated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on (im)mobility across the region.",
