Statistical analysis demonstrated that lymphocyte is negatively correlated with IL-6 (R = \u2212 0.26; p < 0.001) (eFig. 1).

Our study developed a novel marker to represent immunedysregulation and concluded that IL-6/lymphocyte had an improved predictive value compared to IL-6 and lymphocytes alone. Additionally, IL-6/lymphocyte showed a potential value to identify high-risk patients who needed more timely therapy at the early phase of COVID-19. Fig. 1 a Relationship between IL-6/lymphocyte and 28-day mortality for intensive care patients with COVID-19 using splines. Overlying red is fitted linear splines with 95% CI. b ROC curve analysis and comparison of the AUCs for IL-6/lymphocyte, IL-6 and lymphocytes in COVID-19. c Stratified mortality of groups based on the cutoff value of IL-6/lymphocyte in COVID-19. Bars show the percent of patients who died and 95% CI. COVID-19: coronavirus disease-2019; ROC: receiver operating characteristic; AUC: area under the curve",
