In rheumatologic patients, sHLH is referred to as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Differentiating between triggers is important for prompt treatment and prognosis. Data comparing subsets of sHLH are limited due to the rarity of this disease. We aim to explore differences in clinical features that may differentiate MAS from malignancy-associated HLH (mHLH) patients. We conducted a single-center retrospective study assessing clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment regimens and outcomes in 34 patients with sHLH over a 16 year period. We compared patients with MAS to those with mHLH. Hepatomegaly was not present in the MAS group but was present in the mHLH group (0 vs. 25%, p = 0.024). MAS patients had on average nearly double the concentration of platelets at 50.0 (IQR: 31.0-78.0 K\u00b5/L) vs. 29.0 K\u00b5/L (IQR: 14.0-37.5 K\u00b5/L), p = 0.003. Soluble IL-2R concentrations were four times lower in the MAS group with a median soluble IL-2R concentration of 6814.5 kU/L (IQR: 2101-2610 kU/L) vs. 27972.0 kU/L (IQR: 12,820-151,650 kU/L), p = 0.010. The MAS group fared better overall than the mHLH group but was not statistically significant (mortality 22 vs. 44%, p = 0.18). MAS and mHLH patients exhibited different laboratory parameters and clinical features, most notably differences in platelet counts, soluble IL-2R concentration and hepatomegaly, which may help differentiate these conditions early in their course.",

Features most frequently associated with sHLH include fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, elevated ferritin, and elevated soluble IL-2 receptor. When this disease process occurs in the setting of rheumatologic diseases, it is called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). MAS is most commonly associated with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), but can also rarely be seen in other rheumatologic conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and dermatomyositis [1] . Malignancies known to trigger sHLH include lymphomas, T/NK-cell disorders, acute leukemias, lymphoproliferative diseases, and myelodysplastic syndrome [2] . Although both malignancy-associated HLH (mHLH) and MAS have poor outcomes, MAS carries a lower fatality rate [1, 2] .",

The exact mechanism that triggers MAS is unknown, but it is likely related to a defect in immune cell cytolytic activity, which results in prolonged cell-to-cell interaction and a pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade [3, 4] . In recent years, certain loss of function mutations were retroactively identified in patients who developed sHLH as an adult, showing that there is indeed a genetic component to these acquired syndromes [5] . In addition to an underlying genetic predisposition, sHLH requires an environmental trigger, such as infection, immunosuppression, uncontrolled autoimmune disease, or malignancy [6] . Identifying the trigger is important, because treatment differs depending on the underlying etiology and patients often present in critical condition [7, 8] .",

We searched for patients with laboratory features seen in MAS or HLH with known underlying rheumatologic conditions or hematologic malignancy to find patients who may not have been properly coded for MAS or HLH.

We collected Yamaguchi criteria data for AOSD patients. During their disease course, all AOSD patients (6 of 6) presented with high fevers, arthritis/arthralgias, characteristics rash, and leukocytosis.

IL-2R concentrations did differ between groups, significantly. Furthermore, not only were platelet counts significantly higher in the MAS cohort at 50 K\u00b5/L compared to 29.9 K\u00b5/L, but they also showed a significant difference in post-treatment values between the two groups. Platelet discrepancies between MAS and other forms of HLH have been reported in the past, and show MAS patients as having higher platelet counts compared to other groups [26] . These studies, however, predominantly compare MAS to familial forms of HLH. Since there is little data on predicting unique characteristics to the adult population of MAS, our findings may be helpful in differentiating MAS from mHLH. With respect to treatment regimens, MAS patients were more likely to receive pulse dose steroids and immunomodulatory medications compared to mHLH patients, while mHLH patients were more likely to receive etoposide/dexamethasone combination therapy. Etoposide/ dexamethasone-based therapies are reported as resulting in a long-term survival of greater than 50% in familial forms of HLH [30] . Though there are limited randomized control trials for MAS treatment protocols, the treatments seen in this study are similar to what is seen in the literature [30] [31] [32] . Biologics are increasingly being used in patients with severe MAS [33] , and in our cohort, Anakinra was used in 33% of MAS cases. Though there is minimal data on the use of immunologic therapies in MAS in an adult population, early pediatric studies on the use of anakinra in corticosteroid refractory MAS have been promising [34] . There is limited data to support the Bars represent interquartile ranges for data analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

            "text": "It is frequently unclear what tips somebody into the immune dysregulation that causes MAS or mHLH, but infection can be a trigger for these patients. Viral triggers, including EBV, CMV, parvovirus, HSV, HIV and, more recently, SARS-CoV-2, have been implicated in the development of secondary HLH in the absence of an underlying malignancy or autoimmune disease [36] . Bacterial infections, including anaplasma and ehrlichia, are also associated with HLH [37, 38] . EBV and CMV PCR was not consistently evaluated in our cohort; however, a quarter of patients had detectable EBV by PCR and three patients were found to have CMV viremia. EBV is a common trigger of HLH, including in patients with no underlying autoimmune disease or malignancy, and, similar to the patients in this cohort, EBV-associated HLH is frequently treated with rituximab in addition to etoposide/dexamethasone-based treatments [39] . Despite detecting the presence of EBV and CMV by PCR in a portion of patients, few patients received specific therapy, likely because their overall clinical picture was more consistent with an underlying autoimmune or malignant process rather than secondary to EBV or CMV infection. In all MAS patients, the viremia was thought to represent reactivation from immune dysregulation rather than an incident infection. The single MAS patient with CMV viremia was the only patient to receive concomitant antiviral therapy in addition to immunosuppression. Further understanding of the role of these infections in triggering HLH and the implications on treatment is an important area for further research. Although infections can be triggers for other etiologies of HLH, in MAS and mHLH infection is thought to be an epiphenomenon. Regardless, infections should be treated, especially in MAS since concomitant infections in rheumatologic patients on immunosuppressive therapies is not uncommon.",

Our research shows that immunologic laboratory values, most notably platelet count, as well as clinical features, including the absence of hepatomegaly, may help distinguish these two disease states, and as a result, help guide clinical decision making early on in the disease process. Future research into differentiating MAS from other triggers for HLH, including infection, as well as research with larger sample sizes, will be important to further elucidate this important distinction.",
