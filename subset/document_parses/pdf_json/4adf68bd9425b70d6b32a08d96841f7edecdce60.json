Non-pharmaceutical interventions have had a long history of preventing many infectious diseases such as the pandemic Influenza, Measles, and the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Actions taken in the early stage of the coronavirus outbreak by the various state governments in the United States include declaring a state of emergency and issuing a state-wide shelter in place. The use of a face mask by the general public in the United States has been controversial as some state governors issued executive orders that voided face mask mandates within their jurisdiction (17) .",

(18) proposed an agent-based model to assess the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 mortality. In the absence of public health interventions, their model projected high mortality in the United States and the United Kingdom. Eikenberry et al. (3) developed a mathematical model to assess the impact of mask use by the general public on the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their results showed that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks might reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Recently, Ngonghala et al. (8) developed a mathematical model to assess the impact of NPIs on curtailing the public health burden of COVID-19 in the United States. Their study showed the effect of early implementation of face masks, lockdown, and lifting of social-distancing. Extending the duration of lockdown could reduce the daily cases, daily mortality in the United States. Mizumoto and Chowell (19) used a mathematical model to assess the potential for a coronavirus outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess cruise, which experienced a major COVID-19 outbreak during the months of January and February of 2020. Their study showed that the basic reproduction number of the model decreases with increasing the effectiveness of the quarantine and isolation measures implemented on the ship.",

Other parameters, such as the effective infection rate parameters \u03b2, education rate \u03c8, education efficacy \u03c9, and fatigue rate \u03bd are obtained by fitting the model to the observed cumulative mortality data for the United States (21, 22) . In particular, the United States Cumulative mortality data from January 22, 2020 (first index case) to December 8, 2020 were obtained from the John Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering COVID-19 Dashboard (23) . We fitted the model for three different time periods of the pandemic, with the first period from January 22, 2020 to July 5, 2020, second period from July 6, 2020 to September 30, 2020, and the third period from October 1, 2020 to December 8, 2020. This was done in order to correctly capture the trends observed in the daily mortality data (i.e., the COVID-19 waves observed). Hence, we obtained three set of values for the parameters to be estimated based on the different periods. Our choice of fitting the model to the mortality data is due to the fact that there is evidence of under-reporting and undertesting of COVID-19 cases in countries such as France, Italy, United States, Iran, and Spain. Hence, mortality data may provide a better indicator for COVID-19 case spread (8, 24) . The datafitting process involves implementing the standard nonlinear least squares approach using the fmincon Optimization Toolbox embedded in MATLAB. The estimated values of the unknown parameters are tabulated in Table 4 Tables 3,  4 . The results depicted in Figure 3 , show that the model also captures the observed daily mortality data for each of the period considered. Thus, the parameter estimation of model (S1) shows that cumulative mortality data provides a very reliable calibration for coronavirus transmission dynamics. In Figures 3A,D, it is worth mentioning that the fit is not really good around mid March. This is not surprising since testing capacities have been ramped up around this time, leading to an increasing fraction of infections being detected.",

The effect of such uncertainties is assessed using uncertainty and sensitivity analysis (25) (26) (27) . In particular Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC) is used to identify model parameters that have the most influence on the model with the reproduction number (R c ) as the response function. The purpose of this analysis is to determine effects of parameters on model outcomes (25) (26) (27) . A highly sensitive parameter should be more carefully estimated, since a small change in that parameter can cause a large quantitative changes in the result (25) (26) (27) . On the other hand, a parameter that is not sensitive does not require as much attempt to estimate, since a small change in that parameter will not cause a large variation to the quantity of interest (26) . Parameters with large PRCC greater than +0.50 are said to be highly positively correlated with the response function, while those <\u22120.50 are said to be highly negatively correlated with the response function (25) (26) (27) . The parameters considered in the PRCCs analysis are the effective infection rate for unwilling (willing) individuals (\u03b2), education rates for unwilling (willing) individuals (\u03c8), education efficacy (\u03c9), and fatigue rate (\u03bd). We performed a PRCC analysis for the three different periods; however, the parameters have the same effect on the response function for the three periods. We chose to report one plot as displayed in Figure 4 . The results show that the (3, 5, 18) four parameters that mostly impact the response function (R c ) are the effective infection rate (\u03b2), education rate (\u03c8), fatigue rate (\u03bd), and education efficacy (\u03c9). Based on the PRCC values, the transmission rate for unwilling individuals and the fatigue rate has a positive impact on R c , as an increase(decrease) in the transmission and fatigue parameter will increase(decrease) R c . In contrast, the education rate and efficacy have a negative impact on the R c , and an increase in these parameters will decrease the R c .",

This impedes the immediate curtailment of the epidemic much more severely than too few individuals being in the process of being educated (this is exactly the reason, why \u03c8 does barely affect R c : rather than the flux from uneducated to educated individuals the number of currently educated individuals acts on R c ). As soon as a significant number of individuals is educated, the effect of the education efficacy on R c will increase dramatically. Moreover, since R c depends on the values of the initial conditions (S * u and S * e ), it is expected that R c decreases as more individuals are being educated over time. Figure 6a shows that for the period January 22, 2020 to July 5, 2020, with the baseline education efficacy, R c can be brought to a value <1 if 90% among all susceptible individuals are educated. This result suggests that an incredibly high education rate (\u03c8) is necessary to curtail the outbreak effectively for the period January 22, 2020, to July 5, 2020. However, for the period July 6, 2020, to September 30, 2020, of the outbreak, with the baseline education efficacy, R c can be brought to a value less than one if 76% among all susceptible individuals are educated (Figure 6b) . Figure 6c shows that for the period October 1, 2020, to December 8, 2020, with the baseline education efficacy, R c can be brought to a value less than one if 51% among all susceptible individuals are educated. This result further supports the need to educate more people if we are to effectively curtail the coronavirus outbreak, which is consistent with the results obtained in Figure 5 .",

The model allows for the assessment of the impact of public health education programs on the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. The model was parameterized using cumulative mortality data for the United States from January 22, 2020, to December 8, 2020, to assess the population-level impact of public health education programs on the outbreak. In particular, we showed that the disease-free equilibrium of the model is locally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (R c ) is less than one. The epidemiological implication of this result is that when R c < 1, a small COVID-infected individuals in the community will not lead to an outbreak.",

In other words, our study shows that COVID-19 could have been effectively controlled if the public health education campaign has been intensified enough with high efficacy (and sustained) from the beginning of the pandemic. Furthermore, we also explored the sensitivity of the reproduction number with respect to willingness fatigue rate in the United States for three different periods of the outbreak. Since the reproduction number R c depends on the values of the initial conditions (S * u and S * e ), our result shows that R c can be brought to a value less than one (needed to effectively control the disease) as more individuals are being educated over time.",

The results obtained further showed the prospect of effective public health education programs in reducing both the cumulative and daily mortality of the novel coronavirus in the United States. In particular, a 10% increase in education rate from the baseline value reduces the peak mortality by 66.3% by April 20, 2020, 26.7% by July 31, 2020, and 16% by December 8, 2020, when compared to the baseline scenario. However, a 40% increase in education rate from the baseline value reduces the peak daily mortality by 96.8% by April 7, 2020, 44.5% by July 24, 2020, and 54.8% by . This result is consistent with what was obtained in (3, 5, 8, 18) , where the universal use of face masks greatly curtailed community transmission of COVID-19 and brought the pandemic under very effective control.",

Many state governments issued executive order mandating a face mask in public and restricting large gatherings of people. However, using a face mask and social-distancing in public places appears to be politicized in the United States (29) . In particular, states like Georgia and Iowa barred Mayors and City Councils from introducing mask mandates, even as cases continues to rise in various counties in the state (30) . While many people strictly adhere to public health measures, others passionately ignore them. We ran simulations to show the impact of loss of willingness (fatigue rate) on both the cumulative and peak daily mortality. The result indicates that non-compliance to public health measures would increase the cumulative and daily mortality in the United States. In particular, a 10% increase in fatigue rate from the baseline value increases the peak daily mortality by 6.9% by May 1, 2020, 10.1% by August 3, 2020, and 58.5% by , when compared to the baseline scenario. However, a 40% increase in fatigue rate from the baseline value increases the peak daily mortality by 31.9% by April 20, 2020, 67% by July 27, 2020, and 254% by , when compared to the baseline scenario. This result further supports the fact that states with less adherence to public health measures may experience more coronavirus cases and daily mortality than places where there is strict adherence (3, 5, 8) .",
