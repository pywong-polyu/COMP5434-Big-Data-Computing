Because only a minority of units offer For preterm infants, reductions in opportunities to offer kangaroo care may lead to the sensitive window for maturation of the autonomic nervous system being missed. Parent mental health may also suffer: in a unit that had strict limitations on parent-infant contact pre-COVID-19, as many as 60% of mothers and 47% of fathers reported significant PTSD symptoms [25] . These findings lend support to the perspective echoed by the BAPM: \"The mother and her newborn are a biological entity and should have unrestricted contact when admission to a NNU is unavoidable\" ( [26] (p. 14)). Restrictions to parent-infant contact as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic are therefore likely to have adverse repercussions for families in the short and longer term; however, at present, little is known about the impact of these policies on parents.",

The research team chose hashtags both relevant to the experience of premature birth and the cohort of parents and healthcare professionals in a NICU during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as those that would allow for a wide range of tweets to be identified. The hashtags searched were #preterm, #parentalaccess, #neonatalcare, #nicu, #maternalhealth, and #neonatalhealth. These hashtags represent the search terms joined with \"OR\".

It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated anxieties for both staff and parents in neonatal units. In line with Muniraman et al. [22] , the distress of parents having restrictions imposed on contact with their newborn babies was palpable in their tweets. Fears were expressed by both parents and healthcare staff about the consequences of this reduction in contact for the longer-term health and development of the babies. Inevitably this worry and anxiety regarding their babies' wellbeing added further to the challenges parents were already facing with a knock on adverse impact on their own emotional wellbeing. These very real concerns needed, however, to be balanced with the risks to health as a consequence of COVID-19 spreading within the hospital. Tweets highlighting how COVID-19 severely affected pregnant women, with some women tragically dying, underlined the seriousness of the situation. A proportion of tweets, therefore, sought to raise awareness of the risk to pregnant women and also to offer reassurance to parents regarding hygiene procedures implemented within neonatal units to protect babies from the virus.",

Being in the NICU is typically a physically stressful time for parents [17, 21] , adding further to the emotional stresses of having a baby whose survival is threatened.",

A COVID-19 \"baby blind spot\" has been identified where the needs of these most vulnerable members of society are often neglected [35] . Such a blind spot is perhaps all the more concerning for babies in neonatal care and their families who have already experienced so many challenges. Despite this, the resilience of families and their babies shines through in the acknowledgement and celebration of small, intimate, meaningful moments and milestones. A greater understanding of the lived experiences of preterm birth and the additional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic should inform improved support for families, babies, and the healthcare workers involved in their care.",
