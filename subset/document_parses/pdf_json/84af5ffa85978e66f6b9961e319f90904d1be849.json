            "text": "Mobile contact tracing apps have been developed by many countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trials have focussed on unobserved population trials or staged scenarios aimed to simulate real life. No efficacy measure has been developed that assesses the fundamental ability of any proximity detection protocol to accurately detect, measure, and therefore assess the epidemiological risk that a mobile phone owner has been placed at. This paper provides a fair efficacy formula that can be applied to any mobile contact tracing app, using any technology, allowing it's likely epidemiological effectiveness to be assessed. This paper defines such a formula and provides results for several simulated protocols as well as one real life protocol tested according to the standard methodology set out in this paper. The results presented show that protocols that use time windows greater than 30 seconds or that bucket their distance analogue (E.g. RSSI for Bluetooth) provide poor estimates of risk, showing an efficacy rating of less than 6%. The fair efficacy formula is shown in this paper to be able to be used to calculate the 'Efficacy of contact tracing' variable value as used in two papers on using mobile applications for contact tracing [6] . The output from the formulae in this paper, therefore, can be used to directly assess the impact of technology on the spread of a disease outbreak. This formula can be used by nations developing contact tracing applications to assess the efficacy of their applications. This will allow them to reassure their populations and increase the uptake of contact tracing mobile apps, hopefully having an effect on slowing the spread of COVID-19 and future epidemics.",

This paper defines the probability of detection of the risk that occurs within a contact event, and how closely it maps to the actual risk incurred by an individual. A Contact Event is the time and distance of two people within close proximity, at least to a distance of likely exposure to infection. As two people approach each other, meet, and then part their risk exposure will vary according to time spent at each distance from each other. Contact tracing applications, and the proximity detection protocols within them, aim to accurately measure this exposure risk. When one party to the contact event falls ill they can share their contact events such that those placed at high risk of infection are notified and can self isolate, limiting the spread of a disease in a population.",

            "text": "There are many areas a protocol can fail to accurately measure risk. Firstly if a particular contact event is not recorded at all by not supporting a particular phone, or scanning for nearby contacts too infrequently. Closely following a contact event by regularly estimating distance, which we call continuity, is where risk can be over or under estimated. Not regularly measuring duration with distance around the riskiest (closest) part of a contact event -having poor completeness of a risk profile -can also lead to poor recording of exposure risk. Similarly not recording the distance accurately enough can lead to errors in risk calculation. An app must also have the longevity to work throughout a normal working day in order to provide the most useful service. Finally, the population reach of a protocol -how many people can use it given their mobile phone's capabilities -will limit the control effect of any protocol. These are the constituent measures we define in this paper that make up our fair efficacy formula. These issues are shown in Figure 1 , below. This paper uses an example contact event with synthetic data to illustrate concepts such as time windows, distance estimations, and different ways a protocol may measure time, and duration. Some protocols may, for example, only give the time of a contact event to an approximate time window. Others may bucket their distance analogue (E.g. For radio based protocols like Bluetooth this would be the Received Signal Strength Indicator -RSSI) in to bands. Bracketing exposure time or bucketing distance analogue introduces limitations for such protocols' accuracy at measuring a contact event. This will result in either over or under estimating an individual's exposure and chance of infection. This results in lower epidemiological efficacy, limiting protocols' ability to slow the spread of a disease. We highlight these limitations in this paper, and provide a fair efficacy formula for measuring a protocol's effectiveness.",

            "text": "The original work on mathematically modeling of the control effect of an instant contact tracing application was published by Ferretti et al in the journal Science. [6] They discuss the standard 3 days to find and isolate a contact with manual contact tracing and show that such a delay results in a health system's inability to control the spread of COVID-19 under any circumstances. The paper goes on to say \"Traditional manual contacttracing procedures are not fast enough for SARS-CoV-2. However, a delay between confirming a case and finding that person's contacts is not inevitable. Specifically, this delay can be avoided by using a mobile phone app.\" This analysis goes on to plot success in isolating patients against the ability to effectively trace their contacts instantly using a mobile application as we describe in this paper. That analysis (Fig 3 in the paper) shows that a range of efficacy -from 90% effective instant contact tracing with 10% isolation of patients, to 60% effective instant contact tracing with 90% isolation of patients, will go beyond the margin of error for R0 measurement and have a controlling effect on the spread of COVID-19. A protocol will need 30% efficacy in order to be effective. Below 10% a protocol will not be effective It should be noted that the above paper talks about 'detection' in the context of 'accurate risk detection' rather than 'did two phones see each other'. These are very different concepts. Accurate risk detection has epidemiological usefulness, device detection alone does not. My paper will consider 'detection' to mean 'accurate risk detection'. As a result, the 'Efficacy' score in the Oxford paper is what we term 'Probability of risk detection' in this paper.",

Completeness -At and around the moment in the encounter of maximum risk, and thus minimum separation distance, how complete is the recorded dataset and how closely does it fit the actual distance 3. Accuracy -How accurate is the data produced that is later passed to a risk scoring algorithm.

Detection -Whether at any point during a contact event a device saw another device (one-way detection), or whether both saw each other (two-way detection). This is included separately to continuity as if a phone isn't detected its presence will not show up in continuity data, giving a false sense of success. 2. Population Reach -Given the prevalence of Mobile Phones in a particular country and those phones' capabilities, this is the maximal proportion of people that can use a protocol 3. Longevity -The ability of an application to continue to detect and range a set of contact events throughout a working day, or whether a protocol in practice degrades during a day This paper suggests measures and tests for all of the above efficacy indicators. This paper then combines these measures to come up with a way to empirically measure the contact tracing efficacy variable \u03b5 T as defined in the 2004 Fraser et al paper. [7] An often overlooked component of the data provided by the proximity detection protocols is their correction, bucketing, or other processing of the raw Bluetooth data before a description of a contact event is passed to a contact tracing application. This processing can be a mean averaging over time, or grouping distances from continuous measures in to distance bands, or buckets. These changes can result in artificially high or low risk exposure as recorded by some protocols. These issues are discussed under the Continuity heading as they are often related to detection time delay and time annealing -both functions of continuity.

This leads to inaccuracy of distance data around the 2m and above the 5m marks.

For a known distance and accurate distance estimation function, the variable should provide a value with a small (ideally zero) error from the expected analogue value at that known distance. This relates to both movement and static scenarios. This is the concept of fit and has been considered in the Continuity section earlier in this paper. By measuring Continuity across different tests, both static scenarios and those involving constant movement, continuity provides a useful indication of potential accuracy too. 2. If a set of readings are taken in order to produce the analogue value then they should be taken as close together as possible and not spread out across the detection window. This will minimise error due to movement. Thus a set of readings can either be singular, rapid or distributed within the detection window. Thus rapid estimations are likely to be more accurate across contact events involving large amounts of movement. (Restaurant, walking down the street, through a bar, shopping centre, and so on) 3. With devices at a known fixed distance, the variation of values provided across multiple detection windows should be low, ideally with zero variation. This shall be considered below. 4. The time between detections should be as small as possible, but at most the period needed to make an effective epidemiological assessment of risk exposure. As previously mentioned, this is taken as 30 seconds in this paper. This shall be discussed in the section on window time measurement, below.",

As an example, if an analogue value of 800 was recorded at, for example, 2 metres but a value of 1200 was recorded at 1 metre, it would be logical to expect the measurement at 1.5m to be 1000. If the particular protocol only bounds its analogue values in bands of 400 though, this would be recorded as 800 or 1200, incurring an error of 200, a significant amount. It is important, therefore, to conduct accuracy measurements at a set of epidemiologically relevant distances. Given the Oxford Risk Model has maximum risk at or below 1m, and the difference in risk from 1m to 1.1m reduces by 16%, we recommend distance accuracy be calculated for an overall set of distances of 0.8m, 1.0m, 1.2m, 1.5m, 2.0m, 2.5m, 3.0m. I.e. intervals from 0.8m to 3.0m as these are those most important to risk scoring. No weight shall be given to the accuracy score based on relative risk as this is the purpose of the risk estimation function and out of the scope of this paper.

Even applying no buckets using a window value of just two minutes resulted in a poor score of 25.02% and 5.56% respectively. We further applied the fair efficacy formula to a new protocol we developed called Herald. We found in real testing that Herald can achieve a probability of detection of 86.51%, giving a protocol efficacy score of 37.93%. It should be noted that this formal test included 10 phones with one of them having known performance problems. The theoretical maximum efficacy for any BLE based protocol in the UK is 46.57% given the prevalence of mobile phones in the UK.

The main one not discussed in this paper is the accuracy of the conversion mechanism from the distance analogue to a distance value. This paper's formula assumes that, for a given pairing at a given RSSI reading, the conversion is perfect. Whilst we do include reading error in this paper -which is probably a larger contributor to error than mathematical conversion to distance -we do not consider the accuracy of the algorithm to convert the read distance analogue to an actual distance and its effect, if any, on risk attribution accuracy and thus efficacy. For protocols depending upon an integer RSSI value this would be useful to consider in future. As mentioned in a previous section, a single formula for distance conversion should not be relied upon given how RSSI is scaled in different Bluetooth chipsets. See section 8.2 for details. This paper also does not consider physical location of phones on people's person. I.e. front pocket vs. trouser pocket vs. in hand vs. in a purse. To fixate on such imperfections would be to deny any assistance to contact tracing through technology because you cannot make it perfect. It is the authors assertion that a control effect will never be perfect, just as medications' efficacy can never be perfect, and thus it is not worth throwing the baby out with the bathwater or making a good protocol the enemy of the idealised perfect protocol described in this paper.",
