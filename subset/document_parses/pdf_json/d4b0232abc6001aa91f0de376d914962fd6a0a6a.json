Clinically significant mental health conditions in childhood have increased by 50%, while two thirds of school children have experienced social isolation and loneliness; also a 50% increase compared to pre-COVID-19 (Children's Society, 2020). In a recent survey with 2,438 children and young people (Young Minds, 2021) , nearly 70% said that the pandemic will have a long-term negative effect on their mental health. In addition to that, the number of children regularly playing in nature and wild places in the last 30 years in the United Kingdom fell by 90% (National Childhood Report, 2012) . The People and Nature Survey (Natural England, 2020) suggested that this decline was exacerbated by COVID-19 as six in ten children (60%) reported spending less time outdoors. However, children who reported spending more time outside and more time noticing nature/wildlife were more likely to report that \"being in nature makes me very happy\" (91 and 94%, respectively, compared to 79% of those who had spent less time). Furthermore, 46% of parents believed their children seem happier outside, and 42% believed that nature is more important than ever.",

For example, children were invited to create art with leaves, flowers, or stones. Other activities included practicing awareness of the sounds in nature, growing plants, and suggestions about how to care and protect the environment. Nature \"homework\" was also encouraged, such as taking care of own gardens, or growing own plants to maximize the frequency of contact with nature.

Gray and Birrell (2015) and Gray and Thomson (2016) carried out their intervention at the Bundanon Trust properties in Australia, and Arbuthnott and Sutter (2019) at the National Wildlife Area, which is situated in south-central Saskatchewan in North America. Two studies utilized the school playgrounds and school gardens or nature resorts (Murphy, 2018; . Tiplady and Menter (2021) delivered the sessions in a community garden with an established woodland and a dedicated Forest School area, while Sobko et al. (2020) delivered the sessions exclusively in public parks. Finally, Bruni et al. (2017) delivered their intervention in various locations; some sessions took place in nature, but some sessions were delivered indoors in aquariums and national history museums.",

In contrast, being outside exposes children in new sounds, such as waves or echoes, which may act both as a valuable resource for musical compositions as well as an emotional stimulus contributing to children's wellbeing. The authors also referred to work Vygotsky's (1971) arguing that music can transform our emotional state, and our existential state of being. Another significant concept in this study (Adams and Beauchamp, 2019) was that of spirituality, defined as \"an awareness that one is connected to something more, beyond the individual self, but which can be grounded in an existential reality\" (de Souza and Watson, 2018, p. 345) . Finally, the authors created links to Wilson's biophilia theory (Kellert and Wilson, 1995) , a hypothesis suggesting that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life, and actualizing this inner tendency leads to both physical and mental health benefits. Sobko et al. (2020) also drew from biophilia theory in their study.",

This was defined as the degree to which individuals perceive that they are part of the natural environment (Schultz, 2002) . Connectedness with nature involved three key aspects: emotional affiliation to nature, understanding the importance and interconnectedness of all aspects of nature, and seeking regular contact with the natural world (Nisbet et al., 2009 ).

            "text": "Nature connectedness was the most commonly reported outcome of interest in this systematic review. Being in nature appeared to lead to children and young people feeling gradually, and increasingly more connected to nature. In turn, feeling connected to nature led to sensing that nature was becoming an important part of their identity-what has been defined as pro-environmental identity (Stets and Biga, 2003 )-and came alongside higher awareness of environmental issues. This led to pro-environmental behaviors, behaviors in which children and young people were not only caring for the environment but were also taking protective actions, contributing therefore to environmental sustainability. Finally, this led to higher desire in having sustained contact with nature. Figure 2 aims to illustrate this process as understood through the synthesis of the included studies. However, it is worth mentioning that the process of change appeared to be highly complex, therefore the diagram illustrates only one possible direction of travel out of multiple possible directions. The findings of this review echo previous studies which have found that exposure to the natural world is a strong predictor of pro-environmental attitudes and ecological behaviors (Mayer and Frantz, 2004; Leary et al., 2008; Nisbet et al., 2009; Frantz and Mayer, 2014) . Interestingly, connectedness to nature has been found to be an even stronger predictor of pro-environmental behavior in children than environmental knowledge (Schultz, 2002; Schultz and Tabanico, 2007; Gosling and Williams, 2010; Otto and Pensini, 2017; Barrable and Booth, 2020) . Similarly, research suggests that the way that connectedness to nature can be achieved is not through learning in theory about the environment, but by being exposed to the beauty of nature, the emotions that arise while being in nature, and with sustained contact Rainisio et al., 2014; Lumber et al., 2017) . Hence, the concept of spirituality that was explored in the Adams and Beauchamp (2019) study may be especially important to better understand the process through which connectedness to nature can be achieved, and how it enhances pro-environmental attitudes (Martin et al., 2020) .",

During these moments, children expressed that they experienced a sense of entering a heightened reality that included bonding with nature and with each other, and it was described as entering a \"new\" or a \"magic world.\" Feelings of joy and peace were also generated during these moments. The authors created links with the Hay and Nye (2006) self-transcendence theory, according to which, it is only when we move beyond egocentricity that we can start to relate genuinely with nature and with each other. These immersive experiences resonated with theories of optimal experiences and \"flow\" (Csikszentmihalyi, 2002) , Buber's (1937) existential philosophy of dialogue, and Gelter's (2010) concept of \"genuine friluftsliv\" (translated as \"open air living\")-a commitment to celebrating time outdoors regardless of the weather. Most importantly, these findings echo previous literature arguing that it is possible for spiritual experiences to be achieved in childhood, because they don't require high cognitive abilities or sophisticated language capacity, but universal human awareness (Hay and Nye, 2006) . Arts can be the catalyst to inspire these spiritual experiences, thus reinforcing nature connectedness.",

Adams and Beauchamp (2019) reported that one of the first noticeable differences observed was a sensual experience of nature that was achieved through music-making; in this case, the freedom of space outdoors appeared to maximize opportunities for creativity and imagination, while also freeing up the institutional normative behaviors that are expected in the classroom (Waite, 2017) . The combination of arts and nature also allowed children and young people to explore the significance of the history of places and the \"stories of the land\" (Stewart, 2008, p. 82) . Through taking part in activities that involved emotional stimulation, self-reflection, and exploration of their identity, children and young people gradually started to perceive themselves as part of the environment, and vice versa, the environment as part of themselves (Bruni et al., 2017; Gray and Birrell, 2015; Gray and Thomson, 2016; Arbuthnott and Sutter, 2019) . Furthermore, the outdoor sessions raised awareness of environmental issues through the arts and encouraged the exploration of ideas about what can be done to prevent future environmental disasters from happening, thereby reducing eco-anxiety (Bruni et al., 2017; Gray and Birrell, 2015; Gray and Thomson, 2016; Sobko et al., 2020; Walshe, 2021) . Bruni et al. (2017) suggested that arts can engage even the children and young people who might otherwise remain disinterested about environmental issues and/or disengaged with educational programs. Finally, through the arts, children and young people can be involved in creative forms of activism, bringing positive environmental change and environmental sustainability (Inwood et al., 2017) . This would encourage more people to spend time outdoors and start their own cycle of nature connectedness.",

These findings align with one of the key theories to human-nature relationship, Ulrich's psycho-evolutionary theory (Ulrich, 1993 ). Ulrich's theory posits humans' innate affiliation with natural environments (Richardson et al., 2018) , drawing upon the assumption that natural environments induce positive emotions and feelings. This human-nature connectedness can help children and young people to view themselves as part of a wider ecology which has a positive impact on aspects of wellbeing, such as vitality, creativity, and happiness (Capaldi et al., 2014) . Furthermore, connections were made with the PERMA theory of positive psychology (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) which argues that the positive states and traits that children cultivate while in nature (e.g., gratitude, joy, inspiration) contribute significantly to their sense of wellbeing. Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000) have highlighted that the more we enable children and young people to cultivate this state of mind, they happier they can be in the long-term.",

Sen's human capabilities have been defined as a \"a person's ability to do valuable acts or reach valuable states of being\" (Sen, 1993, p. 30) . The list of capabilities (Nussbaum, 2000; Biggeri, 2007 ) include a range of human \"functionings\" that go beyond the notion of subjective and economic wellbeing (Nussbaum, 2011) , aiming to provide opportunities for achieving a state of physical, emotional, intellectual, and existential wellbeing in life (Delors et al., 1996) . Among the 101 children who participated in this study, the capabilities that appeared to have been developed the most were the senses and imagination, autonomy, safety, and emotional expression. Based on these, a list of \"eco-capabilities\" to define children's wellbeing is currently being developed (Walshe, 2021) .",

This led to high heterogeneity in the results, thus a metaanalysis was not feasible. The two most reported outcomes were connectedness to nature and sense of wellbeing. The Nature Relatedness Scale (NRS; Nisbet et al., 2009 ) was the most commonly used outcome measure, although Gray and Birrell (2015) suggested that it did not explore significant concrete questions about how students felt about nature, and therefore other questionnaires should be considered. There was no outcome measure in common with regards to wellbeing. Future studies should consider the implementation of the most valid, reliable, and widely used outcome measures to allow more accurate comparisons with other studies, replication, as well as future meta-analyses. The Salazar et al. (2020) guide to assessing connection to nature is also highly recommended for decisions regarding outcome measures in future research. Artsbased outcome measures as embedded assessment tools may also be beneficial in capturing changes, particularly for children and young people who might find difficult to verbalize their perspectives (Flowers et al., 2015; Staples et al., 2019) .",

In this review, there was no evidence regarding the sustained effects of the included interventions. Although it may be challenging to follow-up children and young people who move to different grades or schools, this would help to understand whether long-lasting changes occurred, or whether the reported effects were due to participants' temporary confidence that their life could be different following the interventions (Younge et al., 2015) . As such, more evidence on the number, duration, and frequency of sessions that could lead to substantial and sustained benefits, could increase the public recognition of such interventions from policymakers and their inclusion in national and international guidelines, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.",

However, they emphasized that distractive noise presents threats such as, disruption of attention and behavior, masking of important signals, and spurious physiological stimulation (Hatch and Fristrup, 2009) . They found that the sonic environment had the greatest impact on children's creative and spiritual experiences. Other distractions commonly reported in literature is the lack of cleanliness and amenities, which negatively influence the use of green spaces, even when these are available (Akpinar, 2016; Wood et al., 2018) .

However, given the high financial cost of the interventions, which is often unaffordable for schools, it would be valuable to investigate whether similar benefits could be observed if the sessions were delivered by teachers. Adams and Beauchamp (2018) highlighted that, if the sessions were to be delivered by teachers, less didactic pedagogies would need to be adopted to give students more opportunities for agency, creativity, and to develop higher self-confidence. It is worth noting that Murphy (2018) observed that teachers often lacked confidence in delivering arts-based sessions, outdoor sessions, or both. Yet this lack of confidence could be due to the time constraints that prevent teachers from investing time and effort in the design and implementation of such sessions (Davies et al., 2014) . Therefore, future research should focus on what support teachers need from artists and from their schools to achieve the desired effects. Future policies should also recognize the importance of having dedicated time for outdoor arts-making, embedded within the curriculum, to avoid overwhelming the teaching staff.",

Arts in nature and outdoor spaces provided an inclusive medium to engage all children and young people, especially those who might otherwise remain disinterested about environmental issues and disengaged with educational programs. These findings echoed similar studies suggesting that connectedness to nature cannot be achieved merely through learning in theory about the environment, but by being exposed to the beauty of nature, the emotions that arise while being in nature, and with sustained contact Rainisio et al., 2014; Lumber et al., 2017) . Furthermore, the sessions provided creative stimuli to increase nature connectivity, understand environmental issues, and explore ways to prevent environmental disasters. This led to higher environmental awareness and pro-environmental behaviors, as well as a potential decrease in eco-anxiety.
