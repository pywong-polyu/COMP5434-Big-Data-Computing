Core endpoints (mortality, clinical status, and hospitalization length) were planned to be assessed in 5.2 to 13.1% of the trials. Five months later, 66 trials (11.4%) were reported as \"Completed\", and only 46 (7.9%) had public results available. One hundred forty-four of 580 trials (24.8%) either had the status \"Not yet recruiting\" or \"Suspended\", and 18 (3.1%) trials were prematurely stopped (\"Terminated\" or \"Withdrawn\") The number of completed trials and trials with results are much lower than anticipated, considering the planned follow-up.",

A few large trials, notably, the RECOVERY trial and the WHO Solidarity trial, are underway and use an adaptive design. Currently, preliminary results are available confirming the usefulness of this type of trial design in providing informative evidence, namely showing positive results for dexamethasone [17] and lack of benefit for hydroxychloroquine [18] and lopinavir/ritonavir [10] . Another example is the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial, (ACTT) [19] , sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) that led remdesivir to receive a conditional marketing authorisation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and an initial Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) followed by formal approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With these few exceptions, the research we found seems largely insufficient to provide clear answers for core outcomes in the shortest possible time. However, it is important to consider that although limitations were present from the onset, several protocols were later revised based on the evolution of the pandemic and increasing knowledge of the disease. The overall impact of protocol modifications is beyond the objectives of the present study. Nevertheless, based on the final results of several studies, most limitations present from the onset seem to have remained and affect the final publication.",

Also of concern is the fact that most treatment trials (58.3%) were not multicentric.

This is particularly clear in the critical care setting, where many positive single-centre trials have been contradicted by subsequent multicentre trials [22] .

While we recognize the importance of surrogate endpoints, which allow faster results to be obtained when compared with core clinical endpoints [24] , the lack of hard and more pragmatic endpoints such as death and length of hospitalisation are causes for concern. To eschew these more clinically relevant endpoints is a methodological mistake that is hard to understand. High-quality information, as straightforward and generalisable as possible, will be key to moving forward. For research to permit informed clinical decision-making, this will have to change, and trials must use uniform disease-related definitions. Of note, several core outcome sets have been defined since the trial protocols were first registered [25] . However, these were published after the first wave of the pandemic in the northern hemisphere, and therefore beyond the scope of time during which these might have been most useful. Nevertheless, many treatment trials are a priori already deemed not to detect statistically significant and clinically relevant results. The median target sample size of assessed COVID-19 pharmacotherapy trials is 100 participants. This is manifestly insufficient to detect anything but an extremely large treatment effect. For example, regarding trials with mortality as a primary endpoint, only three trials were powered to detect a difference of 50% or more between treatment groups (assuming a baseline risk of 2%). Even assuming a baseline risk of 10%, only 38 trials were adequately powered to detect a difference of 50% or more between treatment groups. In fact, half of the trials evaluating mortality have a sample size of 112 participants or fewer and are only able to identify a treatment effect on mortality over 90% (irrespectively of the baseline risk), which is unrealistic (supplementary material). Although the results of underpowered trials can be meta-analysed, thereby increasing the power to detect a treatment effect, this approach remains inefficient in terms of time and overall resources. The results of systematic reviews and meta-analysis can be threatened by underpowered trials due to publication bias and related types of small-study effects [26] . On the other hand, the planned trial duration is also relatively short (median of 184 days for overall treatment trials), given the uncertainty regarding the natural history of COVID-19.",

Second, there is a significant amount of missing or unsubmitted data for certain data fields, which limits the completeness of the analyses and thus the interpretability of the results presented. Third, given the rush to conduct more research, there may be trials underway that had not yet been registered, an important issue given the common nature of retrospective registration [7] . Fourthly, the quality of the available records was largely poor, with inconsistencies and errors throughout. We think that most of the issues have been resolved, though we cannot be certain that nothing was missed.",

The EMA has called for similar efforts [29] . We understand that there are political, ethical, administrative, contractual, regulatory, logistic, economic, and societal factors that may hinder research, though these difficulties should be overcome in times of global crisis. Persisting on the path of isolated investigations will likely only lead to futile trials and more death on a global scale. Given the large numbers of people with COVID-19, and the recent push for more real-world evidence, we consider that there is an urgent need for a global high-quality COVID-19 patient registry, which could be used to detect large beneficial effects [30] and provide relevant evidence for health care decision-making [31] .",

As those are exceptionally difficult contexts for clinical research, tools such as adaptive protocols that could feasibly be integrated into clinical practice, as well as global research networks and platforms, may be of great help to produce informative research. Due to the unpredictable features of new outbreaks, continued enrolment throughout different locations should be advocated, this would enable the inclusion of sufficient numbers of participants as well as the combination of research efforts [32] .",
