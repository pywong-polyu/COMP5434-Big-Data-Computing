Using qualitative research methods, including remote in-depth interviews, this article addresses the question: What is the educational impact of the Covid-19 rapid response on teachers, students, and families in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada? Six themes are discussed, including teacher and family responses to change, vulnerability, transitions, work/home life balance, holistic teaching practices and communication. The article ends with recommendations relating to the communication and implementation of health, care, and educational practices that better attend to vulnerable populations and address social emotional wellness.",

            "text": "On March 17, the British Columbia (BC) government suspended K-12 classroom instruction as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, providing home schooling opportunities to ensure the \"continuity of learning\" (Ministry of Education 2020). Later, that same government announced that schools would be reopening June 1, 2020. Class size and hours of operation were modified, based on \"scientific information\", as a trial run for September (Horgan 2020) . Attendance was not made mandatory and families could continue with online learning if they choose. Although some others had fewer Covid-19 cases, BC was the only Canadian province to open high schools at that time, and (other than Quebec) the only province to reopen elementary schools (Government of Canada 2020). In the wake of this announcement, public forums erupted with parents questioning whether it was safe to send students back at this time, expressing concern about the emotional wellbeing of children returning to classrooms where they could not hug friends or share toys, and wondering whether the \"new normal\" of school would be frightening for children who had been sheltered from the reality of the pandemic at home. Other parents expressed relief at having some respite from childcare duties, excitement that their children would be reunited with teachers and friends and have closure to the school year, and appreciation that those struggling to learn at home would have more support. Teachers questioned how they might keep children safe without frightening them and wondered how to support both online and face-to-face learning simultaneously. They also expressed concern for their own wellbeing, and that of their families.",

In all but two families, the parent(s) normally worked full-time outside the home. In terms of occupations, the parents working outside the home included post-secondary educators (teaching online at the time of the interviews), an animal rescue worker, a supervisor for a group home, as well as the two teachers. All the parents interviewed were women, as were seven of the teachers. Two families had immigrated to Canada, one coming from China and the other from England. Most families resided in areas that would be considered middle class. All the families had two or more school-aged children, and three families had at least one child with a designated learning disability, including ADHD and autism. The nine teachers who were interviewed were from the same district and taught in a variety of contexts, including elementary classrooms, a Montessori focus, Distributed Learning (K-9), middle school, and high school (French Immersion). Five of the teachers interviewed had 10 or more years of experience and were working full-time, while the other four were early in their career.",

For the families we interviewed, this learning included two or more children in different grades who had differing abilities to self-regulate and complete tasks independently. Parents of middle and high school students said they felt like their children were younger again given their increased involvement with them. Families purchased equipment and supplies to support their children's learning, and they created new workspaces within their homes. It soon became clear to families that everyone required their own device as online meetings often overlapped. Children's sleep patterns changed, they stayed up much later than usual, and weekdays and weekends blurred.",

As one teacher whose children were older noted, I was actually able to get a little more sleep. I didn't have the stress of driving every day and I think healthwise I was more healthy [than] in a long time just because I was able, \u2026 to create my schedule and get a little more rest... I found that this was kind of a blessing in disguise at this time in my life-being able to take things at my own pace. (Mia, K-9 distributed learning teacher) For some teachers, this was a time of tremendous professional growth, as they experimented with new technologies as well as new pedagogies, and attended free and easily accessible professional learning webinars. For others, the pandemic meant a chaotic upheaval of unrelenting work to support their communities, as well as their own children. This was particularly challenging for single mothers. One elementary school teacher who is a mother of two, a department head, and a technology leader in her school worked non-stop for the first two weeks after returning from spring break, so she could transition her teaching, reach out to her students, and support her staff. As she put it, Spring Break was fine, but then we were told \"we're teaching online\", \u2026 it was nonstop work for me. I was one of the technology teachers so I \u2026[was] constantly working all the time because I was trying to help and I did help a lot of the staff. I was one of the \"go tos\". There was three of us. So, I think that was exactly when it started going for the worse because we couldn't do our family things. We couldn't do what we were trying to do to make the best of the situation. There was no time. The girls were basically left alone to fight and just play on their ipads, have their screen time forever. And then exhaustion set in for those two weeks. It was very crazy. And then, it stayed like that for a few weeks. And then things started becoming better. And then another switch, now you are going back to work, to continue doing the remote, and now the in-class teaching. (Brenda, technology teacher and single parent of 2) Brenda felt that she survived only because she is a veteran teacher. Some parents also described similar experiences of unmanageable expectations. One essential worker and single mother of three, who works an eight-hour shift and has a two-hour commute, began her second shift at home after a ten-hour day:",

Some parents worried that what was being provided was not enough. Some families struggled to keep up with the assigned workload, and the lack of synchronous support was problematic. This created much stress, particularly for students with exceptionalities who lacked the kind of support that they normally received at school, and for parents who could not provide ongoing support and oversight throughout the workday. One family with two high school students, who were striving to send their children to university, had to adjust their expectations. As the students' mother noted, \"We're trying very hard to make it so that our kids even just pass\". She described how her daughter's teachers were only online for short periods of time to assign work, rather than to teach. She questioned, \"how am I supposed to teach my kids when\u2026I'm having a tough time understanding it, or I understand it but I'm doing it a different way than what the teacher expects?\" (Sara, single mother of 3).",

But she found herself \"falling back a bit on worksheets, because that's maybe what people are used to or feel like that's what school looks like\" (Roslyn, kindergarten and grade 1 teacher). During the interviews, a mother of three children mentioned that some learning assignments were too involved and required too much parental support, which was unsustainable during her demanding workday. She printed off her own worksheets that her children could complete independently, with less one-to-one support, when it was not possible to help her children do the assigned work.",

With elementary and middle school students, parents reported distractibility, difficulty getting their child or children to adhere to routines, and an increased involvement with video games. With high school students, parents were concerned about their children's withdrawal from social networks and again found that their children were connecting to their peers via video games (e.g., Minecraft, Fortnite, Destiny 2, Overwatch, CSGO, Call of Duty, or Rainbow 6 Siege), as a way to maintain social involvement while being remote.",

The parents of all the children we spoke to utilized strategies like creating timetables and assignment charts, and they took an active role in organizing their children's deadlines and activities (both educational and extracurricular). In some cases, parents were worried about their children's mental health and isolation and the strain/confrontation that they were experiencing in their relationship with their child, as they navigated their new roles as their children's teachers. For some, the dual roles of parenting and teaching were overwhelming, even for parents who were professional teachers, which created a great deal of stress and conflict within the household.

It ended up being a really long process to get kids back on track if they got that contact at all. Those kids were, you know, decided to completely disengage or may be engaging inconsistently where they would pick and choose. I think [remote learning] created some trust issues because you know we had a lot of kids cheating because we weren't able to supervise we try to do assessments and they would swap answers it was really tough to keep tabs on that so I think it gave kids that decided early that they weren't very interested in class to just totally disconnect without having much follow up or maybe not having follow up in the same way that they normally would.

For the first time in all of our lives, many of us were working from home as part of the provincial health strategy to create household isolation and mitigate viral transmission. Essential service workers, including teachers working outside the home, had to develop various safety measures when re-entering their homes at the end of the day. These changes, both working from home and creating a safe place in the home, made viral transmission and space part of our new ways of thinking and living alongside the coronavirus. Most of the parents we interviewed were trying to work from home while attending to the needs of their own school-aged children. This required creating a quiet workspace and navigating work responsibilities, while still caring for the holistic needs of their families. In some cases, this also involved financial worry: many partners were sorting through an uncertain future for their family business or a reduction in work hours. For teachers who had children, this was characterized as a juggling act, where the teacher was wearing many hats and responsible for both their own and other children's needs. One parent also longed for her pre-Covid life and was deeply saddened by the situations in local care homes, recalling her mother's situation. I think probably the most challenging thing is wearing many hats at once and not being able to devote 100% of your attention to one thing, so you know if you're working from home and trying to homeschool your own children.

I think it creates a lot more emotional stress on the kids for sure, with parents having to jug-gle this. You're not just their mom you're their teacher, so whereas you were just sometimes helping with homework, now it's much more. It's created a lot more chaos and this strained relationship between mothers and kids. (Brenda, technology teacher and single parent of 2) Homeschooling was the biggest change for me and the kids just adapting to it and scheduling 4 different kids on one computer and 1 laptop organizing meetings the very first 2 weeks. I'll be honest I was out of my mind, stressed beyond belief wanting to make sure that everybody was doing everything properly. (Elise, parent of 4 children in elementary to high school) I would have to sit with him through every class and every assignment just to make sure that he stayed on task and up to date and, if something would go wrong, he'd get very upset, so that added a stress level. (Elise, parent of 4 children in elementary to high school) Generally we're fine. We just do math, language arts, but sometimes I would like to give my opinion or say maybe you change sentences and they you know \"oh, mom, your grammar, your English is bad, you're never right, yeah, yeah, so stop telling me what I need to do\".

He struggles to catch up anyways. So if he didn't continue he would have been so far behind. In the early stages when it was getting too difficult\u2026I contacted the school, his case manager and told her that you know, just some issues. We're really starting to see some changes. Can you help? So she actually got his EA to check in on him every day. And they've worked on some projects together as well. But even then, it was very difficult. (Jule, parent of two children with designations) They're not taking into account [that] there are kids that need that access now. I mean my daughter has ADHD. Some other kids that have, I'm sure there's dyslexia and, other learning difficulties. They're not getting the help that they need. (Sara, single parent of 3, essential service worker)",

Stop this noise. Get out of the room. I don't want to be near you\". You know he can't tolerate any noise right now. We think it's because of the stress of the work. He's been a bit better in the last two days since I guess all this works handed in and there's nothing much he can do now about it.

And then I'm getting home and I'm doing homework and, you know, and I'm fighting with kids because I'm not doing it right. Yeah. Or I'm not understanding it so I'm getting frustrated and having the kids stuck at home, we're now getting on each other's nerves a whole lot more. (Sara, single parent of 3, essential service worker) I'm talking to other parents in the neighborhood everybody had a different set of stressors. Some whose employees were expecting them to be on call from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM like they normally would be in the office but with two children at home and home schooling them and depending on their age having two parents with headsets on a computer or 8 hours a day it's just an unrealistic expectation so we didn't have that stressor, but we had the stress of \"Oh my God What is this going to mean for the business that we've had for 13 years?\" and we've put our entire life into building this business and then having it unravel, that placed a lot of stress on us. I've moved my desk in the house about three times I think I finally found a spot where it's going to be the best kind of situation in terms of just finding a quiet space where I can actually shut the door so normally I'd have my laptop it wouldn't matter where my desk was because the kids would be gone all day.
