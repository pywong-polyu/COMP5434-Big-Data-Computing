Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 692 patients with FEV 1 \u226580% predicted; normal neutrophils and chest high-resolution computed tomography; and recurrent dyspnea, cough, wheeze, and chest tightness. Results: Compared with subjects negative for AHR (n=522), subjects positive for AHR (n=170) showed increased FENO values, peripheral eosinophils (EOS), and R5-R20; decreased FEV 1 , FEV 1 /Forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow (FEFs) (P\u2264.001 for all). Small-airway dysfunction was identified in 104 AHR + patients (61.17%), and 132 AHR \u2212 patients (25.29%) (P<0.001). The areas under the curve (AUCs) of variables used singly for an AHR diagnosis were lower than 0.77. Using joint models of FEF 50% , FEF 75% , or FEF 25%-75% with FENO increased the AUCs to 0.845, 0.824, and 0.844, respectively, significantly higher than univariate AUCs (P <0.001 for all). Patients who reported chest tightness (n=75) had lower FEFs than patients who did not (P<0.001 for all). In subjects with chest tightness, the combination of FEF 50% or FEF 25%-75% with EOS also increased the AUCs substantially, to 0.815 and 0.816, respectively (P <0.001 for all versus the univariate AUCs). Conclusion: FENO combined with FEF 50% and FEF 25%-75% predict AHR in patients with normal FEV 1 . FEF 25%-75% , FEF 50% , or FEF 25%-75% together with EOS also can potentially suggest asthma in patients with chest tightness.",

However, many hospitals do not perform provocation tests because they are expensive, time-consuming, and entail a risk of severe bronchospasm. 2 What's more, pulmonary function testing should be performed in patients with chronic airway disease during COVID-19 pandemic only if it is needed to guide management and limited to the necessary tests, which usually do not include BPT. Therefore, additional ways are needed to predict AHR safely and to detect patients with mild asthma as early as possible in order to relieve their symptoms and prevent the development of chronic inflammation and airway remodeling.",

Lower forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF 25%-75% ) and Forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (FEF 50% ) are widely used for assessing small-airway function. [4] [5] [6] Impulse oscillometry (IOS) may also reliably reflect small-airway function and predict clinical asthma outcomes and AHR. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] FEV in 3 seconds (FEV 3 )/FVC is influenced by the airflow velocity in both the central and peripheral airway, normally 95% or greater in adults. [12] [13] [14] In our previous study of patients with chronic cough, patients with AHR had higher fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), a higher percentage of eosinophils in blood (EOS%), and FEF 25%-75% than patients without AHR. 4 The combination of FEF 25%-75% and FENO increased the area under the curve (AUC) for AHR diagnosis substantially compared with FENO alone. In that study, FEF 25%-75% < 78.5% and FENO > 43 ppb strongly predicted positive AHR in Chinese patients with chronic cough.",

However, early diagnosis is difficult because patients need to satisfy the 2 criteria of variable symptoms and airflow limitation. This is especially true for mild asthma, which is often undiagnosed because FEV 1 is normal and the bronchodilation test has a high false-negative rate. Our data indicating that small-airway dysfunction is present in asthmatic patients with FEV 1 \u2265 80% predicted may help to support an early diagnosis in patients with mild asthma. Measurements of small-airway function, including FEF 50% and FEF 25%-75% , combined with measures of airway inflammation (FENO or EOS) supported the best prediction of positive AHR diagnosis in subjects who had both typical asthma-like symptoms and FEV 1 \u2265 80% predicted.",

Previous studies in guinea pigs have shown that NO may itself contribute to AHR, by increasing plasma exudation via its vasodilator effect and by its transformation into peroxynitrite, which induces AHR. 24 Furthermore, in our study, a weak correlation between FENO and PD 20 in patients with positive AHR was observed (r = \u22120.266, P = 0.0005), suggesting that FENO is valuable in predicting AHR, which was also noted by Jatakanon et al. 25 Currently, FENO is particularly helpful in ruling out asthma. Its cut-off value for predicting asthma ranged from 10.5 to 64 ppb in different studies. 26 FENO < 30 ppb has a high specificity (87%) and NPV (93%) for excluding asthma from untreated nonsmoking adults with chronic cough. 27 Schleich et al showed that FENO > 34 ppb had a low predictive value (AUC = 0.62) for predicting AHR in patients with suspected asthma. 28 Schneider et al illustrated that, in their sample as a whole, asthma could be ruled in at FENO > 71 ppb (PPV, 80%) and ruled out at FENO \u2264 9 ppb (NPV, 82%), with an AUC of 0.656. 29 Importantly, when patients with neutrophilic inflammation were omitted, the AUC was 0.745 and asthma could be ruled in at FENO > 31 ppb (PPV, 82%) and ruled out at FENO \u2264 12 ppb (NPV, 81%). 29 Our present study showed that FENO > 41 ppb has a sensitivity of 65.29%, In our current study, patients positive for AHR, but with FEV 1 in the normal range, had abnormal values of small-airway function variables, obtained with spirometry and IOS. Two-thirds of asthmatic patients with FEV 1 \u2265 80% predicted had small-airway dysfunction, and patients with small-airway dysfunction exhibit a greater likelihood of AHR. FEF 50% , FEF 75% , and FEF 25%-75% were weakly correlated with PD 20 . This might indicate that small-airway dysfunction could be a forerunner of decreased FEV 1 and could be used to detect early disease.",

Those two FEFs were strongly correlated and had equivalent value in predicting AHR. However, because both produced AUC < 0.80, using them singly would be insufficient for predicting AHR in patients with suspected asthma. Thus, we combined the FEFs with FENO or EOS to enhance their predictive value for AHR diagnosis. The AUCs of FEFs combined with FENO were significantly higher than those of the univariate AUCs. This suggests that FEFs combined with FENO (2 noninvasive and convenient measurements) can improve the prediction of AHR diagnosis. The cut-off values had certain difference among different studies possibly because we included patients with mild asthma-like symptoms and normal FEV 1 , who had higher FEFs levels than those with more severe symptoms. 5, [30] [31] [32] One main limitation of FEF is that it depends on FVC and lung capacity. 33, 34 In contrast to FEV 1 , FEF 25%-75% is not normalized to FVC when assessing air-flow obstruction. Therefore, FEF 25%-75% could be artificially low in individuals with restrictive lung or chest bellows disease (eg, obesity) and could therefore overdiagnose asthma. In our study, mean BMI and FVC were in the normal range (23.37 \u00b1 3.477 kg/m 2 and 101.5% \u00b1 12%, respectively), and neither variable differed between groups. 34, 35 Most importantly, all patients in the study had undergone HRCT, therefore guaranteeing that restrictive lung diseases or obesity were excluded and minimizing the possibility of overdiagnosis of asthma in our patients. Furthermore, IOS is a noninvasive and effort-independent alternate test that is done during normal quiet tidal breathing, avoiding the need for any special breathing manoeuvre or any noticeable interference with respiration, and is considered to be more physiological than spirometry 36, 37 We evaluated the ability of IOS measurement to assess small-airway function and to predict AHR. In our study, R5-R20 alone exhibited poor predictive value for AHR diagnosis, and the AUC was still lower than 0.80 when we combined R5-R20 and FENO. This finding suggests that when combined with FENO, FEFs provide better value than R5-R20 for predicting AHR even though they are less physiologically relevant.",

[38] [39] [40] In asthmatic patients with normal FEV 1 in our study, the most frequent chief complaints were cough and chest tightness rather than wheeze or dyspnea. Relevant clinical subtypes of asthma, \"chest tightness variant asthma\" 41 and \"chest pain variant asthma\" 38, 42 have been described in the medical literature. Asthmatic patients who only complain of chest tightness are easily misdiagnosed in clinical practice. We found that decreases of FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC, FEF 25% , FEF 50% , FEF 75% , and FEF 25%-75% were more serious in subjects with than without chest tightness, indicating that small-airway dysfunction may be involved in the mechanism of chest tightness. The joint model of small-airway function variables (FEF 50% , FEF 75% , or FEF 25%-75% ) and FENO gave particularly high predictive values for AHR in subjects with chest tightness (all of the AUCs \u2265 0.880). In addition, the joint model of EOS with small-airway function variables (FEF 50% , FEF 75% , or FEF 25%-75% ) was highly predictive of AHR in subjects with chest tightness (all of the AUCs \u2265 0.815), which it was not for the population as a whole. Since the cost of peripheral blood cell count is much cheaper than FENO, these tests may provide very economic alternatives for predicting AHR in suspected asthmatics, especially in primary hospitals. The diagnosis of asthma should be strongly considered in patients with lower FEFs, high FENO or high EOS, and the symptom of chest tightness.",

The repeatability of our data calculation was shown by an 80/20 split-sample cross-validation. The AUCs in the validation sample were close to those in the whole model.

Patients with small-airway dysfunction exhibit an increased likelihood of having AHR. In order to improve the diagnosis rate of mild asthma and relieve patients' symptoms as early as possible, we combined 2 simple and noninvasive methods-small-airway function tests and FENO to improve the diagnosis rate of mild asthma. The likelihood of AHR strongly increased with FEF 25%-75% <84.4%, FEF 50% <76.8%, and FENO >41 ppb.
