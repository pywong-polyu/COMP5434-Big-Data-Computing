Understanding dynamic human mobility changes and spatial interaction patterns are crucial for understanding and forecasting COVID-19 dynamics. We introduce a novel graph-based neural network(GNN) to incorporate global aggregated mobility flows for a better understanding of the impact of human mobility on COVID-19 dynamics as well as better forecasting of disease dynamics. We propose a recurrent message passing graph neural network that embeds spatio-temporal disease dynamics and human mobility dynamics for daily state-level new confirmed cases forecasting. This work represents one of the early papers on the use of GNNs to forecast COVID-19 incidence dynamics and our methods are competitive to existing methods. We show that the spatial and temporal dynamic mobility graph leveraged by the graph neural network enables better long-term forecasting performance compared to baselines.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every country in the world and has resulted in an unprecedented response by governments across the world to control its spread. The social distancing measures are one of the most effective nonpharmaceutical interventions at this stage. The social distancing measures have led to significant change in human mobility behaviour while the mobility change has also affected the disease dynamics inevitably. To better understand COVID-19 dynamics and help to control the disease spread, it is crucial and challenging to provide accurate and timely spatio-temporal forecasting of epidemic dynamics. As machine learning and artificial intelligence(AI) has been successful in many domains, there is an urge to investigate how we can leverage AI-based technologies for infectious disease understanding, modeling, forecasting, and controlling. In this work, we focus on applying AI-based techniques to solve * Equal contribution the above challenge by incorporating a new large-scale aggregated spatio-temporal mobility data into graph-based neural networks. Using aggregate mobility data to understand COVID-19 dynamics has received wide interests recently. There have been a number of recent studies along these lines, for example, in China using Baidu data [Chinazzi et al., 2020] , in the US using mobility data [Kraemer et al., 2020; Adiga et al., 2020b] , and at a global scale using airline traffic [Adiga et al., 2020a] . On the other side, lots of COVID-19 forecasting methods are proposed since the initial outbreak early this year, such as mechanistic methods Anastassopoulou et al., 2020; Kai et al., 2020] , and time series methods using statistical regression models [Ribeiro et al., 2020] or deep learning model [Ramchandani et al., 2020] . However few of the existing works investigate spatio-temporal forecasting using graph neural network (GNN) with integrated real-time mobility data. In our work, we introduce a novel method to incorporate global population mobility flows into graph-based spatial-temporal neural networks for COVID-19 dynamic forecasting.

This resembles the core insight behind graph neural network models, i.e. the transformation of the input node's signal can be coupled with the propagation of information from a node's neighbors in order to better inform the future hidden state of the original input. This is most evident in the unified message-passing framework proposed by [Gilmer et al., 2017 ]. In our model, we design an Recurrent Message Passing (RMP) module to recurrently pass the hidden representations from a node's neighbors to the current node. As shown in Figure 1 , the RMP module has two phases: the message passing (MP) phase and the update phase (UP). It runs for L rounds, so any node in the graph is taking into account of neighbors that are L hops away. To be more specific, at time t, given a node v i at a certain round (l + 1): In the MP phase, for each node pair",

We observe that mobility flow and new confirmed cases show very high negative correlation (median -0.97) for almost all states during March when most of states mandated school closure and stay-at-home orders. This indicates that COIVD-19 dynamics and human mobility are highly correlated. Starting from the mid April when the states started to reopen to some degree, there is a large variation in correlation values, which indicates that COVID-19 dynamics varies a lot due to that it is affected by multiple complicated factors like local population size, individual behaviours (e.g. wearing a mask or not in public location), and government reopening guidelines.",

Table 1 presents the RMSE, and PCORR performance averaging across 53 states and 28 days. In general, we observe that GNN-dmob has better RMSE performance than the comparisons for long-term forecasting. The best performances on PCORR are evenly distributed among the proposed models. The results indicate that our proposed methods can capture the disease dynamic in both short-term and long-term. Naive baseline outperforms the other baselines for 7, 14, 21, 28 days ahead forecasting. This is not surprising because the testing data is from August during when the time series of all states are showing downward trends with small changing rates. The Naive assumes certain level of regularity in the time series leading to good forecasting performance on the testing data. DNN-based models perform better than AR-based models especially on long-term forecasting which indicates that DNN-based models have better generalization capability for forecasting unseen data. In our experiments, attention-based models cola-GNN and GNNatt are not outstanding for both short and long-term forecasting. A possible reason is that the learned attention coefficients are outdated due to the fast evolution in COVID-19 dynamics between training time period and testing time period (see Figure 3 ), which leads to false attention by regions while predicting. The proposed method GNN-dmob explicitly projects the most recent mobility patterns to the future potentially leading to better performance.",
