In CVID, the vaccine induced poor Spike-specific antibodies, and atypical B-cells with low affinity for Trimeric Spike, possibly by extra-follicular reactions or incomplete germinal center reactions. In HD, among Spike positive memory B-cells, we identified receptor-binding-domain-specific cells that were undetectable in CVID, indicating the incapability to generate this new specificity. Specific T-cell responses toward Spike-protein were evident in HD and defective in CVID. Due to the absence of B-cells, patients with XLA responded to immunization by specific T-cell responses only.",

The study was carried out in 47 patients with PAD who agree to undergo SARS-CoV-2 immunization. We included also 28 immunized age-matched health care workers of the Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children Hospital as healthy controls (HD). Eligible patients were informed on the study, including its safety profile and supply procedures, and signed the informed consents for vaccination and for the immunological study. The BNT162b2 vaccine was administered as prescribed, in two doses, 21 days apart. Two blood samples were obtained from each participant for serological and cellular immunity assessment at time 0 (T0), before the first dose, and seven days after the second dose (T1). During the study, patients were allowed to continue their therapies, and were monitored for their clinical status. The study was approved the Ethical Committee of the Sapienza University of Rome (Prot. 0521/2020, July 13, 2020). The study was performed in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, and the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki. Methods for identify anti-Spike and anti-Receptor univariate analysis assessed the impact of variable of interest. Values were compared by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and, if not significant, the Wilcoxon matched pair signed-rank test or the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test were used.

This was observed only in about one third of CVID patients, where the frequency of low affinity ATMs at least doubled seven days after the second dose of vaccine. ATMs originally observed in tonsils and later in peripheral blood, are observed in conditions of chronic antigen stimulation [23] and may be produced by extra-follicular reactions or failed and incomplete germinal center reactions [24,25]. As expected, high affinity PBs for Trimeric Spike were produced in HD at T1, but not in CVID, with the exception of three patients who also produced specific IgG and IgA. Most CVID patients were able to generate low affinity Trimeric Spike PBs (p=0.001) that are possibly short-lived PBs derived from the non-canonical pathway of ATMs. Among total Spike positive MBCs (S+ plus S++), we also identified RBDspecific cells. RBD+ cells represent a minority of the MBCs generated by vaccination and significantly increased at T1 in HD (p<0.0001) ( Table 1 and Figure S1 ). These cells, with high specificity against the virus RBD and thus producing most of the neutralizing antibodies, are undetectable in CVID patients indicating the incapability of CVID B-cells to undergo somatic mutation in the germinal center and thus generate this new specificity.",

As for all immunizations, the efficacy has been linked to the production of specific antibodies, which increase in response to all vaccines in use [27, 28] . The majority of patients with PAD show clinical and immunological characteristics implicating a functional impairment of B cell compartment, and a dysregulation of T-cell responses causing hypo-gammaglobulinemia or a-gammaglobulinemia and susceptibility to a wide range of microbial infections [29] . Despite severe impaired antibody responses, when infected with SARS-CoV-2, one fourth of adult PAD patients remained asymptomatic and half of them showed a mild disease [7] . It should be considered that a protective effect against severe COVID-19 could be due to the immunemodulatory effects on innate immunity exerted by immunoglobulin therapy also when administered at replacement dosages [30] . However, the discrepancy between this clinical evidence and the lack of antibodies underlines the limitations of this correlate of protection against the severe forms of COVID-19 and requires in depth studies on SARS-CoV-2 specific B-and T-cells function in PAD. However, data on immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in patients with inborn errors of immunity are few and limited to anecdotal cases or heterogeneous cohort [31] . Although the natural course of COVID-19 is primarily characterized by the function of the innate immune system, with a secondary involvement of T-and B-cells, vaccines are designed to force the adaptive immune system to generate neutralizing antibodies and memory B-and T-cells that effectively protect from COVID-19.",

Here we showed that while HD produced specific antibodies and generate high affinity MBCs and activated MBCs that significantly increased after immunization, these responses are lacking in all XLA and severely impaired in CVID patients after SARS-CoV-2 immunization, suggesting an incomplete protection. However, in five out of seven CVID patients who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, IgG were detectable at the time of vaccination administered at least three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection recovery, suggesting that if IgG were produced, they might persist after the primary infection. Moreover, in these previously infected CVID patients, IgG response was boosted by the subsequent immunization.",

In line with this hypothesis, RBD+ B-cells were undetectable in CVID patients, whereas they represent 20% of the highly specific anti-Trimeric Spike response in HD (unpublished data) able to develop and successfully terminate the germinal center reaction [34] . Thus, CVID patients were able to respond to immunization by two doses of BNT162b2 with non-canonical lineage B-cells induced by a primary exposure to a novel antigen. It has been suggested that atypical B cells are short-lived activated cells, in the process of differentiating into plasmacells [23, 35] . In addition, interesting information was gained by the parallel study of the T-cell responses, showing a robust generation of Spike-specific T-cells in all but one patient with XLA, and in HD. Specific-T-cell responses were induced in a minority of CVID patients with a variable frequency. Based on data on response to influenza virus immunization [11] , we expected a more efficient generation of specific T-cells. However, this was not the case. While after influenza virus immunization T-cells are generated after multiple exposures to viral antigen following infection and immunization, SARS-CoV-2 is a pathogen never encountered before. Then, it is possible that the first antigenic stimulation was not sufficient to induce an early T-cell response.",

However, the vast majority of PAD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 did not show signs of hyper-activation of the innate immunity [3] [4] [5] , an effect possibly due to the immunomodulatory effects on innate immune cells due to the regular use of polyvalent immunoglobulins [30] , and a poor adaptive immunity. This pattern of immune responses resembles what we have already shown in asymptomatic immunocompetent subjects [36] , and further demonstrated that a balanced cytokine production resulting from a functional but not hyper-reactive innate immunity and a poor adaptive immunity are the conditions associated with an early benign COVID-19 course. Virus-neutralizing antibodies are only one of the correlates of protection for COVID-19, as we and others [4] [5] [6] [7] demonstrated in patients with PAD, which, while unable to produce any antibodies, might remain asymptomatic after contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Since antibody titers are not a surrogate indicator of the magnitude of memory cells [38] our strategy is to follow up our cohort by serological and cellular investigations. The only epidemiological observation we have for now is that one CVID patient experienced an infection by SARS-CoV-2 three months after completing the two-doses vaccination. He remained asymptomatic possibly due to the prompt administration of monoclonal antibodies [39]. For now, our patients might benefit from these new treatments, and possibly from the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the coming lots of gammaglobulins [40], regularly used to substitute the missing or partial response to infections and vaccination.
