In fact, unavoidable close contact, and sharing often overcrowded and poorly ventilated confined spaces, can easily favor virus infection both by droplets and airborne transmission (2). Moreover, many inmates may be highly vulnerable to severe COVID-19, due to the generally poor health profiles and more limited access to health care services (3) . The management of the COVID-19 in prisons and jails, therefore, needs also to be considered according to the debated implications that the pandemic situation may have in these settings, such as the possible incompatibility with the prison regime of the vulnerable inmates leading to their accelerated release, the access to the care for detained COVID-19 patients, the legal obligation of protecting inmates from COVID-19 outbreaks inside the facilities.",

The application of a stochastic dynamic COVID-19 transmission model to a large US jail allowed to estimate that asymptomatic testing, together to depopulation and single celling, was an effective measure to reduce \u223c83% of the expected cases in inmates and correctional workers (13) . In this sense, antigen-testing screening seems to be more appropriate to the specificity of correctional and detention facilities than molecular testing, because it is less expensive, provides results more rapidly (30-60 min), does not require specialized personnel to perform it and finally, allows a large number of subjects to be tested in a short period (14) .",

            "text": "Our findings seem to be in contrast with the dramatic situation reported in prisons and jails worldwide. At least 3,300 inmates and 5,100 correctional workers were reported to be infected by COVID-19 across Europe, but the real numbers of infections could be much higher, as not all the administrations provided data (18) . Moreover, according to the US COVID Prison project, in August 2020, 90 of the largest 100 US cluster outbreaks occurred in prisons, COVID-19 case rates being substantially higher and escalating much more rapidly in prison than in the US population (19) . Mass testing by rRT-PCR in selected US penitentiaries revealed wide COVID-19 outbreaks, with infection rates exceeding also 80% (20) . Correctional facilities have proved to be areas of heavy SARS-CoV-2 spread also in Latin America, where the high number of positive cases observed should be considered underestimated, given the general lack of testing capacity which makes it impossible to know the true extent of the epidemic in this context. Recent evidence supports a faster viral spread of COVID-19 in Brazilian prisons than in the general population, suggesting the important role of transmission from pre-symptomatic cases inside the prison complex (21). Some scientific reports, however, seem to agree our results, showing that the introduction of specific strategies to minimize COVID-19 transmission can achieve a low number of cases in correctional and detention facilities, even in geographic areas characterized by a wide spread of the epidemic in the general population (2, 22, 23). Our findings, therefore, seems to implicate that COVID-19 management within correctional and detention facilities is possible, leaving the incompatibility with the prison regime only to a few specific cases of inmates. One of the main strength of our study is that it included all the correctional workers, considering that COVID-19 in correctional facilities should be considered as a unique occupational and public health concern (24). In fact, the highest number of positive cases, even if extremely limited, was found among CO (1.9%) and HCW (2.6%). The main challenge in terms of COVID-19 prevention strategies in correctional facilities, therefore, seems to be protecting the correctional workers, that should be the main potential carriers of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the facilities (25, 26) . A possible critical point in the prevention measures is the activity of escorting inmates, considering that 3 of the positive CO performed this task, that cannot always be accomplished in full conformity with physical distancing (11) . Regarding the HCW, activities performed in other health care settings than the correctional facility could be possible sources of contagion. The impact of this situation should be evaluated in the organization of prison health care services during the pandemic (27) .",

The use of antigen tests, instead, allows quick evidence of infection (15-30 min) , at lower cost and without the need for skilled personnel, even if it does not have the same sensitivity as rRT-PCR test, and can give false negative results (28, 29) . This happens particularly if the antigen test is used outside the indications for which it is approved, namely the diagnosis of confirmed cases from 2 days before, up to 5-7 days after the onset of symptoms. The antigen test used in this study reported a high sensitivity (87.5%), whereas a previous survey showed sensitivity of 41.2% among asymptomatic subjects tested by FIA (30) . The main limitation of the study, therefore, is related to the possibility that not all the asymptomatic cases may have been identified by the antigen testing campaigns. However, the results of the antigen test should be interpreted according to the epidemiological situation of the study population, because in a high-prevalence setting they have a high positive predictive value (14) . Therefore, since at the time of the investigation the Apulia region was burdened by a high incidence, and since by definition the prison is a congregate setting with a presumed high incidence in the case of outbreaks, the antigen test in this context still resulted an adequate tool for the detection of COVID-19 cases.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, our study showed the first experience of a serial mass campaign by antigen tests performed both in inmates and correctional workers. Marco et al. has previously described an antigen screening test applied only to the inmates of a Spanish correctional facility, after the diagnosis of three symptomatic COVID-19 cases within a section. Antigen tests were able to find only 9 new positive cases on 81 asymptomatic inmates, while rRT-PCR performed 3 days later was able to identify 27 further asymptomatic confirmed cases (34) . Apart from false-negative antigen tests, the different time of the two tests may also explain these results.",

In fact, our findings highlight the utility of serial cohort-based approaches to COVID-19 screening in the congregate settings, also for antigen test. Early identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infection may reduce the likelihood of transmission, identifying asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic subjects that would be missed by symptoms screening alone, also supporting the medico-legal evidence that measures have been taken to avoid the onset of an outbreak in the facility (28) .",

Moreover, each of the two testing campaigns lasted about 30 days, and although each subject was screened at least 30 days after the first investigation, there is still the possibility that some asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects became infected during the time between the two testing campaigns and so were not then detected because they were already in the resolution phase of the infection.",

Particularly, serial antigen screening tests, despite the limitations with respect to rRT-PCR, might give a contribution to the containment of the COVID-19. These findings may have implications also for the evaluation to the real need of an accelerated release of inmates during the pandemic scenario.",
