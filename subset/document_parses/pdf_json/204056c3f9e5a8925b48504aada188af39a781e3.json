The worldwide spread and expansion of SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic with increased crude mortality rates in most European countries in 2020 [3] . SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted mainly by inhalation of respiratory droplets and aerosols emitted by a patient from the upper and lower respiratory tract or by direct contact with the conjunctiva of exposed individuals [4, 5] . The SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions, with the highest per-contact risk estimated to be in households [6] ; indoor transmission is very high compared to outdoors [7] .",

The 1978 Spanish Constitution recognizes and guarantees self-government for the territories. The vast majority of the Spanish national territory has acceded to self-government until 1995. Other Spanish territories are directly government-run uninhabited small islands along the Strait of Gibraltar and the Southern Alboran Sea off the North African coast and an island bordering Morocco. All self-governing regions are named comunidades aut\u00f3nomas in Spanish, except the Chartered Community of Navarre (Comunidad Foral de Navarra in Spanish), whose own self-government regime is based on an age-old chartered codified consuetudinary law system granting or acknowledging rights and freedoms, the Act of Confirmation of Charters of 1839 and the Compromise Act of 1841. Canarias was divided in 1927 into two provinces: Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas. Since then, only small changes have been made in provincial organization.",

This state of alarm established a nationwide curfew, except in Canarias, and delegated to the authority of each self-governing region or self-governing city the adoption of specific measures to limit mobility and assembly in the corresponding territory according to socio-epidemiological indicators. Under Royal Decree 926/2020, the competent authority was the Spanish government during the state of alarm, and, in each territory, the delegated competent authority was the regional government. The delegated competent authorities was empowered to dictate, by the delegation of the Spanish government, decrees, orders and subordinate instruments for establishing regulations or ad hoc decisions concerning limitations, constraints or restrictions of circulation, mobility and assembly. Although decision-making on public health measures continued to be carried out at the regional level, we have used data from the provinces and self-governing cities to use the most disaggregated data available. Both single and multiprovincial regions can take measures at a lower level when they deem it necessary. To guarantee the required coordination in applying the measures contemplated in the Royal Decree 926/2020, the Interterritorial Board of the Spanish National Health System may adopt for these purposes, in addition to coordinated actions, as many agreements as it considers necessary, including when applicable, establishing reference indicators and risk assessment criteria [37] .",

Given that some Spanish provinces have less than 100,000 inhabitants, we have also considered the notified confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days. The results obtained hardly vary concerning those presented here and are available upon request. We have decided to use CI 14 because this is the rate employed to take health decisions. Cumulative incidence is the proportion of healthy individuals who develop the disease over a given period. The CI 14 series allows an exhaustive assessment of transmission speed and constitutes a powerful epidemiological tool to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic evolves; lower values suggest a better control of the pandemic. Notified confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections included RT-PCR-positive and antigen-positive cases [39] [40] [41] [42] . Reinfections were not assessed in the period under study.",

Many articles have been discussed, with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) being the most commonly used economic indicator. Following the seminal paper by Barro and Sala-i-Mart\u00ed (1992) [46] , we can conclude in favor of convergence between the per capita GDP of a group of countries whenever the dispersion of the per capita GDP values reduces across the sample. Consequently, if convergence exists, then the cross-section variance of the per capita GDP goes to 0. This type of convergence is commonly known as \u03c3-convergence.",

PS warn of the possible presence of artificial convergence. An obvious example of this is the case of the consumer price index. If the base year is taken at the end of the sample, then these indicators would seem to converge, given that the base year takes the value 100 for all the cross-section units. To avoid such artificial forms of convergence, PS suggest taking the first observation as the base year, rescaling the data and discarding some initial observations to avoid the effect of the new initial observation.

As we can see, the null hypothesis of convergence is rejected. This result is also supported by Figures 1 and 2 , showing that the cross-sectional dispersion does not tend towards 0 and offering additional evidence of the absence of \u03c3-convergence. Then, we reject the presence of a single pattern of behavior in the evolution of the CI 14 across the Spanish provinces and self-governing cities. Table 2 shows the presence of some convergence clubs. The use of the PS cluster algorithm allows us to identify four statistically different convergence clubs and an additional province (Madrid) in the sense that the evolution of its CI 14 is not similar to any of the estimated clubs. To better understand the behavior of the estimated clubs, Figure 3 presents the corresponding average CI 14 values, and Figure 4 represents the distribution of the convergence clubs in a map of the Spanish provinces. Club 1 is formed by Asturias (a uniprovincial region), the city of Ceuta and a compact set of 5 southern provinces within the self-governing region of Andaluc\u00eda. Mediterranean coast provinces are mostly included in club 2 (Barcelona, M\u00e1laga, and Granada are exceptions). A few inner provinces are also included in club 2: Burgos, La Rioja, Valladolid, Le\u00f3n, Zamora, Badajoz, Huesca, Teruel, and Cuenca. The north coastal provinces exhibit a quite heterogeneous behavior, with Asturias included in club 1, Cantabria, Guizp\u00fazcoa and Pontevedra in club 2, and the rest in club 3. Finally, the island provinces are included in clubs 3 (Santa Cruz de Tenerife) and 4 (Islas Baleares and Las Palmas) and the rest of the inner provinces. The evolution of the average CI 14 values of the estimated clubs is presented in Figure 3 , allowing us to appreciate the cross-section differences and providing some additional insights. The club 1 and club 2 behaviors were quite similar and exhibited the highest values at the end of the sample. However, they differ in their evolution during the summer months and the beginning of autumn. The club 2 CI 14 average values were always greater up to the beginning of November. After this, club 1 attains its maximum (858) on 11 November 2020, while the club 2 maximum was a little lower (768) and occurred slightly earlier (5 November). From then onwards, both of them showed a sharp drop, and the values at the end of the sample were similar (410 and 420).",

We can also appreciate that those provinces containing the capital of a region also exhibit higher incidence levels, clearly connected with this mobility factor. The clubs with the highest mobility are club 4 and club 2; club 2, together with club 1, have the worst SARS-COV-2 evolution. However, club 4 is the most benevolent in terms of CI 14 , which may be related to the islands and transit-to-Madrid travels. These associations should be studied more in-depth [59, 60] . Internal mobility restrictions proved effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the first wave [61] , but they have not been evaluated territorially in Spain in the succeeding phases in a different way than a stay-at-home requirement. A recent study reported that reducing mobility positively affects reducing the growth rate of incidence [62] . Tools to assess spatial mobility in real time would help in the design and implementation of more effective local-targeted interventions [59] . Another study has shown that a more effective way to reduce CI 14 could be to limit the accumulation of people in specific places. A small minority of superspreader events account for many infections, and measures to restrict the maximum occupancy of spaces are more effective than uniformly reducing mobility [63] . Studies on SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events suggest that heterogeneity in infectivity may have a significant impact on transmission dynamics [64] , calling for further research on factors that could influence interindividual heterogeneity, susceptibility, and clinical outcome [26] . The provincial demographic structure-population density and population in cities lower than 50,000-could be related to the SARS-CoV-2 transmission and CI 14 . Club 1 shows a population density much higher than the rest of the clubs (721) and a proportion of the resident population in municipalities of less than 50,000, which takes the value 4.0, very different from the rest of the clubs: >12.6 (Appendix A). Further studies are necessary to identify and understand associations between mobility, superspreader events, demographic structure, and social interaction [65] .",

The data in Appendix A show that the slightly lower life expectancy at birth observed in club 1 (Appendix A), following recently published results that show lower baseline life expectancy estimations in Andaluc\u00eda (along with most provinces in club 1) [71] , could be associated with the higher transmission of the virus.",

            "text": "Seroprevalence at a particular moment-the proportion of the population with immunity-is related to the cumulative incidences of each province until that point in time. Even so, high seroprevalence levels may reduce the circulation of the virus due to the higher proportion of non-susceptible individuals. Seroprevalence in Spain is far from reaching the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 (~82.5%), using the mathematical formula 1-1/R0 and assuming an R0 estimate of 5.7 [72, 73] . The herd immunity threshold would mean that the incidence of infection will begin to decline once the proportion of individuals with acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the population exceeds 82.5%. It has been shown that in the second half of November, 7.1% of the population residing in Spain had anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, without significant differences between sexes (CI95: 6.7-7.6; 7.5% in women versus 6.7% in men) [74] . In the territorial disaggregation, seroprevalences higher than 10% are found in the provinces of \u00c1vila, Segovia, Soria, Palencia and Salamanca (Castilla y Le\u00f3n), and L\u00e9rida (region of Catalu\u00f1a). These provinces do not correspond to any CI 14 cluster, but there are differences in the seroprevalence values in November for each CI 14 club: clubs 1 and 2 had on average seroprevalences lower than 6.2%, and clubs 3 and 4 greater than 7.4%; in Madrid figure was 12.5%. IgG antibodies are only part of the anamnestic immune response, and memory cells play a fundamental role in adaptive cellular immunity; development of memory B and T cells is critical for long-term protection [75, 76] . Although the serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies show a decline at months 6-8, virus-specific T and/or memory B cell responses increase with time and are maintained during at least 6-8 months after infection [76] [77] [78] [79] . Asymptomatic infected patients generate a weaker immune response [80] , and some COVID-19 patients experience a decline in B cell responses over a timescale of 3 months [81] [82] [83] , so T cell responses may be more sensitive indicators for SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence than seropositivity [84] . Nevertheless, the seroprevalence results (Appendix A) in November 2020 correspond to the immunity generated by infection during the analyzed previous period. Conversely, the IgG seroprevalence results in November 2020 underestimate the past infection of more than six months.",

The Spanish global seroprevalence in November was 9.9% (95% CI: 9.4-10.4) [74] . A marked geographical variability in global seroprevalence was observed: only Las Palmas, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, La Coru\u00f1a, Pontevedra, Lugo, Valencia, Huelva and C\u00f3rdoba presented accumulated prevalences below or close to 5%; the central provinces around Madrid showed more than 15% (Cuenca, Soria and Madrid more than 18%). Above or around 10% is the entire central nucleus of the country. This does not correspond to the CI 14 patterns, but club 1 and club 2 had seroprevalences lower than 8.7%, and club 3 and club 4 greater than 11.1%; the Madrid global seroprevalence was 18.6%. Furthermore, this global seroprevalence could correspond to the underdetected first wave incidence, whose territorial differences have not been assessed in this article. SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells are associated with protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, as reported in a prospective cohort study [86] , and it has been suggested that seropositivity could be associated with protection from infection [84, 87] . Coronavirus protective immunity could be short-lived, and it has been suggested that it provides no long-term protection from reinfections; reinfections occurred most frequently at 12 months after infection [88] .",

Low TPRs not only shows a good control; it can be influenced by an excessive consideration of close contacts without real risk or by screening or studies in populations with low prevalences.

It is crucial to consider the nature of the measures implemented in different regions and cities to correctly interpret changes in the pandemic's impact. This could also help us to identify the most effective measures.",

The value in parentheses is the log-t ratio, and the value above it corresponds to the estimation of the parameter \u03b2 in (3). The null hypothesis is rejected if the log-t ratio is lower than \u22121.65. For the sake of clarity, Spanish names are used for all provinces. Panel II presents the results of applying the PS clustering algorithm. Panel A shows the initial results, Panel B presents the merging analyses of the adjacent clubs, while Panel C shows the final results. The \"PS\" column values are the results of the estimation of Equation (3) for the different combinations of provinces, with the values in parentheses reflecting the log-ratios and the values above them to estimate the parameter \u03b2 in (3).",
