Even with the worldwide distribution of vaccines, there is an apparent need for affordable, reliable, and accessible screening techniques to serve parts of the World that do not have access to Western medicine. Artificial Intelligence can provide a solution utilizing cough sounds as a primary screening mode for COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper presents multiple models that have achieved relatively respectable performance on the largest evaluation dataset currently presented in academic literature. Through investigation of a self-supervised learning model (Area under the ROC curve, AUC = 0.807) and a convolutional nerual network (CNN) model (AUC = 0.802), we observe the possibility of model bias with limited datasets. Moreover, we observe that performance increases with training data size, showing the need for the worldwide collection of data to help combat the Covid-19 pandemic with non-traditional means.",

There is a high demand for frequent, rapid, and affordable testing. To this date, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in nasopharyngeal swabs are the gold standard for detecting COVID-19 in clinical practice due to their high sensitivity and specificity [5] . However, despite the reliability of RT-PCR tests, some issues have arisen during mass application. One such example is that these tests require costly reagents and tools that have prevented equal access globally. Furthermore, administering and processing the test poses a risk of possible infection, and the test results take hours to days to return. An alternative is an antigen detection test for COVID-19 such as the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, a rapid immunochromatographic test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen. This test has the ability to deliver results in as little as 15 minutes, a factor that is helpful in hospital diagnosis for the safety of its patients. However, the antigen test has shown low sensitivity, with studies showing that its sensitivity was as low as 30.2% [6] , and there is often limited test supply during COVID-19 surges. To date, a rapid, accessible, and affordable testing method has not been deployed yet.",

Multiple research groups have been gathering sound recordings for COVID-19 patients of all ages, in various settings, symptomatic and asymptomatic, and at different periods relative to symptom onset. These allow the AI algorithms to learn audio characteristics of COVID-19 illness in patients with various demographic and medical conditions. A potential, purely digital COVID-19 detection method would allow for a smartphone-based rapid, equitable COVID-19 test with minimal infection risk, economic burden, and supply chain issues -all helpful factors to control COVID-19 spread.

Recently, researchers have explored the possibility of screening COVID-19 using cough signals. In [11] , the authors have demonstrated that a binary machine learning classifier is sufficient to identify COVID-19 cough and breath signals from healthy individuals or asthmatic patients. In [12] , a framework for AI speech processing that pre-screens cough to identify COVID by leveraging acoustic bio-marker as features. In this study, 96 cough samples are collected from users with bronchitis and 136 with pertussis in addition to the COVID positive and healthy cough samples. Moreover, this study uses three independent, parallel classifiers, namely, a deep transfer learning-based multi-class classifier (DTL-MC), a classical machine learning-based multiclass classifier (CML-MC), and a deep transfer learning-based binary class classifier (DTL-BC). These three independent classifiers are used due to the insufficient data available for learning. Lastly, handcrafted features like spectral centroid (SC), spectral roll-off (SR), zero-crossing rate (ZCR), MFCC, delta-delta MFCC can be used to train long short-term memory (LSTM) network models as shown in [13] . Classification on voice samples demonstrated the least accuracy among other acoustic features like cough and breath.",

Among the two datasets used in the DiCOVA challenge, one focuses only on cough sounds, and the other contains a collection of audio recordings, including counting numbers, phonation of sustained vowels, and breath. 11 most common symptoms combined with an established feature set of 384 features, obtained by applying 12 functions on the 16 frame-level descriptors and the respective delta coefficients, are classified using support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel in [16] .

It is concluded that high performance is achieved when DWT features are combined with traditional ML approaches such as SVM.

            "text": "Multiple publicly available datasets were combined and utilized to ensure minimal bias during model training. Among the crowdsourced data that were utilized were COUGHVID [21] and Coswara [22] datasets. As a publicly-available dataset of global cough audio recordings, COUGHVID is one of the largest COVID-19 related cough datasets. COUGHVID includes a total of 20,072 cough recordings labeled as positive COVID-19, symptomatic COVID-19 negative, and asymptomatic COVID-19 negative, along with other clinical information and metadata [21] . The dataset contains samples from a wide array of ages, genders, preexisting respiratory conditions, and geographic locations -all of which are useful data to consider when training an unbiased deep learning model. Similarly, the publicly available Coswara dataset was crowdsourced from participants around the globe utilizing a smartphone-based data collection platform [22] . Virufy processed the Coswara dataset and labeled over 2000 coughs resulting in the diverse demographics of samples, with 1839 samples as COVID-19 negative (\"healthy\") and 411 samples as COVID-19 positive (\"infected\"). Furthermore, to increase the usefulness of AI systems like ours in hospital settings, we sought to train our model on clinically gathered datasets. Subsequently, we utilized the IATOS dataset, which is a publicly available dataset gathered by the city government of Buenos Aires, Argentina, using WhatsApp chatbots. This validated dataset includes 2196 positive and 2199 negative patients in 11 hospital facilities where RT-PCR studies were carried out on patients suspected of COVID and 14 out-ofhospital isolation units for patients with confirmed COVID mild cases [23] . In addition to the aforementioned datasets, we also gathered and utilized our own crowdsourced and clinical datasets. Virufy's crowdsource dataset was collected using our study app (https://virufy.org/study) which requests users to input demographic information, such as age, gender, and comorbidities, along with their PCR test results. This app is publicly advertised on our website and as well as through press releases via Forbes, Yahoo, and various media outlets in South America and India. Additionally, we took sufficient measures to protect patient's privacy with our informed consent forms and privacy policy (https://virufy.org/privacy policy/). For Virufy's clinical dataset, in recognizing that the majority of identified COVID-19 positive patients present at clinics for testing, we developed a protocol for data collection at clinics. After extensive ethical review and scientific oversight, we achieved IRB approval for our data collection method. In this method, patients presenting for COVID tests are first requested to input demographic information, such as age, gender, and comorbidities, into our app (https://virufy.org/study). After doing so, they are requested to wear a surgical or cloth mask and cough intentionally into the smartphone. Finally, when test results are available, they are reported in the app and linked to the patient's cough. This protocol increases the likelihood that our data quality is high and clinically valid due to oversight by hospital staff and the IRB committee. This oversight also helps to establish acceptance for use in scientific research and clinical validation studies. Figure 1 shows the labeled data size for training, validation, and test sets as well as the unlabeled data size that is used during unsupervised learning.",

This placed a significant burden on model developers, and the underlying structure made it difficult to keep track of what changes were made to which notebook. To provide a uniform, centralized infrastructure for standardization, we moved many of the notebooks to one Github repository and wrote Python scripts that automated the standardization including the authentication and upload.

The transformer encoder network has three layers, each with a hidden layer size of 768, 12 attention heads, and a feed-forward network of 3072. Transformer encoder layers learn representation by masked signal prediction task as shown in Figure 2 . The masked signal prediction task could be described as follows. The input cough audio is transformed to a spectrogram image and then randomly masked in frequency and time domain as described in III-D2. This masked spectrogram image is fed into the transformer encoder layers. Transformer encoder layers learn representations while the prediction network following the transformer encoder layers tries to reconstruct the original spectrogram of the cough audio. The prediction network consists of 2 feed-forward layers with a hidden size of 768. The reconstruction loss is backpropagated through the prediction network and transformer encoder layers. This process is also called upstream training. Once upstream training is complete, the prediction network is removed, the upstream model is frozen, and representations from the transformer encoder are fed into the downstream model. The upstream model is based on the TERA [36] implementation of the s3prl [35] library.",

This manuscript is currently in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed journal [39] . This model was inspired by modern convolutional networks with a few key differences. First, there are no Batch Normalization (BN) layers. Generally, BN is used in residual networks (ResNets) for object classification and detection from RGB images. We have not found BN effective when we are working with monochrome sonographs. The second difference is that this architecture does not use skip connections. Traditional ResNets use skip connections due to extreme depth, and skip connections help to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. This architecture does not use skip connections since it is shallow compared to modern ResNets. Minor modifications have been made to the model compared to what will be published in the conference paper. The differences are how the sonographs have been created and the extension of the CNN's repeated layers, along with a global average pooling layer instead of flattening the features before being passed to the dense layers.",

This up-sampling allowed the combination of the datasets to be approximately balanced regarding the ratio of positives to negatives. After up-sampling all positives from each dataset, all samples, including the negatives, were randomly augmented using the library \"Audiomentations\" [40] . The augments that were performed include shifting the audio time-wise and adding a Gaussian single-to-noise ratio. The values used for the \"Shift\" function were: a min fraction of -.5, a max fraction of .5, and a pvalue of 1. These values ensured that all of the new samples created were shifted randomly time-wise and guaranteed all of the new samples were augmented. The values used for the \"AddGaussianNoise\" function were: a min SNR of .25, a max SNR of .9, and a p-value of .5. This step increased the likelihood that approximately half of all the new samples created had a Gaussian signal-to-noise ratio added to them in between the specified interval. These steps created a resulting training set that had one set of normal negatives, one set of augmented negatives, four sets of normal positives, and four sets of augmented positives.",

Once the audio was loaded with the library, the audio was condensed using the cough segments that were extracted by the pre-processing step described in Section 3.1 of this paper. Afterward, regardless of how many seconds of audio was extracted by the cough segmenter, all samples were fit into an approximate 4 second window. If there were less than 4-seconds of audio extracted per sample, zeros were padded at the end of the audio. If more than 4 seconds were extracted per sample, the audio was cut off. This previous step allowed all sonographs created to have a standard size and prevented the need to resize the sonographs, which dilates it and negatively affects the data quality. Once all samples were put into a standardized data array, augmentations described above were performed and Librosa extracted the MFCC features of the audio. Sixty-four MFCCs were used, along with a hop length of 256 and an n fft window size of 512. These values were used as opposed to the default values because they allowed us to \"zoom in\" on the temporal features of the audio as opposed to concentrating on the frequency resolution of the sonograph. The resulting sonograph was a 64 by 256-pixel MFCC representation of the four-second condensed audio.",

Afterward, the previous layer's output was passed to a 2 by 2 max-pooling layer with a stride of 2 by 2 to halve the spatial data vertically and horizontally for the next layer. This layer is followed by another sequence of convolution and pooling layers. In this case, the convolution layer consisted of a stride value of 1 by 1, 256 filters, and the dimension of 3 \u00d7 3, and the maxpooling layer was the same as the previous. These previous two layers were repeated twice and helped derive more specific features from the previous layers. These repeated layers were followed by a final convolution layer with a stride value of 1 by 1, 512 filters, and dimension of 3 \u00d7 3, which helps find only the smallest features from the previous layers with the largest amount of nodes in the network.

The output from this dense layer was routed to the final output layer, classifying the image as a zero or one.

            "text": "In this study, we compare the performance of a selfsupervised learning (SSL) and CNN approach to a baseline SVM model. As expected, we find that the SVM, a simpler model, is not able to differentiate the cough signals as well as the SSL and CNN models. We also compare the SSL approach that takes advantage of unlabeled coughs with the more traditional fully-supervised CNN approach. There is a small difference between the models' AUCs, with the SSL approach having a 0.016 higher AUC on the test set, however the SSL model is slightly skewed toward sensitivity. Currently, it is unclear which model is better. There can be multiple improvements made to both models with different types of upsampling techniques, hyperparameter tuning, output threshold tuning, and over-fitting prevention techniques. There can also be improvements to the pre-processing and feature extraction steps such as separating the cough segments into individual samples and concatenating them for a final prediction on a single audio file. Also, the type of data collected by the Virufy team, and other teams around the world, can affect model performance. Another possible next step is to experiment with a fusion model incorporating predictions from the SSLtransformer, CNN, SVM, and other approaches to improve prediction performance. There are several limitations that should be noted. Previous studies have demonstrated a higher AUC and other metrics than the ones that we show in our study. However, our study's performance is likely closer to the real-world performance of such a test due to our larger and more diverse training dataset. Furthermore, most academic papers regarding COVID-19 classification with AI suffer from reproducibility issues, along with the fact that a lot of papers have only a small validation set, and no test set, which increases the possibility of biased models. Another limitation is that the labels from our crowdsourced training data (72.6% of labeled dataset) are unverified. This unverified data has incorporated error into our models and will affect the performance in real world environments. Future work should be done to invest resources in collecting more PCR-verified coughs. Lastly, the crowdsourced audio data is prone to noise that may lead to algorithmic prediction bias. We try to account for this issue by only including high-quality data from all sources using an internally developed cough screening tool. Furthermore, our inclusion of multiple data sources should reduce the effect of background noise specific to datasets.",

In addition to improving model performance, future work should focus on collecting high-volumes of PCR-validated samples and assessing the model generalizability to new datasets. Decisionmaking errors should be closely studied to understand how prediction performance is affected by audio recording conditions, patient symptoms, and the time point during the course of COVID-19 infection.",
