In this white paper, community governance of online and offline aggregate services depends on the various assets and functions of the community, acts in collaboration with community stakeholders, and prevents and resists contingencies. Defined as a community with the ability to self-organize, self-adapt, and self-heal Interference or disaster to achieve sustainable development. This paper puts forward the benefit evaluation method of community governance, which is used to evaluate the implementation effect of online and offline community governance system. Taking a county as an example, this paper analyzes the impact of the challenge and novelty of this model on urban construction. Research shows that in the previous community governance model, about 50% of the people think that the managers of all institutions related to public welfare should not take management as the purpose, and even nearly 70% of the respondents also stressed that these institutions should not be allowed to collect legal management fees or commission fees. At the same time, 40% of respondents admitted that they did not trust the quality of free services provided by public welfare agencies. The online and offline aggregate service modes adopted by the city not only work well in the city's economy, but also increase the city's GDP by 12%. This is 3.6% higher than in the previous mode. In addition, this model will accelerate the process of democratic construction and improve people's happiness index.",

For example, moody m defines the community governance community as a collective community that is in a continuous stressful living environment but can self recover, self adjust and self learn from the perspective of online and offline aggregation services (Moody 2020) . Markus ah believes that community governance community must have excellent management ability to deal with natural disaster events and other risk problems, and community governance can be improved through online and offline aggregation service planning, resource reserve, multi-party cooperation, psychological support, community leadership and death information feedback (Greenwood et al. 2008 ). Frumkin P believes that community governance has the ability to deal with interference and uncertainty, community resources are the core elements, and sustainable development is the long-term goal of community governance (Frumkin 2020 ). Letts C W believes that the research on community governance in China started late and is still in the initial stage. At present, it is mainly applied to urban planning and disaster prevention and mitigation of online and offline aggregation services, which has not been well known by the management academia, and there is a certain gap in research depth with foreign counterparts (Letts et al. 2020 ). Jing y defines elastic community as a social community living in the same area or under the same risk, points out the community's initiative in disaster prevention and control, and advocates domestic scholars and relevant institutions to explore the localization of Community Governance (Jing and Gong 2020) .",

Zietsma C pointed out that community governance of online and offline aggregate services should have three characteristics: initiative, redundancy and agility. Community governance of community comes from four aspects: structural community governance, process community governance, ability community governance and cultural community governance (Zietsma and Lawrence 2020) . In view of the systematic thinking of the theory, hsucl analyzes the current situation and development dilemma of the resilience construction of online and offline community aggregation services in China on the basis of combing the relevant literature of resilient community, and constructs the concept model of resilient community and the governance model of urban resilient community by using the innovation ecosystem theory, so as to provide theoretical reference for the community governance of smart cities in China (Hsu 2020) . However, the communities and their governance status of more than 2000 county divisions across the country seem to be the shadow of the sun, and have not received the necessary attention (Spires 2018). Under the dual constraints of backward ideas and insufficient resources, counties in urgent need of institutional innovation are identified as followers who follow suit, that is, most of them take learning, imitating and learning from the experience of advanced regions at home and abroad as the main means to achieve the improvement of community governance within their jurisdiction (Durand et al. 2020) . The above studies not only rarely involve the online and offline community governance of the third and fourth tier cities, but also fail to accurately grasp the new progress and direction of community governance at the county level.",

In the past, most literatures interpret government led smart city projects from the perspective of government purchasing services or public-private partnership. However, this form of project, which is based on venture capital, has its particularity. A general analysis from a government's point of view cannot help explore its unique policy values, nor can it analyze the difficulties and problems in its operation. At the same time, the lack of research status above further hampered more targeted improvement programs. From this point of view, this paper gradually introduces smart cities into the county community by using the cultural and cognitive perspective of organizational institutionalism as the main theoretical model and understanding and understanding new institutional forms and their practical behaviors. In particular, the specific process of transplanting specific institutional forms to new public policy scenarios and localizing them is called creative governance. It analyzes and sorts out how all parties change their views on key points in typical cases, and then develops new mechanisms.",

Community governance, thinking theory and thinking method are also constantly integrated and developed into community governance thinking, which reflects the overall, regional, inclusive, innovative, systematic, diverse, humanized and dynamic characteristics of the system (Bies and Kennedy 2019). Scholars' research on community governance mostly focuses on individual psychological community governance, family community governance, organizational community governance, industrial community governance and industrial community governance, or community governance in five different dimensions of community, city, region, country and global (Battilana et al. 2020) . It can be seen that although there are literatures at home and abroad on community governance from different perspectives, they all agree that community governance is a kind of ability to restore and maintain their own functions (Tracey et al. 2020 ). The early ideas of community construction and governance in the UK have made important contributions to the theory of community governance and community construction. In 2011, the UK incorporated community governance and community construction into the national strategic model (Sun et al. 2018) . Community governance runs through the structure, process, ability and development level, not limited to disaster response and risk management . From the perspective of community governance, the above situation has two possible advantages: first, due to the innovative requirements of smart city project, community leaders are forced to play the corresponding creativity, and no longer use traditional and rigid propaganda or mobilization means to solve some governance problems; second, in the face of the situation that the superior government is unwilling to transfer part of its functions to social organizations, the smart city, as a special form of government purchasing services, partly realizes the transfer of responsibilities and resources with the help of the community and its social organizations (Girardin et al. 2020) . With the arrival of various administrative tasks, the community often plays an important role in personnel, funds and communication platform see elbow at the front (Gao et al. 2019) . In fact, more and more community cadres have been found since 2018, and they are more responsible for government affairs (Zhou et al. 2017) .",

At the same time, people have the \"economic man\" side of modern citizens or consumers, which emphasizes the market pricing of public services, and thinks that \"cheap goods are not good goods\". In depth investigation will find that another important structural reason for this situation is that as of June 2014, there are more than 1600 legally registered social organizations in our city, but the vast majority are mutual beneficial industry associations or social organizations, which are only limited to the activities related to internal members, and there are not many influential public welfare social organizations that are really oriented to the general public. It is difficult for the local civil affairs department to find a recognized representative organization. As shown in Table 3 , although various government purchase service projects have been written into the work of many county governments in our city, few of them are actually implemented in actual operation. According to the introduction of local officials, due to the strict standards of government purchase service process, few local social organizations can meet the requirements.
