Since then the number of COVID-19 patients has increased drastically across the world. Compared to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), COVID-19 is much more transmissible although its case fatality rate is reportedly lower. 1 However, we have seen the effects of large COVID-19 outbreaks straining healthcare systems such that the mortality escalates exponentially. In spite of all this, healthcare systems still need to continue basic provision of essential services. It is inevitable that during a time of pandemic, services may encounter patients who retrospectively get diagnosed with the disease whilst undergoing a separate planned procedure. 2 Institutions must calibrate their response in accordance with the country's health ministry. 3 In Singapore, a Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) framework is adopted. We discuss the various facets of continued provision of thoracic surgical services during and after a pandemic such as resource distribution, infection control measures, prioritization of surgery, inpatient, perioperative and outpatient management, research activities and ethical considerations. We elaborate on specific measures that are available in literature and practiced in our institution that can be implemented during this crisis. We also include suggestions on resumption of services post lockdown. This article focuses on the provision of thoracic surgical services for patients with lung pathologies.",

An example roster which balances the work rest cycle is demonstrated in Table 1 . Such segregation helps with contact tracing if exposure occurs to a staff member and prevents the disruption of services should any member of staff fall ill. 9 Staff segregation is a dynamic continual process that has to be constantly tweaked according to current manpower status. 3, 10 In the event of a surge, stricter measures of segregation should be considered and staff may be required to rotate duties and alternate work weeks. Non clinical support and administrative staff should be encouraged to telecommute and adhere to social distancing. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 This will require information technology infrastructural support which may not be available in some systems. Tumour boards and department meetings should be conducted over video conferencing platforms to minimize HCWs transmission. 3,7,9,11e15 Pandemics like COVID-19 are unpredictable in its duration and may be prolonged. HCWs should be judicious in the usage and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) and take responsibility in not depleting resources unnecessarily. 9",

Our national policy recommends patients who have URTI symptoms or infective cases (i.e. empyema, lung abscesses) have two COVID-19 swab negative samples 24 h apart before transferring between institutions. 17 Patient transfers should be tracked and senior hospital authorities involved in the approval process of patient transfers so as to maintain a macro view of the hospital's bed situation. 25 We advocate for a criterion for transfer considered only for patients who require clinically urgent intervention, in which the sending hospital has no expertise or capability and t h e s u r g e o n x x x ( x x x x ) x x x the patient cannot be remotely managed. This will minimize cross hospital contamination and transmissions. Where possible, referrals should be directed to an outpatient setting where patients can be screened on arrival to hospital as above. 9 For patients who are COVID-19 positive and require inpatient transfer, we have a dedicated transfer team and protocol. The other hospital transferring team hands over the patient at a dedicated COVID-19 ambulance bay ensuring minimal physical contact of staff and equipment. The patient is then escorted by appropriately PPE attired security and medical personnel along a predetermined route to the COVID-19 wards. Front scout security personnel clear the hallways of pedestrians to avoid exposure. A dedicated lift is used solely for the transfer of COVID-19 patients. A trailing housekeeping team then follows behind the patient cleaning the environment before pedestrians are allowed to resume usage of the path.",

            "text": "An overarching principle for inpatient management is to reduce the duration of stay for patients. 6 Reports have shown that many patients awaiting or undergoing surgery contract COVID-19 during their inpatient stay. 26 We encourage same day admissions, expedited discharges to home and telemedical outpatient follow up to reduce length of stay while delivering appropriate medical care. 23 Pre-operative work up should be consolidated and performed outpatient. Preoperative pulmonary function tests should be considered only for patient who are at high risk of respiratory compromise post lung resection (e.g.: COPD, asthmatic patients). 27 Thoracic surgical patients, in particular patients undergoing lung resection for cancer and immunosuppressed patients on chemotherapy, are at higher risk of contracting infections including COVID-19. 2,21,26 These patients are at higher risk of severe events from SARS-CoV-2 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and death. 2,3 A high suspicion for COVID-19 must be present when managing these patients with lung malignancies, especially if community spread is present. Patients with URTI symptoms or computed tomography findings of bilateral ground glass opacities should be screened for COVID-19 aggressively. 28 If found, surgery should be delayed if possible until the COVID-19 is fully resolved. 9, 15, 29 It is inevitable that as COVID-19 pandemic progresses and lockdowns end, some patients transiting through hospitals will get the disease or bring it from the community. 2,7, 26 We advocate applying an expanded screening criterion to screen all patients presenting to the hospital who have symptoms of URTI or findings of pneumonia, even radiologically, to reduce risk of local hospital transmission. 7 This practice is resource intensive and not all healthcare systems may be able to afford such extensive screening due to limitations in testing kits, PPE or manpower. In such instances, ring fencing and cohorting of thoracic surgery patients may help reduce risk of transmission amongst patients. 30 As most thoracic surgery patients have baseline respiratory symptoms, many will fall within this expanded screening criteria and be screened for COVID-19. As such, PPE training is mandatory for thoracic surgery services staff as they are likely to encounter and manage COVID-19 confirmed or suspect patients. 10 ",

In times of a pandemic with limited operating theatre resources, deliberate prioritization of surgical cases should be considered. 4,14, 19 We suggest thoracic surgical operations be stratified into emergency, urgent and elective. Emergency surgery entails life-saving operations which if not performed, would result in the imminent demise of the patient. 7 Urgent surgeries include those for which there are no non-surgical alternatives for management. These patients require inpatient surgery with the necessary precautions. Elective surgeries include patients with thoracic malignancies who require oncologic surgery. 4,6,9 Within the elective category, we further classify into high, medium and low priority. 23,30e32 Depending on the hospital's current resources, ICU bed and ventilator capacity and current pandemic trajectory, we suggest prioritizing them accordingly. Should the healthcare system be overwhelmed such that manpower and resources have to be diverted away from operating theatres and outpatient clinics, only emergency surgical services can be maintained and all elective and urgent surgeries postponed. 3, 19 As the pandemic resolves, hospitals can progressively begin taking on more elective cases where resources allow. Table 2 illustrates and gives examples of the above principles.",

Hence these patients should still be afforded their oncologic surgery if hospital resources permit, even during a pandemic. 3 While we know these patients are at higher risk of sustaining COVID-19 and severe complications if they transit through the hospital, we cannot predict the duration a pandemic would run and indefinitely postpone oncological surgery while the tumour proliferates. 33 Postoperatively, patients who require adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy can be delayed up to 4 months, until the pandemic curve has crossed its peak. 3,30, 34 In the event of a surge overwhelming surgical resources such as ICU and ventilators, non-inferior alternatives such as stereotactic body radiation may be considered if available. 23, 30, 34 Lung transplantation must proceed with caution during a pandemic. Experience with H1N1 showed that lung transplant patients are at high risk of mortality during pandemics. 35 Furthermore, during a surge there may be a scarcity of resources required to support the prolonged post-operative care of a transplant patient. If transplant is performed, patients must not be actively infected with SARS-CoV-2, at least 14 days after initial diagnosis and recipients should have 2 negative PCR-based tests at least 48 h apart prior to transplantation. 36 Lung transplant for COVID-19 related lung disease is possible but not advisable and warrants concomitant cardiac evaluation in view of the risk of myocarditis. 37 Heightened infection control measures must be adopted for patients immediately post transplantation on induction therapy as COVID-19 is also associated with lymphopenia. 36 Post transplant patients are at high risk of complications from COVID-19. 38 Ex vivo lung perfusion may be considered for time sensitive donors as a temporary hub to store donor lungs during a time of crisis.",

Disposable equipment should be utilized as far as possible. 11, 41, 42 Hand hygiene before and after procedures must be strictly enforced. 25 After the procedure, proper disinfection must be done of the OT and equipment cleaned separately before further utilization. 11, 25 Intraoperative management When performing thoracic surgery, electrosurgical instruments such as monopolar diathermies, advanced bipolar and ultrasonic dissectors should be placed on the lowest setting to minimize aerosolization.

Non-essential clinical trials and research should only continue if resources allow. With the aid of technology, global round table discussions, webinars and conferences should be freely encouraged to facilitate the exchange of information, ideas and treatment modalities. 19 To balance trainee requirements, residents should continue to be exposed to the operating theatre even during the outbreak. Manpower must be evenly distributed within the confines of segregation as residents continue to hone their clinical and operative skills. 2, 48 With the reduction in elective load, opportunities will be decreased. 6 Residents should continue to maintain their skills using simulation where time and resources permit. 48 Conferences, educational courses and examinations that require travel should be postponed. 6, 48 However, trainees should also continue to enhance their knowledge by attending webinars and through internet-based learning platforms. 48 Prolonged training might be a necessity if the pandemic becomes protracted and arrangements for indemnity made. 6, 48 In the initial stages, junior trainees should not be exposed to COVID-19 patients unnecessarily. However, as HCW infections, quarantine orders and fatigue sets in, opportunities for residents to step up into roles beyond their usual duties will arise. Residents as trainees and future specialists, must be prepared to be called upon during such times and sufficiently equip themselves to do so. 48 This calls upon senior physicians to undertake closer supervisory roles and in instances step down to help their juniors where necessary.

The team elected to conservatively manage them citing various logistical and infection control reasons. 49 This was criticized and argued that the risk of HCW infection from intubated patients is mitigated. In such instances, the principle of distributive justice may be invoked to rationalize treatment. 3,47 Due to the limitations in resources, conservative management may be adopted more widely than before, during a surge. 29 In extreme situations when operating theatres are converted to makeshift ICUs and ventilators are shared between patients, surgical intervention would be forced to cease and conventional modalities may become first-line therapy. 9,15 Deliberate efforts, including ethical decision making, must be taken to minimize resource utilization where appropriate. 15 ",
