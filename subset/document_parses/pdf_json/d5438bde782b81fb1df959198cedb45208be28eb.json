The need for practices that \"open doors\" at home as a way to promote a quality education and to foster an environment of supportive relationships and a sense of community, has led to the in-depth analysis of successful educational actions, particularly the Dialogic Literary Gatherings (DLGs). The aim of this article is to show how the transference of DLGs to the home environment has had an impact on child subjective well-being in times of confinement, promoting a safe and supportive environment for learning, interacting, coexisting and on emotional development at different educational stages, especially for the most vulnerable children. Data collection consisted of a focus group of 10 teachers, 6 semi-structured interviews addressed to families and 6 life stories of students, from 4 primary education centers, 1 high school, and 1 Special Education School. Communicative methodology structured the two-level data analysis, for studying both the elements provided by online DLGs that favor and achieve child well-being, and the elements that may hinder those achievements. The results confirm that DLGs have had a notorious impact on children's and their families' well-being. Considering the findings in the development of educational public policies and the possibility of extending \"open doors actions\" as an option for future learning environments beyond the confinement situation is contemplated. Future research on how these spaces can have an impact on child well-being in upcoming contexts of the new normal in the education domain will be of interest.",

The way in which the outbreak is tackled may imply critical long-term effects (Gates, 2020) , what is required is the implementation of successful procedures to reduce to the extent of any possible undesirable effects, especially for the most vulnerable children (Brooks et al., 2020) . In this context, the need to give continuity to teaching and learning, despite school suspension, through online education , and to rapidly find educational alternatives for supporting this learning and ensuring child well-being has become an urgent necessity. Children are more vulnerable than adults in the face of traumatic situations and their impact on their daily routines (Bartlett et al., 2020) . The quickly evolving new situation exposes children to conversations, constant media information, anxiety-inducing environments and changes and continuous adjustments to their routines as a result of the outbreak (Dalton et al., 2020) . The global situation in general, and the prolonged home confinement, the social distancing and the school closures in particular, are having particular negative consequences on children's mental and physical health, interfering with their sense of security, structure or predictability (Bartlett et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , both in the short and long term, which cannot be neglected (Dalton et al., 2020) . Regarding the mental effects, a psychological impact on anxiety, fear, boredom or frustration, inter alia (Brooks et al., 2020) has been reported, as well as trauma both for children and their families (Sprang and Silman, 2013) . This situation can become a vicious circle, as the subsequent social-emotional and behavioral disorders may also contribute to more adverse results on health such as cardiovascular diseases, excessive weight gain, poor quality of life (Perrin et al., 2016) , and a risk for future mental illnesses and cognitive development (Decosimo et al., 2019) . These health consequences become more significant and persistent when we talk about vulnerable children with previous trauma or preceding physical, mental, or developmental disorders, as well as those with problems within the family (Bartlett et al., 2020) . The lack of interactions with friends and outdoor activities , the absence of personal space at home, or the family's financial problems, are among other factors affecting child well-being in confinement, which have a challenging impact on youth and child well-being (Brooks et al., 2020) . But despite the contingencies caused by this outbreak, especially on education around the world, this interruption is also providing new opportunities to find and discover transformative and stimulating practices, where the whole community-families and teachers-with the support of institutions and administrations, meet and reinvent education for the sake of the continuation of learning (Dryden-Peterson, 2020) .",

            "text": "Child well-being is imperative in the current situation, in the wider present, and in the future as it will influence and predict forthcoming outcomes as adults (Lansford et al., 2019 ). The literature on child well-being is large and keeps on expanding, and therefore several and different definitions and indicators can be found, what makes the research review and the choice for a definition more complex (Pollard and Lee, 2003; Statham and Chase, 2010) . From science, research projects, governments, institutions, organizations such as OECD or UNICEF and committees of the European Union or the United States, inter alia, there have been different attempts to create a system of indicators for measuring child well-being. Nevertheless, more work and attention on this is needed (Moore, 2020) . In order to understand the concept, a multidimensional notion of child wellbeing definition seems the most suitable to approach a holistic reality incorporating physical, mental and social aspects of the person (Statham and Chase, 2010) , influenced by the interactions with family, peers, the community, but also by policies and programs (Lansford et al., 2019) . Different studies provide their classifications of child well-being domains, but many of them coincide to focus on cognitive, physical, psychological, educational, social or behavioral domains to define and measure the feeling of wellness in children (Pollard and Lee, 2003; Bradshaw and Richardson, 2009; Lansford et al., 2019) . The latest tendencies in measuring child well-being have gradually evolved into engaging children in defining their perception and interpretation of well-being, what emphasizes the importance of subjective well-being in studies (Statham and Chase, 2010) and the consideration of a communicative perspective of research through the inclusion of the participants' voices (Flecha, 2000; Puigvert et al., 2012) . This study will focus on the latter, paying special attention to the subjective well-being dimension as the sense of happiness or life satisfaction (Dinisman and Ben-Arieh, 2016) , where the supportive interpersonal relationships constitute one of the main predictors (Diener et al., 2018) . It will also measure it from a communicative perspective, considering the participants' view through the voices of families and teachers, but mainly focusing on students.",

Thus, some schools have started to implement Open Doors Actions: actions that emerge from new developments and from the transference of identified evidence-based strategies, aimed at educational communities, families, teachers and mainly students, that traditionally have created a safe and friendly environment for improving learning and coexistence in schools, and which are now brought through a virtual medium to home spaces. These actions for training, sharing and exchanging are forming a response to the challenge of maintaining caring, rich, and supportive interactions among peers and their educational communities. Evidence reported from eight schools has shown a positive impact on the emotional and cognitive development of children in confinement .",

DLGs are dialogic spaces for educational purposes where participants-children and/or adults-involving egalitarian dialogs around classical readings of the universal literature, and where all of them have the same opportunities to speak without hierarchies, and creating in interaction new meanings about the text discussed (Flecha, 2000; Garc\u00eda-Carri\u00f3n et al., 2020) . In them, participants delve into universal values, issues and feelings of concern that humankind has experienced since ancient times through the discussion of complex and rich works, finding meanings and reflecting on them upon the participants' own experiences and building new interpretations all together. The functioning is as follows: all students read alone, at home or at school, a previously decided piece of text from the book being read, which can be a faithful and high-quality adapted version of the original classic work. They choose a paragraph and note down the reasons that led them to select it. Along the DLG session, the students who wish to share their chosen paragraph as well as their reasons, and all the students start a debate or discussion on the raised idea, with the aim being to reflect on and to share and build meanings according to the participants' experiences (Flecha, 2009; Lopez de Aguileta, 2019) . The egalitarian dialogue (Serrano et al., 2010) ; the diversity of voices to enrich interpretations and debate (Flecha, 2009) ; or the fact of grounding the contributions on arguments instead on of power claims (Oliver and Gatt, 2010) are crucial premises according to the dialogic learning principles (Aubert et al., 2008) executed when implementing DLGs.",

The implementation of DLGs in said settings has been conducted on-site until confinement, but since the pandemic situation, the schools participating in the study are developing these meetings online, through a video conference platform, providing an opportunity for social contact during lockdown. The moderator continues to play a very important role both for maintaining a warm environment that encourages participation and for promoting dialogic principles. This study explores DLGs as an evidence-based action replicable in any educational on-site environments, which has been incorporated to European recommendations and public policies (G\u00f3mez et al., 2010; European Commission, 2011) and is now being transferred to online spaces. In this new situation, and considering all its benefits, this study seeks to explore two core issues: the extent to which the transference of DLGs to homes through online means can have a positive impact on child well-being in these times of confinement on the one hand, and how this learning action can promote a safe and supportive environment for learning, and how it can interact and coexist in different education stages, especially for the most vulnerable children. This is necessary not only to respond to the challenges of the current pandemic, but also for meeting future demands regarding the protection of child well-being and health (Shonkoff and Williams, 2020) . In the framework of this study, the analysis has focused on the measurable areas of child well-being, focusing on prosocial behavior; positive relationships with family, peers and other adults as teachers; and academic performance, covering the behavioral, psychological, social and cognitive domains (Lansford et al., 2019) .",

To this end, a communicative approach is used, through the joint construction of knowledge between researchers and research participants, what enables a better understanding of the improvements generated in the well-being of children due to the implementation of the DLGs in confinement times (Puigvert et al., 2012) . The six DLGs, object of analysis, were already implemented in the participating schools before confinement and have been developed online through a video conference platform during confinement. Communicative methodology recovers the voices and views of the different educational agents-families, teachers and students themselves, for generating profound analysis with the aim of building useful knowledge for affording child well-being at present, as well as in future crises (G\u00f3mez et al., 2019) .",

Students have the opportunity to be in a context where to express freely and without judgment their positive, but also the negative emotions and concerns that maybe, in other spaces, they are not able to share. Thus, some teachers report that children often establish relationships between what is happening in the classical book and in their reality, telling their fears and worries through the characters of the book. But also, with teachers, some students have noticed that the line that separates the relationship of student-teacher with friendship is thinner now because during DLGs they have seen their teachers' emotions, feelings and opinions as \"peers\": Now, with Oliver Twist in all the DLGs, the relationship with the current situation emerges. I think it is a space that helps them a lot to talk about those fears, or those concerns that perhaps they do not even dare to speak [out of DLGs] but empathizing with the characters of the book, yes, these issues appear and appear (FP3).",

The results of the research have shown how the implementation of DLGs in online format, transferring them to homes, is having an impact on the improvement of children's well-being, from a subjective view. Precisely, the improvements have taken place in some of the well-being dimensions, such as the emotional, educational and social ones, reducing the risk of anxiety regarding the new situation of confinement and all the inputs children receive related to the COVID-19 outbreak. These virtual spaces have shown how they enable the involvement of families for which participating had never been possible before and have allowed many children to participate more and more thanks to the facilities provided by virtual communication. The study has gone further, exploring and revealing the benefits of this action for family life and in their homes, and how the reciprocal collaboration of the community agents has enabled such impact.

The development of policies addressed to ensure a healthy child development has been studied as the foundation of a productive society intended to create a successful future. Public programs and policies directly affect the community capacities for strengthening that healthy development, underpinned by safe contexts and quality stable relationships (Center on the Developing Child, and Harvard University, 2014). According to Wang et al. (2020) , it is the responsibility of not only families or schools, but also of governments, to immediately act to avoid, as far as possible, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's physical and mental health . Taking this into consideration and knowing the potentialities and viability of DLGs in homes, it seems possible and convenient to contemplate the proposal of developing public policies in this direction. Ensuring technological availability and internet access for conducting the DLGs needs to be considered in order to transfer this educational action.",

The online DLGs were introduced less than a month before the study, not before ensuring technical support for every family without internet access or technological resources in order to ensure equal terms for all to share the educational experience. This time of deployment makes it difficult to measure the impact of DLGs transferred to the home on aspects related to the child's objective well-being. This study has shown that an impact on child well-being occurs and, therefore, further research on the elements and strategies of DLGs that facilitate and promote this impact is needed in order to facilitate the transference of this action to other educational spaces. Considering their further implementation beyond the confinement situation, it would also be relevant to delve into the long term impact of implementing this action, especially to explore its possible effects on improving academic performance, or preventing school failure. Further research on how the implementation of other Open Doors Actions , such as Dialogic workspaces with students, teachers and volunteers; Class assemblies, or other Dialogic Gatherings (musical, artistic, scientific, etc.), could have an impact on child well-being during the time of pandemic crisis and school closing would be relevant. A future line of research on the benefits of extending online DLGs after the confinement situation, in the upcoming contexts of the new normal in the education domain is also of interest.",

What seems probable is that it will go along to become the new normal. Results of the study indicate the desire-once the online connection obstacles are overcome, and the potentialities discovered-for continuing to implement DLGs online in the future. Considering the new setting and the voices of participants, who expressed their desire to continue with this action regardless of the pandemic situation, and given its complementarity with the face-to-face format, it seems plausible to think that this educational action will live on beyond the outbreak, as a useful and successful tool for boosting children's education and, above all, children's well-being as well as their families' , encouraging the creation of a wider community and broader participation. Once the data collection period for this study was finished, researchers learnt that more and more between-schools alternatives had been emerging once the potentialities and opportunities offered by a virtual format of DLG were discovered. The different schools found in this online action an opportunity to connect different learning communities virtually, broadening educational horizons and extending their impact, through the joint implementation of this new Open Doors Action.",
