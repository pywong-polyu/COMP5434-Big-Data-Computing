Aim: Our aim was to develop and validate a largescale facility that uses hydrogen peroxide vapour for the decontamination of used respirators. Methods: A multidisciplinary and multisectoral ad hoc group of experts representing various organisations was assembled to implement the collection and transport of used FFP2 and FFP3 respirators from hospitals covering 86% of the Finnish population. A large-scale decontamination facility using hydrogen peroxide vapour was designed and constructed. Microbiological tests were used to confirm efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapour decontamination together with a test to assess the effect of decontamination on the filtering efficacy and fit of respirators. Bacterial and fungal growth in stored respirators was determined by standard methods. Results: Large-scale hydrogen peroxide vapour decontamination of a range of FFP2 and FFP3 respirator models effectively reduced the recovery of biological indicators: Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus atrophaeus spores, as well as model virus bacteriophage MS2. The filtering efficacy and facial fit after hydrogen peroxide vapour decontamination were not affected by the process. Microbial growth in the hydrogen peroxide vapourtreated respirators indicated appropriate microbial cleanliness. Conclusions: Large-scale hydrogen peroxide vapour decontamination was validated. After effective decontamination, no significant changes in the key properties of the respirators were detected. European Union regulations should incorporate a facilitated pathway to allow reuse of appropriately decontaminated respirators in a severe pandemic when unused respirators are not available. 4 h 11 h 12 h 6 h",

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of filtering facepiece (FFP2 and FFP3) respirators or equivalent for healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients when performing aerosol-generating procedures [1] . In view of delays in scaling up production, since manufacturing respirators is technically demanding, the use of decontaminated respirators has been suggested as a solution to ensure appropriate protection for healthcare workers if new respirators are not available. European Union (EU) regulation prevents the use of decontaminated respirators if the respirator does not have instructions for decontamination from the manufacturer [2] . The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given Emergency Use Authorization for reuse of decontaminated respirators [3] .",

The process verified the efficacy of decontamination, as well as the preservation of the key filtering, breathing resistance and facial fit properties of the decontaminated respirators. Based on the experience in producing HPV using a method developed by VTT and FDRA [15, 16] , our ad hoc group constructed a large-scale HPV decontamination facility on a large parking area using the FDF's existing hardware. Scaling up the decontamination process from laboratory-based to large-scale processing necessitated high-capacity HPV generation and effective air circulation to ensure high and uniformly distributed HPV concentration inside a large space with densely packed respirators. Previously, the largest documented capacities for decontamination of respirators were up to 1,500 in one treatment run [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Our facility's capacity to decontaminate 40,000 respirators per 24 h would meet the estimated maximum need for FFP2 and FFP3 respirators in Finland in the worst-case scenarios of the current pandemic, if no unused respirators were available.",

This is in line with the high HPV decontamination efficacy reported previously from small-scale experiments, mostly conducted in the US [6, 8, 22, 23, 26] . In our two high-load runs of up to 20,000 respirators, which adsorb large amounts of HPV, we observed slightly lower reductions in the viability of BG spores deposited into the respirator matrix.

Testing of all the respirator properties according to the EN 149 standard was not considered essential because some properties are unlikely to change (e.g. carbon dioxide content of inhaled air), or are not considered to be important in healthcare use (e.g. flammability). We replaced the total inward leakage tests with fit tests with one person to acquire reproducible data on possible changes. The EU regulation prevents the use of reprocessed, decontaminated disposable respirators if the respirator does not have manufacturer instructions for decontamination [2] , and they cannot be used in workplace [32] . Consequently, the objective of the investigation was not to provide reprocessed respirators to the healthcare districts or to the market while a sufficient supply of new ones was available. Given the availability of adequate supplies, the worst-case scenario that would have potentially required us to use the processed respirators did not materialise, and the decontaminated respirators were stored centrally. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has published a review on various decontamination methods, including sterilisation in autoclave, HPV treatment, gamma radiation, ozone, UV and EtO treatment [33] , without presenting decontamination efficacies for these methods or recommendations.

In this case, if the general population were to require respirators in addition to healthcare, the demand for respirators would greatly surpass that experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This raises the need to consider using reprocessed respirators when unused ones are unavailable and to incorporate this concept in future preparedness processes.",

We propose that a regulatory pathway should be considered in the EU for the reuse of reprocessed respirators, decontaminated with HPV or other well-validated methods, as an emergency procedure when no new respirators are available, including strict conditions as a prerequisite for reuse.",

The duration of HPV treatment varied between 1.5 h and 5.5 h depending on the number of respirators, but loading, airing and unloading the chamber approximately doubled the total duration of each run. The largest decontamination run lasted 11 h and contained 20,000 respirators. Airing of the decontaminated respirators continued outside of the chamber for up to 24 h.",
