Despite extensive analyses, there remains an urgent need to delineate immune cell states that contribute to mortality in severe COVID-19. We performed high-dimensional cellular and molecular profiling of blood and respiratory samples from critically ill COVID-19 patients to define immune cell genomic states that are predictive of outcome in severe COVID-19 disease. Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) manifested increased frequencies of inflammatory monocytes and plasmablasts that were also associated with ARDS not due to COVID-19. Single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq)-based deconvolution of genomic states of peripheral immune cells revealed distinct gene modules that were associated with COVID-19 outcome. Notably, monocytes exhibited bifurcated genomic states, with expression of a cytokine gene module exemplified by CCL4 (MIP-1b) associated with survival and an interferon signaling module associated with death. These gene modules were correlated with higher levels of MIP-1b and CXCL10 levels in plasma, respectively.",

In the United States alone, more than 26 million cases and over 450,000 deaths have been reported 4 . Despite the rapid development and deployment of vaccines 5,6 , thousands of patients are currently hospitalized with severe COVID-19. COVID-19 is also projected to be a major cause of critical illness and hospitalizations throughout 2021 and beyond, before world-wide vaccine campaigns can control the pandemic. Furthermore, the recent emergence of more highly transmissible viral variants (i.e. B.1.1.7 in the United Kingdom and N501Y in South Africa) is predicted to increase infections and hospitalizations in the coming months 7 . Among initial clinical trials examining several pharmacologic interventions in severe COVID-19, non-specific immunosuppression with corticosteroids has shown clear efficacy 8-10 , and recent work has shown efficacy of IL-6 blockade in patients treated soon after ICU admission 11 . Therefore, severe COVID-19 continues to carry a high mortality risk. Thus, in depth analyses of cellular and molecular states, particularly of the immune system, that are associated with survival or death in severe COVID-19 disease are urgently needed. Such analyses will accelerate the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics that could save lives.",

Notably, the dysregulated levels of IL-6 in patients are lower compared with those in non-COVID ARDS, cytokine release syndrome or sepsis, suggesting differences in the underlying etiology 17 . Type I interferon (IFN) signaling is essential in moderating COVID-19 disease, as patients with either IFN autoantibodies 18 or inborn errors of type I interferon 19 production have a much higher risk of severe COVID-19. Paradoxically, a delayed and excessive type I IFN response is implicated in severe disease and leads to mortality in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection [20] [21] [22] .

The median ages of non-COVID ARDS and COVID-19 patients were 62 and 65 years, and many patients had pre-existing conditions (Table S1 ) including diabetes (17% non-COVID ARDS, 47% COVID-19) and either current or former smoking (67% non-COVID ARDS, 60% COVID-19). Mortality at 90 days was 33% and 40% in non-COVID ARDS and COVID-19 patients, respectively (Table S1 ). Comparisons of clinical covariates by death or survival (day 90) showed trends towards higher mortality in older patients and patients with lower BMI. We note that patients who received glucocorticoids were more likely to survive (Table S2) . We obtained peripheral blood as well as endotracheal aspirates from COVID-19 patients to perform high-dimensional profiling of cellular genomic states and cytokines. Only blood samples were obtained from non-COVID ARDS and healthy donors ( Fig. 1a , Methods). We leveraged flow cytometry, scRNAseq and cytokine datasets from blood samples to thoroughly interrogate immune system states across these clinical groups (Fig. 1a , Table S3 ).",

The separation between outcome evident in the first two PCs suggested that gene modules could be predictive of mortality. We next performed leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to evaluate the predictive power of this approach with data held out. In a LOOCV framework, using either a random forest or support vector machine classifier with a linear kernel on the down-selected gene modules (with downselection done separately within each fold to avoid signal leakage) yielded accurate stratification of the patients who survived versus those that died (Methods).

Earlier work in non-COVID ARDS has defined monocyte signatures in PBMC that are indicative of progression to ARDS 34 ; our work demonstrates distinctive monocyte gene modules as part of a multivariate peripheral immune system state that is predictive of severe COVID-19 disease mortality.

Dimensionality reduction for visualization was next performed using Uniform Manifold Approximation Embedding (UMAP) 26 implemented in Seurat. Clusters were identified using graph-based clustering in Seurat, and inspection of canonical lineage markers and their association with each cluster was used to identify cell types. One cluster of cells expressed high levels of genes involved in the cell cycle, but included multiple cell types.

When visualized along the PC1 axis, distributions of patient samples demonstrated considerable heterogeneity (Fig. 1c). However, COVID-19 as well as non-COVID ARDS samples were shifted rightwards on PC1, while healthy donors were shifted leftwards. Consistent with analysis in Fig. 1b, higher frequencies of myeloid cells and plasmablasts contributed to the PC1 distribution of samples from critically ill patients, while higher frequencies of T and B cells distinguished the healthy donors (Fig. 1d).

These genes included the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL3, CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2), CXCL2 and CCL3 (MIP-1\u03b1). Conversely, a set of interferon response genes (MX2, MX1, ISG15, IFI44L, OAS3, ISG20, IFIT3, and IFIT1) were associated with death in COVID-19 patients. Although these genes were not part of the Mono_cells_NOC2L module, the latter contained genes that encoded components of viral sensing and the RIG-I pathway (Supp. Data S1). Thus, the analyses of monocytic gene modules and DEGs complemented one another while expanding the gene features that distinguished the divergent monocytic states. To distinguish the activation states of canonical monocyte subsets, we performed gene set enrichment analysis 25 (Fig. 2c, Supp. Data S4). Gene sets for interferon signaling were highly enriched in intermediate monocytes and suggestive of viral entry into such cells. To explore this possibility, we utilized flow cytometry to analyze the expression levels of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and cofactor neuropilin-1 (NRP1). ACE2 expression was significantly higher on both classical and intermediate monocytes in COVID-19 as well as non-COVID-19 ARDS patients compared to healthy donors (Fig. 2d-e). Notably only intermediate monocytes from COVID-19 patients expressed NRP1 at significantly higher levels versus healthy controls(Fig. 2f-g). Expression of these two entry receptors suggests activated monocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 entry.However, we were unable to detect SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in these monocytic cells by scRNAseq (Methods). Consistent with a systemic inflammatory state, both intermediate and classical monocytes expressed higher levels of the chemokine receptor CCR5(Fig. S4a-b).

Importantly, monocytic cells manifesting both of these divergent states were detected in ETA samples of severe COVID-19 patients, highlighting the relevance of analyzing PBMC. We propose that the pathogenic viral sensing and IFN signaling monocytic state may be induced by virus entry. Intriguingly, our flow cytometry analysis identified increased expression of the SARS-Cov-2 entry receptor ACE2 35,36 in classical and intermediate monocytes in PBMC, and increased expression of the entry cofactor NRP1 37,38 in intermediate monocytes, suggesting that these cells may be permissive to viral entry and possibly replication, especially within the lung. We were not able to detect viral transcripts in monocytic cells of COVID-19 patients possibly due to low numbers of such transcripts resulting from non-productive infection. Even if the virus cannot replicate, after entry through ACE2 or through opsonization it could trigger innate viral sensors such as RIG-I in monocytes.

Our analysis revealed that monocyte gene modules on day 1 dictate distinct disease trajectories, with the high levels of the interferon response associated Mono_cells_NOC2L module on day 1 correlating with its levels on day 5 in individual patients. Additionally, the Mono_cells_NOC2L module on day 5 is correlated with numerous cytokines associated with disease severity and death, including CXCL10, IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and IL-8. Conversely, the high levels of the favorable monocyte state on day 1 (Mono_cells_PDE6H) was negatively correlated with Mono_cells_NOC2L on day 5, suggesting that these initially bifurcated states lead to divergent immune system dynamics. Thus, we infer that protracted interferon signaling (as reflected by consistently high Mono_cells_NOC2L module scores, ICU day 1-5) promote an immune state with correlated expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines that contributes to immunopathogenesis, organ damage, and death.Our data regarding the temporal evolution of severe disease and the multi-faceted nature of inflammatory cytokines has important implications for COVID-19 treatment strategies.Our results suggest that the correlated expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines may partially explain conflicting results from trials of IL-6 blockade 11,49,50 , and highlight that IL-6 blockade is likely to be most beneficial early in the course of disease before multipleinflammatory cytokines become elevated. Recently, evidence from a mouse model 51 and observational studies of rheumatic 52,53 and inflammatory bowel disease 54 have COVID-19 patients may benefit from anti-TNF therapy. Our results suggest that selective intervention based on new molecular diagnostics informed by our analysis of divergent inflammatory monocytic states could attenuate the coordinated elevation of multiple inflammatory cytokines and subsequent tissue damage and death. Our study adds important details of immune pathogenesis in severely ill COVID-19 patients to what is known across the spectrum of disease. Limitations of our study include the relatively small sample size of our COVID-19 patient cohort, precluding in depth analysis of relationships between flow cytometry measurements, transcriptional states of immune cells and cytokines with clinical covariates such as diabetes, age and biological sex. These covariates are important contributors to outcome and need to be more fully integrated with the high-dimensional immune system analyses in larger studies.Furthermore, emergent datasets consisting of critically ill patients that have been phenotyped as densely as our patient cohort will facilitate external validation of the findings presented here. Nevertheless, our study of severely ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU has uncovered a striking bifurcation in inflammatory monocyte genomic states that is predictive of mortality outcome. These bifurcated monocytic states manifest differing temporal dynamics and are in turn linked to distinct inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, our findings may facilitate discovery of new diagnostics and therapeutics to improve outcome in severe COVID-19.",

Assays were performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plasma samples were thawed and on average 25 \u00b5L of plasma samples were diluted as recommended in a MSD 96-well assay plate. Calibrators were added to wells on each plate in parallel. Plates were then sealed and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next, the plates were washed 3 times with 150 \u00b5L per well of MSD wash buffer. Following washing, 25 \u00b5L",

Following demultiplexing, gene expression reads were then aligned to the reference genome using CellRanger v3.1.0, and feature barcode matrices were created for each sample. Importantly, we added the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) to the genome and the GTF to facilitate detection of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. Cell hashing libraries were aligned to TotalSeq-C barcodes using CITE-seq-Count v1.4.3 55 , using a sample-specific cell barcode whitelist (i.e., only cell barcodes from cells identified by CellRanger from each sample were included in the whitelist).Identification of individual samples from cell hashingAfter generation of gene expression and feature barcode matrices, downstream analysis was performed using Seurat v3.1.4 56 in R 3.6.0. Gene barcode matrices and associated feature barcode matrices containing cell hash expression values were read into R. To identify individual samples, feature barcode matrices were first log-normalized using a centered log ratio transformation (CLR) implemented in Seurat. Individual samples were identified by unique expression of the anticipated TotalSeq-C antibody and the absence of alternative TotalSeq-C antibodies. To permit automated identification of samples, kmeans clustering was performed on CLR normalized expression values for each sample to identify cut-offs for negative and positive TotalSeq-C counts. Samples were visualized on bi-variate x/y plots to confirm adequate cutoffs. Cells with expression levels above the",
